Do You Remember?
Have you appreciated reading the recent issues of The Watchtower? Well, see if you can answer the following questions:
• What personal program involving the Sermon on the Mount might you employ to alleviate stress?
Each day, you could read one of Jesus’ basic teachings set out in that sermon or elsewhere in the Gospels. By meditating on that teaching and seeking to apply it personally, you will likely find increased happiness and decreased stress.​—12/15, pages 12-14.
• What are three good reasons for congregation elders to train ministerial servants to handle additional responsibilities?
Because of the growth in the number of Jehovah’s Witnesses, additional responsible men are needed to help newly baptized ones to progress. Age or health problems now limit what some longtime elders can do. And some capable elders are carrying responsibilities that extend beyond the local congregation, so they may not be able to do as much in their congregation as formerly.​—1/1, page 29.
• How do people trust in gods that are not real?
Many worship the gods of their religion, but these may simply be lifeless gods that can no more save than could Baal in Elijah’s day. (1 Kings 18:26, 29; Psalm 135:15-17) Others venerate entertainment personalities or sports figures, who cannot provide any real hope for the future. In contrast, Jehovah actually exists and fulfills his purposes.​—1/15, pages 3-5.
• What can we learn from Cain’s reaction to God’s warning?
God has given us free will, and we can choose to do what is right rather than turn away from doing good, which is how Cain reacted. The Bible account also shows that Jehovah does execute his judgments upon the unrepentant.​—1/15, pages 22-3.
• Why is cleanliness especially important now?
With shifting social patterns, many spend less time cleaning their home than used to be common. Ignoring cleanliness as to food and water could present health dangers. In addition to physical cleanliness, the Bible highlights giving attention to spiritual, moral, and mental cleanness.​—2/1, pages 3-6.
• Concerning pre-Christian witnesses, Paul said that they would “not be made perfect apart from us.” How so? (Hebrews 11:40)
During the coming Millennium, Christ and his anointed brothers in heaven, serving as kings and priests, will dispense the benefits of the ransom to resurrected ones. Such faithful ones as those noted in Hebrews chapter 11 will thus “be made perfect.”​—2/1, page 23.
• What was Paul’s point when he told the Hebrews: “You have never yet resisted as far as blood”? (Hebrews 12:4)
He meant resisting to the point of dying. There were historical examples of ones who had been faithful until death. Though the Hebrews to whom Paul wrote had not been tested to that point, they needed to progress to maturity, building up their faith to endure whatever might come.​—2/15, page 29.
• Why is it best to avoid saying that Jehovah tempers his justice with mercy?
In some languages, “temper” can mean to moderate or restrain. Jehovah is a God of both justice and mercy, and in his displaying those qualities, the two work harmoniously. (Exodus 34:6, 7; Deuteronomy 32:4; Psalm 116:5; 145:9) Jehovah’s justice does not need to be softened or tempered by mercy.​—3/1, page 30.
• Is it proper for a Christian to have the body of a dead loved one embalmed?
Embalming is a means of preserving a corpse. Some ancients followed the practice for religious reasons. That would not be so of true worshipers. (Ecclesiastes 9:5; Acts 24:15) Embalming would merely delay the inevitable, a body returning to dust. (Genesis 3:19) But there would be no need for concern if the law required embalming, some family members desired it, or it was needed because some must travel a long distance to a funeral.​—3/15, pages 29-31.
• What Bible examples teach us that God welcomes people of all nations?
Jehovah sent the prophet Jonah to warn the Ninevites, and God urged Jonah to accept their repentance. By word and example, Jesus encouraged showing love toward Samaritans. Both the apostle Peter and the apostle Paul had a role in bringing the good news to non-Jews. From such examples, we can see the need for trying to help people of all backgrounds.​—4/1, pages 21-4.

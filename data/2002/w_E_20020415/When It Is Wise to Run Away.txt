When It Is Wise to Run Away
TODAY’S world is often marked by a spirit of bravado and confrontation or by temptation. A person who flees from a situation is generally regarded as weak or cowardly. He may even become subject to ridicule.
However, the Bible makes it plain that there are times when running away is both wise and courageous. Bearing that out, before sending his disciples out into the ministry, Jesus Christ told them: “When they persecute you in one city, flee to another.” (Matthew 10:23) Yes, Jesus’ disciples were to try to escape from their persecutors. They were not to carry on anything like a crusade, trying to convert others by force. They bore a message of peace. (Matthew 10:11-14; Acts 10:34-37) So rather than allowing tempers to flare, Christians were to flee, to put distance between themselves and the source of provocation. In this way, they maintained a good conscience as well as their precious relationship with Jehovah.​—2 Corinthians 4:1, 2.
A contrasting example is found in the Bible book of Proverbs. It tells of a young man who, instead of fleeing in the face of temptation, went after a prostitute “like a bull that comes even to the slaughter.” The result? Calamity because of succumbing to the temptation that involved his very soul.​—Proverbs 7:5-8, 21-23.
What if you should face a temptation to commit sexual immorality or confront some other potential danger? According to God’s Word, the appropriate action may well be to flee, to distance yourself from the scene immediately.​—Proverbs 4:14, 15; 1 Corinthians 6:18; 2 Timothy 2:22.

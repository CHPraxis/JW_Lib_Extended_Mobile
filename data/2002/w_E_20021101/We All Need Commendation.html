<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">IT WAS a good day for the little girl. Although she had needed correction at other times, on this particular day, she was especially well behaved. That night, however, after the little girl had been put to bed, her mother heard her crying. When asked why she was upset, she tearfully sobbed: “Haven’t I been a good girl today?”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">That question cut through the mother like a knife. She had always been quick to correct her daughter. But now, despite having noticed how hard her little girl had tried to behave, the mother neglected to speak even one word of appreciation.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Little girls are not the only ones who need commendation and reassurance. We all do<wbr />—as much as we need counsel and correction.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">How do we feel when we receive heartfelt commendation? Does it not warm our heart and brighten our day? Likely we feel that someone noticed, someone cares. It reassures us that what we did was worth the effort, and it motivates us to apply ourselves again in the future. It is not surprising that sincere commendation often draws us to the person who takes the time to say something encouraging.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:15:23-20:15:23" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Proverbs 15:23</a>.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Jesus Christ appreciated the need to give commendation. In the parable of the talents, the master (picturing Jesus himself) warmly commends each of the two faithful slaves, saying: “Well done, good and faithful slave!” How heartwarming! Even though they have very different abilities and achievements, they get equal commendation.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:25:19-40:25:23" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matthew 25:19-23</a>.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">So let us remember the mother of that little girl. We need not wait for others to be in tears before we give them commendation. Instead, we can make a point of looking for opportunities to commend. Indeed, we have good reason to give sincere commendation at every opportunity.</p>

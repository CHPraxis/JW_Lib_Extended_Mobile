<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><strong>Web of Life  </strong>I am 11 years old, and I really love animals. When I received the series “Who Will Protect the Web of Life?” (November 22, 2001), I couldn’t wait to read it. I feel so bad for the wandering albatross, pictured on page 7. It is sad that they are drowning because of being accidentally caught on fishing hooks. I also liked the last picture on the page, the freshwater sawfish. Please keep printing articles like these!</p>

<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><strong>Prisons  </strong>Words cannot express how I felt reading the article “Stories of Faith From a Historic Prison.” (November 22, 2001) I have a son who is in prison for bank robbery. This is his second time. I am going to send this article to him. I pray that it will touch his heart and encourage him to accept the love that Jehovah has for all of us. Thank you for the comfort you bring to us.</p>

<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><strong>Suicide  </strong>Thank you so much for the series “Life Is Worth Living.” (October 22, 2001) When I was in middle school, I was under a lot of stress. Jehovah really supported me through the Bible and Christian association. Still, I felt unworthy. When I read the box entitled “‘Will God Forgive Me for Feeling This Way?’” it was as if Jehovah were talking directly to me. It is such a joy to know that Jehovah does not forget people like me!</p>

<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">I want to tell you of my joy after reading this series. How happy I was not to be lectured, as I expected to be after reading the cover title! The box “‘Will God Forgive Me for Feeling This Way?’” made me want to cry. Thanks to this article, I was able to talk with a Christian sister about what I am going through. Thank you for handling this delicate subject.</p>

<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">I have read this series eight times. When I was in middle school, I thought about suicide. Death seemed attractive to me. This series helped me to realize that even though I may have an unhappy daily life, it is good to be alive. I am not one of Jehovah’s Witnesses, but for some time I have been reading the <em>Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>magazines. You people are really wonderful!</p>

<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb"><strong>Battered Women  </strong>Thank you for the series “Help for Battered Women.” (November 8, 2001) The title on page 3<wbr />—“Maybe This Time He’ll Change”—<wbr />expresses the hope I’ve had for years. I can confirm the truthfulness of what you state on page 4, that all too often sympathy is shown to the perpetrator instead of the victim.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sj">S. M., Germany</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">This series was so heartwarming. As no doubt many others did, I cried uncontrollably from the very first page because I remembered the hardship and the pain that I at one time endured. I treasure the thought that Jehovah views each one of us as precious. As a full-time evangelizer, I have found that people who live where I preach are eager to read this article, so much so that I have had to request extra copies. Many thanks for providing such valuable information.</p>

“It Came at the Right Time”
THAT is what a man from the city of Abakaliki said in a letter to the branch office of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Nigeria. He was referring to the brochure When Someone You Love Dies, which had recently been given to him. He explained:
“I lost my beloved wife, Tochi, in death soon after childbirth on June 18, 2000. More than a month later, I had still not recovered from the shock, numbness, emptiness, and disbelief of one of the most terribly traumatic tragedies that has ever befallen me. Then in July one of Jehovah’s Witnesses handed me a copy of your publication When Someone You Love Dies. The brochure was to me like medicine, and gradually I am beginning to pick up whatever pieces remain of my life—thanks to the advice it offers. It really restored hope in me and made me realize that at the end of the dark tunnel, there is light.”

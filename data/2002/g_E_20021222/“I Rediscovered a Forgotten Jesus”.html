<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">After reading the book <em>The Greatest Man Who Ever Lived, </em>a woman from Saint-Jérôme, Quebec, Canada, wrote: “It was with great interest that I rediscovered a forgotten Jesus, who is often drawn in an unrealistic manner by artists.”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The woman noted regarding the book’s artwork: “I was deeply impressed by the drawings in your book. The characters appear to me as real and authentic, like those who lived at the time Jesus was alive and preaching.” She concluded: “Congratulations for preparing this book. It is a compass that guides those who are seeking to grow in Jesus’ truth.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The <em>Greatest Man </em>book endeavors to present every event in Jesus’ earthly life mentioned in the four Gospels, including the speeches he delivered and his illustrations and miracles. To the extent possible, everything is related in the order in which it is believed to have occurred. And, as noted above, the book features beautiful, authentic illustrations that are designed to convey the feelings of Jesus and his contemporaries.</p>

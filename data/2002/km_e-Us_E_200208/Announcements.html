<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn">▪ The presiding overseer or someone designated by him should audit the congregation’s accounts on September 1 or as soon as possible thereafter. When this has been done, make an announcement to the congregation after the next accounts report is read.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn">▪ The annual inventory of all literature and magazines on hand should be taken on or as close as possible to August 31, 2002. This inventory is similar to the actual count taken monthly by the literature coordinator, and the totals should be entered on the Literature Inventory form (S-18). The total number of magazines on hand can be obtained from the magazine servants in each congregation in the literature group. Each coordinating congregation will receive three Literature Inventory forms (S-18). <em>Please mail the original to the branch office no later than September 6. </em>Keep a copy for your files. The third copy may be used as a work sheet. The secretary of the coordinating congregation should supervise the inventory. He and the presiding overseer of the coordinating congregation will sign the form.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn">▪ On August 30 and 31, 2002, an inventory will be taken of all literature on hand at Brooklyn Bethel. Because of this, no congregation literature requests will be processed for pickup during those days.</p>

New Special Assembly Day Program
1 While the media and secular educators glorify material wealth, God’s Word urges us to “Be Rich in Fine Works.” (1 Tim. 6:18) That is the theme of the special assembly day program beginning in September 2002. What encouragement will we receive at this assembly?
2 The circuit overseer will discuss what it means to “Be Rich From God’s Standpoint,” and he will interview some who are exerting themselves to acquire spiritual riches. In his first talk of the day, the visiting speaker will show how God’s people are performing “Fine Works in This Time of Harvest.” Each of us will be encouraged to consider how we might share even more fully in the God-ordained harvest work being accomplished today.
3 How proud we are when we see Christian youths pursuing spiritual riches! This glorifies Jehovah and helps youths to lay a fine foundation for future privileges of service. The part “Commending Youths for Fine Works in Praising Jehovah” will highlight fine works that young Christians locally have been performing.
4 What are the results of pursuing fine works? The visiting speaker will discuss this in his final talk, “Continue in Fine Works and Reap Jehovah’s Blessings.” He will consider four areas in which we reap rich blessings: (1) as individuals, (2) as families, (3) as a congregation, and (4) as a worldwide organization.
5 Those who have made a dedication to Jehovah will have the opportunity to get baptized. If you are ready to take that step, let the presiding overseer know right away.
6 When the assembly date for your area is announced, be quick to make definite plans to be in attendance. Endeavor to arrive early so as to share in the opening song and prayer. Being present and attentive for the entire special assembly day program will strengthen us to continue pursuing a course that makes us truly rich from the standpoint of our God, Jehovah.

<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sn"><strong>15 min: </strong>What Holds Them Back? Audience discussion and demonstration. In our ministry we commonly encounter people who are reluctant to discuss their beliefs. This poses a barrier that can prevent us from sharing the Kingdom message. If we recognize why a person holds back, this may help us to formulate an approach that will draw the individual out. Discuss how we might adapt our presentation when we encounter the following types of people: (1) Those apathetic toward religion, even their own. (2) Those with an emotional attachment to religious customs practiced by their family and ancestors. (3) Those who are uncomfortable talking about their beliefs because they have little Scriptural support for them. (4) Those prejudiced against us because of misleading comments made by opposers. Adjust list as needed to suit the local territory, focusing on attitudes commonly encountered. Include a brief demonstration showing how to draw a person into a Scriptural conversation.</p>

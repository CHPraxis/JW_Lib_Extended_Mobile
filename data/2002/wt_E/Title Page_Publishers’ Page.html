<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Everlasting life on a paradise earth! By means of a study of the Bible, we learn about this wonderful hope. But this, as well as other basic teachings of God’s Word, is just a beginning. The Bible urges all who love God to “grasp mentally . . . [the] height and depth” of his precious truths. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:3:18-49:3:18" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ephesians 3:18</a>) To that end, this book has been prepared. We hope that it will help you to grow spiritually and to be better equipped to walk the narrow road leading to life in God’s righteous new world.</p>

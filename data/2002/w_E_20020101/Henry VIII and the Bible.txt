Henry VIII and the Bible
IN HIS book History of the English-Speaking Peoples (Volume 2), Winston Churchill wrote: “In the field of religious belief the Reformation brought profound change. The Bible now acquired a new and far-reaching authority. The older generation considered that Holy Writ was dangerous in the hands of the unlearned and should only be read by priests.”
The account continues: “Complete printed Bibles, translated into English by Tyndal and Coverdale, had appeared for the first time late in the autumn of 1535, and were now running through several editions. The Government enjoined the clergy to encourage Bible-reading.” After centuries of Bible illiteracy, England was to become literate, but thanks to Henry VIII’s government rather than to the church.a
“As a further blow to the old school the Government commissioned in Paris a great printing of English Bibles, more sumptuous than any previous edition, and in September 1538 directed that every parish in the country should purchase a Bible of the largest volume in English, to be set up in each church, where the parishioners might most commodiously resort to the same and read it. Six copies were set up in St Paul’s, in the City of London, and multitudes thronged the cathedral all day to read them, especially, we are told, when they could get any person that had an audible voice to read aloud.”
Sadly, in a number of nations, many do not take advantage of their privilege to read the Bible regularly. This is great cause for concern, since only the Bible “is inspired of God and beneficial for teaching, for reproving, for setting things straight, for disciplining in righteousness.”—2 Timothy 3:16.

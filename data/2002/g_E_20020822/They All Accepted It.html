<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">At a school in Basel, Switzerland, a teacher announced that students had to prepare a talk of 10 to 15 minutes in length on any subject of their choice. Fifteen-year-old Rosi chose as her subject “Your Youth<wbr />—Getting the Best Out of It.”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“What kind of a subject is this?” classmates asked. “Are you going to talk about drugs?”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“You will see,” she replied.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">At the conclusion of her talk, the students applauded. Then Rosi observed: “Fifteen minutes is really not enough time to tell about how to get the best out of one’s youth.” So she said: “I have a gift for all of you.” She handed each student a copy of the book <em>Questions Young People Ask<wbr />—Answers That Work, </em>20 books in all. They were wrapped neatly and marked with the name of each classmate.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">All gratefully accepted the book and were later observed examining its contents, which include such chapters as: “How Can I Get My Folks to Give Me More Freedom?,” “How Can I Make Real Friends?,” “What Career Should I Choose?,” “What About Sex Before Marriage?,” and “How Do I Know If It’s Real Love?”</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Altogether, there are 39 chapters. To request a copy of this book, you may fill in the accompanying coupon and mail it to the address shown on the coupon or to an appropriate address listed on page 5 of this magazine.</p>

They All Accepted It
At a school in Basel, Switzerland, a teacher announced that students had to prepare a talk of 10 to 15 minutes in length on any subject of their choice. Fifteen-year-old Rosi chose as her subject “Your Youth—Getting the Best Out of It.”
“What kind of a subject is this?” classmates asked. “Are you going to talk about drugs?”
“You will see,” she replied.
At the conclusion of her talk, the students applauded. Then Rosi observed: “Fifteen minutes is really not enough time to tell about how to get the best out of one’s youth.” So she said: “I have a gift for all of you.” She handed each student a copy of the book Questions Young People Ask—Answers That Work, 20 books in all. They were wrapped neatly and marked with the name of each classmate.
All gratefully accepted the book and were later observed examining its contents, which include such chapters as: “How Can I Get My Folks to Give Me More Freedom?,” “How Can I Make Real Friends?,” “What Career Should I Choose?,” “What About Sex Before Marriage?,” and “How Do I Know If It’s Real Love?”
Altogether, there are 39 chapters. To request a copy of this book, you may fill in the accompanying coupon and mail it to the address shown on the coupon or to an appropriate address listed on page 5 of this magazine.

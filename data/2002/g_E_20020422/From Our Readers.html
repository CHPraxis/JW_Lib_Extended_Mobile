<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">I am a pediatric nurse. The scope of depression is underestimated by many but not by you. I have ordered a hundred copies of this magazine. I intend to deliver them to all the pediatricians and mental-health workers in this area.</p>

<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">I have a number of relatives who have been diagnosed with depression or bipolar disorder. Recognizing these as illnesses rather than weaknesses goes a long way in restoring the dignity that many have lost. The suggestions you gave will help us all to be compassionate and supportive.</p>

<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">I am going to keep a supply of this issue on hand at all times. It is exactly what our teenagers need, and I believe it will help many of them and their parents to get through what you accurately described as a disease. It will probably save lives.</p>

<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">I was comforted to know that this emotional pain does not come from some spiritual deficiency. My heart felt lighter, and I cried when I read that “Jehovah is near to those that are broken at heart.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:34:18-19:34:18" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 34:18</a>.</p>

<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">I was a depressed teen, and I never told my parents or anyone that I wanted to kill myself. This was a grave error. It is important to get help when you are depressed. Thank you for showing your care and concern for young people.</p>

He said that even though the article deals with a complex subject, it is clear and accurate, without using too many technical terms. Such articles enable us to help others become acquainted with <em>Awake!</em></p>

<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">Since I have just finished occupational training for metal materials testing, I didn’t much fancy reading an article about steelmaking. But the way you handled such an extensive and extremely complex subject absolutely fascinated me.</p>

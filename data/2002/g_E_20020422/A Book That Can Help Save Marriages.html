<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A WOMAN NAMED LESLIE, in Louisiana, U.S.A., received a telephone call last year from a representative of Tulane University. The caller said that Tulane, as well as another university, was conducting a survey of newlywed couples in Louisiana.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">After agreeing to participate in the survey, the woman received a questionnaire, filled it out, and sent it in along with a copy of the book <em>The Secret of Family Happiness. </em>She explained that she and her husband were Jehovah’s Witnesses and had studied this book together in preparation for marriage.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">A few weeks later, a letter was received from the project director, who wrote: “We are very hopeful that couples like you and your husband can teach us what it takes to make marriages strong and healthy. The fact that you came from such different backgrounds is important because this often puts a strain on a marriage. But your preparation for marriage, especially with materials like the book you sent, will allow you to deal with any differences that arise. And, of course, a religious basis for a marriage is the most important thing. You are both lucky to share a strong faith and reliance on God’s help.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">“I have put the copy of the book you sent me on the top of my desk, and I show it to my students now when they ask me for advice about getting married. I had never seen this particular book, and it is simply wonderful.”</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">We believe that you too will find this book invaluable.

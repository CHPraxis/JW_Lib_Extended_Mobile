Question Box
▪ What are the advantages of attending the congregation that holds the territory where we live?
Through the congregation arrangement, we receive encouragement ‘inciting us to love and fine works.’ (Heb. 10:24, 25) Through the congregation we learn the truth and are equipped to fulfill our assignment to make disciples. (Matt. 28:19, 20) We are also strengthened to endure trials faithfully and are provided with loving overseers to help us cope with mounting pressures and anxieties. Clearly, the congregation is vital to our spiritual survival. However, are there advantages in attending the congregation that holds the territory where we live?
Individual circumstances vary, and such factors as secular employment, an unbelieving mate, and transportation may affect one’s final decision in this regard. Yet, there are definite advantages, both spiritual and otherwise, when a person associates with the congregation holding the territory where he lives. The elders may be able to get in touch with all the publishers more quickly in cases of emergency. Past Question Boxes have highlighted a number of other advantages.​—May 1991, March 1976, and January 1967.
Generally, it is more convenient to attend meetings nearby, allowing us to arrive early enough to speak with others, care for necessary matters, and share in the opening song and prayer. When newly interested ones live in our neighborhood, we are usually in a better position to reach them, conduct Bible studies with them, and direct them to the meetings most convenient for them.
We are confident that family heads will prayerfully consider this matter, weighing all the factors involved in determining what is best for the spiritual and physical welfare of their family.​—1 Tim. 5:8.

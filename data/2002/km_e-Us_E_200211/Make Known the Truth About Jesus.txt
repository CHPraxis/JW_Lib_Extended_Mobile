Make Known the Truth About Jesus
1 Anointed Christians, assisted by their other sheep companions, “have the work of bearing witness to Jesus.” (Rev. 12:17) This is an important assignment, since salvation is possible only through him.​—John 17:3; Acts 4:12.
2 ‘The Way, the Truth, and the Life’: “I am the way and the truth and the life,” Jesus said. “No one comes to the Father except through me.” (John 14:6) Only through Jesus, “the way,” can we approach God in prayer and have an approved relationship with Him. (John 15:16) Jesus is “the truth” in that the prophecies and shadows contained in the Hebrew Scriptures became a reality in him. (John 1:17; Col. 2:16, 17) Indeed, the primary intent of true prophecy is to illuminate his central role in the outworking of God’s purpose. (Rev. 19:10) Further, Jesus is “the life.” To gain the blessing of everlasting life, all must exercise faith in his ransom sacrifice.​—John 3:16, 36; Heb. 2:9.
3 Head and Reigning King: People must also recognize the vast executive authority Jehovah has entrusted to his Son. Jesus has been installed as King of God’s Kingdom​—‘to him the obedience of the peoples belongs.’ (Gen. 49:10) In addition, Jehovah has designated him as the Head of the congregation. (Eph. 1:22, 23) We need to help our Bible students to appreciate how Jesus directs the congregation and uses “the faithful and discreet slave” to supply spiritual “food at the proper time.”​—Matt. 24:45-47.
4 Merciful High Priest: Having experienced trials and suffering as a human, Jesus “is able to come to the aid of those who are being put to the test.” (Heb. 2:17, 18) How heartwarming it is for imperfect humans to learn that Jesus sympathizes with their weaknesses and graciously pleads for them! (Rom. 8:34) On the basis of Jesus’ sacrifice and through his services as High Priest, we can approach Jehovah “with freeness of speech” in order to obtain “help at the right time.”​—Heb. 4:15, 16.
5 May our efforts to acquaint others with the truth about Jesus move them to obey and serve him alongside us.​—John 14:15, 21.

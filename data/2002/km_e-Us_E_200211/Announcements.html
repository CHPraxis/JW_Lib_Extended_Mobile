<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn">▪ The presiding overseer or someone designated by him should audit the congregation’s accounts on December 1 or as soon as possible thereafter. When this has been done, make an announcement to the congregation after the next accounts report is read.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn">▪ Congregations should begin requesting bound volumes of <em>The Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>for 2002 with their next literature request. The bound volumes will be available in Chinese, Croatian, Dutch, English, French, German, Greek, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, and Spanish.

<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn">▪ The secretary of each congregation holding title to property should review paragraphs 42-44 in the form entitled “Information Regarding Ownership of Kingdom Halls” (T-36-E 3/00). Even after real-estate tax exemption has been obtained, an annual filing is required in some states. Check carefully with your local tax assessor’s office to confirm whether any action is required. All taxes and assessments are to be paid within the time provided. If any tax or assessment is questioned, promptly follow through on the matter so that it is either removed or a proper challenge is filed within the applicable time limit.</p>

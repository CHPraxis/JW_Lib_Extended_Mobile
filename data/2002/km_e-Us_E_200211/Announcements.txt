Announcements
▪ Literature offer for November: What Does God Require of Us? or Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life. If the householder already has these, an older publication may be offered. December: The Greatest Man Who Ever Lived. As an alternative offer, you may use My Book of Bible Stories, The Bible​—God’s Word or Man’s?, or You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth. January: Any 192-page book published prior to 1988 that the congregation may have in stock. Congregations that have on hand Mankind’s Search for God may also offer it. February: Draw Close to Jehovah.
▪ The presiding overseer or someone designated by him should audit the congregation’s accounts on December 1 or as soon as possible thereafter. When this has been done, make an announcement to the congregation after the next accounts report is read.
▪ Congregations should begin requesting bound volumes of The Watchtower and Awake! for 2002 with their next literature request. The bound volumes will be available in Chinese, Croatian, Dutch, English, French, German, Greek, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, and Spanish. Until the bound volumes are available and shipments are made, these will appear as “Pending” on congregation packing lists. Bound volumes are special-request items.
▪ The secretary of each congregation holding title to property should review paragraphs 42-44 in the form entitled “Information Regarding Ownership of Kingdom Halls” (T-36-E 3/00). Even after real-estate tax exemption has been obtained, an annual filing is required in some states. Check carefully with your local tax assessor’s office to confirm whether any action is required. All taxes and assessments are to be paid within the time provided. If any tax or assessment is questioned, promptly follow through on the matter so that it is either removed or a proper challenge is filed within the applicable time limit.
▪ The video Faithful Under Trials​—Jehovah’s Witnesses in the Soviet Union will be considered at the Service Meeting during February. Those who wish to obtain a copy of this video should request it through the congregation as soon as possible.
▪ An adjustment is being made in the way the Theocratic Ministry School will be conducted during the visit of the circuit overseer. Starting in January 2003, after the opening song and prayer, the school will be conducted for approximately 25 minutes. There will be a five-minute talk on a speech quality, a ten-minute instruction talk, and a ten-minute Bible highlights. Assignments Nos. 2, 3, and 4 will not be presented. The school will be followed by a half-hour Service Meeting. After a song, there will be a half-hour program by the circuit overseer, followed by the concluding song and prayer.

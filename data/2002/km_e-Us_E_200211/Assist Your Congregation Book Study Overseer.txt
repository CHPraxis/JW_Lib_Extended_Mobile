Assist Your Congregation Book Study Overseer
1 Each of us derives many benefits from the Congregation Book Study. Last month we discussed how the Congregation Book Study overseer fulfills his role. But what can we do to assist him and thus benefit ourselves and others?
2 Attend Every Week: Because book study groups are kept small, your presence makes a difference. Make it your aim to attend every week. You can also help by being punctual, as this allows the overseer to begin the meeting in an orderly manner.​—1 Cor. 14:40.
3 Upbuilding Comments: Another way you can assist is by being well prepared and by making upbuilding comments. Comments that focus on just one point are usually best, and this also encourages others to comment. Avoid trying to cover everything in a paragraph. If a point in the material touches your heart, enrich the discussion by sharing your thought in a comment.​—1 Pet. 4:10.
4 If you have the privilege of reading the paragraphs for the benefit of the group, be diligent in fulfilling that assignment. Good reading contributes to the success of the study.​—1 Tim. 4:13.
5 Group Witnessing: Meetings for field service are held at many book study locations, and your support of these arrangements helps the overseer as he takes the lead in the evangelizing work. View these arrangements as opportunities to draw closer to your brothers and to encourage them.
6 Field Service Reports: Submitting your field service report promptly at the end of each month is another way to assist the overseer. You may hand your report directly to him or place it in the box designated for service reports at the Kingdom Hall. The secretary can use the box to gather the field service reports collected by book study overseers.
7 Your cooperation with your Congregation Book Study overseer will not go unnoticed. Above all, you can be assured that Jehovah will “be with the spirit you show.”​—Phil. 4:23.

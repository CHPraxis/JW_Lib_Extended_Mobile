Very Good Reading!
Would you not agree that the following titles of past Watchtower articles sound like very good reading?
“God Knows and Protects His Own”
“Progress Toward Taming the Tongue”
“When Christianity Went Underground”
“Preaching Effectively at the Doors”
“Answering the Question, Are You Saved?”
These articles and scores of others appeared in The Watchtower during the years 1951 and 1952. Are they too old for us to benefit from them now? Far from it! You can still obtain Watchtower bound volumes in English for the years 1951 and 1952. (Some English bound volumes for the years 1953 through 1959 are also available.) Any publishers who desire these Watchtower bound volumes may now request them through the congregation literature servant.
The Theocratic Ministry School overseer should check to see if any bound volumes are missing from the Kingdom Hall library and order accordingly.

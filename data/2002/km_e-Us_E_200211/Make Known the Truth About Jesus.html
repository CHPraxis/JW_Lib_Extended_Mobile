<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>Anointed Christians, assisted by their other sheep companions, “have the work of bearing witness to Jesus.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:12:17-66:12:17" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Rev. 12:17</a>) This is an important assignment, since salvation is possible only through him.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:3-43:17:3" data-bid="2-1" class="b">John 17:3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:4:12-44:4:12" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Acts 4:12</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup><strong>‘The Way, the Truth, and the Life’: </strong>“I am the way and the truth and the life,” Jesus said. “No one comes to the Father except through me.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:14:6-43:14:6" data-bid="3-1" class="b">John 14:6</a>) Only through Jesus, “the way,” can we approach God in prayer and have an approved relationship with Him. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:15:16-43:15:16" data-bid="4-1" class="b">John 15:16</a>) Jesus is “the truth” in that the prophecies and shadows contained in the Hebrew Scriptures became a reality in him. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:1:17-43:1:17" data-bid="5-1" class="b">John 1:17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:2:16-51:2:17" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Col. 2:16, 17</a>) Indeed, the primary intent of true prophecy is to illuminate his central role in the outworking of God’s purpose. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:19:10-66:19:10" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Rev. 19:10</a>) Further, Jesus is “the life.” To gain the blessing of everlasting life, all must exercise faith in his ransom sacrifice.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:3:16-43:3:16" data-bid="7-1" class="b">John 3:16,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:3:36-43:3:36" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 36;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:2:9-58:2:9" data-bid="7-3" class="b"> Heb. 2:9</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup><strong>Head and Reigning King: </strong>People must also recognize the vast executive authority Jehovah has entrusted to his Son. Jesus has been installed as King of God’s Kingdom​—‘to him the obedience of the peoples belongs.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:49:10-1:49:10" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Gen. 49:10</a>) In addition, Jehovah has designated him as the Head of the congregation. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:1:22-49:1:23" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Eph. 1:22, 23</a>) We need to help our Bible students to appreciate how Jesus directs the congregation and uses “the faithful and discreet slave” to supply spiritual “food at the proper time.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:45-40:24:47" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Matt. 24:45-47</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup><strong>Merciful High Priest: </strong>Having experienced trials and suffering as a human, Jesus “is able to come to the aid of those who are being put to the test.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:2:17-58:2:18" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Heb. 2:17, 18</a>) How heartwarming it is for imperfect humans to learn that Jesus sympathizes with their weaknesses and graciously pleads for them! (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:8:34-45:8:34" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Rom. 8:34</a>) On the basis of Jesus’ sacrifice and through his services as High Priest, we can approach Jehovah “with freeness of speech” in order to obtain “help at the right time.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:4:15-58:4:16" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Heb. 4:15, 16</a>.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>May our efforts to acquaint others with the truth about Jesus move them to obey and serve him alongside us.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:14:15-43:14:15" data-bid="14-1" class="b">John 14:15,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:14:21-43:14:21" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> 21</a>.</p>

“Would you agree that righteous rulership would make this earth a better place to live? [Allow for response.] Please note what the Bible promises. [Read Psalm 37:11.] We can enjoy such peace, which will be a reality under an ideal Leader who is identified in these articles.”
Awake! Mar. 22
“Earthquakes can cause untold death and destruction. Survivors are often left homeless, with no means to recover. This issue of Awake! shows how victims have been able to cope with the aftermath of an earthquake. It also explains how earthquakes figure into a very important Bible prophecy.”
The Watchtower Apr. 1
“Let me share with you a heartwarming thought from the Bible. [Read Matthew 22:37.] What do you think that means?

Awake! Apr. 8

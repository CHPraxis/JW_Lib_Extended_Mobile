<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn"><strong>12 min: </strong>Maintaining Our Christian Neutrality. Talk by a capable elder. Displays of patriotism have become more common at school, in the workplace, and around the neighborhood. Many who promote this do so as their way of coping with anxiety and grief over national tragedies. Even though we too are pained by what we see in the world, we understand the bigger issue of universal sovereignty and are comforted by the Kingdom message. When tactfully explaining to others why we do not join in nationalistic activities, we should also share the comfort and hope we have found in God’s Word. The brochure <a class="xt" data-xtid="3" href="jwpub://p/E:1101995044/3:353-18:247"><em>Jehovah’s Witnesses and Education, </em>pages 20-4</a>, under the subheading “The Flag Salute,” explains the reason why we do not participate in patriotic ceremonies.

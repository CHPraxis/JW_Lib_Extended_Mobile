<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“Would you agree that righteous rulership would make this earth a better place to live? [Allow for response.] Please note what the Bible promises. [Read <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:37:11-19:37:11" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 37:11</a>.] We can enjoy such peace, which will be a reality under an ideal Leader who is identified in these articles.”</p>

<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">“Earthquakes can cause untold death and destruction. Survivors are often left homeless, with no means to recover. This issue of <em>Awake! </em>shows how victims have been able to cope with the aftermath of an earthquake. It also explains how earthquakes figure into a very important Bible prophecy.”</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn"><strong>The Watchtower Apr. 1</strong></p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">“Let me share with you a heartwarming thought from the Bible. [Read <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:22:37-40:22:37" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matthew 22:37</a>.] What do you think that means? [Allow for response.] Notice this article, ‘Search for God With Your Heart and Mind.’ Is true faith simply a matter of the heart, or should it also involve the mind? The answer is enlightening.”</p>

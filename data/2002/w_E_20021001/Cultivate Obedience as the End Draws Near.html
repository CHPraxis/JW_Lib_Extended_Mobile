<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu"> 1. (a) In the past, what has obedience to Jehovah often involved? (b) What prophecy concerning obedience did Jacob make?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb">OBEDIENCE to Jehovah has often involved obedience to his representatives. These have included angels, patriarchs, judges, priests, prophets, and kings. The throne of the kings of Israel was even called Jehovah’s throne. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/13:29:23-13:29:23" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Chronicles 29:23</a>) Sadly, though, many of Israel’s rulers disobeyed God, bringing woe upon themselves and their subjects. But Jehovah did not leave his loyal ones without hope; he comforted them with a promise to install an incorruptible King, whom the righteous would delight in obeying. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:9:6-23:9:7" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Isaiah 9:6, 7</a>) The dying patriarch Jacob prophesied about this future ruler, saying: “The scepter will not turn aside from Judah, neither the commander’s staff from between his feet, until Shiloh comes; and to him the obedience of the peoples will belong.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:49:10-1:49:10" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Genesis 49:10</a>.</p>
<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu"> 2. What is the meaning of “Shiloh,” and what would his royal rule embrace?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>“Shiloh” is a Hebrew term meaning “He Whose It Is,” or “He to Whom It Belongs.” Yes, Shiloh would inherit nothing less than the right to rulership, as symbolized by the scepter, and the power to command, as represented by the commander’s staff. Moreover, <span id="page18" class="pageNum" data-no="18" data-before-text="18"></span>his royal rule would embrace, not just the descendants of Jacob, but all “peoples.” This is in line with Jehovah’s promise to Abraham: “Your seed will take possession of the gate of his enemies. And by means of your seed all nations of the earth will certainly bless themselves.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:22:17-1:22:18" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Genesis 22:17, 18</a>) Jehovah confirmed the identity of this “seed” in 29 C.E. when he anointed Jesus of Nazareth with holy spirit.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:3:21-42:3:23" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Luke 3:21-23,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:3:34-42:3:34" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 34;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/48:3:16-48:3:16" data-bid="6-3" class="b"> Galatians 3:16</a>.</p>

<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>When Jesus ascended to heaven, he did not immediately take up the scepter of rulership over the peoples of the world. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:110:1-19:110:1" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Psalm 110:1</a>) However, he did receive a “kingdom” with subjects that obeyed him. The apostle Paul identified that kingdom when he wrote: “[God] delivered us [spirit-anointed Christians] from the authority of the darkness and transferred us into <em>the kingdom of the Son of his love.” </em>(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/51:1:13-51:1:13" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Colossians 1:13</a>) This deliverance began at Pentecost 33 C.E. when holy spirit was poured out on Jesus’ faithful followers.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:2:1-44:2:4" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Acts 2:1-4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/60:2:9-60:2:9" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 1 Peter 2:9</a>.</p>

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>As “ambassadors substituting for Christ,” the spirit-anointed disciples obediently started to gather others who would become “fellow citizens” in that spiritual kingdom.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:1:10-46:1:10" data-bid="11-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 1:10</a>) As a group, they constituted a “faithful and discreet slave,” or a faithful steward class.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:24:45-40:24:45" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Matthew 24:45;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:12:42-42:12:42" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> Luke 12:42</a>.</p>

<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>Jehovah has always provided teachers for his people. For example, after the Jews returned from Babylon, Ezra and a number of other qualified men did not just read God’s Law to the people, they “expounded” that law, ‘putting meaning into it and giving understanding’ of God’s Word.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/16:8:8-16:8:8" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Nehemiah 8:8</a>.</p>
<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu">6, 7. How has the slave class provided timely spiritual food through its Governing Body, and why is submission to the slave class fitting?</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup>In the first century, when the issue of circumcision arose in <span id="page19" class="pageNum" data-no="19" data-before-text="19"></span>49 C.E., the governing body of that early slave class prayerfully considered the matter and came to a Scriptural conclusion. When they announced their decision by letter, the congregations obeyed the direction given and enjoyed God’s rich blessing. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:15:6-44:15:15" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Acts 15:6-15,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:15:22-44:15:29" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> 22-29;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:16:4-44:16:5" data-bid="14-3" class="b"> 16:4, 5</a>) Likewise in modern times, the faithful slave through its Governing Body has clarified such important issues as Christian neutrality, the sanctity of blood, and the use of drugs and tobacco.

<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><sup>7 </sup>By submitting to the slave class, God’s people also show their subjection to the Master, Jesus Christ.

<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><sup>8 </sup>Jacob’s prophecy foretold that Shiloh would command “the obedience of the peoples.” Clearly, Christ’s rulership would extend beyond spiritual Israel.

<p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu"> 9. What did Jesus do when he received his Kingdom, and what indirect effect did this have on mankind, especially on his disciples?</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><sup>9 </sup>Jesus’ first act after receiving kingly power was to hurl the very personification of disobedience<wbr />—Satan—<wbr />along with his demons “down to the earth.” Since then, these wicked spirits have fomented unprecedented woe for mankind, besides fostering an environment that makes obedience to Jehovah a challenge.

Yes, among them we all at one time conducted ourselves in harmony with the desires of our flesh, doing the things willed by the flesh and the thoughts, and we were naturally children of wrath even as the rest.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/49:2:2-49:2:3" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Ephesians 2:2, 3</a>.</p>

Keep on holding fast what you have, that no one may take your crown.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:3:8-66:3:8" data-bid="47-1" class="b">Revelation 3:8,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:3:11-66:3:11" data-bid="47-2" class="b"> 11</a>.</p>
<p id="p56" data-pid="56" class="qu">20. How have millions today kept Jesus’ word, and despite what circumstances?</p>
<p id="p28" data-pid="28" data-rel-pid="[56]" class="sb"><sup>20 </sup>In “the Lord’s day,” beginning in 1914, a faithful remnant and their other sheep companions, now numbering millions, have also kept Jesus’ word by sharing zealously in the ministry and by holding fast to their integrity. Like their first-century brothers, some have suffered for their obedience to Christ, even being thrown into prisons and concentration camps. Others have kept Jesus’ word by maintaining a ‘simple eye,’ despite being surrounded by affluence and greed. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:6:22-40:6:23" data-bid="48-1" class="b">Matthew 6:22, 23</a>) Yes, in every environment and in every circumstance, true Christians, through their obedience, continue to make Jehovah’s heart rejoice.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:27:11-20:27:11" data-bid="49-1" class="b">Proverbs 27:11</a>.</p>

<p id="p29" data-pid="29" data-rel-pid="[57]" class="sb"><sup>21 </sup>As we approach the great tribulation, “the faithful and discreet slave” remains resolved not to compromise its obedience to the Master, Christ. This includes preparing timely spiritual food for God’s household. So let us continue to appreciate Jehovah’s wonderful theocratic organization and what it provides. In this way, we demonstrate our submission to Shiloh, who will reward all his obedient subjects with everlasting life.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:24:45-40:24:47" data-bid="50-1" class="b">Matthew 24:45-47;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:25:40-40:25:40" data-bid="50-2" class="b"> 25:40;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:5:22-43:5:24" data-bid="50-3" class="b"> John 5:22-24</a>.</p>

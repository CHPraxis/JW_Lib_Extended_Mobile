<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">INVITED TO WHAT? To the most important meeting held each year by Jehovah’s Witnesses<wbr />—the commemoration of the death of Christ, based on the Lord’s Evening Meal that he instituted. Matthew’s account tells us: “Jesus took a loaf and, after saying a blessing, he broke it and, giving it to the disciples, he said: ‘Take, eat. This means my body.’ Also, he took a cup and, having given thanks, he gave it to them, saying: ‘Drink out of it, all of you; for this means my “blood of the covenant,” which is to be poured out in behalf of many for forgiveness of sins.’”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:26:26-40:26:28" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matthew 26:26-28</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The significance of these words will be explained at this year’s celebration of the Lord’s Evening Meal, which falls on Thursday, March 28, after sundown. We hope that you will be there. Please check with Jehovah’s Witnesses for the exact time and place of the meeting in your locality. You will be very welcome.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">When a young man left his job at a bank in Chicago, Illinois, U.S.A., to further his education, a fellow employee gave him a copy of the book <em>Is There a Creator Who Cares About You? </em>Later she received a letter from the man. He wrote:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">‘What a potent little book you gave me! I’ve been reading it these past few weeks, and it has some very profound arguments. I’m especially interested in the astronomical and geological argument of creation as “a deliberate intellectual act.” I also found the strong emphasis on the Sermon on the Mount exciting.’</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">As a result of reading <em>Is There a Creator Who Cares About You? </em>many have been moved to think more deeply about the origin as well as the purpose of life. More important, many have been helped to reach informed conclusions.</p>

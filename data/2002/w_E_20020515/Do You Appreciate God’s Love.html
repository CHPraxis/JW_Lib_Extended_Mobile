<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">THE man Job once described the imperfect human condition in these words: “Man, born of woman, is short-lived and glutted with agitation. Like a blossom he has come forth and is cut off, and he runs away like the shadow and does not keep existing.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:14:1-18:14:2" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Job 14:1, 2</a>) Life, as Job was then experiencing it, was fraught with anguish and sorrow. Have you ever felt that way?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Despite all the difficulties and problems we may face, however, a well-founded hope exists, one that is based on God’s compassion and love. First of all, our merciful heavenly Father has provided the ransom sacrifice to redeem mankind from their fallen, sinful condition. According to <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:3:16-43:3:17" data-bid="2-1" class="b">John 3:16, 17</a>, Jesus Christ stated: “God loved the world [of mankind] so much that he gave his only-begotten Son, in order that everyone exercising faith in him might not be destroyed but have everlasting life. For God sent forth his Son [Jesus] into the world, not for him to judge the world, but for the world to be saved through him.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Also consider God’s kind attitude toward us imperfect humans. The apostle Paul declared: “He made out of one man every nation of men, to dwell upon the entire surface of the earth, and he decreed the appointed times and the set limits of the dwelling of men, for them to seek God, if they might grope for him and really find him, although, in fact, he is not far off from each one of us.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:17:26-44:17:27" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Acts 17:26, 27</a>) Think of it! Although we are imperfect humans, we can still enjoy a personal relationship with our loving Creator, Jehovah God.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Confidently, then, we can face the future, knowing that God cares for us and has lovingly made provision for our lasting benefit. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:5:7-60:5:7" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 Peter 5:7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:3:13-61:3:13" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 2 Peter 3:13</a>) Surely, then, we have every reason to learn more about our loving God through a study of his Word, the Bible.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">In the early Christian congregation, there were material needs that required attention. As each person prospered, he was urged to “set something aside” as a contribution to meet those needs. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:16:1-46:16:3" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Cor. 16:1-3</a>) As a result of their generosity, all rejoiced at giving “many expressions of thanks to God.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:9:11-47:9:12" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Cor. 9:11, 12</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Today the worldwide work of Jehovah’s people keeps expanding, requiring ever-increasing financial support. It is appropriate that we too “set something aside” regularly to help fill the need. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:8:3-47:8:4" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2 Cor. 8:3, 4</a>) Material giving can be done in a variety of ways. (See the <a class="xt" data-xtid="14" href="jwpub://p/E:2001806/7:639-14:263">November 1, 2001, <em>Watchtower, </em>pages 28-9</a>.) We rightly view this as a privilege that brings real happiness.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:20:35-44:20:35" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Acts 20:35</a>.</p>

What to Say About the Magazines
The Watchtower Jan. 15
“Many people use images in their worship. Do you think that such objects have saving powers? [Allow for response.] Please note what the true God will do for us. [Read Revelation 21:3, 4.] Only a God who is real can accomplish that. This magazine shows who he is and how we can benefit from putting our trust in him.”

The Watchtower Feb. 1
“There is much concern about pollution of the environment. But have you ever thought about pollution of the mind? [Allow for response.] The Bible emphasizes the importance of being clean both physically and spiritually. [Read 2 Corinthians 7:1.] I am sure you will find this information helpful and practical.”

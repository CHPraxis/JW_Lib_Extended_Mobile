‘How Will They Hear?’
1 Jesus emphatically stated: “In all the nations the good news has to be preached first.” (Mark 13:10) Despite our diligent efforts, there are yet hundreds of millions of people who have not received a personal witness. Some governments restrict our work. Many lands have vast populations that keep growing at a fast pace. Hence, ‘how will they hear?’​—Rom. 10:14.
2 Have Confidence in Jehovah: We must remember that Jehovah knows the heart condition of all people. No matter what a person’s situation is, if he sincerely searches for the truth about God, he will find it.​—1 Chron. 28:9.
3 Abraham was anxious about the inhabitants of Sodom and Gomorrah. But God assured him that Sodom would not be destroyed even if only ten righteous people were found there. (Gen. 18:20, 23, 25, 32) Jehovah has never destroyed the righteous along with the wicked, as was shown by the deliverance of Lot and his daughters.​—2 Pet. 2:6-9.
4 Elijah once thought that he was totally alone in serving the true God. However, Jehovah assured him that he was far from being alone and that the work he had begun would be completed. (1 Ki. 19:14-18) What about the situation in our day?
5 Stay Busy in God’s Service: On how much greater a scale the witness work is yet to be done, we do not know. Jehovah is responsible for this work and is using his angels to oversee it. (Rev. 14:6, 7) He is the one to determine to what extent the witness is to be given to all the nations. If Jehovah chooses, he can see that the Kingdom message is spread in ways that we cannot yet imagine so that many more people may “hear the word of the good news and believe.” (Acts 15:7) What Jehovah does will be in full harmony with who he is​—a loving, wise, and just God.
6 It is our privilege to work in harmony with Jehovah’s will, doing our best to let everyone hear the good news.​—1 Cor. 9:16.

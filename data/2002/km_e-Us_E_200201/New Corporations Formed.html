<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">The January 15, 2001, issue of <em>The Watchtower </em>reported on the organized way in which Jehovah’s Witnesses are continuing to move forward with the Kingdom work in all the earth. It also explained how various legal entities are used as instruments to facilitate the spreading of the good news. Such entities or corporations are necessary to conform to local and national laws, as required by God’s Word. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:13:1-45:13:1" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Rom. 13:1</a>) Because of the diversity and scope of our work, the Governing Body has approved the formation of additional corporations to care for certain needs of Jehovah’s Witnesses here in the United States. The new corporations are as follows:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="si">Christian Congregation of Jehovah’s Witnesses</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="si">Religious Order of Jehovah’s Witnesses</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="si">Kingdom Support Services, Inc.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">These will operate along with Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania and Watchtower Bible and Tract Society of New York, Inc. Congregations and publishers may receive correspondence from any of these corporations. Your cooperation with these adjustments made by the Governing Body in fulfilling its assignment to care for all the Master’s belongings will be greatly appreciated.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:45-40:24:47" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matt. 24:45-47</a>.</p>

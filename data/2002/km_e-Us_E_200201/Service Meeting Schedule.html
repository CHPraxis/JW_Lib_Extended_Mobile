<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn"><strong>25 min: </strong>Benefiting From Kind Provisions. Talk by a qualified elder, based on the December 1, 2001, outline from the branch office. The congregation should have a sufficient quantity of the following items on hand for distribution: Advance Medical Directive/​Release card, Identity Card, the health-care durable power of attorney (DPA) form, and the Advance Directive Guide. These documents will be made available to baptized publishers after tonight’s meeting, but they should NOT be filled out tonight. Signing, witnessing, and dating of cards will be done at the next Congregation Book Study, with assistance where necessary from the book study conductor. Those signing as witnesses should actually see the individual sign the document. The Advance Directive Guide should be carefully considered before completing the DPA. If you have already executed a DPA, it will not be necessary to complete another one unless your current one is dated prior to 2001 or does not express your present wishes. If a publisher has moved to another state, he should execute a new DPA form for that state. Unbaptized publishers may write out their own directive for themselves and their children by adapting language from these documents to their own circumstances and convictions.</p>

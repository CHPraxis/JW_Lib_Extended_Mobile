“Set Something Aside”
In the early Christian congregation, there were material needs that required attention. As each person prospered, he was urged to “set something aside” as a contribution to meet those needs. (1 Cor. 16:1-3) As a result of their generosity, all rejoiced at giving “many expressions of thanks to God.”​—2 Cor. 9:11, 12.
Today the worldwide work of Jehovah’s people keeps expanding, requiring ever-increasing financial support. It is appropriate that we too “set something aside” regularly to help fill the need. (2 Cor. 8:3, 4) Material giving can be done in a variety of ways. (See the November 1, 2001, Watchtower, pages 28-9.) We rightly view this as a privilege that brings real happiness.​—Acts 20:35.

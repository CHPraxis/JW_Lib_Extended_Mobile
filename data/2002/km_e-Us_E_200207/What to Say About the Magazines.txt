What to Say About the Magazines
The Watchtower July 15
“Do you think that the wicked are punished in hell? [Allow for response.] The Bible clearly shows what the punishment for sin is. [Read Romans 6:23a.] Is hell, then, a fiery place of torment? Is it simply a state of separation from God? This magazine gives Scriptural answers to these questions.”
Awake! July 22
“Many people view gambling as a socially acceptable pastime. Others feel that it harms families and society in general. This issue of Awake! examines gambling in the light of recently published research. You may also be interested in reading how Bible principles relate to this subject.” As an example, read 1 Timothy 6:10.
The Watchtower Aug. 1
“Many people feel that superstitious ideas and customs are just innocent fun. [Show an item or two from the box on page 5.] Have you ever thought about what is behind such ideas? [After a response, read 2 Corinthians 11:14.] This magazine gives the Bible’s view of superstitions.”
Awake! Aug. 8
“Many people are very concerned about the rising tide of violence and terrorism. Perhaps you agree with the words of Ecclesiastes 8:9. [Read and allow for response.] This issue of Awake! discusses lessons from the past and shows how such domination will soon end.”

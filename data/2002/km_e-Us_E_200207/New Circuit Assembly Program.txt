New Circuit Assembly Program
1 To stand firm in the faith in an unstable world, we must trust in Jehovah. What does this mean in practical terms? How does trusting in Jehovah affect our personal and family life? How does it help us resist the influence of Satan’s world? The circuit assembly program for the 2003 service year answers these questions. Its theme is “Trust in Jehovah and Do Good.”​—Ps. 37:3.
2 Our trust in Jehovah is not reserved for special occasions or times of dire need. It permeates our daily lives. This is emphasized in the opening talk, “Trust in Jehovah at All Times.” (Ps. 62:8) The four-part symposium “Manifesting Trust in Jehovah” will show us how to find and apply Bible-based information that can help us to build a successful marriage, to handle problems that arise in the family circle, and to meet our material needs.
3 Satan’s world tries to foist on us a twisted view of what is right and wrong and cause confusion as to what is important and unimportant. (Isa. 5:20) The talks “Guard Against the Vanities of Life” and “Shun the Bad​—Be Doers of Good” will reinforce our resolve to uphold Jehovah’s lofty standards.​—Amos 5:14.
4 When Jehovah brings an end to the present wicked system of things, God’s servants will need to trust in him fully. This is highlighted in the public address, “Deliverance From World Distress Is Near.” After that, we will be invited to examine ourselves in the part “Will You Be Counted Worthy of the Kingdom of God?” The program concludes with an exhortation to “Trust in Jehovah’s Promises.”
5 A highlight of every assembly is the baptism talk. Any who wish to be baptized should tell the presiding overseer as soon as possible so that the necessary arrangements can be made.
6 In these uncertain times, Jehovah is the only real source of confidence and stability. (Ps. 118:8, 9) May all of us strengthen our trust in him by being present for the entire circuit assembly program.

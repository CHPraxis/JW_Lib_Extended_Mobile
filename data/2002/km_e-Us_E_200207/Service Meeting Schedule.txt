20 min: Good Reasons to Use the Bible in Our Ministry. Talk and audience discussion. Jesus knew the Scriptures and referred to them liberally when teaching. (Luke 24:27, 44-47) What he taught was not of his own originality. (John 7:16-18) It is important that we too use God’s Word. It has more power than anything we might personally say. (John 12:49, 50; Heb. 4:12) Sincere ones are drawn by the comfort and hope the Scriptures offer. Make it your goal to read at least one Bible text in your presentations. Point out that scriptures are incorporated in this month’s suggested magazine presentations. Entertain some comments from the audience on how they have been using the Bible in the ministry and the effect this has had on themselves and on those to whom they preached.

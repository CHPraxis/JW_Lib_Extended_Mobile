<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">This scripture, our yeartext for 2002, is one of beauty and meaning. We live in perilous times, and many are burdened with the increasing pressures of this world. How comforting are these words of Jesus! How they reflect Jehovah’s patient, merciful, and loving concern for people everywhere who want to do what is right! May we, as Witnesses of Jehovah, imitate his compassion by helping others to accept the invitation and find refreshment under the kindly yoke of Christian discipleship.</p>

Acts of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Modern Times
Curaçao
On a map of the earth, the islands of Curaçao, Aruba, and Bonaire seem very small when compared with the great continents that lie near them. Yet, on these islands live people from dozens of nations and cultures. Many who live on these three Caribbean isles now rejoice under Jehovah’s righteous rulership. Read about how zealous Witnesses have overcome the challenges of diversity and language to teach the pure language of Bible truth.
Ukraine
It was April 8, 1951. The rumble of military trucks shattered the early morning silence. Throughout western Ukraine, soldiers arrived at the homes of Jehovah’s Witnesses and gave each family two hours to pack their belongings for a journey from which many never returned. On that day, more than 6,100 Witnesses were loaded into boxcars and banished to Siberia. That operation was part of a prolonged campaign by the powerful Soviet Union to silence any voice that dared to proclaim God’s Kingdom. The exciting story of how Ukrainian Witnesses endured ban and persecution for more than 50 years will build your faith in Jehovah’s power to sustain his people.

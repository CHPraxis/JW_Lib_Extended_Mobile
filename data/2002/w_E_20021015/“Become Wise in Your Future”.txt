“Become Wise in Your Future”
“The greatest part of mankind employ their first years to make their last miserable.” So said Jean de La Bruyère, a 17th-century French essayist. Indeed, an indecisive young person may vacillate, experiencing discontent and regrets. On the other hand, a headstrong youth may persist in an unwise course, robbing him of joy later in life. Either way, sins of omission or commission can lead to considerable misery.
How can such an eventuality be avoided? In warning against youthful indecisiveness, God’s Word advises young people: “Remember, now, your Grand Creator in the days of your young manhood, before the calamitous days proceed to come, or the years have arrived when you will say: ‘I have no delight in them.’” (Ecclesiastes 12:1) If you are a youth, take positive steps to learn about “your Grand Creator” while you are young.
How, then, does the Bible help young people to avoid youthful folly? It says: “Listen to counsel and accept discipline, in order that you may become wise in your future.” (Proverbs 19:20) The Bible also clearly shows that rejection of godly wisdom as a result of neglect or rebellion in youth, or at any age, bears bitter fruit. (Proverbs 13:18) Conversely, heeding divine directives results in “length of days and years of life and peace,” a satisfying and fulfilling life.​—Proverbs 3:2.

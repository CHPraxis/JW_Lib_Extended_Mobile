<p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="qu"> 1. In what important respect are Jehovah and Satan complete opposites?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb">JEHOVAH and Satan are complete opposites. Any person who feels drawn to Jehovah can only be repulsed by the Devil. This contrast is pointed up in a standard reference work. With regard to Satan’s activities as outlined in the Bible book of Job, the <em>Encyclopædia Britannica </em>(1970) says: ‘Satan’s task is to roam through the earth seeking out acts or persons to be reported adversely; his function thus is the opposite of that of the “eyes of the Lord,” which roam through the earth strengthening all that is good (II Chron. xvi, 9). Satan is cynical about unselfish human goodness and is permitted to test it under God’s authority and control and within the limits God sets.’ Yes, what a contrast!​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:1:6-18:1:12" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Job 1:6-12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:2:1-18:2:7" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 2:1-7</a>.</p>
<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu">2, 3. (a) How is the meaning of the word “Devil” well illustrated in what happened to Job? (b) How does the Bible show that Satan continues to accuse Jehovah’s servants on earth?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>The word “Devil” comes from a Greek word meaning “false accuser,” “slanderer.” The book of Job reveals that Satan accused Jehovah’s faithful servant Job of serving Him out of self-interest, saying: “Is it for nothing that Job has feared God?” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:1:9-18:1:9" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Job 1:9</a>) The account in the book of Job shows that in spite of his tests and trials, Job drew ever closer to Jehovah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:10:9-18:10:9" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Job <span id="page14" class="pageNum" data-no="14" data-before-text="14"></span>10:9,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:10:12-18:10:12" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:12:9-18:12:10" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> 12:9, 10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:19:25-18:19:25" data-bid="4-4" class="b"> 19:25;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:27:5-18:27:5" data-bid="4-5" class="b"> 27:5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:28:28-18:28:28" data-bid="4-6" class="b"> 28:28</a>) After his ordeal, he said to God: “In hearsay I have heard about you, but now my own eye does see you.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:42:5-18:42:5" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Job 42:5</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>Has Satan ceased accusing God’s faithful servants since the time of Job? No. The book of Revelation shows that in this time of the end, Satan continues to accuse Christ’s anointed brothers and assuredly also their faithful companions. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:12-55:3:12" data-bid="6-1" class="b">2 Timothy 3:12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:12:10-66:12:10" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> Revelation 12:10,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:12:17-66:12:17" data-bid="6-3" class="b"> 17</a>) Hence, the dire need of all of us as true Christians is to subject ourselves to our caring God, Jehovah, serving him out of deep love and thus proving Satan’s accusation to be false. So doing, we will make Jehovah’s heart rejoice.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:27:11-20:27:11" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Proverbs 27:11</a>.</p>

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>The Devil roves about in the earth, seeking to accuse and devour someone. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:1:7-18:1:7" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Job 1:7,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:1:9-18:1:9" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:5:8-60:5:8" data-bid="8-3" class="b"> 1 Peter 5:8</a>) In contrast, Jehovah seeks to help those who need his strength. The prophet Hanani told King Asa: “As regards Jehovah, his eyes are roving about through all the earth to show his strength in behalf of those whose heart is complete toward him.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:16:9-14:16:9" data-bid="9-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 16:9</a>) What a difference between Satan’s hateful scrutiny and Jehovah’s loving care!</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>Jehovah is not spying on us to catch our every fault and failing. The psalmist wrote: “If errors were what you watch, O Jah, O Jehovah, who could stand?” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:130:3-19:130:3" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Psalm 130:3</a>) The implied answer is: no one. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:7:20-21:7:20" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 7:20</a>) If we draw near to Jehovah with complete hearts, his eyes will be upon us, not to condemn us, but to observe our efforts and answer our prayers for help and forgiveness. The apostle Peter wrote: “The eyes of Jehovah are upon the righteous ones, and his ears are toward their supplication; but the face of Jehovah is against those doing bad things.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:3:12-60:3:12" data-bid="12-1" class="b">1 Peter 3:12</a>.</p>
<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu"> 6. How is David’s case both a comfort and a warning for us?</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup>David was imperfect and sinned grievously. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:12:7-10:12:9" data-bid="13-1" class="b">2 Samuel 12:7-9</a>) But he poured out his heart to Jehovah and drew near to him in fervent prayer.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:12:10-10:12:14" data-bid="15-1" class="b">2 Samuel 12:10-14</a>) This should be for us both a comfort and a warning. It is comforting to know that Jehovah is willing to forgive our sins if we are truly repentant, but it is sobering to realize that sins often bring dire consequences. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:6:7-48:6:9" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Galatians 6:7-9</a>) If we want to draw close to Jehovah, we should stay as far away as possible from anything that displeases him.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:97:10-19:97:10" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Psalm 97:10</a>.</p>

<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu"> 7. What kind of people does Jehovah watch for, and how does he draw them to himself?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><sup>7 </sup>David wrote in one of his psalms: “Jehovah is high, and yet the humble one he sees; but the lofty one he knows only from a distance.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:138:6-19:138:6" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Psalm 138:6</a>) In a similar vein, another psalm says: “Who is like Jehovah our God, him who is making his dwelling on high? He is condescending to look on heaven and earth, raising up the lowly one from the very dust.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:113:5-19:113:7" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Psalm 113:5-7</a>) Yes, the almighty Creator of the universe condescends to look down upon the earth, and his eyes see “the humble one,” “the lowly one,” people who are “sighing and groaning over all the detestable things that are being done.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:9:4-26:9:4" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Ezekiel 9:4</a>) He draws such ones to himself by means of his Son. While on earth, Jesus stated: “No man can come to me unless the Father, who sent me, draws him . . . No one can come to me unless it is granted him by the Father.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:6:44-43:6:44" data-bid="21-1" class="b">John 6:44,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:6:65-43:6:65" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> 65</a>.</p>

<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><span id="page15" class="pageNum" data-no="15" data-before-text="15"></span><sup>8 </sup>All humans should come to Jesus and put faith in the ransom sacrifice because they were born sinners, alienated from God. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:3:36-43:3:36" data-bid="22-1" class="b">John 3:36</a>) They need to be reconciled to God. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:5:20-47:5:20" data-bid="23-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 5:20</a>) God did not wait for sinners to plead with him to provide some arrangement whereby they might find peace with him. The apostle Paul wrote: “God recommends his own love to us in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. . . . For if, when we were enemies, we became reconciled to God through the death of his Son, much more, now that we have become reconciled, we shall be saved by his life.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:5:8-45:5:8" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Romans 5:8,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:5:10-45:5:10" data-bid="24-2" class="b"> 10</a>.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><sup>9 </sup>The apostle John confirmed the sublime truth that God is reconciling humans to himself, writing: “By this the love of God was made manifest in our case, because God sent forth his only-begotten Son into the world that we might gain life through him. The love is in this respect, not that we have loved God, but that he loved us and sent forth his Son as a propitiatory sacrifice for our sins.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:4:9-62:4:10" data-bid="25-1" class="b">1 John 4:9, 10</a>) The initiative was God’s, not man’s.

<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu">10, 11. (a) What must we do to seek Jehovah? (b) How should we view Satan’s system of things?</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><sup>10 </sup>Of course, Jehovah does not force us to come to him. We must seek him, “grope for him and really find him, although, in fact, he is not far off from each one of us.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:17:27-44:17:27" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Acts 17:27</a>) We must recognize Jehovah’s right to call for our subjection. The disciple James wrote: “Subject yourselves, therefore, to God; but oppose the Devil, and he will flee from you. Draw close to God, and he will draw close to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners, and purify your hearts, you indecisive ones.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:4:7-59:4:8" data-bid="28-1" class="b">James 4:7, 8</a>) We should not hesitate to take a firm stand against the Devil and for Jehovah.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><sup>11 </sup>This means distancing ourselves from Satan’s wicked system of things. James also wrote: “Do you not know that the friendship with the world is enmity with God?

<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><sup>12 </sup>When Satan’s world opposes us in some particular way, we need especially to approach Jehovah in prayer, asking for his help. David, who felt Jehovah’s saving hand so many times, wrote for our comfort: “Jehovah is near to all those calling upon him, to all those who call upon him in trueness. The desire of those fearing him he will perform, and their cry for help he will hear, and he will save them. Jehovah is guarding all those <span id="page16" class="pageNum" data-no="16" data-before-text="16"></span>loving him, but all the wicked ones he will annihilate.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:145:18-19:145:20" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Psalm 145:18-20</a>) This psalm shows that Jehovah can save us when we are tested individually and that he will save his people collectively at the time of “the great tribulation.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:7:14-66:7:14" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Revelation 7:14</a>) Jehovah will stay close to us if we stay close to him. Guided by “the spirit of God,” the prophet Azariah stated what we can take as an overall truth: “Jehovah is with you as long as you prove to be with him; and if you search for him, he will let himself be found by you, but if you leave him he will leave you.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:15:1-14:15:2" data-bid="33-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 15:1, 2</a>.</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:42:5-18:42:5" data-bid="36-1" class="b">Job 42:5</a>) It was said of Enoch and Noah that they ‘walked with God.’ They did this by seeking to please God and obey him.

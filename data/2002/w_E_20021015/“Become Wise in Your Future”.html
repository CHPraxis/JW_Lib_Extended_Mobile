<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">“The greatest part of mankind employ their first years to make their last miserable.” So said Jean de La Bruyère, a 17th-century French essayist. Indeed, an indecisive young person may vacillate, experiencing discontent and regrets. On the other hand, a headstrong youth may persist in an unwise course, robbing him of joy later in life. Either way, sins of omission or commission can lead to considerable misery.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">How can such an eventuality be avoided? In warning against youthful indecisiveness, God’s Word advises young people: “Remember, now, your Grand Creator in the days of your young manhood, before the calamitous days proceed to come, or the years have arrived when you will say: ‘I have no delight in them.’” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:12:1-21:12:1" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 12:1</a>) If you are a youth, take positive steps to learn about “your Grand Creator” while you are young.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">How, then, does the Bible help young people to avoid youthful folly? It says: “Listen to counsel and accept discipline, in order that you may become wise in your future.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:19:20-20:19:20" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Proverbs 19:20</a>) The Bible also clearly shows that rejection of godly wisdom as a result of neglect or rebellion in youth, or at any age, bears bitter fruit. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:13:18-20:13:18" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Proverbs 13:18</a>) Conversely, heeding divine directives results in “length of days and years of life and peace,” a satisfying and fulfilling life.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:3:2-20:3:2" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Proverbs 3:2</a>.</p>

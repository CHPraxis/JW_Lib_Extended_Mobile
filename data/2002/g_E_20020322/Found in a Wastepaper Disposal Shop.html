<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">THAT is where a Tamil-speaking youth in Chennai, India, saw a copy of the August 8, 1999, <em>Awake! </em>After examining the magazine, as well as other copies he was able to obtain, he expressed his opinion of them in a letter to the India branch office of Jehovah’s Witnesses.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><em>“Awake!,” </em>he wrote, “is a beautiful magazine, informative and very useful. The matters presented are of great help. Congratulations!”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Then the youth made a request: “I wish that this intellectual magazine, which travels to all corners of the world, could be part of my personal library too. After reading the magazines published so far, I would like to receive forthcoming issues.”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">As is explained on page 4 of each magazine, <em>Awake! </em>provides enlightenment on many subjects. Yet, its stated purpose says: “Most important, this magazine builds confidence in the Creator’s promise of a peaceful and secure new world that is about to replace the present wicked, lawless system of things.”</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">The 32-page brochure <em>What Does God Require of Us? </em>highlights that purpose of God, providing information from the Bible, showing what we need to do to receive his approval. You may request a copy of this brochure by filling in the accompanying coupon and mailing it to the address provided with the coupon or to an appropriate address listed on page 5 of this magazine.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="su">□ Send me a copy of the brochure <em>What Does God Require of Us?</em></p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="su">□ Please contact me concerning a free home Bible study.</p>

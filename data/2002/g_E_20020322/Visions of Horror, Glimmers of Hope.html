<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sa">“ALL AROUND ME BUILDINGS WERE ROCKING AND FLAMES SHOOTING. AS I RAN PEOPLE ON ALL SIDES WERE CRYING, PRAYING AND CALLING FOR HELP. I THOUGHT THE END OF THE WORLD HAD COME.”<wbr />—G. R., EARTHQUAKE SURVIVOR.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">EACH year millions of earthquakes rumble through the crust of our restless planet. Of course, most of these cannot be felt.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> Still, on average, nearly 140 earthquakes a year are serious enough to be labeled “strong,” “major,” or “great.” Throughout history, these have caused millions of deaths and an incalculable amount of property damage.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Earthquakes also exact a profound emotional toll on survivors. For example, after two earthquakes rocked El Salvador early in 2001, the coordinator of the mental-health advisory committee of that country’s health ministry stated: “People are entering a phase of psychological problems characterized by sadness, despair and anger.” Not surprisingly, health workers in El Salvador reported a 73-percent increase in the number of patients suffering from depression and anxiety. In fact, surveys indicated that among the needs of those in relief camps, mental-health attention ran second only to the need for water.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">But the story of earthquakes involves more than death, destruction, and despondency. In many cases, these disasters have moved people to demonstrate extraordinary goodwill and self-sacrifice. Indeed, some have worked tirelessly to repair damaged structures and rebuild shattered lives. Such glimmers of hope have shone through even the grimmest visions of horror, as we will see.</p>

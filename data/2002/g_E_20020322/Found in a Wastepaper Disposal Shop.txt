Found in a Wastepaper Disposal Shop
THAT is where a Tamil-speaking youth in Chennai, India, saw a copy of the August 8, 1999, Awake! After examining the magazine, as well as other copies he was able to obtain, he expressed his opinion of them in a letter to the India branch office of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
“Awake!,” he wrote, “is a beautiful magazine, informative and very useful. The matters presented are of great help. Congratulations!”
Then the youth made a request: “I wish that this intellectual magazine, which travels to all corners of the world, could be part of my personal library too. After reading the magazines published so far, I would like to receive forthcoming issues.”
As is explained on page 4 of each magazine, Awake! provides enlightenment on many subjects. Yet, its stated purpose says: “Most important, this magazine builds confidence in the Creator’s promise of a peaceful and secure new world that is about to replace the present wicked, lawless system of things.”
The 32-page brochure What Does God Require of Us? highlights that purpose of God, providing information from the Bible, showing what we need to do to receive his approval. You may request a copy of this brochure by filling in the accompanying coupon and mailing it to the address provided with the coupon or to an appropriate address listed on page 5 of this magazine.

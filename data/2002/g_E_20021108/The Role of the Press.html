<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">“Edward Willis Scripps, founder of the Scripps newspaper chain, once said that the role of the press in America is to comfort the afflicted and afflict the comfortable,” stated former White House press secretary Mike McCurry. He added: “You can’t comfort or afflict people whom you leave ignorant.”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“[McCurry] noted that our process for understanding what is happening around the world is lacking because our [U.S.] news media don’t report on the world around us.” The sad part is that the U.S. media believe that “American citizens don’t want to have news about the world.”<wbr />—<em>Graphic Arts Monthly.</em></p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">IT WAS the death of Jesus Christ. Why was it so important? For a number of reasons.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Jesus’ faithfulness unto death proved that a human could maintain integrity to God.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Christ’s death provided an opportunity for some to become corulers with him in heaven. It also opened the way for many more to enjoy everlasting life in an earthly paradise.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">On the evening before he died, Jesus used unleavened bread and red wine as symbols of his loving human sacrifice. And he told his disciples: “Keep doing this in remembrance of me.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:22:19-42:22:19" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Luke 22:19</a>) Will you remember this important event?</p>

<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn">▪ The Memorial invitations for <strong>2003 </strong>in the primary language of each congregation will soon be sent to your congregation. If other languages are spoken in your territory and you would like a supply of invitations in those languages, these should be requested immediately on a Literature Request Form (S-14). Memorial invitations are available in Albanian, Arabic, Armenian, Cambodian, Chinese, Chinese (Simplified), Croatian, Dutch, East Armenian, English, French, Greek, Gujarati, Hmong, Iloko, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Laotian, Macedonian, Marshallese, Papiamento (Curaçao), Persian, Polish, Portuguese, Punjabi (Gurmukhi), Romanian, Russian, Samoan, Spanish, Tagalog, and Vietnamese. Please request only those languages needed for your territory.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn">▪ Please note that the Memorial for the year <strong>2004 </strong>will be on Sunday, April 4, after sundown. This advance notice is given so that brothers may make necessary reservations or contracts for available halls when there are several congregations using the Kingdom Hall and other facilities must be found. The elders should have an agreement with the management ensuring that there will be no disturbances from other activities in the building so that the Memorial observance can proceed in a peaceful and orderly manner. Because of the importance of the occasion, in assigning a Memorial speaker, the body of elders should select one of the more qualified elders instead of simply taking turns or using the same brother every year. If there is a capable elder of the anointed who can give the talk, he should be selected.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn">▪ All baptized publishers present at the Service Meeting the week of January 6 may obtain the Advance Medical Directive/​Release card and the Identity Card for their children.</p>

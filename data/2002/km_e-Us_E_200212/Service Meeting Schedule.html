These documents will be made available to baptized publishers after tonight’s meeting, but they should NOT be filled out tonight. Signing, witnessing, and dating of cards may be done at the next Congregation Book Study, with assistance where necessary from the book study overseer.

If you have moved to another state, you should execute a new DPA form for that state.

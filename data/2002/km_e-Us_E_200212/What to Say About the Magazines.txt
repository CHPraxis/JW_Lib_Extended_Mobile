The Watchtower Dec. 15
“At this time of the year, many think about Jesus’ birth. Did you know that there are valuable lessons we can learn from the Bible’s account of his birth? [Allow for response. Then point to page 5, and read 2 Timothy 3:16.] This issue of The Watchtower considers some of these lessons.”
Awake! Dec. 22
“Do you feel that parents have reason to be concerned about how today’s violent entertainment is affecting their children? [Allow for response.] Many parents use this Bible verse as a guideline. [Read Psalm 11:5.] This issue of Awake! helps families to examine the risks associated with electronic games.”
The Watchtower Jan. 1
“When people lose a loved one in death or suffer from an illness, they often wonder, ‘Why does God allow this?’ Perhaps you have asked the same question. The Bible shows that God feels for those who suffer. [Read Isaiah 63:9a.] This magazine explains why we can be sure that God will end suffering.”
Awake! Jan. 8
“Do you think that government should interfere with freedom of speech? [Allow for response.] What if the speech involves talking to others about religion, as we read here? [Read Acts 28:30, 31.] Recently, this question was brought before the U.S. Supreme Court. You are invited to read about it in this issue of Awake!”

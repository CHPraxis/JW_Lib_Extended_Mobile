<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">TWO teenagers stopped at a restaurant for breakfast in a small town in Ohio, U.S.A. As is their custom, before they ate they bowed their heads and said a silent prayer.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Afterward, a woman who had been watching them came over to their table and picked up their check. She told them: “In a world where we hear so much bad about our youth, it is so refreshing to see two young men who take the time to thank God for their food. I would like to pay for your breakfast.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The boys were stunned but managed to utter a thank-you. Afterward they reasoned that they could not let the woman think that they were praying to just any God. So one of them went over to the lady and, after thanking her again, explained that they were Jehovah’s Witnesses.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">It is the custom of Jehovah’s Witnesses to study the Bible with their families. The parents of these boys had done so. One of the publications the families studied is <em>Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life. </em>Among its 19 chapters, this book includes one on prayer entitled “How You Can Draw Close to God.”</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sa"><strong>NOTE: </strong><em>Our Kingdom Ministry </em>will schedule a Service Meeting for each week during the summer months. Congregations may make adjustments as needed to allow for attending the “Zealous Kingdom Proclaimers” District Convention. Where appropriate, use 15 minutes on the last Service Meeting before attending the convention to repeat pointed counsel from this month’s insert that applies locally. During the month of October, an entire Service Meeting will be arranged to review highlights of the convention program. In preparation for that discussion, all of us can take meaningful notes at the convention, including a list of specific points that we wish to apply personally in our own life and in the field ministry. Then we can explain how we have applied those suggestions since attending the convention. It will be mutually upbuilding to hear one another tell how they benefited from the good instruction that was received.</p>

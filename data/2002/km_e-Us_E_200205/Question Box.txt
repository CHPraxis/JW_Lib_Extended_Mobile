Question Box
▪ Why is there a need to exercise caution when witnessing by mail?
Giving a witness through the mail is a time-tested method of sharing the good news. Recent developments on the world scene, however, have made people cautious about opening unfamiliar mail. Envelopes from unknown sources or with no return address are often viewed with suspicion, especially if they are handwritten and bulky. Householders may discard such mail without opening it. How can we prevent this from happening?
If possible, both the letter and the envelope should be typewritten. The envelope should be addressed to the householder by name. Do not address it to “Occupant.” In addition, always provide a return address. If it is not advisable to show your personal address, give your name and the Kingdom Hall address. Do not send letters anonymously. Never use the address of the branch office.​—See the November 1996 Our Kingdom Ministry Question Box.

A Time to Reveal a Confidential Matter
Keeping certain matters confidential can mean the difference between peace and contention. But is there a time to reveal a confidential matter? Note what the prophet Amos says about his God: “Jehovah will not do a thing unless he has revealed his confidential matter to his servants the prophets.” (Amos 3:7) From these words, we can glean something concerning confidentiality. Jehovah may keep certain matters confidential for a period of time and eventually reveal them to some individuals. How can we imitate Jehovah in this regard?
At times, the appointed shepherds in the Christian congregation find it beneficial to keep a certain matter undisclosed. (Acts 20:28) For instance, with the benefit of the congregation in mind, they may decide to keep the details of some arrangements or changes in congregation responsibilities confidential until a specific time.
In such a case, however, it is important to make clear to those who are involved if, when, and in what manner the matter is to be revealed. Knowing when a matter will be publicly disclosed may help them to maintain confidentiality.​—Proverbs 25:9.

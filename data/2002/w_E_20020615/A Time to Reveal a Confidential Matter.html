<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Keeping certain matters confidential can mean the difference between peace and contention. But is there a time to reveal a confidential matter? Note what the prophet Amos says about his God: “Jehovah will not do a thing unless he has revealed his confidential matter to his servants the prophets.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/30:3:7-30:3:7" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Amos 3:7</a>) From these words, we can glean something concerning confidentiality. Jehovah may keep certain matters confidential for a period of time and eventually reveal them to some individuals. How can we imitate Jehovah in this regard?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">At times, the appointed shepherds in the Christian congregation find it beneficial to keep a certain matter undisclosed. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:20:28-44:20:28" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Acts 20:28</a>) For instance, with the benefit of the congregation in mind, they may decide to keep the details of some arrangements or changes in congregation responsibilities confidential until a specific time.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">In such a case, however, it is important to make clear to those who are involved if, when, and in what manner the matter is to be revealed. Knowing when a matter will be publicly disclosed may help them to maintain confidentiality.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:25:9-20:25:9" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Proverbs 25:9</a>.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>It is the most important work going on in the world at this time. Jehovah God, Jesus Christ, and myriads of angels have fixed their attention on it. What is it, and why is it essential? It is Kingdom preaching, and it helps save lives!​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:1:16-45:1:16" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Rom. 1:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:10:13-45:10:14" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 10:13, 14</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>Some people may feel that we could better serve others if we got involved in trying to improve the world around us. Many are consumed with efforts to attain peace, cure diseases, or improve the economy. But what will help people the most?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup><strong>An Excelling Work: </strong>The Kingdom message alone explains the purpose of life, the cause of human suffering, and the only reliable hope for the future. The good news enables people to become friends of Jehovah and thus receive “the peace of God that excels all thought.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:4:7-50:4:7" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Phil. 4:7</a>) Only the Kingdom message provides practical guidance to help people to cope with life’s problems now and explains how to be preserved alive when the wicked world is destroyed in the future. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:2:17-62:2:17" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 John 2:17</a>) Is that not worth all the effort we can put into Kingdom preaching?</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>To illustrate: What would be the best way to help a sleeping village that is imperiled by a dam that will soon burst? Bailing water from behind the weakening dam? Beautifying the doomed village? No! The villagers must be awakened, warned of the impending disaster, and helped to escape! Those who are spiritually asleep today are in grave danger. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:21:34-42:21:36" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Luke 21:34-36</a>) Since this system of things will be passing away soon, let us endeavor to preach with utmost urgency to all we can!​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:4:2-55:4:2" data-bid="5-1" class="b">2 Tim. 4:2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:3:11-61:3:12" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 2 Pet. 3:11, 12</a>.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup><strong>Stick With It: </strong>Let us look for ways to reach even more people who are sincere with the good news​—at their homes, on the street, over the telephone, and informally. The work Jehovah has given us to do is the most important work we could possibly do. If we carry it out zealously, we ‘will save both ourselves and those who listen to us.’​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:4:16-54:4:16" data-bid="6-1" class="b">1 Tim. 4:16</a>.</p>

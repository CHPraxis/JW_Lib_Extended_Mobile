<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Now that mail subscriptions to the <em>Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>magazines are being discontinued, effort will be required to ensure that we, and those to whom we preach, do not miss even one issue.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><strong>Personal Copies: </strong>When your personal subscription expires, increase your present order at the magazine counter. Parents should order enough magazines so that each family member has his own copy. Putting your name on your personal copy will ensure that it is not inadvertently placed in the field. When shipments of magazines arrive, the brothers handling them will make each issue available <em>immediately </em>at the Kingdom Hall.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><strong>Magazine Routes: </strong>Publishers should endeavor to establish a magazine route with all interested ones who desire to receive each issue. Delivering the magazines personally to such ones will provide opportunities to cultivate the interest shown and to start Bible studies.​—See <a class="xt" data-xtid="50" href="jwpub://p/E:201998363/1-12"><em>Our Kingdom Ministry, </em>October 1998, page 8</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><strong>Those With Special Needs: </strong>If an individual displays genuine interest but lives in unassigned territory, an exception can be made to allow him to receive the magazines by mail subscription. If a person living in the congregation’s territory cannot be served by a magazine route but is sincerely interested in receiving the magazines, discuss the case with the Congregation Service Committee. If they approve, a subscription can be turned in for the interested person. The standard subscription forms (M-1 and M-101) may be used for this purpose.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">We can be confident that Jehovah will continue to bless all our efforts to advertise the Kingdom by means of <em>The Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake!</em></p>

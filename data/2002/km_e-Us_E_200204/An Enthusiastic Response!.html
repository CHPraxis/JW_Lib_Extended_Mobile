<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>Christian families everywhere have expressed their enthusiastic appreciation for the video <em>Young People Ask​—How Can I Make Real Friends? </em>A father in the United States said that after viewing it his sons sat silently​—they could relate to everything in the video! A report from Malawi says that young brothers and sisters there could also relate to it because they experience the same pressures from their peers at school. A father in Germany said of the video: “I consider it an answer to my prayers.” A youth said: “Thank you for reminding me that Jehovah does care about me.” An elder in New Zealand reported: “It helped one of our teenagers get back on the road to life.” A married adult watched it and said: “How I wish every young person in the truth would see this video and be moved to make the truth his own!” Families, why not watch it again? Afterward, discuss together the following questions.</p>

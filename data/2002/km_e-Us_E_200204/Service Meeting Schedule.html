<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sn"><strong>15 min: </strong>Pioneers Keep Assisting Others. Service overseer holds a panel discussion with a Congregation Book Study overseer, a pioneer, and a publisher. The service overseer reviews the Pioneers Assist Others program as outlined in the <a class="xt" data-xtid="5" href="jwpub://p/E:201998322/1-12">September 1998 <em>Our Kingdom Ministry, </em>page 4</a>. Then he discusses with each one on the panel his or her role in the program and how it is serving its purpose. What has been done to make it a success? The service overseer invites all publishers to let him know if they want to receive assistance in the ministry. Those who were assisted in the past may be included again to receive further help in another feature of the ministry.</p>

<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sn"><strong>10 min: </strong>Local announcements. Using the suggestions on page 8, have a ministerial servant demonstrate how to present the May 1 <em>Watchtower </em>and have a sister show how to present the May 8 <em>Awake! </em>After each demonstration, restate the opening sentence or two that was used to arouse the householder’s interest.</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sn"><strong>10 min: </strong>Be on Time! A talk. Activities associated with our worship and service are important affairs, calling for “an appointed time.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:3:1-21:3:1" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Eccl. 3:1</a>) We want to derive the fullest benefit from theocratic provisions. Congregation meetings and meetings for service should begin promptly at the designated times. Jehovah is never late in carrying out his activities. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/35:2:3-35:2:3" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Hab. 2:3</a>) Do we need to improve in this regard? Occasionally, individuals may be unavoidably delayed. But with good organization, we need not be habitually late, arriving after the opening song and prayer of a meeting or after field service arrangements have already been made. Discuss practical ways to cultivate better habits that will ensure our being prompt for all spiritual activities.​—See <a class="xt" data-xtid="8" href="jwpub://p/E:1990447/22:315-32">June 15, 1990, <em>Watchtower, </em>page 29</a>.</p>

<p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sn"><strong>20 min: </strong>Research Using the <em>Reasoning </em>Book. Audience discussion. Questions often arise in the ministry about topics that are not listed under “Principal Subjects” (pages 5-6) in the <em>Reasoning </em>book. The “Index” (pages 439-45) is very useful in locating Scriptural support for our beliefs. Invite audience to participate in finding answers to the following questions by looking in the index under each italicized word: What is a Christian’s view of national <em>anthems </em>and <em>flags? </em>Why does God permit <em>disasters? </em>How can you explain the Bible’s view of <em>divorce? </em>Why and when do sisters sometimes need to wear a <em>head covering? </em>What is the origin of <em>Mother’s Day? </em>How do we know that <em>144,000 </em>is a literal number in the Bible? What does the parable of the <em>rich man and Lazarus </em>mean? Encourage everyone to use the <em>Reasoning </em>book in the ministry.</p>

Outline activities usually planned for summer: attending the entire district convention, auxiliary pioneering one or more months, making improvements around the house, and perhaps enjoying a vacation or some recreation. Invite a few to relate their summer plans and how they will make sure that they do not neglect their family study, congregation meetings, and field service, even if traveling elsewhere. If the congregation has seldom-worked territory, announce what arrangements are being made for thorough coverage. Remind all to make sure that the Congregation Book Study overseer receives their field service reports, regardless of whether they are at home or away.</p>

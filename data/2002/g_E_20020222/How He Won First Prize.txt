How He Won First Prize
A youth wrote the branch office of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Lusaka, Zambia, to express appreciation for Awake! Because of this magazine, he explained, he had been awarded first prize in a writing competition for secondary school students. The students were given the title “The Space Race—The World’s Biggest Money Waster” and were told to do research on the subject. The youth explained:
“Before long I found the September 8, 1992, issue of Awake! The magazine contained what I was looking for. I also used extracts from other issues of Awake!” The first-place prize that the youth received included a check for $75. He observed appreciatively: “For many people, Awake! has proved itself to be an award-winning journal.”
When people earth wide consider the space program—including plans of governments to defend their territories against attack—many wonder whether there will ever be a world without war. This very question is the title of a 32-page brochure that provides powerful evidence that such a world will be realized. But how? and when?

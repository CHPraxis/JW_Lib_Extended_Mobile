<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">“I DID not take the symptoms seriously,” explained Claus, who had been experiencing shortness of breath for some weeks. But something happened that made him think differently.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“I keep back issues of <em>The Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>on my bedside table,” Claus related. “One evening I happened to pick up the <em>Awake! </em>of March 22, 2001, and turned at random to the article ‘The Marvels of the Circulatory System.’ Reading the article, I immediately realized that my symptoms matched the description of angina.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">As soon as possible, Claus had an examination at the local clinic, where tests revealed diseased coronary arteries. Treatment started without delay. The physician told Claus that he was very fortunate, since his condition if left untreated would probably have led to a heart attack that may well have been fatal. Claus wrote to the publishers of this magazine: <em>“Awake! </em>probably saved my life!”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><em>Awake! </em>does more than feature such marvels of creation as the workings of the human body. On page 4 of this magazine, the purpose of <em>Awake! </em>is presented: “More important, this magazine builds confidence in the Creator’s promise of a peaceful and secure new world.”</p>

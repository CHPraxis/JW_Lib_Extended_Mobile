Happy Family Life Is Possible!
A WOMAN from the city of Maladzyechna, in Belarus, wrote to the branch office of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Russia. She explained that she had a husband and two children. She wrote: “My husband and I love each other. However, I noticed that the longer we lived together, the more we got aggravated and argued, seemingly without any reason at all. A few months ago, a stranger stopped me on the street and gave me a tract entitled Enjoy Family Life. At first, my attention was drawn to the beautiful illustration of a happy family. Later I read the text and gave it to my husband to read.
“Like a miracle, our family life has not only improved but, I would say, changed to the very core. We now understand that being happy is not so difficult. All that is needed is a little earnest, heartfelt warmth and giving. What is necessary is to live according to God’s commandments, to love God and love people, including family and strangers.”
She concluded: “Life has become easier and happier. We want to continue to study the Bible and to teach our children.”

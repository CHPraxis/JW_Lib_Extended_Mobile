<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">In today’s loveless world, how can we keep our love for our spiritual brothers burning brightly? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:2:17-60:2:17" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Pet. 2:17</a>) How can we show others that our genuine, global brotherhood really exists? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:23:8-40:23:8" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matt. 23:8</a>) By means of the video <em>Our Whole Association of Brothers. </em>It shows the reasons why we love one another. See if you can answer these questions:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><strong>(1) </strong>What three activities do we share in common with our worldwide brotherhood? <strong>(2) </strong>How are our brothers showing their determination to preach (a) in the Alaskan wilderness, (b) in the vast harbors of Europe, and (c) in the dense forests of Peru? <strong>(3) </strong>What is an especially effective witnessing tool? <strong>(4) </strong>Why should we never feel that preaching is just an ordinary work? <strong>(5) </strong>Give examples of how Jehovah’s Witnesses have comforted and supported one another in times of distress​—earthquakes, hurricanes, and civil wars. (See the comments of Takao on <a class="xt" data-xtid="11" href="jwpub://p/E:101995607/13-20:158">page 23 in the August 22, 1995, <em>Awake!</em></a> and of Kotoyo on <a class="xt" data-xtid="12" href="jwpub://p/E:101996766/17:83-25">page 20 in the October 22, 1996, <em>Awake!</em></a>) <strong>(6) </strong>In what practical ways can all of us demonstrate the great identifying mark of our Christian brotherhood? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:13:35-43:13:35" data-bid="3-1" class="b">John 13:35</a>) <strong>(7) </strong>How highly should we value our congregation meetings? <strong>(8) </strong>How does having a Kingdom Hall in which to meet affect those who have not previously had one? <strong>(9) </strong>How did our brothers in Eastern Europe and Russia survive spiritually when under ban? <strong>(10) </strong>Even now, what extraordinary effort do many Witnesses put forth to attend conventions, and why? How has this touched your heart? <strong>(11) </strong>Why are you determined to worship together in unity, to help others in times of need, and to preach faithfully whenever and however you can? <strong>(12) </strong>Why would it be good to have a personal copy of this video and show it to as many interested people as possible?</p>

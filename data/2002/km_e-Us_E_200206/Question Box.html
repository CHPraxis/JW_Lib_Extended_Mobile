<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">▪ <strong>What standard of dress and grooming should we observe when visiting Bethel homes and branch facilities?</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">When we visit Bethel, whether to tour the facility or to visit with members of the Bethel family, “our dress, grooming and conduct should be similar to what is expected of us when attending meetings for worship at the Kingdom Hall.” (<em>om </em>131) However, it has been noted that when visiting the branch offices, some brothers and sisters tend to be extremely casual in their dress. That is not appropriate when visiting these facilities. Our appearance should be exemplary, well-arranged, and modest, reflecting the decency and dignity that befit servants of Jehovah God.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:2:9-54:2:10" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Tim. 2:9, 10</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">This is especially important when visiting Bethel homes and branch facilities because they attract the attention of many non-Witness observers. Such onlookers may form opinions about God’s people and his organization based on what they observe. It would be good to speak with Bible students and others who may be visiting to remind them of the importance of giving attention to proper dress and grooming. The Bethel family will appreciate your doing this.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">As Christian ministers, we must be careful that our appearance does not give any cause for stumbling. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:6:3-47:6:4" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Cor. 6:3, 4</a>) Rather, by our proper decorum, may we always “adorn the teaching of our Savior, God, in all things.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/56:2:10-56:2:10" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Titus 2:10</a>.</p>

Why We Love Our Whole Association of Brothers
In today’s loveless world, how can we keep our love for our spiritual brothers burning brightly? (1 Pet. 2:17) How can we show others that our genuine, global brotherhood really exists? (Matt. 23:8) By means of the video Our Whole Association of Brothers. It shows the reasons why we love one another. See if you can answer these questions:
(1) What three activities do we share in common with our worldwide brotherhood? (2) How are our brothers showing their determination to preach (a) in the Alaskan wilderness, (b) in the vast harbors of Europe, and (c) in the dense forests of Peru? (3) What is an especially effective witnessing tool? (4) Why should we never feel that preaching is just an ordinary work? (5) Give examples of how Jehovah’s Witnesses have comforted and supported one another in times of distress​—earthquakes, hurricanes, and civil wars. (See the comments of Takao on page 23 in the August 22, 1995, Awake! and of Kotoyo on page 20 in the October 22, 1996, Awake!) (6) In what practical ways can all of us demonstrate the great identifying mark of our Christian brotherhood? (John 13:35) (7) How highly should we value our congregation meetings? (8) How does having a Kingdom Hall in which to meet affect those who have not previously had one? (9) How did our brothers in Eastern Europe and Russia survive spiritually when under ban? (10) Even now, what extraordinary effort do many Witnesses put forth to attend conventions, and why? How has this touched your heart? (11) Why are you determined to worship together in unity, to help others in times of need, and to preach faithfully whenever and however you can? (12) Why would it be good to have a personal copy of this video and show it to as many interested people as possible?

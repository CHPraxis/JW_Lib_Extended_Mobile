<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">ALMIGHTY GOD is the Master of the universe. Our lives, now and in the future, depend on him. He has the power to reward and the power to punish. He has the power to give life and the power to take life. If we have his approval, we will do well; if we do not have his approval, it will go badly for us. How important it is that our worship be acceptable to him!</p>

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">People worship in many ways. If religion is like a road, do all religious roads have God’s approval? No, they do not. Jesus, God’s prophet, showed that there are only two roads. He said: “Broad and spacious is the road leading off into destruction, and many are the ones going in through it; whereas narrow is the gate and cramped the road leading off into life, and few are the ones finding it.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:7:13-40:7:14" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matthew 7:13, 14</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">There are only two types of religion: one that leads to life and one that leads to destruction. The purpose of this brochure is to help you find the road that leads to everlasting life.</p>

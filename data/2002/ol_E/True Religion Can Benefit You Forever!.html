<p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="qu"> 1. What will happen if we “draw close to God”?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" data-rel-pid="[28]" class="sb">JEHOVAH loves those who serve him. If you worship Jehovah, he will bless you now and in the future. The Bible says: “Draw close to God, and he will draw close to you.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:4:8-59:4:8" data-bid="1-1" class="b">James 4:8</a>.</p>
<p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="qu"> 2. How can we draw close to God, and how will this affect our prayers?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[29]" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>To draw close to God, you must study and apply his Word. When you pray in harmony with his will, Jehovah will listen to your prayers and answer them. The Christian apostle John wrote: “This is the confidence that we have toward [God], that, no matter what it is that we ask according to his will, he hears us. Further, if we know he hears us respecting whatever we are asking, we know we are to have the things asked since we have asked them of him.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:5:14-62:5:15" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 John 5:14, 15</a>.</p>
<p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="qu">3-7. How may we acquire godly wisdom, and how can it help us?</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[30]" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>Furthermore, as you draw close to God, he will give you the wisdom to deal with the everyday matters of life. The Bible says: “If any one of you is lacking in wisdom, let him keep on asking God.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:1:5-59:1:5" data-bid="3-1" class="b">James 1:5</a>.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[30]" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>How can godly wisdom help you? For one thing, it can help you to know the things that displease Jehovah. You can also learn why these things are wrong and what you can do to avoid practicing them. Such knowledge can protect you from many of the problems that afflict people in general. For example, obedience to God’s counsel to be morally clean helps protect God’s people against unwanted pregnancy, sexually transmitted diseases, and unhappy or broken marriages.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[30]" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>What else can God-given wisdom do for you? It can enable you to get the most out of life. It can help you make wise decisions in practical matters, such as managing your money. You will be able to pursue worthwhile goals and reject goals that are of no lasting value.</p>

</div>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[30]" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup>Godly wisdom can also help you in your relationships with others. You can have a happier family life. You can build lasting, genuine friendships with others, and you may earn respect, even from those who do not serve God.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[30]" class="sb"><sup>7 </sup>Furthermore, your having godly wisdom will improve your outlook on life. It will help you to cope with life’s difficulties and disappointments. Also, you will have a balanced, positive outlook for the future. A positive outlook, in turn, will contribute to your mental and physical health.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:14:30-20:14:30" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Proverbs 14:30;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:48:17-23:48:17" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Isaiah 48:17</a>.</p>
<p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="qu"> 8. If you serve God, what will you not fear?</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[31]" class="sb"><sup>8 </sup>If you serve the true God, you will have freedom from the fears that trouble those who do not serve him. Because you know that the dead are lifeless in the grave, you will not fear those who have died. Because you have confidence in God’s promise to resurrect the dead, you will not fear dying. And since you know that God is <span id="page30" class="pageNum" data-no="30" data-before-text="30"></span>all-powerful, you will not fear witchcraft or sorcery.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:8:32-43:8:32" data-bid="5-1" class="b">John 8:32</a>.</p>

<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[32]" class="sb"><sup>9 </sup>If you draw close to God, you will not fear the future. As we have seen, the Bible foretold many of the problems that we see on earth today. Jehovah tells us that these things are temporary; God’s Kingdom will soon make this earth a paradise.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:21:10-42:21:11" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Luke 21:10, 11,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:21:31-42:21:31" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 31;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:23:43-42:23:43" data-bid="6-3" class="b"> 23:43</a>.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[32]" class="sb"><sup>10 </sup>Only those who draw close to Jehovah and serve him will live in Paradise. The Bible says: “Just a little while longer, and the wicked one will be no more; and you will certainly give attention to his place, and he will not be. But the meek ones themselves will possess the earth, and they will indeed find their exquisite delight in the abundance of peace.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:37:10-19:37:11" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Psalm 37:10, 11</a>.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[32]" class="sb"><sup>11 </sup>Those who stubbornly refuse to obey God’s righteous laws will lose their lives forever. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/53:1:8-53:1:9" data-bid="8-1" class="b">2 Thessalonians 1:8, 9</a>) They will be no more. They will join Satan and his demons in everlasting death.

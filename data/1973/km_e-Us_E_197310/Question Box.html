<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"><strong>● Is it all right for the congregation or a few brothers to hold a “garage sale” or other such “sales” for the financial benefit of the congregation and make it a congregation matter?</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">If a member of a congregation wants to hold a “garage sale,” that is something of a personal nature and for him to decide. What he does with such proceeds thereafter would also be a personal matter. However, it is never appropriate for anyone to make such sale a congregation matter or indicate in any way that the congregation is involved.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Each Kingdom Hall provides a contribution box where contributions for the congregation can be made on a completely voluntary basis. The Scriptures clearly indicate that Christians should have the opportunity to contribute for necessary congregation expenses, but this should be done willingly, from the heart, not by appealing to a desire for personal material gain in return for what is given.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:9:7-47:9:7" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Cor. 9:7</a>.</p>

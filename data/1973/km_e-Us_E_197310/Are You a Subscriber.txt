Are You a Subscriber?
1 This month, when we are aiding others to appreciate the value of Awake! and encouraging them to subscribe, is a good time to think of the advantages of subscribing ourselves. When we subscribe we make more certain that each issue is delivered to our home and often this is done before we could get distributors’ copies at the Kingdom Hall. Thus we can be reading the new magazine sooner, for our own benefit, and also preparing to present it effectively in the field when the release date for the distributors’ copies arrives.
2 There is no need to hold back from entering personal subscriptions, feeling that these would be more work for the Society. In the past it was suggested that the brothers pick up personal copies at the Kingdom Hall rather than subscribe. Your cooperating during this period was a great help and was very much appreciated. But we want all to know that now we will be very glad to mail the magazines directly to your homes. Encouraging others to subscribe is more convincing when we ourselves are subscribers. Of course, this applies to The Watchtower also.
3 Undoubtedly, this would also be a good time to review our individual needs as far as distributors’ copies are concerned. Could we, with a little planning, increase the number that we order and place? Heads of families might consider how the children are sharing in magazine distribution and whether the order should be increased for their sakes. Do we always pick them up on time? Are we holding to good schedules in magazine work, appreciating that this is dated material and should be placed while current? These and related factors regarding magazine distribution might be considered now while they are fresh in our minds.

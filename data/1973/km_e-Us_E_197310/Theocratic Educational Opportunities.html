<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>As is true of all of Jehovahâ€™s provisions for his people, we enjoy greatly the benefits of the Theocratic Ministry School. Not only do we learn to express ourselves better, but everyone attending has the opportunity to grow in knowledge of the truth through the material that is considered. The Bible readings, life experiences, <em>School Guidebook </em>material and <em>Aid to Bible Understanding </em>assignments all contribute toward a wealth of up-to-date truths acquainting us ever more fully with our God, Jehovah, and his purposes. And now the new schedule that is included as an insert to this <em>Kingdom Ministry </em>shows that we will be covering the material in the new <em>Peace and Security </em>book. Here is another powerful reason why we will want to be sure to attend each session in the coming year if at all possible.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>Are there some new ones in the congregation who have been thinking about enrolling in the ministry school? Possibly now would be a good time to do so. Or, others who have hesitated, though associated with the congregation for some time, might now decide that it is time to enroll. Why not approach the ministry school overseer and speak to him?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>How are the brothers handling the number two talk, the Bible reading assignment? Possibly some could use a little help in understanding just how to do the necessary research that will enable them to make explanatory comments during the reading. Where this has been done well, both the students and the audience have benefited greatly. Usually in each reading assignment there are a few scriptures that raise questions as to their meaning and application, and the clarifying comments by the student are very much appreciated.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>Would not this be a good time for all in the congregation to review their schedules for ministry school preparation? Undoubtedly so. If you are able to read all of the material prior to attending the school, rejoice in the good that comes to you. If your circumstances do not allow you to do so, then seek to benefit to the full from the studying you are able to do and be determined to pay attention to all the talks and retain as much as you can. If you came away with just one good point from each of the talks, just think of what you would be learning over a period of time! Yes, Jehovah has indeed arranged for tremendous educational opportunities for his people through the Theocratic Ministry School.</p>

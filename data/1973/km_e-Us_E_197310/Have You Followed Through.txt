Have You Followed Through?
1 During the last ten days of September you shared in delivering Kingdom News No. 16 to people in your territory. They have had opportunity to read it. But what was their reaction? Even if they were favorably impressed, many of them will not do much about it until one of Jehovah’s witnesses again calls at their home.
2 That is why it was recommended that, following our tract distribution, we go right back into the same territory and cover it again. It was suggested that we ask the people whether they read the tract. In many cases this will open the way for fine discussions and opportunities to start Bible studies. By offering magazines and subscriptions we also give them further opportunity to read and build up their confidence in God’s Word.
3 Have you done this follow-up work? If not, loving concern for our fellowman should move us to start now. If you distributed a hundred tracts during September, then there are a hundred households that could benefit from special calls on our part during October.

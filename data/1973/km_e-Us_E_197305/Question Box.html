<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"><strong>● When a person is given either a private or a public reproof for unchristian conduct, are terms or requirements then imposed that the individual must comply with?</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">No, neither one privately reproved by the judicial committee nor one publicly reproved is given certain terms to comply with (as if he were on a form of “probation”). It is simply required that he conduct himself in harmony with Bible principles, as the others in the congregation do. The judicial committee may strongly recommend that the individual discontinue certain habits or associations that could lead to repetition of the wrongdoing, and, in accord with the individual’s needs, will give spiritual assistance and encouragement.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">When there has been serious wrongdoing, even though the reproof is not announced, any weight of responsibility in the way of special assignments in the congregation would be removed from the individual. (“or,” p. 167) When one is publicly reproved, the congregation would be advised as to what privileges have been removed. (“or,” p. 169) When the individual gives evidence of regaining his spiritual strength and stability, privileges can be gradually restored. The same applies when a disfellowshipped person is reinstated. (“or,” p. 177)</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">If one who, for serious wrongdoing, was given either a private or a public reproof moves to another congregation before privileges have been fully restored to him, the judicial committee of the congregation to which he moves will determine when the gradual restoration of privileges may fittingly be made. (“or,” pp. 169, 170) Any further serious violation of God’s Word, of course, would be handled by the judicial committee where the individual now associates.</p>

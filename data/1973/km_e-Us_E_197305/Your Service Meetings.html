Make the month of June a real Bible study month. Remember that we have, not only the regular edition, but also a large-print edition, as well as “The Kingdom Interlinear Translation of the Greek Scriptures.” Use the folder on “Bibles and Bible Study Aids” to acquaint people with these. In carrying out our field activity, we will try to encourage all people to read the Bible. People might say they have a Bible, read it and are not interested in a copy of the “New World Translation.” Such a householder can be informed of the “Aid” book. Show the person the sample in your folder. In some cases, you may want to arrange a return visit to show the householder your copy and how we use it, and tell him that, if he so desires, one can be ordered for him. We can also offer to interested householders “Make Sure” for 75c. Brothers can carry their own copy of “Make Sure” with them. Then if people say they have a Bible, we can offer the householder something that will help him to understand the Bible. Appreciating the importance of the Bible study work, encourage all to start studies at every opportunity.</p>

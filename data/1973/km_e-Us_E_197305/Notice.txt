Notice
Some congregations report that at times Kingdom Ministry supplies are received late. This is to advise that Kingdom Ministry supplies are mailed on the 15th or 16th of each month. If a congregationâ€™s supply is late in arriving, the elders should make up their own program and adjust later meetings as needed when the Kingdom Ministry is received.

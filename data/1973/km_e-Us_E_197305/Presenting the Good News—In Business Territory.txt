Presenting the Good News​—In Business Territory
1 Has the business territory of your congregation been worked recently? Many businessmen and women are seldom contacted at their homes but can be spoken to at their places of employment. Ones who work business territory advise that early in the morning, shortly after establishments open, business is usually slow and that this is a fine time to work that territory. Too, early afternoon, for an hour or so following the lunch period, there is often a lull in activity. Two special pioneers who were encouraged by the Society to work business territory that had not been covered for some time wrote: “We made special effort to work the business territory. In just two mornings, using the suggestions from past Kingdom Ministry issues, namely, to call early in the day, to be very brief and to use a businesslike approach, we were able to place 105 books and six subscriptions. Many of the businessmen were sincerely pleased to have us take the time to stop and speak with them. We much appreciate your encouragement to call on the stores in our community.”
2 In New York city experienced publishers and pioneers are now working the Wall Street area, including every office building, large and small. Not only has a great deal of literature been placed with businessmen, including executives, but also many fine discussions have resulted. Arrangements were made to care for interested ones.
3 Businessmen and women are indeed among the “all sorts of men” whom Jehovah wishes to “come to an accurate knowledge of truth” and “be saved.” (1 Tim. 2:4) It is suggested that the field overseer of each congregation work out arrangements for the congregation’s business territory to be covered. Ones who share in this work, doing so with full reliance on Jehovah, can be confident of his blessing.

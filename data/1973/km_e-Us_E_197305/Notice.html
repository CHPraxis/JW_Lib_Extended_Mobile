<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Some congregations report that at times <em>Kingdom Ministry </em>supplies are received late. This is to advise that <em>Kingdom Ministry </em>supplies are mailed on the 15th or 16th of each month. If a congregationâ€™s supply is late in arriving, the elders should make up their own program and adjust later meetings as needed when the <em>Kingdom Ministry </em>is received.</p>

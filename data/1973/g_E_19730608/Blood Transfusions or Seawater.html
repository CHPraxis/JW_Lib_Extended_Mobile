<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">IN THE March 1970 issue of the magazine <em>Let’s Live, </em>appears an article by Dr. Giovanni Boni and Dr. Pierre Lafarge, in which they speak of “the uniqueness of the relationship between a body and its own blood.” Then the doctors state that there has been a long process of brainwashing to induce people to believe that they can “safely ignore this unique relationship and to believe that a blood transfusion from another person is at all possible.”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">After admitting that medical literature “fully agrees on the dangers of blood transfusions,” the doctors say: “One cannot but ask oneself how it could be that a practice so dangerous, irrational and ‘primitive’ is still continued today, and is, in a way, enforced.” They ask: “Why take useless chances when an alternative is available?” What is the alternative that they recommend?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">They go on to say: “This alternative consists of performing transfusions with a fluid which is absolutely harmless, is perfectly accepted by the body, easy to procure and easy to store, and which is as <em>alive </em>as the blood that runs in our veins. We are talking of ‘sea water.’” They explain this as being natural seawater specially collected and processed. “In France it is used quite extensively (even in Army hospitals) and, is called <em>Plasma de Quinton.”</em></p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Relating an experiment performed by R. Quinton in the laboratories of a noted French physiologist, the doctors report: A dog “was bled ‘white’ through the femoral artery; that is the bleeding was continued until it stopped spontaneously.” Immediately “sea water” was injected into the dog. Though the animal was extremely weak and unable to move, twenty-one hours later “the dog was running around.” After about a week the animal was ‘exceedingly active and vivacious,’ as a matter of fact, much more so than before the experience.” Five years later the dog was very much alive.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">The doctors prefer the processed natural seawater to an artificial saline solution. They believe there is an element of difference between the two that “escapes our system of measurement.” They point out that the composition of blood “is amazingly similar to that of ‘sea water.’” Obviously there are alternatives to dangerous blood transfusion.</p>

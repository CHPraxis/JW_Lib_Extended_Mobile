Teach Your Child to Love God
The Bible makes it clear that “from infancy” children can be beneficially taught about the Creator and his works. Listening to the Great Teacher is a book specifically designed for this purpose.
Read with your child the chapter “The One Who Made All Things.” This valuable 192-page, hardbound book is yours for only 25c.
Please send me Listening to the Great Teacher, for which I enclose 25c.

Can be more effective if youths on program work up their own presentations and rehearse before parents or overseers. Work in appropriate local experiences, if possible.</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">(4 min.) Chairman draws expressions from youths in congregation on how Christian thinking and conduct on their part serve to remove any reason for others to look down on their youth. Actions around home, school and Kingdom Hall many times speak louder than words. Should be like Timothy, who was an example in many ways, “in speaking, in conduct, in love, in faith, in chasteness.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:4:12-54:4:12" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Tim. 4:12</a>.</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">(3 min.) So as not to be looked down upon, youths’ conduct in and around Kingdom Hall needs to be exemplary. Form good habits early in life. Be attentive. Have own Bible and study materials. Unnecessary trips to rest room while meeting is on can be disturbing to others as well as causing one to miss part of the program. Encourage to go to rest room before meeting starts. Kingdom Hall is not a place for running and playing before or after meetings. Playing and loud noise outside of Kingdom Hall before or after meetings may annoy neighbors and cause them to look down on congregation’s youth.</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">(3 min.) Christian conduct in school will cause others to respect you. Reading, writing and arithmetic are good helps to prepare one for future service. Obedience to teachers, studying and paying attention in class are all important. A need to watch associations.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:15:33-46:15:33" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Cor. 15:33</a>.</p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">(3 min.) Earning respect from parents. Show deep love and respect for parents. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:6:1-49:6:2" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Eph. 6:1, 2</a>) Christian examples of children have directed parents to truth. Appreciate what they provide for you in way of home, food, clothing and truth. Willingly and joyfully care for family responsibilities given by parents, washing dishes, mowing grass, etc. Obedience is pleasing to Jehovah and parents.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:3:20-51:3:20" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Col. 3:20</a>.</p>
<p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb">(2 min.) Chairman. Youths’ proper conduct now paves the way for future privileges of service. Brings praise to Jehovah’s name, and greater respect from brothers. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:148:12-19:148:13" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ps. 148:12, 13</a>) Other youths in school and neighborhood, now looked down upon because of their conduct and thinking, will see good example and this may cause some to change, opening up way for witnessing and Bible studies.</p>
<p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sn"><strong>17 min: </strong>Talk by presiding overseer on how much the youths are appreciated in the congregation. Commend them for their ministerial activities, meeting participation. Show from their Bible studies, return visits and placements what they are accomplishing in preaching the good news. If they have placed any subscriptions during campaign, may ask one to tell how he did it. Encourage them to keep up their fine work and learn all they can, because they may be future elders and ministerial servants, pioneers, Bethel members, missionaries, which are all fine privileges of service.

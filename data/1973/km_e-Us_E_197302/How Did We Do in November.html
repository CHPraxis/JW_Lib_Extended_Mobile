<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">There were 424,342 proclaimers of the good news active during November, and they did good work. We were offering the “Paradise​—Theocracy” book that month, and 641,537 books were placed. Bible study work showed some increase​—up 6,379 from October’s report—​and that is good to see. Wherever interest is found, it is beneficial to tell them about our free home Bible study service. But to reach people we must spend time; the hours dropped off again in November. With careful planning, can we improve in February?</p>

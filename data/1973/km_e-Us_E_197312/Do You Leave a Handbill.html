<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">What do you do when a person is so busy you do not have time even to offer the magazines? Suppose someone does not take any literature after you speak with him about the truth? And what do you do when there is no one at home? Handbills are designed to fill the need in these and many other situations. Do you always carry handbills with you and try to leave them at every home? Often they can give a witness when you cannot.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">In addition to handbills that advertise the public lecture program of the congregation for several weeks, there are those that give general information on the times of meetings and the location of the Kingdom Hall. It is beneficial to have a good supply of these on hand. Both have brief Scriptural discussions on the back that are designed to start a person thinking and to excite his interest in the Bible’s answer.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Many experiences have been related in which individuals came in touch with the truth because of receiving a handbill. One man, after being disillusioned with several churches, prayed one night: ‘Dear God, if there is a God, help me to find the religion that is right.’ The next morning he noticed a handbill left earlier at his door when no one was at home. He accepted the invitation thereon to attend the Bible lecture at the Kingdom Hall. How glad he and his family are now that one of God’s Christian witnesses left that handbill. Try to leave at least a handbill at every door.</p>

There Is An Answer
War, crime, pollution of the air, water and land​—all bring untold distress and suffering. Human governments have been unable to remedy the situation.
But there is an answer to these problems. It is God’s kingdom, which is a real government ruled by Jesus Christ. The Watchtower magazine explains how this government will soon remedy world problems.

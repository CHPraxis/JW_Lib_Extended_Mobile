Things You Ought To Know
✔ Why God has permitted wickedness until our day—
✔ How this present system of things will soon end—
✔ The earth’s future as a paradise in God’s purpose—
✔What you must do to gain eternal life in paradise—
These are things discussed in the 416-page books “Things in Which It Is Impossible for God to Lie” and Life Everlasting​—in Freedom of the Sons of God. You may have both of these gold-embossed hardbound books by sending only $1.
If you are studying the Bible with Jehovah’s witnesses and have baptism in mind, it is recommended that you read these two books in preparation for that important step.
Please send me “Things in Which It Is Impossible for God to Lie” and and Life Everlasting​—in Freedom of the Sons of God, for which I enclose $1. Send also the gift booklets “This Good News of the Kingdom and “Look! I Am Making All Things New.”

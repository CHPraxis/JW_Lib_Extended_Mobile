Where Will You Attend the “Divine Victory” Assembly?
HUNDREDS of thousands of persons are looking forward with eager anticipation to the series of “Divine Victory” International Assemblies of Jehovah’s Witnesses to start in a few weeks. Not only are they convinced that “divine victory” by God’s kingdom will bring the greatest blessings for mankind, but they are also keenly interested in sharing in these blessings soon. Is this the way you feel about God’s triumph over all wickedness? If so, you will want to attend every session of the “Divine Victory” assembly.
Young and old, family groups and even the infirm will be there. Some will be traveling by the various means of modern transportation. Others will be walking many miles through wild jungle territory, or over rough mountain paths. For a considerable number, great expense will be involved in making the trip to an assembly.
Last year many put forth extraordinary effort to be present at the assemblies of Jehovah’s witnesses. A few weeks before an assembly in Duluth, Minnesota, one of Jehovah’s witnesses had a leg fractured when struck by a car. Yet she attended the convention along with her five children. A polio victim confined for about three years to a special rocking bed attended the assembly in Long Beach, California. What moved him and others in such difficult circumstances to attend? It was heartfelt appreciation for the great value of the assembly program.
Just think, over 21,000 will be flying across oceans to assemble with Christian brothers in other parts of the earth​—Asia, Europe, Africa, North and South America. Regardless of where you may attend an assembly, you will likely have opportunity to see delegates from distant places and hear about their experiences in sharing Bible truth with others.
We are confident that you will enjoy the assembly program to the full. Are you a family head? a mother? a youth? Have you been studying the Bible with Jehovah’s witnesses and attending some of their meetings? Then you will find that portions of the program are especially designed for you. Are you serving as an elder in one of the congregations of Jehovah’s witnesses? Then you will be delighted with the parts that will assist you to minister to the needs of fellow believers.
It is vital that people everywhere be helped to gain accurate knowledge of God’s will and purposes. So the assembly program will focus considerable attention on the important work of Kingdom-preaching and disciple-making. A special work will be outlined and demonstrated. All congregations of Jehovah’s witnesses world wide will be sharing in it during specified dates following the assembly. If you are one of Jehovah’s witnesses, we are sure you will want to be at the assembly to receive instructions.
If you have attended assemblies before, doubtless you very much appreciated the Biblical dramas presented. Will the “Divine Victory” International Assembly feature any of such dramas? Yes, four of them! Have you ever wondered just how people might have reacted to the work of Jesus Christ? What were conditions like in ancient Jerusalem before its destruction by the Roman armies, and how did the Christians living then feel? Why was David forgiven of his sin with Bath-sheba? Why did Rahab and her relatives survive the destruction of Jericho? The answers to these questions will be vividly portrayed in the assembly dramas. Your enjoyment of them may be heightened by reading ahead of time Joshua chapters 2 and 6; 2 Samuel 11 and 12; Psalm 51, and one of the Gospels.
The highlight of the convention program will be the public discourse on the stirring subject “Divine Victory​—Its Meaning for Distressed Humanity.” Besides the thousands of assembly delegates, other thousands of interested persons are being cordially invited to hear this heart-cheering discourse.
The “Divine Victory” assembly in most places will be five days long, with sessions starting at 9:55 a.m. Beginning at about 1:00 p.m. there will be a two-hour intermission for refreshments or cafeteria lunch. The closing sessions of each day will run from 2:55 p.m. to 5:30 p.m. In New York city, however, the opening session will begin at 6:00 p.m. on Friday and run to 9:00 p.m. On Saturday the program will begin at 8:55 a.m., and on the following days at 9:55 a.m. On the last four days the concluding sessions will be over at about 6:00 p.m. We encourage you to attend every session.
Hereafter we are setting forth the assembly dates and locations, to aid you in making plans. At each assembly the program will be presented in the local language unless indicated otherwise. If you need rooming accommodations, address your request to Watchtower Convention at the “Rooming” address shown for the convention you plan to attend. These requests may be mailed about six weeks before the assembly date.
We are sure that you will be richly rewarded by what you will see and hear at this year’s “Divine Victory” assembly. Do not miss it.

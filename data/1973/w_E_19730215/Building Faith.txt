Building Faith
● For millions upon millions of “Christians” their religion is composed of knowing some Bible stories learned in childhood and occasionally going to the church of their choice.
Yet in Gods and Men, Henry B. Parkes, Professor of History, wrote concerning first-century Christianity: “To become a Christian meant to undergo an emotional transformation centered in trust in Jesus Christ and in a resolution to imitate him. Christianity was based not on theory, but on faith . . . and this faith resulted in the reorganization of the believer’s whole personality and the adoption of new ways of behavior and new ethical responses.”​—Page 373.
In this same vein, hundreds of thousands of individuals earth wide are today acquiring such faith by studying the Bible with Jehovah’s witnesses. Such a faith that profoundly influences one’s whole way of thinking and acting is absolutely necessary, for the apostle Paul wrote, “Without faith it is impossible to please [God] well.”​—Heb. 11:6.

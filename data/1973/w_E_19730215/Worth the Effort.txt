Worth the Effort
◆ How common it is for individuals to look for sales, to purchase items at a specially reduced price. Yet it has been observed that almost anything can be purchased at a reduced price except lasting satisfaction. Accordingly, the Bible book of Proverbs observes: “If you keep seeking for it as for silver, and as for hid treasures you keep searching for it, in that case you will understand the fear of Jehovah, and you will find the very knowledge of God.” (Prov. 2:4, 5) So be willing to ‘pay the price’ of time and effort in studying God’s Word. It surely is worth it.

Do Not Delay
● The saying, ‘Tomorrow is often the busiest day of the year,’ reflects the human tendency to procrastinate. How appropriate, then, is the inspired encouragement concerning the present​—today: “Really, then, as long as we have time favorable for it, let us work what is good toward all, but especially toward those related to us in the faith.”​—Gal. 6:10.

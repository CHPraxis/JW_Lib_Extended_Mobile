Do You Wish You Could Remember?
Which issue of The Watchtower discussed what is proper dress for Christians? Where was the article on the Christian view of dancing?
Do you wish you could remember where to find things that you have read? The 1972 Watch Tower Publications Index can help. With its use any subject discussed in the past year in the publications of the Watch Tower Society can be quickly located. Send only 10Â cents for your copy.

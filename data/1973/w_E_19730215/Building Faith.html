<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">● For millions upon millions of “Christians” their religion is composed of knowing some Bible stories learned in childhood and occasionally going to the church of their choice.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Yet in <em>Gods and Men, </em>Henry B. Parkes, Professor of History, wrote concerning first-century Christianity: “To become a Christian meant to undergo an emotional transformation centered in trust in Jesus Christ and in a resolution to imitate him. Christianity was based not on theory, but on faith . . . and this faith resulted in the reorganization of the believer’s whole personality and the adoption of new ways of behavior and new ethical responses.”​—Page 373.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">In this same vein, hundreds of thousands of individuals earth wide are today acquiring such faith by studying the Bible with Jehovah’s witnesses. Such a faith that profoundly influences one’s whole way of thinking and acting is absolutely necessary, for the apostle Paul wrote, “Without faith it is impossible to please [God] well.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:11:6-58:11:6" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Heb. 11:6</a>.</p>

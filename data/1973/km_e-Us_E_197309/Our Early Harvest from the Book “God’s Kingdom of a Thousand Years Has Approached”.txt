Our Early Harvest from the Book “God’s Kingdom of a Thousand Years Has Approached”
In ancient Israel harvesttime was a period of great rejoicing. That happiness spread over some months, as there was an early harvest of flax, barley and wheat, followed by the later harvest of grapes, dates, figs and olives. We might use that to illustrate two provisions for rejoicing in connection with our new book God’s Kingdom of a Thousand Years Has Approached.
As announced at the recent assemblies, during the first week in December we will begin to study the book in the congregation book studies. But even before we begin in that way to reap the fine spiritual things from the new book, we will be able to gain much from it. This is because an early harvest, as it were, is being arranged. We will soon be moving quickly through the entire book in a series of seven public talks during November and December.
You will benefit greatly from these seven talks. Maybe you just do not foresee being able to sit down and study the entire book during the next few months. So what better way could you find to get the overall picture than to move rapidly through it during these talks? And won’t that “bird’s-eye view,” as it were, lay a fine groundwork for your detailed consideration of it at the book study starting in December? This will make the book study more meaningful for you.
Another benefit you will get from these seven talks involves your field service. We will be placing the new book in the house-to-house work during November. Can’t you see, then, how even the first few of these talks are going to help you to be more confident and enthusiastic about offering the book? You will know some of the subjects it considers and will appreciate how important it is for persons to have this information. You will even be able to mention specific parables and Bible chapters that the book treats.
Though you may not be assigned to deliver the discourses, there is something you can do in advance that will aid you to gain the most benefit from this “early harvest,” the seven talks. Each one of them will discuss a specific portion of the Bible, maybe a certain parable or chapter. Why not plan to read this over during the week before the talk, perhaps as your own personal Bible reading or together with the family? Then the talk dealing with that portion will be ever so much more valuable to you. Some may even be able to read the chapters in the new book that will be covered in the talk. Do so if you can. The Bible portions and chapters of the book to be covered are listed with each of the following outlines. Each week the chairman should announce what will be covered the following week. Bring your copy of the book to the talks, so you can follow along.
Speakers
You will note from the following outlines that each of the talks covers quite a bit of material, from two to four chapters of the new book. Do not attempt to include in your discourse all of the points in the chapter assigned to you. Of course, it will be beneficial to read through the chapters to get the overall view. But the outline calls attention to key sections, and in your talk you are to concentrate on these.
Since the audience has been alerted to read in advance a certain portion of the Bible, be sure to work with that portion in your talk. Help the brothers to understand it and to be in position to explain the essential meaning of that portion. You can read, or have read, what seems advisable in that Bible portion. Also, there is no objection to calling attention to, or even reading from the new book, certain choice parts of the chapters you have been assigned.
You will find with each outline a theme and some indications as to the direction the talk should take. Bear these in mind in preparing the talk, as they will help to make your talk distinct. Some talks cover material dealing basically with anointed Christians. In accord with the suggestions given, help the audience to see how ones with an earthly hope are involved in the matter, how they can apply the principles in their dealings or how this should affect their outlook.
Elders, we recommend that the talks be given during November and December, if possible. In some instances other talks may already have been lined up for those months. But would it be possible to readjust previously arranged talks so that these seven can be given in those two months, thus accomplishing the greatest possible good? If your congregation has the visit of the circuit overseer, or has a circuit assembly, during November or December, then these seven talks should be fitted around such events.
Naturally, it is best if elders in the local congregation or in nearby congregations deliver these talks. (See or pp. 66, 95; km 6/73 p. 4.) Last year in arranging for talks of this nature based on the Paradise​—Theocracy book many congregations were able to exchange speakers, and that can be done again. For example, the talks might be divided up between two or three congregations. The brother who prepares the first talk would deliver it in congregation A, the next week in congregation B, and finally in congregation C. He would be followed a week later in each congregation by the brother who prepares the second talk in the series. And so on in the proper sequence.
The elders in the congregation can work out the arrangements for these talks when they meet during September. When details have been settled, handbills may be ordered; the sooner the better.
1. A Thousand Years of Peace Has Approached (ka chapters 1-4; read Revelation 19:11-20:6.)
Look to God’s, not men’s, promise of thousand-year ruler (Chap. 1; 10 min.) Promises of lasting, peaceful rule for mankind so common that few believe them any longer; Christians may be able to cite texts about coming peaceful rule, but why believe such? What is basis for believing? Will consider matter today. No human ruler or government has proved permanent, able to bring lasting peace. Hitler boasted he would, but failed. (Pars. 1-5) Should look to God, as his will is irresistibly done. (Pars. 6, 7, 11; Dan. 4:34-37) He foretells thousand year rulership, mentioning it six times in Revelation 19:11 through 20:10. Evidence that Kingdom was established in heaven in 1914 C.E. and that seventh millennium of human history will soon begin shows why we have reason to believe millennial rule has approached. (Pars. 11-14, 17, 18)
God will prepare the way for peaceful rule by ridding earth of peace disturbers. (Chap. 2; 10 min.) Human efforts to secure peace by treaties, pacts and negotiations have repeatedly failed. God foretells his way of providing peace on earth​—eliminating peace disturbers from earth. Bible depicts enthroned Son as one leading war to accomplish this. (Rev. 19:11-16; pars. 1-3) Is a war from God, not between nations; those destroyed have no burial with honors. (Rev. 19:17, 18; par. 5) Will even eliminate world system of political rule. (Rev. 19:19-21; pars. 14, 15)
144,000 qualified rulers will help mankind from heaven. (Chap. 3; 15 min.) God assures us that there will be survivors on earth and in heaven; we can be among them and enjoy resulting peace. How? Revelation shows peace disturbers in heaven will also be removed. (Rev. 20:1-3) Will not be around to mislead people​—this suggests some will survive. Earlier, Revelation 7:9-15 had indicated that great crowd would survive tribulation. (Par. 4) Who will rule mankind? God provides rulers in heaven. (Rev. 20:4-6; pars. 8, 11) In contrast to humans who will progress gradually to perfection and life, these are resurrected immortal. (Pars. 16-19) This resurrection is first in time and importance. (Par. 33) Would you like to have such rulers? The more we know about them, the more we want them as rulers. (Par. 42)
God’s rulers have proved to be promoters of real peace. (Chap. 4; 20 min.) God has selected rulers who are and will be lovers of God and of peace. (Par. 4) They are not like human rulers who tend to divide up mankind, retarding peace. (Par. 6) Mankind will be united under their rule, even have one language. (Par. 8; read pars. 11, 12.) Easy to see how this would contribute to peace. Are we already striving for international unity as Christians? (Par. 15) Anointed Christians who will be heavenly rulers promote peace in their preaching. (Isa. 2:4; par. 17) They follow pattern of Jesus, Prince of Peace. (Isa. 9:6, 7; pars. 21, 43) He avoided human politics, stressed heavenly kingdom. (Pars. 47, 49) Can display your real desire to live during approaching thousand-year peace, by sharing in peaceful work he commanded. (Pars. 51-54) One thus aligns self with peace-promoting rulers, and manifests one’s confidence that this thousand-year peace has approached.
2. Rulership from Heaven​—Will You Accept It? (ka chapters 5, 6; read Hebrews 5:1-10; 6:19-10:25.)
Jesus and his associate kings serve to the benefit of those who accept heaven’s rulership. (Chap. 5; 15 min.) Most persons were born into a nation; never had to decide to accept this rulership. Many are apathetic or critical of government because of obvious deficiencies; rulers may be greedy or dishonest. Divine provision for government is vastly different. But do we take it for granted or do we show real interest in it? Are we eager to learn about it? God’s king, Jesus, unselfishly gave life for those who accept heaven’s rulership; do we? (Pars. 1-3) Even David will have to acknowledge Jesus’ position; will we? (Par. 6) Christ will have associate kings ruling with him. (Rev. 20:4; pars 8, 10) They pattern selves after his image, so will be loving, righteous, worthy of our respect. (1 Pet. 4:1; par. 12) This ensures harmonious government, no rivalry. (Pars. 15, 16) While on earth they, as ambassadors, strive to reconcile individuals to God. (2 Cor. 5:18–6:1; pars. 19, 21, 23) As ambassadors loyal to God, on earth they are not identified with or supporters of human political arrangements. (Pars. 24-27) Will be able to benefit mankind during rulership of thousand years. (Par. 29)
Rulership from heaven​—if we accept it—​also performs priestly services in our behalf. (Chap. 6, pp. 83-93; 20 min.) These associate rulers will also be priests with Christ. (Rev. 20:6) You may have had bad experience with corrupt priests. Priests often have deceived, misled people. (Relate Acts 14:8-19; pars. 2, 5-7.) We cannot imagine Jesus’ associate rulers, with their fine qualities, being like that. Of what value is a priest? (Heb. 5:1-3) Because of man’s sinfulness, we need service of perfect priest. God made Jesus a righteous and perpetual priest. (Heb. 5:4-6; pars. 15, 18, 19) Is far superior even to priesthood of Aaron’s family. (Heb. 7:15, 16, Heb 7:23–8:1; pars. 20, 24) Do we appreciate that, realizing what a blessing rulership from heaven thus provides for us?
Priestly service in our behalf carries right into very presence of God. (Chap. 6; pp. 93-116; 20 min.) Aaron and associate priests served in typical sanctuary. (Describe, using illustration on p. 93.) Was typical of heavenly things. (Heb. 8:4, 5; 9:9, 11) When Jesus was baptized, becoming High Priest, area of God’s presence came to be Most Holy of True Temple. (Pars. 30, 39, 40) As spiritual Son on earth, Jesus was in Holy of spiritual temple, able to enjoy spiritual light and food. (Pars. 45-48) Anointed ones, like Aaron’s sons, are priests. (Rev. 1:5, 6; pars. 52, 61, 62) Because of being spirit-begotten, are in Holy and can enjoy spiritual enlightenment and food. (Par. 64) Upon death they pass beyond curtain-like barrier of flesh and enter very presence of God. (Heb. 10:19-22) As with Christ, from heaven they will be sympathetic, understanding priests. (Pars. 73-76, 81) Surely is desirable rulership. You are not forced to submit to it; up to you if want to accept it. Can indicate acceptance by accepting their instruction and sharing in their work today.
3. How God Will Prepare Mankind to Live Forever (ka chapters 7-9; read Revelation 20:7-21:4.)
Millennium is loving provision to help us qualify for eternal life. (Chap. 7; 25 min.) If someone spends time, effort helping us to qualify for job or other desirable thing, natural to respond with appreciation. Associated with millennium are provisions to help us to qualify to live forever. Millennium may also be referred to as Judgment Day, thousand-year period of judging. Follows end of wicked system. (Rev. 20:4; pars. 3, 4) Jehovah has committed judging to Jesus; anointed ones share with him. Not something for Christian to fear, for judging will be in righteousness. (Acts 17:31) Even “unrighteous” can benefit. (Pars. 10, 11) Resurrected ones still not perfect, so thousand-year judgment day provides for deliverance from sin for those who want to serve God. (Pars. 12, 13, 20, 21) “Righteous” ones resurrected have advantage of already having displayed integrity, love for God. Will “unrighteous” put away bad habits? Provision of millennium allows for that. (Pars. 25, 26) Will give all first real “chance” at eternal life; heavenly judges will help. (Par. 32) God will provide instruction to help us. (Rev. 20:11-15; pars. 34, 35) Earthly “princes” will also aid. (Ps. 45:15, 16) Jesus’ faithful ancestors and other men of integrity will thus serve. (Pars. 38, 43-46)
Transforming personalities with eternity in view. (Chap. 8; 15 min.) More is needed than righteous administrative arrangements; we need to be right kind of persons. To find permanent place in New Order, we must learn righteousness. (Isa. 26:9; par. 1) Chief Judge, Jesus, will lead in executing just decisions. (Isa. 11:1-5; pars. 4, 5) This will aid humans to transform their personalities, abandoning beastly qualities and characteristics. (Isa. 11:6-9; pars. 9, 10) Can expect corresponding literal fulfillment in the animals coming to be at peace with one another and with humans. (Pars. 13, 14) Do you have jealousy, wrath, envies, prejudices?
The post-millennium test as to who qualify for life. (Chap. 9; 15 min.) Question remains, Will we meet Jehovah’s standard for eternal life? At end of millennium, Jesus will turn things back to Father. (1 Cor. 15:24-28; pars. 3, 4) God will permit Satan one final opportunity to test mankind’s support of Jehovah’s sovereignty. (Rev. 20:7-10; pars. 5-7) Some will rebel, choosing group sovereignty. (Pars. 11-14) “Nations” that attack representatives of New Jerusalem will be like Gog of Magog who led attack on Christians during great tribulation. (Pars. 15-17) Satan, demons and rebels will be cast into second death, second type of death that entered realm of creation. (Rev. 20:10, 14, 15; pars. 25-28) Surviving mankind will then be acknowledged as worthy of eternal life, coming to life. (Rev. 20:5; pars. 31-33) Then all mankind will joyfully praise God. (Ps. 150:1-6) Jehovah’s witnesses invite individuals to do that with them now.
4. Are You Wise or Foolish Regarding Christ’s Presence? (ka chapters 10-13; read Matthew 25:1-30.)
An aspect of Jesus’ “sign” that should move us to be alert, discreet. (Chap. 10; 15 min.) One of most frequent subjects of our preaching is “sign” of Matthew 24. Often refer to features of it to establish we are in “last days.” But Jesus’ “sign” covered Matthew 25 also; parables there, in addition to being part of sign, have vital meaning for us. (Read Matthew 25:1-13.) Reply was to question about time of his “presence.” Parousia meant, not his first coming, but future presence. (Matt. 24:3; pars. 8-14) Fulfillment of parable was an evidence of presence. Bible likens Jesus to bridegroom; anointed ones are compared to chaste virgins. (John 3:28-30; Eph. 5:23-27; pars. 18, 21-23) From the start, Christians were obliged to maintain selves as virgins awaiting marriage in heaven. (Pars. 26-28) Would be identified by “oil” or being filled with God’s enlightening Word and spirit. (Matt. 5:16; pars. 31, 36-38) Bridegroom was to be ‘delayed,’ with antichrist coming first. (1 John 2:18; pars. 42-46) Danger exists of being asleep, not alert to Christ’s presence. (Matt. 25:13)
Parable’s fulfillment in our day should affect us. (Chap. 11; 15 min.) Can rightly expect, after period of sleep, an awakening associated with bridegroom’s presence. (Matt. 25:5, 6) C. T. Russell correctly pointed forward to end of Gentile Times for 1914. (Pars. 4, 5) He recognized parousia applied to invisible presence. Though he miscalculated beginning of Christ’s presence, in time his associates recognized presence began in 1914 C.E. (Pars. 6, 9, 10, 48, 55) From 1919 there was an awakening among anointed. (Pars. 11-19) Nominal Christians would not accept Jesus’ presence; “discreet” virgins parted company with such “foolish” ones. (Pars. 24-26) Foolish ones are in line for destruction. (Pars. 41, 42) Emphasizes our need to recognize the complete “sign” and to keep on the watch. (Pars. 44-46)
Christians need to work, resulting in growth​—this is part of the “sign” too. (Chaps. 12, 13; 25 min.) Following parable in Matthew is also part of “sign.” (Gist of Matthew 25:14-30) It should help us see need to work hard for God. (ka p. 258, par. 3) Logical to expect Christ as king since 1914 to inspect and test servants. (Par. 1) In parable Jesus committed talents to disciples. (Pars. 4-10) Talents represented potentiality for reaping disciples. (Pars. 12-15) By preaching and teaching they did business. (Pars. 20, 24, 26, 30, 35) As part of sign, can expect to see culminating fulfillment since 1914. (Pars. 37-40) Would be an inspection to see if slaves showed increase by use of talents. (Par. 45) Evidence among Witnesses is that members of anointed slave have increased talents, resulting in now over 11/2 million Christians! (Pars. 52-56) Settling accounts would span some time. (Chap. 13, par. 3) After start of parousia has been time to reward anointed ones sleeping in death. (1 Cor. 15:50-54; pars. 5-8) They are resurrected to reign with Christ, entering heavenly joy. (Par. 14) Sluggish slave deliberately did not increase master’s talents. (Pars. 19, 20) Finds counterpart in nominal Christians and those separating from God’s servants. (Pars. 21-24) In line for execution in darkness of great tribulation. (Par. 29) Anointed slave determined to continue its hard work, increasing talents. (Pars. 26, 32, 33) Is course of wisdom to join in its work.
5. Do You Qualify to Inherit God’s Kingdom? (ka chapters 14, 15; read Matthew 25:31-46.)
By your attitude and acts, begin now to qualify to inherit God’s kingdom. (Chap. 14; 40 min.) Many today believe no one will live forever; others feel all will be saved. Both views lead to outlook that one’s attitudes and acts are not important. Bible proves otherwise; are especially crucial since 1914. Witnesses have often shown that fulfillment of “sign” of Christ’s presence proves Kingdom set up in heaven then. Parable of sheep and goats, a part of “sign,” proves attitudes and acts now can affect whether one qualifies for eternal life. (Read verses as you discuss them.)
Son of man is Jesus, now on heavenly throne. (Dan. 7:13, 14; pars. 5-7) In time will dash nations to pieces. (Ps. 2:7-9) People are first separated. (Pars. 13-15) Would take time for personalities and conduct to be manifest. (Pars. 16-18) Parable applies now, not during or after millennium​—Christians will not then be thrown into prisons; now is time of parousia; and parable relates to persons alive when Jesus takes power, not to living and dead to be judged during millennium. (Par. 19; Rev. 20:11, 12) “Sheep” are Christians with hope of eternal life on earth. They are “great crowd” shepherded by Lamb. (Rev. 7:9, 10, 17; par. 32) Inherit Kingdom by being earthly subjects; God had this in mind since ransomable children born to Adam and Eve. (Pars. 35-37) “Sheep” qualify because, out of faith in Jesus, they help his spiritual brothers. (Heb. 2:16, 17; pars. 43-47) Joining selves to spiritual Jews, they dedicate lives to God and faithfully serve him. (Zech. 8:20-23; pars. 48-53) They display humble attitude, pursue peace, keep separate from world, live by Bible standards, share in preaching. (Pars. 55, 56, 60) Ask self: How does Jesus judge my actions and attitudes? Is this “sign” meaningful to me? Do I show it?
Not all will qualify​—will you? (Chap. 15; 15 min.) Parable shows that some persons do not qualify but receive eternal death. Why? May not have persecuted Christ or his spiritual brothers; might be their negative attitude that puts them on Devil’s side. (Pars. 5-8) Is no basis for claim of ignorance as to whom anointed represent. (Pars. 11-13) Where do we fit in? How about our family and relatives? Of what course regarding them does this emphasize need? Is not a matter of no concern because of being long way off; “goats” soon to be destroyed at end of this system. (2 Thess. 1:7-10; par. 14) Will not experience eternal torment​—a form of everlasting life—​but eternal cutting off or death. (Pars. 3, 4, 17, 18) Righteous “sheep” will be protected during war of Armageddon. Should be source of encouragement. (Pars. 19, 21) To begin qualifying for eternal life, it is clear that positive action is needed.
6. The “Sign” that God’s New Order Is Near (ka chapters 16, 17; read Matthew 23:34–24:51.)
We can be uplifted by the “sign” that New Order is near! (Chap. 16; 30 min.) Problems and worries of today leave most persons troubled, insecure about future. Vastly different with Christians who understand meaning of Jesus’ “sign” regarding our time. (Read appropriate verses in Matthew 24 as you discuss them.) Apostles were interested in future in view of Jesus’ comments. (Luke 19:41-44; Heb. 9:26; pars. 3-7) When would end of Jewish system come? How would they know? Jesus outlined events leading up to destruction of Jerusalem. (Pars. 8-14) Was life-or-death matter to note the indication that destruction impended. (Pars. 15-17) When Romans encompassed Jerusalem, Christians knew end near. (Pars. 21, 22, 26) Larger future fulfillment expected, as Revelation chapter 6 (written after 70 C.E.) pointed forward to war, famine and pestilence. Applies to entire wicked system, dominated by Christendom. Have seen evidences of fulfillment of sign since 1914. (Pars. 28, 30-33) Though this means destruction impends, is cause of encouragement. Why? Note what will be destroyed. Led by Anglo-American Seventh World Power, nations look to UN for peace. Revelation shows that this peace organization will lead in desolating false religion. (Pars. 42-44) Those desiring God’s favor are urged to get out of false religion, just as Christians fled Jerusalem. (Par. 45) Coming destruction will begin with false religion and include rest of wicked system. (Pars. 52, 53) Encouragingly, some will survive. (Pars. 55-57) These will be ones discerning true Messiah and gathering there for spiritual nourishment. (Pars. 60, 63) They are not discouraged by disturbances in the physical heavens. (Pars. 70, 71) Will not be forced to acknowledge parousia when Jesus comes to destroy system, for they already have acknowledged his presence and that he has gathered his anointed ones. (Pars. 74, 76) They are sure all he promised will occur, and look forward to preservation. (Pars. 81-83) Have we fully joined with such ones? Time to decide now.
Jesus stressed need to be alert and active, as with the “faithful and discreet slave.” (Chap. 17; 25 min.) Hard to believe that persons would ignore fulfillment of “sign,” but they do. As with people before Flood, most display lack of faith and ignore parousia. (Pars. 4-7) Need to keep on watch that we are alert and active when he comes as executioner. Ought to live each day as ones aware of the time. (Pars. 10-13) Lesson in being active and faithful during presence is found in “faithful and discreet slave.” Jesus directed words to entire body of disciples. (Pars. 14, 16) Slave class began with anointing of disciples in 33 C.E. when nation of spiritual Israel formed. (Pars. 20-23) Slave began to make spiritual food available. (Pars. 24-26) In modern times, anointed as a class have provided spiritual food. (Pars. 29, 30) Even despite difficult condition of World War I, slave class continued supplying food for individual domestics. (Par. 40) After “Master” received Kingdom power and turned attention to servants, he showed approval, assigning responsibility for his spiritual things on earth. Now even have responsibility of caring for “great crowd.” (Pars. 49-51, 54) Individual anointed ones turning bad become like the “evil slave,” rejected by Jesus. (Pars. 59-62, 65) Even if not of the “faithful and discreet slave” class, should see need to be faithful in Christian activities. Attention to such will aid us to avoid being ensnared. (Luke 21:34-36; pars. 66-68) Thus sign that New Order is near will mean eternal blessings for us.
7. When Apostates Are Gone​—Peace for a Thousand Years! (ka chapters 18, 19; read 1 Thessalonians 4, 5; 2 Thessalonians 1, 2; Psalm 116.)
Heed the warning​—Now is the time for decisive religious action! (Chap. 18; 35 min.) Jehovah’s witnesses happy that many new ones regularly associate; shows commendable interest in true worship. How important is decisive action on your part? For Witnesses, how vital is it to reach still others (relatives, workmates, neighbors) with Christian message? First and Second Thessalonians give an answer; will discuss “man of lawlessness.” General outlook today is hope for peace among nations; Bible shows that time will come. (1 Thess. 5:1-3; pars. 1-3) Some in Thessalonica thought Christ’s presence and “day of Jehovah” had come; Paul corrected them, explaining fulfillment was future. (2 Thess. 2:1, 2; pars. 5-8) Before “day of Jehovah” apostasy had to come. (2 Thess. 2:3; pars. 12, 13) Meant a rebellion against Jehovah on part of ones claiming to be Christian, especially the leaders. Also foretold in other Bible books. (Acts 20:28-30; 2 Pet. 2:1-3; pars. 16-25) In time men claiming to be Christian did take to selves role of leaders, becoming clergy. (Pars. 27, 31, 34) This composite “man” set himself in opposition to God, demanded reverence. (Pars. 38-40, 42, 43) Apostles acted as a restraint to apostasy, which showed evidence of developing even while they were on earth. (2 Thess. 2:6; 1 John 2:18-22; pars. 44-46, 49-51) During Christ’s then future presence clerical “man of lawlessness” would be destroyed; means an end to apostates. (2 Thess. 2:8; pars. 52, 53) God lets this “man” operate, thus allowing those taking pleasure in unrighteousness to be deceived. (2 Thess. 2:9-12; pars. 59-63) Soon the end of “man of lawlessness” class, and of all apostates, will come. Just as earthly Jerusalem was destroyed in 70 C.E., Christendom and rest of Babylon the Great will be destroyed, to be followed by rest of wicked system. (Pars. 67-69) Where do we stand? Are we actively aiding others to separate from that class? When apostates are gone, will we be here? What conditions then?
A millennium of peace and other blessings for those pursuing true worship now. (Chap. 19; 20 min.) Maybe feel insecure; not sure if you will survive. With apostates earth wide being destroyed, what reason can one have for confidence of life in paradise to follow? True, that end of entire wicked system to come in great tribulation, but Jesus promised that “flesh” would be saved. (Matt. 24:3, 21, 22; pars. 2, 3) This preservation, and outlook we can have, nicely described in Psalm 116. As psalmist looked to God for life, so must we. (Ps. 116:1-6; pars. 6, 7) We need the faith the psalmist and Paul had. (Ps. 116:7-11; 2 Cor. 4:8-10; pars. 9-12) After final part of great tribulation, war of great day of God Almighty, will realize that God preserved us when he destroyed wicked. (Pars. 13, 14) Such deliverance into New Order will move us to appreciation. (Ps. 116:12-14; par. 17) Will see how precious to God are his loyal ones; he did not let Satan wipe them all out. (Ps. 116:15, 16; pars. 22, 24) What a joy it will be to have peace in which to express our gratitude to God by sacrifices of thanksgiving. (Ps. 116:17-19; pars. 26-28) Prospect of that preservation and of delightful peace of thousand years to follow should move us to share now in preaching, thus holding before others this prospect. (Par. 30)

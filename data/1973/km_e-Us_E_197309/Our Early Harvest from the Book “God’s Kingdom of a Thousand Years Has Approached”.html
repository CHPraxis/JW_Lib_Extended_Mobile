<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">In ancient Israel harvesttime was a period of great rejoicing. That happiness spread over some months, as there was an early harvest of flax, barley and wheat, followed by the later harvest of grapes, dates, figs and olives. We might use that to illustrate two provisions for rejoicing in connection with our new book <em>God’s Kingdom of a Thousand Years Has Approached.</em></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">As announced at the recent assemblies, during the first week in December we will begin to study the book in the congregation book studies. But even before we begin in that way to reap the fine spiritual things from the new book, we will be able to gain much from it. This is because an early harvest, as it were, is being arranged. We will soon be moving quickly through the entire book in a series of seven public talks during November and December.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">You will benefit greatly from these seven talks. Maybe you just do not foresee being able to sit down and study the entire book during the next few months. So what better way could you find to get the overall picture than to move rapidly through it during these talks? And won’t that “bird’s-eye view,” as it were, lay a fine groundwork for your detailed consideration of it at the book study starting in December? This will make the book study more meaningful for you.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Another benefit you will get from these seven talks involves your field service. We will be placing the new book in the house-to-house work during November. Can’t you see, then, how even the first few of these talks are going to help you to be more confident and enthusiastic about offering the book? You will know some of the subjects it considers and will appreciate how important it is for persons to have this information. You will even be able to mention specific parables and Bible chapters that the book treats.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Though you may not be assigned to deliver the discourses, there is something you can do in advance that will aid you to gain the most benefit from this “early harvest,” the seven talks. Each one of them will discuss a specific portion of the Bible, maybe a certain parable or chapter. Why not plan to read this over during the week before the talk, perhaps as your own personal Bible reading or together with the family? Then the talk dealing with that portion will be ever so much more valuable to you. Some may even be able to read the chapters in the new book that will be covered in the talk. Do so if you can. The Bible portions and chapters of the book to be covered are listed with each of the following outlines. Each week the <em>chairman </em>should announce what will be covered the following week. Bring your copy of the book to the talks, so you can follow along.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="ss"><strong><em>Speakers</em></strong></p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">You will note from the following outlines that each of the talks covers quite a bit of material, from two to four chapters of the new book. Do not attempt to include in your discourse all of the points in the chapter assigned to you. Of course, it will be beneficial to read through the chapters to get the overall view. But the outline calls attention to key sections, and in your talk you are to concentrate on these.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Since the audience has been alerted to read in advance a certain portion of the Bible, be sure to work with that portion in your talk. Help the brothers to understand it and to be in position to explain the essential meaning of that portion. You can read, or have read, what seems advisable in that Bible portion. Also, there is no objection to calling attention to, or even reading from the new book, certain choice parts of the chapters you have been assigned.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">You will find with each outline a theme and some indications as to the direction the talk should take. Bear these in mind in preparing the talk, as they will help to make your talk distinct. Some talks cover material dealing basically with anointed Christians. In accord with the suggestions given, help the audience to see how ones with an earthly hope are involved in the matter, how they can apply the principles in their dealings or how this should affect their outlook.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Elders, we recommend that the talks be given during November and December, if possible. In some instances other talks may already have been lined up for those months. But would it be possible to readjust previously arranged talks so that these seven can be given in those two months, thus accomplishing the greatest possible good? If your congregation has the visit of the circuit overseer, or has a circuit assembly, during November or December, then these seven talks should be fitted around such events.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">Naturally, it is best if elders in the local congregation or in nearby congregations deliver these talks. (See <em>or </em>pp. 66, 95; <a class="xt" data-xtid="5" href="jwpub://p/E:201973205/7:645-11$p/E:201973208/$p/E:201973209/$p/E:201973210/1-6"><em>km </em>6/73 p. 4</a>.) Last year in arranging for talks of this nature based on the <em>Paradise​—Theocracy </em>book many congregations were able to exchange speakers, and that can be done again. For example, the talks might be divided up between two or three congregations. The brother who prepares the first talk would deliver it in congregation A, the next week in congregation B, and finally in congregation C. He would be followed a week later in each congregation by the brother who prepares the second talk in the series. And so on in the proper sequence.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">The elders in the congregation can work out the arrangements for these talks when they meet during September. When details have been settled, handbills may be ordered; the sooner the better.</p>

<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb"><em>Look to God’s, not men’s, promise of thousand-year ruler </em>(Chap. 1; 10 min.) Promises of lasting, peaceful rule for mankind so common that few believe them any longer; Christians may be able to cite texts about coming peaceful rule, but why believe such? What is basis for believing? Will consider matter today. No human ruler or government has proved permanent, able to bring lasting peace. Hitler boasted he would, but failed. (Pars. 1-5) Should look to God, as his will is irresistibly done. (Pars. 6, 7, 11; <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:4:34-27:4:37" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Dan. 4:34-37</a>) He foretells thousand year rulership, mentioning it six times in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:19:11-66:20:10" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Revelation 19:11 through 20:10</a>. Evidence that Kingdom was established in heaven in 1914 C.E. and that seventh millennium of human history will soon begin shows why we have reason to believe millennial rule has approached. (Pars. 11-14, 17, 18)</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb"><span id="page4" class="pageNum" data-no="4" data-before-text="4"></span><em>God will prepare the way for peaceful rule by ridding earth of peace disturbers. </em>(Chap. 2; 10 min.) Human efforts to secure peace by treaties, pacts and negotiations have repeatedly failed. God foretells his way of providing peace on earth​<em>—</em>eliminating peace disturbers from earth. Bible depicts enthroned Son as one leading war to accomplish this. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:19:11-66:19:16" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Rev. 19:11-16</a>; pars. 1-3) Is a war from God, not between nations; those destroyed have no burial with honors.

<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb"><em>144,000 qualified rulers will help mankind from heaven. </em>(Chap. 3; 15 min.) God assures us that there will be survivors on earth and in heaven; we can be among them and enjoy resulting peace. How? Revelation shows peace disturbers in heaven will also be removed. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:20:1-66:20:3" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Rev. 20:1-3</a>) Will not be around to mislead people​—this suggests some will survive. Earlier, <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:7:9-66:7:15" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Revelation 7:9-15</a> had indicated that great crowd would survive tribulation. (Par. 4) Who will rule mankind? God provides rulers in heaven. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:20:4-66:20:6" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Rev. 20:4-6</a>; pars. 8, 11) In contrast to humans who will progress gradually to perfection and life, these are resurrected immortal. (Pars. 16-19) This resurrection is first in time and importance. (Par. 33) Would you like to have such rulers? The more we know about them, the more we want them as rulers. (Par. 42)</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb"><em>God’s rulers have proved to be promoters of real peace. </em>(Chap. 4; 20 min.) God has selected rulers who are and will be lovers of God and of peace. (Par. 4) They are not like human rulers who tend to divide up mankind, retarding peace. (Par. 6) Mankind will be united under their rule, even have one language. (Par. 8; read pars. 11, 12.) Easy to see how this would contribute to peace. Are we already striving for international unity as Christians? (Par. 15) Anointed Christians who will be heavenly rulers promote peace in their preaching. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:2:4-23:2:4" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Isa. 2:4</a>; par. 17) They follow pattern of Jesus, Prince of Peace. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:9:6-23:9:7" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Isa. 9:6, 7</a>; pars. 21, 43) He avoided human politics, stressed heavenly kingdom. (Pars. 47, 49) Can display your real desire to live during approaching thousand-year peace, by sharing in peaceful work he commanded. (Pars. 51-54) One thus aligns self with peace-promoting rulers, and manifests one’s confidence that this thousand-year peace has approached.</p>

Rulership from Heaven​—Will You Accept It? </strong>(<a class="xt" data-xtid="13" href="jwpub://p/E:1101973015/"><em>ka </em>chapters 5,</a><a class="xt" data-xtid="14" href="jwpub://p/E:1101973016/"> 6;</a> read <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:5:1-58:5:10" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Hebrews 5:1-10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:6:19-58:10:25" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> 6:19-10:25</a>.)</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb"><em>Jesus and his associate kings serve to the benefit of those who accept heaven’s rulership. </em>(Chap. 5; 15 min.) Most persons were born into a nation; never had to decide to accept this rulership. Many are apathetic or critical of government because of obvious deficiencies; rulers may be greedy or dishonest. Divine provision for government is vastly different. But do we take it for granted or do we show real interest in it? Are we eager to learn about it? God’s king, Jesus, unselfishly gave life for those who accept heaven’s rulership; do we? (Pars. 1-3) Even David will have to acknowledge Jesus’ position; will we? (Par. 6) Christ will have associate kings ruling with him. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:20:4-66:20:4" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Rev. 20:4</a>; pars 8, 10) They pattern selves after his image, so will be loving, righteous, worthy of our respect. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:4:1-60:4:1" data-bid="14-1" class="b">1 Pet. 4:1</a>; par. 12) This ensures harmonious government, no rivalry. (Pars. 15, 16) While on earth they, as ambassadors, strive to reconcile individuals to God. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:5:18-47:6:1" data-bid="15-1" class="b">2 Cor. 5:18–6:1</a>; pars. 19, 21, 23) As ambassadors loyal to God, on earth they are not identified with or supporters of human political arrangements. (Pars. 24-27) Will be able to benefit mankind during rulership of thousand years. (Par. 29)</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb"><em>Rulership from heaven​—if we accept it—​also performs priestly services in our behalf. </em>(Chap. 6, pp. 83-93; 20 min.) These associate rulers will also be priests with Christ. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:20:6-66:20:6" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Rev. 20:6</a>) You may have had bad experience with corrupt priests. Priests often have deceived, misled people. (Relate <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:14:8-44:14:19" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Acts 14:8-19</a>; pars. 2, 5-7.) We cannot imagine Jesus’ associate rulers, with their fine qualities, being like that. Of what value is a priest? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:5:1-58:5:3" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Heb. 5:1-3</a>) Because of man’s sinfulness, we need service of perfect priest. God made Jesus a righteous and perpetual priest. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:5:4-58:5:6" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Heb. 5:4-6</a>; pars. 15, 18, 19) Is far superior even to priesthood of Aaron’s family.

<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb"><em>Priestly service in our behalf carries right into very presence of God. </em>(Chap. 6; pp. 93-116; 20 min.) Aaron and associate priests served in typical sanctuary. (Describe, using illustration on p. 93.) Was typical of heavenly things.

(Pars. 30, 39, 40) As spiritual Son on earth, Jesus was in Holy of spiritual temple, able to enjoy spiritual light and food. (Pars. 45-48) Anointed ones, like Aaron’s sons, are priests. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:1:5-66:1:6" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Rev. 1:5, 6</a>; pars. 52, 61, 62) Because of being spirit-begotten, are in Holy and can enjoy spiritual enlightenment and food. (Par. 64) Upon death they pass beyond curtain-like barrier of flesh and enter very presence of God. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:10:19-58:10:22" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Heb. 10:19-22</a>) As with Christ, from heaven they will be sympathetic, understanding priests. (Pars. 73-76, 81) Surely is desirable rulership. You are not forced to submit to it; up to you if want to accept it.

(Pars. 12, 13, 20, 21) “Righteous” ones resurrected have advantage of already having displayed integrity, love for God. Will “unrighteous” put away bad habits?

(Par. 1) In parable Jesus committed talents to disciples. (Pars. 4-10) Talents represented potentiality for reaping disciples. (Pars. 12-15) By preaching and teaching they did business. (Pars. 20, 24, 26, 30, 35) As part of sign, can expect to see culminating fulfillment since 1914. (Pars. 37-40) Would be an inspection to see if slaves showed increase by use of talents. (Par. 45) Evidence among Witnesses is that members of anointed slave have increased talents, resulting in now over 1<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2 </sub>million Christians! (Pars. 52-56) Settling accounts would span some time. (Chap. 13, par. 3) After start of <em>parousia </em>has been time to reward anointed ones sleeping in death.

(Pars. 21-24) In line for execution in darkness of great tribulation. (Par. 29) Anointed slave determined to continue its hard work, increasing talents.

Many today believe no one will live forever; others feel all will be saved. Both views lead to outlook that one’s attitudes and acts are not important. Bible proves otherwise; are especially crucial since 1914. Witnesses have often shown that fulfillment of “sign” of Christ’s presence proves Kingdom set up in heaven then. Parable of sheep and goats, a part of “sign,” proves attitudes and acts now can affect whether one qualifies for eternal life. (Read verses as you discuss them.)</p>

(Pars. 5-8) Is no basis for claim of ignorance as to whom anointed represent. (Pars. 11-13) Where do we fit in? How about our family and relatives? Of what course regarding them does this emphasize need? Is not a matter of no concern because of being long way off; “goats” <em>soon </em>to be destroyed at end of this system.

<p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="sb"><em>We can be uplifted by the “sign” that New Order is near! </em>(Chap. 16; 30 min.) Problems and worries of today leave most persons troubled, insecure about future. Vastly different with Christians who understand meaning of Jesus’ “sign” regarding our time. (Read appropriate verses in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:1-40:24:51" data-bid="58-1" class="b">Matthew 24</a> as you discuss them.) Apostles were interested in future in view of Jesus’ comments. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:19:41-42:19:44" data-bid="59-1" class="b">Luke 19:41-44;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:9:26-58:9:26" data-bid="59-2" class="b"> Heb. 9:26</a>; pars. 3-7) When would end of Jewish system come? How would they know? Jesus outlined events leading up to destruction of Jerusalem. (Pars. 8-14) Was life-or-death matter to note the indication that destruction impended. (Pars. 15-17) When Romans encompassed Jerusalem, Christians knew end near. (Pars. 21, 22, 26) Larger future fulfillment expected, as <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:6:1-66:6:17" data-bid="60-1" class="b">Revelation chapter 6</a> (written after 70 C.E.) pointed forward to war, famine and pestilence. Applies to entire wicked system, dominated by Christendom. Have seen evidences of fulfillment of sign since 1914. (Pars. 28, 30-33) Though this means destruction impends, is cause of encouragement. Why? Note what will be destroyed. Led by Anglo-American Seventh World Power, nations look to UN for peace. Revelation shows that this peace organization will lead in desolating false religion. (Pars. 42-44) Those desiring God’s favor are urged to get out of false religion, just as Christians fled Jerusalem. (Par. 45) Coming destruction will begin with false religion and include rest of wicked system. (Pars. 52, 53) Encouragingly, some will survive. (Pars. 55-57) These will be ones discerning true Messiah and gathering there for spiritual nourishment. (Pars. 60, 63) They are not discouraged by disturbances in the physical heavens. (Pars. 70, 71) Will not be forced to acknowledge <em>parousia </em>when Jesus comes to destroy system, for they already have acknowledged his presence and that he has gathered his anointed ones. (Pars. 74, 76) They are sure all he promised will occur, and look forward to preservation. (Pars. 81-83) Have we fully joined with such ones? Time to decide now.</p>
<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="sb"><em>Jesus stressed need to be alert and active, as with the “faithful and discreet slave.” </em>(Chap. 17; 25 min.) Hard to believe that persons would ignore fulfillment of “sign,” but they do. As with people before Flood, most display lack of faith and ignore <em>parousia. </em>(Pars. 4-7) Need to keep on watch that we are alert and active when he comes as executioner. Ought to live each day as ones aware of the time. (Pars. 10-13) Lesson in being active and faithful during presence is found in “faithful and discreet slave.” Jesus directed words to entire body of disciples. (Pars. 14, 16) Slave class began with anointing of disciples in 33 C.E. when nation of spiritual Israel formed. (Pars. 20-23) Slave began to make spiritual food available. (Pars. 24-26) In modern times, anointed as a class have provided spiritual food. (Pars. 29, 30) Even despite difficult condition of World War I, slave class continued supplying food for individual domestics. (Par. 40) After “Master” received Kingdom power and turned attention to servants, he showed approval, assigning responsibility for his spiritual things on earth. Now even have responsibility of caring for “great crowd.” (Pars. 49-51, 54) Individual anointed ones turning bad become like the “evil slave,” rejected by Jesus. (Pars. 59-62, 65) Even if not of the “faithful and discreet slave” class, should see need to be faithful in Christian activities. Attention to such will aid us to avoid being ensnared.

Jehovah’s witnesses happy that many new ones regularly associate; shows commendable interest in true worship. How important is decisive action on your part? For Witnesses, how vital is it to reach still others (relatives, workmates, neighbors) with Christian message? First and Second Thessalonians give an answer; will discuss “man of lawlessness.” General outlook today is hope for peace among nations; Bible shows that time will come. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/52:5:1-52:5:3" data-bid="63-1" class="b">1 Thess. 5:1-3</a>; pars. 1-3) Some in Thessalonica thought Christ’s presence and “day of Jehovah” had come; Paul corrected them, explaining fulfillment was future.

(Pars. 27, 31, 34) This composite “man” set himself in opposition to God, demanded reverence. (Pars. 38-40, 42, 43) Apostles acted as a restraint to apostasy, which showed evidence of developing even while they were on earth.

Just as earthly Jerusalem was destroyed in 70 C.E., Christendom and rest of Babylon the Great will be destroyed, to be followed by rest of wicked system. (Pars. 67-69) Where do we stand?

<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="sb"><em>A millennium of peace and other blessings for those pursuing true worship now. </em>(Chap. 19; 20 min.) Maybe feel insecure; not sure if you will survive.

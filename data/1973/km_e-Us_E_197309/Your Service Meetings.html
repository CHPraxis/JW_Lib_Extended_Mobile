<p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="sn"><strong>30 min: </strong>How Clearly Do We See the Issue?</p>
<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="sb">At the outset briefly set forth what the issue of universal sovereignty is: In attacking God’s law, Satan called into question the rightfulness, righteousness and deservedness of God’s sovereignty. And the rebellion of Satan and the first humans raised yet another question: Would all other intelligent creatures ignore God’s law if that seemed to be to their advantage? When we see this issue clearly, we recognize disregard of God’s law as rebellion against him as Ruler. By rebelling against him a person sides with Satan. Does appreciation of these facts influence our daily conduct?​—“True Peace and Security,” pp. 52, 53.</p>
<p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="sb">Discuss the following questions with the audience, making sure that in each instance it is shown how the issue of sovereignty is involved and that what one does shows where he stands in relation to that issue. Encourage publishers to comment freely; read scriptures and bring in fine points from “True Peace and Security” book as time permits. (1) When would a husband’s actions toward his wife and family reveal that he needed to let recognition of the issue be a greater force in his life? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:5:28-49:5:31" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Eph. 5:28-31;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:6:4-49:6:4" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 6:4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:3:19-51:3:19" data-bid="8-3" class="b"> Col. 3:19,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:3:21-51:3:21" data-bid="8-4" class="b"> 21</a>; tp p. 168 ¶5; p. 175 ¶22; p. 139 ¶17) (2) How does a wife, even if her husband may be unreasonable or demanding, prove that she sees the issue clearly? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:5:22-49:5:24" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Eph. 5:22-24;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:3:1-60:3:6" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 1 Pet. 3:1-6</a>; tp pp. 140, 141; p. 176 ¶24) (3) What attitude and actions on the part of children toward their parents would show that they do appreciate the issue? Why? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:3:17-51:3:17" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Col. 3:17,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:3:20-51:3:20" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> 20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:15:2-45:15:3" data-bid="10-3" class="b"> Rom. 15:2, 3</a>; tp pp. 132, 133, 140, 141) (4) Since disregard for traffic laws (speed limits, parking, etc.) has become “acceptable” in the world, why would our seeing the issue clearly prevent us from imitating the world in this respect? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:2:2-49:2:3" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Eph. 2:2, 3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:5:19-62:5:19" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 1 John 5:19</a>; tp p. 137 ¶14) (5) Why would one’s littering and sharing in other similar acts reveal the need to consider more seriously one’s attitude toward the issue? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:7:12-40:7:12" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Matt. 7:12</a>; tp p. 169 ¶8 (6) How can real appreciation for the issue prevent one from being influenced by racial, social or national prejudice? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:17:26-44:17:26" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Acts 17:26;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:3:23-45:3:23" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> Rom. 3:23;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:2:1-59:2:9" data-bid="13-3" class="b"> Jas. 2:1-9</a>; tp p. 171 ¶12 to p. 172 ¶16) (7) What aspects about the settlement of the issue make it urgent that we zealously share in Kingdom-preaching and disciple-making? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:34-40:24:34" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Matt. 24:34;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/53:1:6-53:1:9" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> 2 Thess. 1:6-9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:3:9-61:3:9" data-bid="14-3" class="b"> 2 Pet. 3:9,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:3:15-61:3:15" data-bid="14-4" class="b"> 15</a>; tp pp. 173-175) In concluding, reemphasize the importance of seriously reflecting on our conduct and activity. Are we working hard to make advancement in living in ever fuller recognition of Jehovah’s sovereignty?​—tp p. 143 ¶25; p. 144 ¶26.</p>

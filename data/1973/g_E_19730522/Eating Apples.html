<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">● Two researchers at the Alexandria University in Egypt have supplied evidence that seems to support the old adage “An apple a day keeps the doctor away.” They report that pectin, which makes up .8 percent of apples, has antibacterial properties. In one experiment it took only fifteen minutes for a 1-percent concentration of pectin to kill 90 percent of bacteria that can upset the human digestive system and that are associated with diarrhea. However, one variety of bacteria sometimes associated with diarrhea defied the pectin​—in fact, ate it up!</p>

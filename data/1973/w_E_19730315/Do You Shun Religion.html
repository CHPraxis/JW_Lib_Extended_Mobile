<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sa">Many men think that religion is hypocritical. Some feel that it is a moneymaking business. And they have good reason for thinking so.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">But there is a religion that is not like that. Its people sincerely practice what it teaches about God and his Word. You probably believe there is a God. So why not investigate what Godâ€™s own Word teaches?</p>

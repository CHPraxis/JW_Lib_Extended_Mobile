Do You Shun Religion?
Many men think that religion is hypocritical. Some feel that it is a moneymaking business. And they have good reason for thinking so.
But there is a religion that is not like that. Its people sincerely practice what it teaches about God and his Word. You probably believe there is a God. So why not investigate what Godâ€™s own Word teaches?
The Watchtower is designed to help you to do this. Send only $1.50, and receive two issues a month for one year.

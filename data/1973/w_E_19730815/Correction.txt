Correction
In the May 15, 1973, issue of The Watchtower, on page 302, column 1, lines 12, 13, “indefinitely lasting covenant” should have read “commandment.” And the word “commandment” should have been used instead of “covenant” on page 307, paragraph 5, line 10; page 308, column 2, line 21, also paragraph 8, line 9; page 309, paragraph 9, lines 1 and 15, and in study question “a.” Why? Because what is stated at Genesis 9:4-6 is not a covenant, or an agreement, but is simply a commandment given by God to man.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">In the <a class="xt" data-xtid="1" href="jwpub://p/E:1973363/8:273-11:1058">May 15, 1973, issue of <em>The Watchtower, </em>on page 302</a>, column 1, lines 12, 13, “indefinitely lasting covenant” should have read “commandment.” And the word “commandment” should have been used instead of “covenant” on page 307, paragraph 5, line 10; page 308, column 2, line 21, also paragraph 8, line 9; page 309, paragraph 9, lines 1 and 15, and in study question “a.” Why? Because what is stated at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:9:4-1:9:6" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Genesis 9:4-6</a> is not a covenant, or an agreement, but is simply a commandment given by God to man.</p>

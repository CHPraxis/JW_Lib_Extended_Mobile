“Be Fruitful and Become Many”​—At What Rate?
● The expression “be fruitful and become many” was directed by the Creator to both animals and man. (Gen. 1:22, 28) It is common knowledge that as a rule nine months elapse between the conception and birth of a human. But how about others of earth’s creatures? Various authorities give the following time periods for the following kinds: bacteria, 20 minutes to several days; chickens, 21 days; mice, 20 to 21 days; ducks, 23 to 30 days; rabbits, 30 to 34 days; guinea pigs, 68 to 71 days; hogs, 114 days; sheep, 146 days; cows, 270 days; horses, 330 to 380 days; elephants, 607 to 641 days; whales, 330 to 550 days (depending upon the species).
Generally speaking the larger the kind, the longer its period of gestation.

Even Enemies
● The saying, ‘Those who seem to deserve love least, need it most,’ is not unlike Jesus’ admonition to Christians: “Continue to love your enemies and to pray for those persecuting you; that you may prove yourselves sons of your Father who is in the heavens, since he makes his sun rise upon wicked people and good and makes it rain upon righteous people and unrighteous.”​—Matt. 5:44, 45.

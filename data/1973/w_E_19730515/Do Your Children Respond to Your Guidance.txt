Do Your Children Respond to Your Guidance?
No doubt you want your children to be kind and say “Thank you” when others do things for them. You probably teach them to stay out of fights and tell the truth always. But do they listen?
The book Listening to the Great Teacher can help you to achieve these aims. Its stories cultivate in children a desire to be good because God wants them to be. This valuable 192-page, hardbound book is yours for only 25c.
Please send me Listening to the Great Teacher, for which I enclose 25c.

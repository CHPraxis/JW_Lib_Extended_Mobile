<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">● Have you met individuals who go through life disdaining counsel or caution because of believing that “experience is the best teacher”? The point has been made about such an outlook, that one big problem is that an individual sadly winds up learning a lot of things he really did not want to know. What an advantage it is, then, to have the Bible for one’s guidance. It represents more than the oldest accurate account of human experiences. It actually presents the loving guidance of a God interested in the happiness of humans.</p>

Desirable Tenants
✔ On November 24, 1971, a woman called the branch office of the Watch Tower Society in Wiesbaden, Germany, saying that she had bought an apartment house in Berlin and wanted to rent to Jehovah’s witnesses. Asked why she wanted to have Jehovah’s witnesses as tenants, she replied that a friend of hers in southern Germany was renting to them and had recommended that she do the same. She also commented about how difficult it was to get dependable tenants. Having been impressed by the conduct of Jehovah’s witnesses, she observed: “I know that these people are God-fearing, ready to help, and industrious, and I would be very happy if you would be of help to me in carrying out my plan.”

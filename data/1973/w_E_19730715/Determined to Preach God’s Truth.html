<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sa">As told by Beulah Prior</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">IN 1919, shortly after I was baptized, I came down with the Spanish flu. Along with the flu, I developed pneumonia. It almost got the better of me, but I just held on by Jehovah’s undeserved kindness. I felt that this was no time to die, because there was too much work to do. It was such a privilege to tell people about the truth of God’s Word​—so few knew it! My desire and determination to live and to preach about Jehovah and his kingdom were so strong that this must have helped me to overcome such a serious illness.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">From childhood I had been interested in the Bible. I was born in 1888 in Lowndes County, Alabama. Thanks to the efforts of my father, Bible reading was a routine practice in our home. When I was nine years of age and living in the city of Montgomery, my father began preaching in the Methodist church. I joined the church at that youthful age. When I was sixteen years old, I was made a teacher in the Sunday School; two years later, I was made superintendent of the Sunday School.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">As I learned all about the teachings of the Methodist Church, I began to question many of the things the church taught and practiced. It was very important to me to prove that what I was supporting was right according to the Bible. So I spent much time searching the Scriptures. The result? I could not find any support in the Bible for so many things our church taught.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="ss"><strong>I LEARN GOD’S TRUTH</strong></p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">One day, while I was away teaching in a Methodist high school, a traveling minister of the International Bible Students, as Jehovah’s witnesses were then known, called on my parents. My mother readily took the literature for me. My fiancé’s mother, who lived a few blocks away, also obtained a set of the books, the first three volumes of <em>Studies in the Scriptures. </em>My fiancé, who was home on vacation that summer from college, read some of the books. Little did we know the tremendous impact those publications would have on our lives!</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">During the summer of 1911, my fiancé would come by to visit. Our conversation would often turn to things he was reading in the books. As a result, I began reading my own copies with great anticipation. We quickly discovered we had a zeal for God but not a great deal of accurate knowledge.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:10:2-45:10:3" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Rom. 10:2, 3</a>.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">After we learned of God’s purpose to restore the earth to paradisaic conditions, we could not keep the good news to ourselves. Both of us began talking about it to others. When the Watch Tower Society’s president, C. T. Russell, visited Montgomery in 1914 to present the Photo-Drama of Creation, the story of the Bible with slides and motion pictures, we were more convinced than ever that this was indeed the truth!</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb"><span id="page444" class="pageNum" data-no="444" data-before-text="444"></span>Thereafter I began reading the publications of the Watch Tower Society with more interest than before and increasingly talked about them to others. By June 1915 we were married and had quit the Methodist Church.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">The next year we moved to Fort Wayne, Indiana. Through an advertisement of the Bible Students, which we found on our porch, we located their meeting place and began associating with them. This was our first time ever for studying with a group of Jehovah’s people. We had no idea that such an arrangement existed anywhere in the world. How happy we were to associate with others of like treasured faith! The Bible Students in Fort Wayne were somewhat surprised to see us at first, because no colored people in that area had shown an interest in God’s truth. We were treated very kindly during our stay there in Fort Wayne.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">When things improved economically in the South, we went back to Montgomery. The community branded my husband and me as “educated fools” because we had both graduated from college (my husband as a veterinarian and I as a teacher) and yet we followed what some called this “new religion.” But such ridicule did not deter us from sticking to God’s truth.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="ss"><strong>UPHOLDING THE BIBLE AS A TEACHER</strong></p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">In 1918 times were very hard. To assist in supporting the family (we now had two children), I got a job teaching in a Lutheran school that was hiring teachers of any religion. Many of the teachers, however, promised to become Lutherans eventually in order to get the job. But I made my position known from the start. I said: “I am not going to join your church.”</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">At first I taught the primary class, which included the daily routine of teaching the children the Lutheran catechism. As we went over it, I would let them know that it was not what I believed nor what the Bible teaches. Some of the children wanted to ask questions, and I encouraged them to come up during recess or after school and I would answer their questions. Many enjoyable lunch hours were spent in this manner.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">That same year a traveling representative of the Watch Tower Society, W. E. Walton, visited our group. He delivered a lecture on “Consecration,” or dedication, as it is now called. That Sunday a fine crowd came to hear his wonderful talk. The next Monday I was baptized, already aware that I had dedicated my life to Jehovah God. I knew that I was worshiping the Most High God, so upon learning that baptism was the next step to take, I did not hesitate to take it.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:28:19-40:28:20" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matt. 28:19, 20</a>.</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">It was not long before my interest in the Bible was made known to the superintendent of the school where I worked. Others on the teaching staff feared that I might be promoted, so they made known the fact that I had been baptized as an International Bible Student. Soon the superintendent approached me and brought up the subject. I explained that I was not joining his church and that I was dedicated to Jehovah God. “Anyhow,” he said, “I like your work and your frankness.” He asked me to take over the eighth grade, and I was promoted.</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">The older students also had many questions about my faith, and during recess <span id="page445" class="pageNum" data-no="445" data-before-text="445"></span>and after-school discussions, I answered their questions and helped them to learn something about the Bible. These discussions caused some of the parents to become interested, and I made many calls at the homes of the children to give a further witness to the Bible’s truth.</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">It was during this time that I was out a month with the Spanish flu. While I was recovering, the pastor of the Lutheran mission visited our home and told me that if I would just stop “talking the Bible,” I would have all things my way in his organization. I told him: “As long as I have breath, I won’t stop talking about the truth in God’s Word the Bible.”</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">As a result of that conversation, I knew I had better look for other employment. It was not long before I heard of the need for a teacher in Opelika, Alabama. I applied and got the job.</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="ss"><strong>SERVING IN YPSILANTI, MICHIGAN</strong></p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">In 1924 we moved to Ypsilanti, Michigan, where my husband’s parents lived. While my husband went to Ypsilanti to get things arranged for us, I stayed with my parents in Youngstown, Ohio. Over the years my father had always been bitterly opposed to God’s truth. After twenty years of opposition, he finally began to see the light of Bible truth. The Watch Tower Society’s book <em>Enemies </em>seemed to open his eyes to the great issue facing all mankind. To see my father come to the truth was one of the most thrilling things that happened to me. My mother, who could not read, never did make a dedication to Jehovah, but she was always delighted to hear about the truth. In 1948, my father died, faithful to Jehovah.</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">Finally, things were ready in Ypsilanti, and we went to meet my husband there. The need for proclaimers of Bible truth was indeed great in this small college town. From 1924 until now Jehovah has kindly permitted me to be used in his service in this area. Here Brother Pettibone took the lead in the meetings and was a pillar of spiritual strength. With his death, apostasy set in. For a time we were able to gather a few others in our home and keep the flickering flame of truth burning in this locality.</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">The falling away affected most of those that were attending meetings. My husband was even affected, and he left me and the four girls. Around 1932 the meetings in Ypsilanti, even the one that was held in our home, seemed to cool down. Activity seemed to be dead.</p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">About that time I was stricken by a severe nerve condition. Despite this, I determined to continue witnessing even in my hospital bed! The results? Many marvelous experiences were enjoyed by my bedside, teaching people about Jehovah and his kingdom.</p>
<p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb">Four months later I was sent to my parents’ home in Youngstown to recuperate. After a short stay, I went to be with Witness relatives in Homestead, Pennsylvania. Soon, both physical and spiritual strength began to return to me as I attended meetings in Pittsburgh. We moved to Aliquippa, Pennsylvania, where the joyous gathering work was going full speed. All around us there were increases in the number of praisers of Jehovah.</p>
<p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb">Finally, my physical and spiritual strength renewed, I was ready to return to Ypsilanti. What a disappointment! Nothing had changed! The Kingdom work was at a standstill. I wrote the Watch Tower Society about the condition of things in Ypsilanti. The answer came in the form of a special representative, Zone Servant Clayton Ball. He brought the sound car, phonographs and literature I had requested. Ever since that time, Jehovah <span id="page446" class="pageNum" data-no="446" data-before-text="446"></span>has continued to supply spiritual assistance to keep the Kingdom-preaching going in this town.</p>
<p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sb">In time I was able to arrange for a group of colored Witnesses to come out and assist in preaching in this area. A school was rented and the public talk was well advertised and attended. After the colored Witness gave the talk, it was well known that all races are represented and welcomed to Jehovah’s true worship. As a result of the talk, much interest was evident among the colored people in the area. Soon, many Bible studies were begun with former opposers of the truth.</p>
<p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="ss"><strong>DETERMINED TO DO FULL-TIME PREACHING</strong></p>
<p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="sb">I wanted desperately to enter the full-time preaching work. But I still had one girl in school and could not see how I was going to do it. I took the problem to Jehovah in prayer. Soon came the idea of renting out rooms in my house. But I did not have enough rooms to rent out to earn support for me and my daughter. Then another idea came to me: Enlarge the house! But how? I had no money, but I went to a local lumberman and laid my plans before him. Immediately, he accepted the idea and pledged his assistance. In addition to that, he trusted me for the price of the lumber. I enlarged the house, and in 1944 entered the full-time preaching work. The house has been a blessing in other ways as well as a means of support. Through the years, Jehovah has allowed many persons to come to a knowledge of the truth while rooming in that house. I am convinced that this is another marvelous example of Jehovah’s motivating his people with his holy spirit.</p>
<p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="sb">During all those years, in view of our limited means, my Christian brothers and sisters lovingly gave me and the children assistance in attending conventions. Gradually, the renting of the rooms provided enough income for me and my daughter to go to all the assemblies. We never missed one after that! There have been times recently, however, when I had to get permission to go from a hospital to attend an assembly in a wheelchair, but I was determined to be there and I was!</p>
<p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="sb">When I began the full-time preaching work in 1944, I was blessed with my first car, a 1934 Dodge. An old farmer had owned it, and two Witnesses repaired it for me. To help pay for it and keep gas in it, I sold junk and paper to the local scrap dealer. Jehovah, in his kindness, made opportunity for me to praise his great Name even more!​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:96:1-19:96:3" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ps. 96:1-3</a>.</p>
<p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="sb">By Jehovah’s kindness, I not only was able to attend the assemblies in the United States, but also had the blessing of making a trip to Europe in 1951, attending the London and Paris assemblies. In 1955 I was able to return to Europe to visit all the cities in which assemblies were being held. They were wonderful blessings.</p>
<p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="sb">The full-time preaching work has indeed been a privilege in which to share all these years. In this town, where quite a few people come and go, Jehovah has permitted me to help many persons to get a knowledge of God’s truth before they moved on. Today these Christian brothers and sisters are scattered all over this country from coast to coast. During the years, I have had so many marvelous experiences that I cannot begin to recount them. Despite the pain of arthritis, I manage to continue in the full-time preaching work. With a crutch and a cane I have been privileged to assist in dispensing these wonderful truths to others.</p>
<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="sb">In 1965 my house burned down while I was out in the preaching work. Even that did not stop me from staying in the full-time preaching work. All I ever wanted was somewhere to rest at night, enough <span id="page447" class="pageNum" data-no="447" data-before-text="447"></span>food to keep alive to serve Jehovah, and a way to get to the people with God’s message of truth.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:4:4-40:4:4" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Matt. 4:4</a>.</p>
<p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="sb">Recently I was again confined to bed because of an accident. But I was able to carry on several Bible studies by means of the telephone. What had happened? The car slipped out of gear somehow and rolled backward over my legs. Despite this accident I held my study and then went to the hospital to be examined. Not a bone was broken! But I had to stay in the hospital six weeks. The doctor who treated me was amazed and called it a “miracle.”</p>
<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="sb">Now, in the waning strength of my years, I continue to preach and laud the great name of Jehovah! At eighty-four years of age I remain determined to be faithful to the most wonderful and loving Employer in the universe, Jehovah. Yes, the full-time preaching work has indeed been a most wonderful and rewarding career! I pray to continue faithful to the end.</p>

Instinct Guides Birds​—What Guides Man?
Instinctively, arctic terns may migrate 22,000 miles before returning home. But, “as regards earthling man, how can he discern his way?”​—Prov. 20:24.
The Creator of the tern has given the Bible to man to guide his course. You can understand it with the help of The Watchtower. Send only $1.50 for a year’s subscription.

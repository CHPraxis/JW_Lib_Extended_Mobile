Ancient Therapy
Dr. Salvatore P. Lucia writes in Wine as Food and Medicine: “The therapeutic use of wine in acute respiratory infections dates back to the ancients. In modern times it has proven effective in the treatment of bronchitis . . . and other allied affections of the lungs. Warm wine is prescribed during the period of chilling in influenza and in other respiratory infections. A glass of wine taken at bedtime will often forestall a cold by acting as a sudorific [causing sweat].”

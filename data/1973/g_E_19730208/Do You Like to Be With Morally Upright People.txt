Do You Like to Be With Morally Upright People?
All around the world, in 208 lands, there is a society of morally upright persons. A regular study of the Bible, using the Watchtower magazine as an aid, has helped to strengthen them morally. You are invited to attend this weekly study at the Kingdom Hall in your vicinity.
You can also subscribe for The Watchtower for one year. Send just $1.50. You will receive 24 issues, a copy every two weeks.
Please send me by mail a one-year subscription for The Watchtower, for which I enclose $1.50. I am also to receive as a free gift the three booklets God’s Way Is Love, “This Good News of the Kingdom” and Divine Rulership​—the Only Hope of All Mankind.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">All around the world, in 208 lands, there is a society of morally upright persons. A regular study of the Bible, using the <em>Watchtower </em>magazine as an aid, has helped to strengthen them morally. You are invited to attend this weekly study at the Kingdom Hall in your vicinity.</p>

<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Please send me by mail a one-year subscription for <em>The Watchtower, </em>for which I enclose $1.50.

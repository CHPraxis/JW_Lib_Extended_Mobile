<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">PROBABLY most of your friends and associates would claim to have a religion or religious views. But what does their religion amount to? Under inspiration the apostle Paul said concerning our day that many would have ‘a form of godly devotion but prove false to its power.’​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:5-55:3:5" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Tim. 3:5</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">In the book <em>The Person in Psychology, </em>Gordon W. Allport commented: “For many people, religion is a dull habit, or a tribal investment to be used for ceremony, for family convenience, or for personal comfort. It is something to <em>use </em>but not to <em>live. </em>It may be used to improve one’s status, to bolster one’s self-confidence. It may be used as a defense against reality, and as a divine sanction for one’s own formula for living. Such a sentiment assures me that God sees things my way. In theological terms, the extrinsically religious person turns to God, but does not turn away from self. This type of religion is a shield for self-centeredness.”​—Page 131.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">In contrast, those in the first century who became followers of Jesus were spoken of as belonging to “The Way.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:19:9-44:19:9" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Acts 19:9,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:19:23-44:19:23" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 23</a>) They adhered to a way or manner of life that centered around faith in God and Christ. If you are interested in knowing how religion can be for you a satisfying way of life that pleases God, Jehovah’s witnesses would be most happy to assist you.</p>

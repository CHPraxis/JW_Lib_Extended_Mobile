Cold Cubs?
● When the temperature in the Arctic is in the range of -60° F., how can a polar bear keep her newborn cubs warm? With instinctive wisdom she delivers and suckles her cubs in a den burrowed in the snow, which does a fine job as an insulator. In the den the cubs, born deaf, blind and helpless, are protected from the freezing temperatures and fierce winds of the Arctic winter.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"><strong>● Should users of tobacco and those addicted to drugs, or those taking “substitute” drugs (like those on the “methadone program”), be allowed to share with us in the field ministry?</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">All kinds of people today, as in the first century, are coming to a knowledge of the truth and are making drastic changes in their lives. This they are doing out of love for Jehovah and in order to become baptized members of the Christian congregation. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:6:9-46:6:11" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Cor. 6:9-11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:3:9-51:3:9" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Col. 3:9</a>) To help these people to make the necessary changes, we encourage them to attend the meetings at the Kingdom Hall as well as the congregation book study. We also urge them to talk to their friends and relatives about the good things they are learning.

In some cases their going along to a home Bible study or on a return visit might cause no problem, whereas going from door to door might require greater caution to avoid a wrong impression.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">However, such a one would certainly not be encouraged to go from house to house on his own or to represent himself at the homes as one of Jehovah’s witnesses. Neither would a field service report be accepted from such a one.</p>

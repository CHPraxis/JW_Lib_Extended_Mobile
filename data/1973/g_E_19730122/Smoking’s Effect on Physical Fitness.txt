Smoking’s Effect on Physical Fitness
Medical authorities are now generally agreed that smoking adversely affects physical fitness. Geriatrics 1971, published by Medical World News, says: The lung function of chronic cigarette smokers is, on the average, reduced to levels of nonsmokers who are approximately ten years older.”
However, some persons may say, ‘I have smoked too long. It will do no good to stop now.’ But the above-quoted article explains: “When an individual stops smoking, his lung function may, in 12 to 18 months, return nearly to the levels of nonsmokers; this applies even in 60-year-old subjects. Clearly, recuperative processes are still active in older people.”
Do you want improved fitness, and perhaps additional years of life? If you smoke, there is something you can do. Stop smoking! It is really worth the effort.

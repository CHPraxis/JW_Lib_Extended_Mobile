The Invitation Remains
◆ Back in 1716 Johann Scheuchzer published a natural science report on the Swiss Alps, which cover some 80,000 square miles and contain hundreds of peaks that tower more than 10,000 feet above sea level. He posed a question “as to whether the mountains as we see them before us now, were created by God in the creative period, or at what time they originated.” He believed that the Biblical flood had a considerable effect on the Alps and their present shape.
He also called attention to the fact that in the rocks of the high Alps one can find remains of seashells and other crustaceans pressed right into the stone formations. Then he offered the interesting challenge:
“Come here you who despise the Holy Scriptures, you who hold the record of the flood in the Book of Moses to be a simple fable; come and learn right here, you atheists and disbelievers, the dumb rocks will preach to you, the hard walls themselves will soften you, if it is possible to bend you at all.”
The interesting invitation is still valid.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">● A survey in the United States showed that many middle-class citizens, though able to afford good food, have fallen into very poor eating habits. On the basis of the recommended amounts of calories, proteins and fifteen other nutrients needed to maintain good health, the survey showed that, between 1955 and 1965, the number of Americans with good diets fell from 60 to 50 percent. Also, the number on poor diets (ones that supply less than two thirds of the recommended amount in one or more categories) increased from 15 to 21 percent.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Medical authorities are now generally agreed that smoking adversely affects physical fitness. <em>Geriatrics 1971, </em>published by Medical World News, says: The lung function of chronic cigarette smokers is, on the average, reduced to levels of nonsmokers who are approximately ten years older.”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">However, some persons may say, ‘I have smoked too long. It will do no good to stop now.’ But the above-quoted article explains: “When an individual stops smoking, his lung function may, in 12 to 18 months, return nearly to the levels of nonsmokers; this applies even in 60-year-old subjects. Clearly, recuperative processes are still active in older people.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Do you want improved fitness, and perhaps additional years of life? If you smoke, there is something you can do. Stop smoking! It is really worth the effort.</p>

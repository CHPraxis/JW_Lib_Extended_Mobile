<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">The key to protecting children against drugs is to teach them Bible principles.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">One thirteen-year-old said: “The kids nowadays have nothing to believe in, like me, I had nothing to believe in. I lived to get ‘high.’”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">But this youth changed. Bible instruction helped!</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The book <strong>Listening to the Great Teacher, </strong>based on the teachings of Jesus Christ, can help you to protect your children against drugs. Read with them the chapter “Tempted by the Devil.” This hard-covered, illustrated book of 192 pages is yours for only 25c.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Please send me <em>Listening to the Great Teacher, </em>for which I enclose 25c.</p>

● How are expiration slips that are sent to a congregation to be handled?
An expiration slip is sent to the congregation two months after the expiration date if the subscription is not renewed. Many fine experiences have resulted from following up such calls promptly. When these slips are received, it is requested that the Bible study overseer distribute them. If it is known that some former subscribers are presently being called on regularly by certain publishers, it would be logical to give the slip to them. Otherwise, the slips may be distributed to any publishers who can be depended on to make the calls and follow through on interest found. Some congregations find it best simply to distribute the slips to the book study conductors.
If publishers are unable to make contact on these calls for some reason, it would be good to return these to the Bible study overseer or the book study conductor, so he can give them to others who may be able to call at a different time. If repeated efforts to contact the person are unsuccessful, letters can be written by publishers whose health or circumstances limit their share in the house-to-house ministry. When the circuit overseer visits, he can be given any slips, currently on hand, but they should not be allowed to accumulate for this purpose.
Occasionally the congregation may receive a slip with an address not in its territory. If that territory is held by a nearby congregation, the slip may be sent there. If not, please return it to the Society.
Slips regarding “undeliverable” magazines are often sent out. If you can obtain the information needed to assure future delivery of the magazines, please note this on the slip and return it to the Society.
From time to time it would be good for overseers to ask all the publishers to check their notebooks and bookbags carefully for any slips they may have neglected to follow up.

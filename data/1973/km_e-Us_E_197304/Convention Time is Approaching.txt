2 Usually most brothers attend assemblies nearest their homes, and facilities are planned accordingly. But to avoid overcrowding the facilities we were able to obtain, we are recommending that, as much as possible, brothers in the following circuits and areas attend the assemblies as shown below:
Los Angeles, Calif. (June 27–July 1): Ariz. circuits 1, 3; Calif. 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 17, 31; N. Mex. 1-B; Utah 1.
Los Angeles, Calif. (July 18-22): Ariz. circuit 2; Calif. 1, 3, 6, 16, 20, 21, 24, 25, 28, 30.
Pittsburgh, Pa. (July 4-8): N.Y. circuits 7, 8, 9, 13.
Winnipeg, Man. (July 4-8): Metropolitan Minneapolis and St. Paul, northern Minnesota and other northern states near Winnipeg.
Atlanta, Ga. (July 25-29): Fla. circuit 3.
3 As there will be two assemblies in Los Angeles, it is requested that the respective circuits attend each assembly as shown. Also, the facilities in Toronto are not as large as those in Pittsburgh. Hence, although the New York circuits listed for Pittsburgh are closer to Toronto, it would be far better for them to attend the assembly at Pittsburgh, where there will be plenty of room. The branch office in Canada informs us that the assembly facilities in Halifax are quite limited but that publishers in the northeastern United States who want to go to Montreal can be accommodated.
4 Due to new regulations affecting use of Yankee Stadium in New York, the program there will not begin until 6 p.m. on Friday, and that opening session will close at 9 p.m. On Saturday the program will begin at 9 a.m., and on the following days at 10 a.m. On the last four days of the assembly it will conclude at about 6 p.m., a little later than in other cities, so that nothing will be missed as a result of readjusting the first day’s program. The public talk will be on Sunday (followed by a Bible drama), even though the New York assembly extends through Tuesday. In other cities, the program each day will usually run from 9:55 a.m. to 1 p.m. and then from 2:55 to 5:30 p.m.
5 The Society will be sending a supply of room request forms to each congregation. Please fill out the form very carefully and mail it, NOT to the Society, but directly to the address of the rooming headquarters shown thereon. Do this no earlier than six or seven weeks before the assembly of your choice.

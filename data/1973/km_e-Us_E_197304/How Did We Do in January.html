<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Our report reflects a fine upward trend in zealous activity. From December’s 421,895 publishers we increased in January to 430,695! And both magazines and total hours showed an increase of well over half a million from January of 1971. It was especially good to see that publishers averaged 9.9 hours, and regular pioneers 100.6 hours, and that home Bible studies increased 15,000 from December. Very fine indeed! It certainly is commendable that so many saw the need to exert themselves vigorously in publicly making known Jehovah’s name and kingdom.</p>

<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sn"><strong>20 min: </strong>Have Regard for Those Working Hard. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/52:5:12-52:5:13" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Thess. 5:12, 13</a>) Group composed of ministerial servants and publishers discuss ways they can assist elders who have “plenty to do.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:15:58-46:15:58" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Cor. 15:58</a>) Can help best by being obedient and submissive. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:13:17-58:13:17" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Heb. 13:17</a>), We can avoid being critical when things are not always arranged as we personally might prefer. Be willing to overlook their shortcomings; they are imperfect as we are. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:3:13-51:3:13" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Col. 3:13</a>) Respond to their counsel; do not attempt to justify yourselves or raise issues over in minor things. Do not burden them unnecessarily with matters that must be decided by our own conscience; each one ‘must carry his own load.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:6:5-48:6:5" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Gal. 6:5</a>) Husbands and fathers especially need to shoulder their responsibility to make decisions involving the family, not shirking their obligations of headship. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:5:23-49:5:23" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Eph. 5:23</a>) Volunteering to assist in performing various tasks related to congregation activity is always appreciated. Their anxiety about the congregation is considerably lessened when they know they can depend on us to care faithfully for any assignment given to us. We can take the initiative ourselves to encourage and assist those needing spiritual upbuilding; this reinforces their efforts to “support the weak.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/52:5:14-52:5:14" data-bid="8-1" class="b">1 Thess. 5:14</a>) We can help a great deal by turning in reports promptly and checking to be sure they are accurate. Because these brothers unselfishly give their “own souls” in our behalf, we ‘reckon them worthy of double honor.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/52:2:7-52:2:8" data-bid="9-1" class="b">1 Thess. 2:7, 8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:5:17-54:5:17" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 1 Tim. 5:17</a>) Appreciation should prompt us to cooperate fully and to keep “holding men of that sort dear.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:2:29-50:2:29" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Phil. 2:29</a>) Additionally, discuss ways that each one can assist in any other matters currently affecting your congregation.</p>

<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sn"><strong>15 min: </strong>Are You Reporting All Your Activity? Field overseer explains how trend toward a decline in reported activity may be due in part to incomplete, inaccurate or late reports. Let the congregation know what problems have been encountered locally in this regard. Invite audience to offer comments and suggestions on what can be done to ensure complete, accurate reports. Questions that can be considered: How are reports helpful to the Society and the congregation? How can we keep an accurate record during the month? (Do not rely on your memory; make notation after each period of service. May use field service report slip; keep in your Bible or briefcase. Parents can remind children. Overseers can remind all to report at meetings toward end of each month. Be sure to include time spent witnessing informally.) What should you do if you forget to turn in your report? (Turn in the complete report next month; it will be included in the congregation’s report and noted on your card. Prompt reporting, however, is much to be preferred.) What method of reporting have you found works well for you? (Invite someone in audience to offer suggestions on what he has found to be practical ways to record and report his activity.) Although it may seem to be a small matter, this is another one of the ways we prove ourselves to be faithful.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:16:10-42:16:10" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Luke 16:10</a>.</p>

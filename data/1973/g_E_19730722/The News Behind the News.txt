The News Behind the News
Forecasting world events today is hazardous business, even when based upon sober analysis of power politics, global strategy and the present and prospective balances of forces. Nevertheless, events can be foreseen and world happenings understood.
Awake! magazine gives you the news behind the news. Not only does it show what is happening, but it correctly explains the significance of world happenings. And of special value, Awake! shows what you and your family can do to benefit yourselves.

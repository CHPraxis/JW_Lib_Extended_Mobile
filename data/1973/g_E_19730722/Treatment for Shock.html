<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">â—† Persons seriously burned can die from shock. Lost body fluids need to be replaced at once. One method that doctors have used is to give burn victims blood transfusions. But in Peru scientists have experimented with an alternative treatment. In a three-and-a-half-year study, half of those badly burned were given a blood transfusion; the other half received a solution of salt and baking soda. This proved to be as effective as blood in combating shock. No toxic effects were observed, whereas blood transfusions have proved dangerous. The alternative treatment consists of a teaspoon of salt and one-half teaspoon of baking soda dissolved in one quart of water, the patient being encouraged to drink it as often as possible. The ease with which this solution can be prepared in the home is a key factor in saving life.</p>

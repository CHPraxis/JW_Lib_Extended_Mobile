<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">● How would you respond if you were walking down the street and a roving newspaper reporter stopped you and asked, “What was the happiest moment in your life?”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">That was the question posed to people on the street by a reporter of <em>The Mirror, </em>a newspaper published for the suburbs of Toronto, Canada. The reply of one man was, “When I learned to ski last year was my happiest moment. A lady answered, “I live for the moment. . . . There is certainly no one outstanding event that could be called the happiest.” An elderly man answered, “My happiest moment was at my granddaughter’s wedding. . . . And it was our 47th wedding anniversary.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">However, among the replies printed in the paper, the very first one was that of a man who had been studying the Bible with a minister of Jehovah’s witnesses. In response to the question, “What was the happiest moment in your life?” he said: “My happiest moment was when I started to study the Bible with Jehovah’s witnesses.” Why? Because, as he explained, he hoped to study, in turn, with others about Christ Jesus and his kingdom​—the means by which the world of mankind could gain total peace.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">If you would like to have the lasting and well-founded happiness that comes from a regular study of God’s Word, express your interest in this to the witnesses of Jehovah in your area. Or write to the publishers of this magazine so that arrangements to that end can be made.</p>

Special handbills showing this lecture only, may be ordered now. If your circuit assembly falls on that weekend, the special talk may be scheduled for the next week, and if other circumstances arise, the body of elders can make adjustments.</p>

The body of elders can decide what adjustments in the schedule of other meetings for the week would be best locally. Memorial invitations may be ordered in lots of 250 at 25c, 500 at 50c, or 1,000 at $1.00. Exact payment should accompany each order.</p>

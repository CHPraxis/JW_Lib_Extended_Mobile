Our Field Service Report
There were 427,289 who demonstrated their love for Jehovah by sharing in the field ministry during October. And, of these, it is fine to see, 11,256 arranged their affairs to be temporary pioneers.
Just as we will be doing in January, so in October we were featuring subscriptions. How did we do? Subscriptions took an upswing to 174,156. Magazine placements averaged 14 for publishers, 106.9 for regular pioneers and 163 for special pioneers. Will we do that well again in January? Letâ€™s try, because it is an excellent way to give a good witness.
Something else that needs special attention is our making of return visits. Do you have some share regularly each week in making return visits? And do you seize every opportunity to explain to people about our free home Bible study arrangement? It would be a fine thing for all of us to do that.
Jehovah is blessing our efforts to make disciples. During October, another 2,424 were immersed.

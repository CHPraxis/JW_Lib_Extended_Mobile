<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sa">Do you know for sure? Would you like to know?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Because <strong>The Watchtower </strong>follows and explains the unerring book of prophecy, the Holy Bible, it is under safe guidance. So, what it says about the future can be read with confidence. Send only $1.50, and receive two issues a month for one year.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Please send me by mail for one year the <em>Watchtower </em>magazine, for which I enclose $1.50. For mailing the coupon I am to receive free three timely booklets on Bible themes.</p>

Only One of These Statements Is True. Can You Prove Which One It Is?
“Know that Jehovah . . . made us, and not we ourselves.”​—Psalm 100:3 in “The Holy Bible.”
“The earth and its inhabitants were not created, they evolved.”​—Evolutionist Julian Huxley.
Both statements cannot be true. Either God directly created man, as the Bible says; or man evolved. Do you know the evidence put forth to support each view? Read it in the book Did Man Get Here by Evolution or by Creation? Only 25c.
Please send me the 192-page hardbound book Did Man Get Here by Evolution or by Creation? for which I enclose 25c.

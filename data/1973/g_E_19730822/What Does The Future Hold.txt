What Does The Future Hold?
Do you know for sure? Would you like to know?
Because The Watchtower follows and explains the unerring book of prophecy, the Holy Bible, it is under safe guidance. So, what it says about the future can be read with confidence. Send only $1.50, and receive two issues a month for one year.
Please send me by mail for one year the Watchtower magazine, for which I enclose $1.50. For mailing the coupon I am to receive free three timely booklets on Bible themes.

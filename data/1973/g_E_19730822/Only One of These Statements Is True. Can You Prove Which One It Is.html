<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sa">“Know that Jehovah . . . made us, and not we ourselves.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:100:3-19:100:3" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 100:3</a> in “The Holy Bible.”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sa">“The earth and its inhabitants were not created, they evolved.”​—Evolutionist Julian Huxley.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Both statements cannot be true. Either God directly created man, as the Bible says; or man evolved. Do you know the evidence put forth to support each view? Read it in the book <em>Did Man Get Here by Evolution or by Creation? </em>Only 25c.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Please send me the 192-page hardbound book <em>Did Man Get Here by Evolution or by Creation? </em>for which I enclose 25c.</p>

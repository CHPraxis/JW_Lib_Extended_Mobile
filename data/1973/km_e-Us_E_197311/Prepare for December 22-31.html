<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><em>Kingdom News </em>No. 17 will be distributed from December 22 to 31. Supplies are being consigned to all congregations. If you have territory that was not worked with <em>Kingdom News </em>No. 16, then plan to work that territory first when distributing No. 17. [If your congregation received more tracts last time than could be distributed in your territory, please inform us how many your congregation can use and we will consign that number of <em>Kingdom News </em>No. 17.]</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">If you have a Spanish section and <em>there is no Spanish congregation working it, </em>you may send in an order for <em>Kingdom News </em>No. 17 in Spanish and they will be sent to you. Specify how many you need. We are not in a position to supply <em>Kingdom News </em>in other languages. Send orders for Spanish tracts <em>now </em>and these will be shipped to you with your next shipment of literature.</p>

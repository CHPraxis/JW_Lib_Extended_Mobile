<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>It will soon be about six months since <em>The Watchtower </em>in English pointed out the need for decisive action in stopping use of tobacco by dedicated persons. If there are still any who use tobacco, it would be good for them to make stronger efforts to stop now. Speak to the elders for assistance. The elders, applying the counsel of the Scriptures, must determine who may remain in the congregation.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>Nonbaptized persons who use tobacco and simply attend meetings, without advocating the use of it or trying to involve the brothers in such practice, may be permitted to continue attending meetings, but they should not use tobacco at the Kingdom Hall. However, where individuals who are not baptized have associated in the sense of sharing in the field ministry and the Theocratic Ministry School, they should have been talked to by this time and if, within the same period of six months, they have not broken the habit, they should be told that they are not acceptable to share in the field service or the Theocratic Ministry School, if this has not already been done. They should be encouraged to inform the elders when they have completely ended tobacco use. But no further action will be taken, since they are not baptized. They may attend meetings. It would not be necessary to make a public announcement concerning these unbaptized persons.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>If a tobacco user was once baptized but left the organization a long time ago and does not now claim to be one of Jehovahâ€™s witnesses and his use of tobacco causes no reproach or disturbance in the congregation, it would not be necessary for the elders to search him out and inquire whether he is using tobacco or to take action against such a smoker who no longer associates.</p>

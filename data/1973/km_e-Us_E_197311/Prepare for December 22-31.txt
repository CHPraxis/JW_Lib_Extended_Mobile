Prepare for December 22-31
Kingdom News No. 17 will be distributed from December 22 to 31. Supplies are being consigned to all congregations. If you have territory that was not worked with Kingdom News No. 16, then plan to work that territory first when distributing No. 17. [If your congregation received more tracts last time than could be distributed in your territory, please inform us how many your congregation can use and we will consign that number of Kingdom News No. 17.]
If you have a Spanish section and there is no Spanish congregation working it, you may send in an order for Kingdom News No. 17 in Spanish and they will be sent to you. Specify how many you need. We are not in a position to supply Kingdom News in other languages. Send orders for Spanish tracts now and these will be shipped to you with your next shipment of literature.

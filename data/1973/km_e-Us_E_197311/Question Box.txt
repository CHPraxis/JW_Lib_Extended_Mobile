● Who may perform weddings and funerals?
Weddings and funerals may be conducted by any dedicated, baptized brother as permitted by law. If there are any restrictions or requirements according to the local law, these should be carefully observed. When it comes to the selection of someone to conduct a wedding or a funeral, this is a personal matter for the individuals or the family involved to determine. Since weddings and funerals are not viewed as public talks, appointment as an elder or ministerial servant is not a requirement for one to perform such services. If it is to be in the Kingdom Hall, then, of course, permission must be obtained from the congregation service committee. A dedicated brother from a different congregation could be allowed to give a wedding or funeral talk in another congregation’s Kingdom Hall with the approval of the committee and in accord with the local laws.
Dedicated couples in good standing in the congregation may be permitted by the committee to use the Kingdom Hall for a wedding. A dedicated person who plans to marry an undedicated person should be counseled concerning marrying “only in the Lord.” (1 Cor. 7:39) If the dedicated one goes through with the marriage, it is his responsibility. The committee may or may not decide to allow the use of the Hall, but, even if allowed, this does not mean that they approve of the marriage. Two undedicated persons may also be permitted to use the Kingdom Hall for a wedding if the committee gives permission, but such undedicated individuals should have a good reputation in the community. It is left to the conscience of the brother who is authorized by law to perform a marriage as to whether he would serve where undedicated individuals may be involved. All weddings and funerals performed in the Kingdom Hall should be dignified and should comply with the local laws. (See “Watchtower” 6/15/72, 1/15/69, 9/15/65 and 12/1/60.)

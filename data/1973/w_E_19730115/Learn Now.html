<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">● It was once observed that ‘people who expect salvation “at the eleventh hour” often die at 10:30.’ The Bible presents a fine contrasting example involving a jailer in the first century. The apostle Paul and his companion Silas were imprisoned, when, in the middle of the night, they were miraculously freed by an earthquake that opened all the doors and loosened their bonds. That same night, without delay, the jailer and his household listened to the “word of Jehovah” spoken by Paul, and the jailer “rejoiced greatly with all his household now that he had believed God.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:16:25-44:16:34" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Acts 16:25-34</a>) It is still the course of wisdom to act without delay in taking in such life-giving information.</p>

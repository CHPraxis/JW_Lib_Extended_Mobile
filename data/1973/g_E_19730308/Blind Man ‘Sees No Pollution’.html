<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">◆ A nineteen-year-old college student in the state of Washington has been enjoying a regular Bible study with Jehovah’s witnesses even though he has been blind from birth. The minister who conducts the Bible study invited the young man to a regional assembly of the Witnesses being held in the area. He attended for all three days. At the next Bible study he was asked how he enjoyed the convention. The blind youth responded: “I thought it was marvelous. And I received many joys from being there. I saw no pollution.” The minister responded: “Excuse me. But I realize you cannot see. What do you mean?”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The student commented: “I kicked no cans, stepped on no paper or cigarette butts. There was no smoke and I heard no foul language, which I encounter at the college I attend and the other organizational functions I have attended. Also, the people were kind, even the young children. I did not see any pushing or fighting among them. I especially appreciate these fine qualities, and I can see that these people live by what the Bible teaches.”</p>

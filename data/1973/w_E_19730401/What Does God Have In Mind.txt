What Does God Have In Mind?
Do you ever wonder? Will man be permitted to ruin the earth completely? Or will God intervene before this happens?
The Bible gives hope-inspiring answers to such questions, and Jehovah’s witnesses will be glad to help you to find them. A qualified Bible instructor will call at your home and conduct, free of charge, a one-hour-a-week Bible discussion, if that is your desire.
The textbook used along with the Bible in such discussions is The Truth That Leads to Eternal Life. Send just 25 cents, and a copy of this 192-page hardbound book will be mailed to you postpaid.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">That God’s kingdom will include, both in its administration and among its subjects, people of all races is made very clear in the Bible. <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:5:9-66:5:10" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Revelation 5:9, 10</a> says that with his own blood Christ bought “persons for God out of every tribe and tongue and people and nation,” and, under his direction, “they are to rule as kings.” Over whom will they rule? <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:7:9-66:7:9" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Revelation 7:9</a> answers: “a great crowd . . . out of all nations and tribes and peoples and tongues,” all of them worshipers of the true God.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"><strong>Protect Your Car:</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn">● Try not to park on dark or deserted streets.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn">● Take your keys out of the ignition and make sure the doors are locked when you leave your car.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn">● Lock any packages in the trunk or take them with you.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn"><strong>Protect Yourself from Pickpockets:</strong></p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sn">● Do not display large sums of money in public.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sn">● Men​—in large crowds it is best for you not to keep your wallet in a hip pocket, even if it is buttoned. If you are jostled while in a crowd, make sure your wallet is yet in place.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sn">● Women​—do not lay your handbag on a counter or floor or in a shopping cart while making purchases. Do not leave your purse on a seat in a public place of assembly. When carrying a load of packages, keep your purse next to your body.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sn">● Beware particularly of strangers who try to put their hands on you. Some may claim that they want to assist you in some way; others may describe their own ailments by touching your body. Such persons may be pickpockets cleverly trying to remove your money.</p>

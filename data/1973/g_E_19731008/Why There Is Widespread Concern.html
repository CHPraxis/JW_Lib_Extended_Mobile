<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">PEOPLE today feel increasingly puzzled, uneasy, as to the direction of world affairs. Doubtless in your own area you find people asking:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><strong>What does it all mean? Where are we going? What hope is there for genuine improvement? </strong>These questions trouble millions earth wide​—with good reason. For example:</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">● We live in a time of tremendous advances in science and technology. Yet for all the ‘giant leaps’ forward, mankind seems to be winding up worse off than before, slipping backward.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">● A shaky peace exists in the world, one that threatens to come apart at the seams.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">● More and more governments face a “crisis of confidence”; they seem uncertain as to how to cope with their problems.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">● Crime wages a ceaseless and ever more violent war against people in cities, towns and countryside.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">● Concern deepens as to the most basic things of life: food, fuel, housing, clothing. Shortages grow; prices soar.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">“It’s like living on a treadmill,” is the way one New England woman put it; “you can never catch up.” People find it increasingly hard to save for the future. Many wonder if it is even worth while, since money loses its value so rapidly.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Without hope and sure direction, life has no real meaning. It becomes an aimless wandering. Is there a stable, secure hope to which you can look, one that you can work toward with a sure sense of purpose and confidence? Is the world of mankind now moving toward such a hope?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">To find out, consider what follows. See where this world is heading and then see the reasons for firm belief that the biggest change the world has ever known is due to take place in the near future. Learn how that change can make life on earth satisfying and truly worth while for you.</p>

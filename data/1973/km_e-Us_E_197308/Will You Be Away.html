<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>Will you be away from home during August? Are you planning to attend the Kingdom Hall in the area where you will visit? You will no doubt find, as others have, that meeting with the brothers, attending the meetings with them and sharing in the service with them will be high points of your trip. And, of course, this will keep you strong spiritually.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>Be alert to share in the Kingdom service wherever possible. This can be done even when you are traveling. Carry a good supply of the <em>Great Teacher </em>book and copies of other twenty-five-cent publications. Take along new and older copies of the <em>Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>magazines. They can be left with relatives, friends and new acquaintances. One brother said that when he and his family travel, they offer new magazines for a contribution, or leave older copies of <em>The Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>at gas stations and restaurants where they stop. The family takes turns presenting them.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>If you will not be back home before the end of the month, please mail your field service report back to the field overseer so that your activity can be included with the congregationâ€™s report to the Society for August.</p>

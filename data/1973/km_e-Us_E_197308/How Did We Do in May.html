<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">May proved to be another outstanding month of field service in the 1973 service year. There were 446,730 of us who shared in the Kingdom service and over 9 <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2Â </sub>million copies of Bibles and Bible publications were left in the homes of the people. And, just think, in each piece of literature is information that can help people to gain life. Additionally, 3,084,180 return visits were made and 300,255 home Bible studies were conducted. How privileged we are to be able to honor Jehovah by sharing in Kingdom-preaching each month!</p>

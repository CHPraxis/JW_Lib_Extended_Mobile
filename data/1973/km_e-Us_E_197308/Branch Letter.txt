Branch Letter
Dear Kingdom Publishers:
Can you imagine the excitement and joy here at Bethel when international assembly time comes around? How many happy reunions there are with former associates! For visiting missionaries, stop at Bethel is a highlight of their trip. However, many of the 6,000 foreign delegates were seeing Bethel for the first time. Their enthusiasm impressed upon us the fine privilege we have in serving here at the headquarters of God’s grand earthly organization.
Our hearts were warmed by the spiritual appreciation that so many of these visitors from over 26 countries showed. An East German couple, who had fled to the West, needed new furniture. But they decided, “The old couch and armchair will do until Armageddon.” A chance to see Bethel was more valuable to them. All agreed that the organization here is far vaster than they had pictured. As one Colombian brother put it: “We are so glad to be here and see Bethel with our own eyes.”
Missionaries and branch workers have been visiting us from India, Chile, Panama, Kenya, the Philippines, Papua and many other lands. It was thrilling to hear firsthand reports about the work in their lands. For example, missionaries from Kenya told about conditions under the recent ban, but we know they will not be able to strengthen their brothers there any longer. They were given five days to leave. Many of these missionaries expressed heartfelt appreciation for your contributions that made it possible for them to visit their former homes.
Now, as many return from vacations and from attending one or more of these assemblies, there is good reason for all of us to feel invigorated to continue zealously in our work and to apply God’s Word in everything that we do, thus “recommending ourselves to every human conscience.”
Be assured of our warm love and our prayers on your behalf.
Your fellow servants,
BROOKLYN BRANCH OFFICE

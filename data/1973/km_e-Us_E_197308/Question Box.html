<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"><strong>● If field service reports are received after the congregation’s report has been sent to the Society, how should they be handled?</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">It would be very helpful if all reports could be turned in promptly at the end of each month. Some publishers keep a field service report in the back of their Bible or songbook or other convenient place. It is then on hand to make note of field service activity each time they have a share and it is also with them at the Kingdom Hall at the end of the month when the report should be turned in. Do what you can to turn your report in on time.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">But what if you forget or find it will be late? Please turn your report in anyway. The field overseer will record the activity on your Publisher’s Record card for the proper month​—the month during which you shared in the service. And he will include your activity in the congregation’s next report to the Society.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">If, for example, a publisher turns in a late report for his activity during July and then turns in his August report on time, all of his activity would be included in the congregation’s August report. Would this one be counted twice as a publisher in August? Yes, because he was not counted as a publisher in July. This will provide the Society with a complete report, and the averages at the end of the year will be correct.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Some elders have asked if there is any objection to personally approaching publishers, when this is necessary, reminding them to turn in their reports at the end of the month. Often when field overseers and book study conductors approach the brothers and remind them to turn in their reports at the end of the month, a complete report is available to send to the Society. And you can be sure that the brothers you remind will appreciate your help and interest in them.</p>

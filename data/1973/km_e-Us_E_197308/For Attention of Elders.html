<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">The body of elders will no doubt want to hold their September meeting early in the month. Listed below are some matters that will need attention. (See <em>Organization </em>book, pages 67-69, 72.)</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">1. Are there brothers who now qualify to be recommended as ministerial servants? If so, please use the S-2 form to make these recommendations.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">2. Are there ministerial servants who now qualify to be recommended as elders? (Unless a brother has moved into the congregation and was an appointed elder in the previous congregation, normally one would not be recommended as an elder now unless he has first served as a ministerial servant.)</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">3. Are there any elders or ministerial servants not measuring up to the Scriptural qualifications who should be recommended for removal? Are there any who have moved or died and whose names have not yet been deleted? If so, please provide this information on the S-2 form under “Deletions.”</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">4. The normal rotation system is outlined on page 67 of the <em>Organization </em>book. If some elders are not able to care for the responsibility that would be theirs according to the regular pattern of rotation, the body of elders will decide what will be best under the circumstances, still recognizing the rotation arrangement.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">5. When the body of elders has determined who will be the new presiding overseer, who will serve as field overseer, Bible study overseer, etc., announcement can then be made to the congregation. When the announcement is made to the congregation the brothers can then begin caring for their new responsibilities. However, if the body of elders has in mind using a brother who is newly being recommended to the governing body for appointment as an elder, they should wait until such appointment is received before making any definite assignment. (The congregation will not receive a letter from the Society appointing brothers to serve in various positions of oversight. Rather, the present presiding overseer, using the S-10 form, will inform the Society which brothers will be serving on the committee. The Society will send a letter covering only new appointments of elders and ministerial servants and also deletions.)</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">6. If it seems beneficial to shift any book study conductors from one study group to another, this can be considered. Local circumstances should be taken into consideration in determining whether this will be advisable or not.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">7. Review the various assignments of the ministerial servants and make whatever adjustments, if any, may seem advisable.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">8. The present presiding overseer should prepare his report on the congregation for the branch office. This should be read to the elders at their meeting in September. Then it should be typed or printed on the S-10 form and sent to the Society. A copy should be retained for the congregation files.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Brothers who are now serving in various capacities will kindly aid the brothers who will soon be taking over these responsibilities. A smooth transition of oversight will benefit all in the congregation. We look to Jehovah to bless the arrangements for the coming year to his glory and honor.</p>

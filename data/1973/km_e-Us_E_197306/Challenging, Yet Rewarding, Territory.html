<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>Some have asked for more details in connection with working business territory. We are pleased to offer some suggestions, which we hope will help you to meet the great challenge that is represented in the vast amount of in worked business territory in some areas.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>To get business territory worked on an organized basis, it is recommended that the city overseer, with the cooperation of the presiding overseers and circuit overseers (for these areas), make up a list of names of pioneers and publishers who want to work business territory and who likely would be successful therein. We all appreciate that, as pointed out at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:12:5-46:12:5" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 12:5</a>, “There are varieties of ministries.” Some, because of background and experience, would be more effective than others in this “ministry.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>In preparation for this activity a special meeting may be arranged with all those selected to work business territory. A few weeks prior to this meeting it would be advantageous to have several qualified brothers and sisters work in the main business district, giving preference to some of the larger office buildings. A review of the March 1971 and May 1973 issues of <em>Kingdom Ministry </em>will aid them. In New York city some of the circuit overseers and a district overseer spent several days working a sampling of business territory, concentrating mainly on the large office buildings. Periodically, they exchanged ideas on approaches that proved effective, made notes of problems encountered and how these were handled, as well as experiences they had. This experience proved valuable in connection with a meeting to launch this program.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>For the special meeting to set this program in motion, a program could be worked up under the direction of the city overseer. Those who initially worked business territory can relate experiences, realistically feature demonstrations, discuss ways of approaching business and professional people that met with success and talking points that appealed to persons in this type of territory. Thereafter, any questions that the publishers and pioneers have can be handled.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>Prior to this meeting the various congregations that hold business territory not being worked will, through their field overseers, have worked up territory maps for the business territory, making them available after this meeting, and these territories can be checked out before the brothers leave the meeting. Thereafter, an arrangement can be worked out locally so that territories can be systematically and appropriately checked in and out. It is hoped that this territory will be worked at least once a year.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup>We might add that the experiences of the brothers here in New York city have shown generally that it is not advisable to try to talk to everyone in an office or to every individual in a certain building. In any cases it is best to ask for particular individuals where their names appear listed in directories in the lobby, on individual floors or on the doors leading to their offices. Sometimes, one might find it necessary to ask for the office manager. If referred to a person in charge, it is proper that he be approached with the message. In a tactful, straightforward way explain what you are doing. Then offer the subscription or other <span id="page4" class="pageNum" data-no="4" data-before-text="4"></span>literature, depending upon the circumstances, time available and other factors. In large firms it may be possible to get permission to talk to other officials or key men. It is good to have your identification card available should it be needed.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><sup>7 </sup>Much literature has been placed already here in New York city by those working business territory. For example, one brother working several hours placed 80 magazines and 20 books in that short period of time. Those who have been contacting the business people find that they are generally courteous, and usually our brothers are well received. Since these people are knowledgeable, good discussions often result. Where persons are very busy at first, but suggest that an appointment be made (or the publisher may ask for one), it is recommended that you arrange for a later visit. This has been done with good results. Also, return visits have already been made on interested ones and some studies have been started.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb"><sup>8 </sup>By setting things in motion in the above-mentioned manner, such a program will assure that the challenge of the business territory will be met. If this work cannot be started before the assemblies this summer, then city overseers can organize this activity right after the assembly.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb"><sup>9 </sup>In addition to downtown business areas, there are outlying business sections that need to be covered, and even in small towns there are business places that are sometimes left unworked by publishers. All publishers can work in small towns covering the business sections.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb"><sup>10 </sup>It is Jehovah’s will that all sorts of men should be saved and come to an accurate knowledge of truth. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:2:4-54:2:4" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Tim. 2:4</a>) Surely we want to provide as extensive a witness as is possible everywhere before the “great tribulation” strikes.</p>

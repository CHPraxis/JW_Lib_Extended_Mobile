<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sh">Dear Kingdom Publishers:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">It is thrilling to see the news that has been coming in to Brooklyn from all parts of the earth in recent weeks. Reports from the branches indicate one new peak of publishers after another! We counted such peaks for at least fifty-three lands, along with ours, in March!</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">New publisher peaks were reached in Austria, Belgium, Bolivia, British Isles, Canada, Colombia, Greece, Haiti, Ireland, Israel, Korea, Mexico, Nicaragua, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland. Finland had its third peak for the service year. Germany exceeded 91,000 publishers (91,068). Italy had an 18.1-percent increase over last year’s average; the Netherlands, with their fifth peak of the year, reached 11.4 percent; Spain, 19 percent, with 18,722 publishers. Other examples are Ivory Coast, 18 percent; Korea, 16.2 percent, and Puerto Rico, 14 percent. Japan, with a 24-percent increase, reported 16,274! publishers, and their 68th month of consecutive publisher peaks As the end draws near, Jehovah is indeed ‘speeding up’ the increase!​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:60:22-23:60:22" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Isa. 60:22</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Along with these peaks in number of publishers, many of these lands averaged 11 hours or more. Italy averaged 13.6, and Peru, 16.1 hours. Love for Jehovah should move all of us to exert ourselves, whole-souled in his service.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">The work is not slowing down. It is on the increase in ever so many lands.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">The “Divine Victory” International Assemblies will soon begin. They should do much to strengthen all of us for what lies ahead in the grand work that God has given us to do. We hear that 480 missionaries plan to attend assemblies in the U.S. Also large delegations plan to come to assemblies here from England, Germany, France, the Netherlands and Scandinavian countries. We have a blessed spiritual feast ahead of us. Don’t miss any of it!</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">We send you our warm love.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sj">Your brothers,</p>

Question Box
● Are there any circumstances under which ministerial servants may be used to give public talks outside their own congregation?
It is the elders upon whom the Scriptures place the responsibility to do “speaking and teaching” In the congregations. (1 Tim. 5:17; 3:2) Wherever possible, they should give the public talks. If there are not enough elders available, even with an exchanging of speakers between congregations, the body of elders may assign certain ministerial servants to give public talks (or, possibly, to handle part of a symposium) in their home congregation.
Under normal circumstances, only elders would be assigned to give public talks in congregations other than their own. But if there simply are not enough elders available in the area, then, in order to keep the public meetings going on a regular basis, ministerial servants may be requested from nearby congregations to give public talks. If a request is received by the presiding overseer for the services of ministerial servants and the local body of elders feels that they will handle the assignment well, they may be assigned to speak in that other congregation. However, unless ministerial servants are specifically requested as speakers, only elders should be sent out to other congregations to speak.
Where it is not possible to arrange for public speakers at all on certain weeks, then it is suggested that the material in the extensive outlines provided by the Society be read to the congregation and they can look up and discuss the scriptures together. (Do not order handbills for such presentations.) In this way, whether public speakers are available or not, all will receive the spiritual food provided by means of the public meeting program.

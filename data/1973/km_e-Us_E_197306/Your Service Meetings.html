<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn"><strong>20 min: </strong>Displaying Genuine Love for One Another at Christian Assemblies.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn">Chairman: Brief introduction to material should include some comments on displaying genuine love and Christian hospitality toward one another at assemblies this summer. What we do, how we act, can be a powerful influence for good or can cause disappointment, even stumbling some. After very brief introductory comments proceed to ask the following questions, letting brothers look up scriptures, commenting on them and applying them to our conduct at Christian assemblies. (1) What do Christian assemblies provide for us in these momentous days? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:1:11-45:1:12" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Rom. 1:11, 12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:10:24-58:10:25" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Heb. 10:24, 25</a>) (2) What quality primarily should we display if we are to be identified as Christ’s disciples? Why do you so answer? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:13:34-43:13:35" data-bid="2-1" class="b">John 13:34, 35</a>)’ (3) How do Bible principles show that we should conduct ourselves with respect to waiting in line for food or for releases at a literature counter? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:10:24-46:10:24" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Cor. 10:24;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:15:12-43:15:13" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> John 15:12, 13</a>) (4) When it comes to seat saving, what Bible principles should guide our outlook and decisions? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:13:1-58:13:2" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Heb. 13:1, 2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:2:4-50:2:4" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Phil. 2:4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:13:4-46:13:5" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> 1 Cor. 13:4, 5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:3:13-51:3:13" data-bid="4-4" class="b"> Col. 3:13</a>) (5) What would we do if newly interested ones came to our house to learn about the Bible and the entire family was seated, occupying all the chairs at the table? Would we just tell them that they would have to stand, or would some of us help them to be seated? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:12:10-45:12:10" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Rom. 12:10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:4:9-60:4:9" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 1 Pet. 4:9</a>) (6). How can we aid elderly people to enjoy assemblies? How can children make the assembly more enjoyable for their parents? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:19:32-3:19:32" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Lev. 19:32;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:20:12-2:20:12" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> Ex. 20:12</a>) (7) Why is setting a good example at assemblies of great value to fellow believers, new ones and worldly observers? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:2:12-60:2:12" data-bid="7-1" class="b">1 Pet. 2:12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:6:3-47:6:4" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 2 Cor. 6:3, 4</a>)</p>

Are We Missing Any Opportunities?
1 Are we missing any opportunities to do what? To start Bible studies! As we work our territory more often, there is a need to exercise even greater discernment in speaking with those we meet. No matter in what feature of the field ministry we may be engaged, it is good to be ready to adapt our presentation so as to start a study then and there.
2 When one sister observed that a householder was showing more than the usual interest in the good news, she adjusted her presentation and explained our free Bible study program. The householder was surprised and asked, “Do you mean I get another chance?” She then explained that someone had called on her several years earlier and she had refused to study at that time because she was pregnant. This time the study was started.
3 When a householder already has our literature, has friends or relatives who are Jehovah’s witnesses, and as a result has some interest in our work, often a study can be started on the first call. In fact, if the person has one of other publications, why not simply suggest he locate it and then show him how easily he can learn about Jehovah and his purposes. Arrangements can be made to call back later and continue the discussion. You may decide whether it would be best to mention “our Bible study program” at that time or to wait until the study is under way.
4 One publisher met a man who had relatives who were becoming interested in our work and, after getting acquainted with the situation, the publisher answered a few questions and started a study in the Truth book, which the man had obtained it already. It was not necessary to offer any literature, only the Bible study.
5 Whether in magazine work, using the regular offer in house-to-house work, or witnessing on the street, seize every opportunity to start a study immediately.

Victory over Alcohol
● An experience related on June 30, 1973, at the Los Angeles “Divine Victory” International Assembly was about a man in the Dominican Republic who was the town drunk. When he received his paycheck he went out for several days and drank it up. Since he was a good schoolteacher, he was not fired, but his classes were canceled until he sobered up. One of Jehovah’s witnesses started a Bible study with him. As he made progress in Bible knowledge, the man quit drinking and smoking. The change was so great that people would stop him on the street and ask what had happened. He told them that the only ones who were able to help him were Jehovah’s Christian witnesses. His victory over alcohol abuse has given him occasion to speak to many persons about God’s truth and its power to transform lives.

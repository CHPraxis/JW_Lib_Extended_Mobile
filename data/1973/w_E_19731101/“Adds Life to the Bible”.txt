“Adds Life to the Bible”
Aid to Bible Understanding is a 1,700-page alphabetical reference work. Under its more than 4,000 subject headings its publishers have endeavored to discuss every person, place, plant, river and animal mentioned in the Bible. Also covered are notable events and the record of God’s dealings with man.
One reader wrote: “The book adds life to the Bible that was always there but not so readily understandable as it is with this new publication.”

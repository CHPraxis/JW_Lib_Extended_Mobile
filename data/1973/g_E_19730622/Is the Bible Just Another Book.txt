Is the Bible Just Another Book?
Or is it really the Word of God?
Did you know that the Bible is one of the oldest books? That it is distributed in more languages than any other book? And that it is the all-time best seller? For these reasons alone, the Bible is worthy of examination.
The 192-page book Is the Bible Really the Word of God? examines the Bibleâ€™s claim of divine authorship. Get your copy; only 25c.
Please send me the hardbound book Is the Bible Really the Word of God? for which I enclose 25c.

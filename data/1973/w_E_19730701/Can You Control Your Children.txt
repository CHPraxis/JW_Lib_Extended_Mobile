Can You Control Your Children?
Disobedience to parents is rampant today, even among those who claim to be Christians. Do you care about your children?
If so, Bible principles can help you to rear them in a godly way. Read together chapter 20, “Building a Happy Family Life,” in the book The Truth That Leads to Eternal Life. Order your copy; only 25c.
Please send me the 192-page hardbound book The Truth That Leads to Eternal Life, for which I enclose 25c.

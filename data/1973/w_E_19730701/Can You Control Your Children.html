<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Disobedience to parents is rampant today, even among those who claim to be Christians. Do you care about your children?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">If so, Bible principles can help you to rear them in a godly way. Read together chapter 20, “Building a Happy Family Life,” in the book <strong>The Truth That Leads to Eternal Life. </strong>Order your copy; only 25c.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Please send me the 192-page hardbound book <em>The Truth That Leads to Eternal Life, </em>for which I enclose 25c.</p>

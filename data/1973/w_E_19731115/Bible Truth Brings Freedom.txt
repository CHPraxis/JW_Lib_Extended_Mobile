Bible Truth Brings Freedom
A missionary serving in West Africa relates: “I called on a woman who, though formerly opposed to our work, had now agreed to study the Bible. But the study was not held regularly and so I wondered if it would continue. However, when we considered the subject of spiritism, I saw that she was taking the study seriously. That week she threw out all objects related to spiritism except one.
“At our next study she brought this object to me, asking if it would be all right for her to look inside before destroying it. The item had been given to her by a ‘medicine man’ to ensure pregnancy, as she had wanted to have a baby but could not. In the middle of a large tray covered with sand sat a little upside down clay pot. Gingerly she upended the pot. Seeing nothing, she dug around the tray with a pair of scissors​—again nothing! She was furious at having been fooled by the ‘medicine man.’ Rising immediately, she heaved the whole thing out the window.”
Yes, the ‘truth sets one free’ from false belief as this woman, now a baptized Witness, can well testify.​—John 8:32.

Patient Endurance Bears Fruitage
● In La Réunion, an island in the Indian Ocean, an elderly witness of Jehovah over a period of ten years tried to share Bible truth with her daughter and son-in-law. Eventually the son-in-law got so irritated about his mother-in-law’s ‘preaching her religion’ that one day he said in answer to her knock: “Come in, but leave your Jehovah outside.” He began to talk so insultingly about true worship that his mother-in-law began to cry. With tears streaming down her cheeks, she told him that he could at least come to a meeting of Jehovah’s witnesses and see for himself. The man was so touched by his mother-in-law’s tears that he said: “All right, dry your eyes. I’ll come if you stop crying.” And he did come. In fact, he enjoyed the meeting so much that he kept on coming. Now both he and his wife are baptized witnesses of Jehovah.

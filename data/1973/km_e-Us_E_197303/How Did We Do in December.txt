How Did We Do in December?
There were 6,785,762 magazines placed in December, resulting in an increase in the average placed by publishers, from 11.6 a year ago to 12.4. In December we were featuring the Bible and the “Word of God” book. A total of 717,499 Bibles and books was placed. What fine witness was given by distributing all this literature! And with all these placements, think of the opportunities you have for return visits and offering to study the Bible with interested ones.
There were 9,388 more publishers this December than last December which is good to see. But the hours were somewhat less; this continues to need our attention.

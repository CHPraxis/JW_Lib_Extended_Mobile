1973 International Assembly
The number of brothers interested in attending the conventions in Honolulu, Hawaii, and San Juan, Puerto Rico, in September and October has been overwhelming. The Society has arranged for additional charter flights, and the majority who applied have been accommodated. But these flights are now filled, and no more planes will be chartered. The reason is that our assembly locations in Honolulu and San Juan will be more than filled. We feel that it would not be fair to the local brothers to bring so many delegates from abroad that the local publishers could not get seats at their own assemblies. We suggest that any who are making their own travel arrangements plan go to international assemblies in other places that will be less crowded.

<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sn"><strong>16 min: </strong>Making a Personal Examination. (To be handled by or in cooperation with field overseer.) All publishers invited to reflect back over the past year to see what has been personally accomplished in the field ministry as the activity of the congregation for the past year is briefly considered. Nationally there have been fewer hours devoted to the field ministry during the past service year in comparison to the previous year, even with more publishers sharing, in the preaching work. And hours continue to be slightly lower for this service year. Why?</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">Could it be that some of us have had a little difficulty doing our best without goals being stressed or special efforts being made to help us to get out in field service and to report each month? Now that there is less checking of records to see who have not reported and what we are doing in preaching, we are put more on our own, are we not? It puts us to the test as to what we will do without someone urging us regularly to share in the field service.</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">As we individually think about what we have been able to do during the past year, likely some fine blessings will be recalled. Our own hours may not have dropped off but may actually have increased. We may now have a Bible study. These are causes for rejoicing. But where we find room for improvement, we will want to put forth the effort needed to refine our schedules or show more love and zeal for Jehovah’s service. We may find that our hours have decreased without real cause and perhaps, if a study was discontinued, added effort could enable us to replace it with another one. Or, if we have never conducted study, it may be possible to start one now as we continue without letup, looking to Jehovah to bless us.</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">It is good to examine our own activity from time to time and draw our own conclusions about what has been accomplished and what might be improved. In coming months, will it be possible to spend more time in the field service? You may find that you can be a temporary pioneer during April. Each one can make his own analysis without making comparisons with another.</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">The field overseer can begin preparing for this part several weeks in advance. (Your congregation may be doing fine, and new ones coming in. If so, this discussion can be adjusted in harmony with local circumstances.) The Publisher’s Record cards should be posted through February. The congregation can be told that the field overseer will be at a particular location in the Kingdom Hall after the meeting and if anyone wishes to see his Publisher’s Record card, he may do so. This may be helpful to some in reflecting on what has been accomplished and what might be done to improve their personal ministry. (If the congregation is large, he may need assistance in distributing the cards and collecting them again.)</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">Good work is being done and the publishers should be encouraged, but as we finish up the preaching of this good news and the gathering of the remaining ones of the Lord’s “sheep,” we do not want to slow down. Wherever we can, we want to speed up the witness, because the time is short.</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sn"><strong>16 min: </strong>Concluding comments. Discuss the prospects of having new ones we have been studying with to join us in the field service during April. They will particularly enjoy placing the special magazines in April. Help them to see their responsibility to share in Kingdom-preaching as they otherwise progress toward dedication and baptism. Remind publishers to turn in field service reports. Song 52.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">In view of the earthquake in Managua and the subsequent evacuation of most of the city, there will not be an international assembly there in 1973, as was earlier planned. But arrangements are being made for an assembly for Central America nearby in San Salvador, capital of El Salvador, from December 18 to 23. If you are scheduled to be on one of the Society’ tours to this area, in due time the Society’s Travel Desk will write to you about changes in travel arrangements.</p>

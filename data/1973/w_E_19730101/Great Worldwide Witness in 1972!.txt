Great Worldwide Witness in 1972!
1, 2. How extensively, and under whose direction, is the work of Jehovah’s witnesses being carried on?
NO QUESTION about it, the work of Jehovah’s witnesses today is under the supervision of the glorified Lord Jesus Christ. Otherwise, it would be impossible for them to accomplish so much year after year, often in the face of great opposition. This work is being done just as Jesus said it would be.​—Matt. 24:14.
2 You will find it very interesting to study over the figures from each country in the accompanying chart. The chart shows that the ninety-five branches of the Watch Tower Society received reports from 208 countries and islands of the sea in which the Witnesses have been busy preaching, including eleven countries where their good work is outlawed by anti-God rulers.
 3. What was the all-time peak in publishers reached during 1972, and during the same year, how many symbolized their dedication by water baptism?
3 Jehovah’s people certainly have had “plenty to do in the work of the Lord,” and the results show that it has not been in vain. (1 Cor. 15:58) They had a new peak in Kingdom publishers, a total of 1,658,990. So, Jehovah’s witnesses have been helping thousands to see the need of taking their stand for God’s kingdom and their privilege of preaching the good news about that established heavenly government to still others. Were you one who enjoyed this privilege and so was numbered among this great chorus of praisers of Jehovah? If you were, then you probably shared in helping some of the 163,123 lovers of righteousness who dedicated their lives to do Jehovah’s will and who were baptized during the past twelve months. This is truly remarkable, to have so many in a single year baptized as evidence that they are following closely the steps of the Model Jesus Christ.
 4. How much time was spent by the Witnesses in preaching and teaching the good news?
4 Now look at what all those getting a firm hold on the “real life” as Christian ministers were able to do with Jehovah’s help during the past service year. (1 Tim. 6:12, 19) Indeed, they have been very busy spreading knowledge of the “word of life.” (Phil. 2:16) They spent 291,894,945 hours in that joyful work​—going from house to house, making return visits, conducting home Bible studies, and so forth—​distributing Bibles, books, magazines and other literature.
 5. What do the figures show is the real objective in leaving literature with the people?
5 Upon finding interested persons, these witnesses of Jehovah made 135,898,447 return visits and conducted 1,269,277 home Bible studies, often with whole families benefiting from a study. Generally, these studies are conducted weekly with the same people for about six months and then new studies are started. So probably the number of persons studied with during the year is well over two and a half million. All of this shows that the Christian witnesses of Jehovah are not an idle or lazy people. They feel the urgency of the times and diligently and energetically have gone forth to “make disciples of people of all the nations.”​—Matt. 28:19, 20.
 6. What is indicated by the great difference in the number of those attending the Memorial and those partaking of the emblems?
6 At their one annual celebration, the Memorial of Jesus Christ’s death, Jehovah’s witnesses had a total attendance of 3,662,407 persons world wide. This celebration was held on the evening of March 29, 1972, after sundown. Of this great number, only 10,350 professed to be anointed followers of Jesus Christ, who hope to be associated with him in heavenly glory. (Luke 12:32; 22:19, 20; Rom. 8:16, 17; Rev. 14:1-4; 20:6) This is less than three tenths of one percent of those in attendance. The vast majority of those in attendance at the Lord’s Evening Meal this past year, therefore, are looking forward with delight to joyous eternal life on earth in God’s promised new order after the end of this wicked system of things in the “great tribulation” just ahead.​—Matt. 24:3, 20-22; 2 Pet. 3:13.
 7. To what extent was the message of God’s kingdom in printed form distributed throughout the world last year?
7 The publishers of God’s kingdom had a very fine year in placing literature in the hands of the people, making it possible for them to read and study God’s holy Word the Bible at their own leisure. During the past twelve months Jehovah’s witnesses placed 18,360,561 bound books and 9,747,270 booklets. They obtained 1,696,260 new subscriptions for The Watchtower and Awake!, and in addition distributed 217,109,764 individual copies of these excellent journals in their ministry.
 8. What do the figures show regarding the various privileges of the full-time preaching service?
8 Many Kingdom proclaimers are in the full-time preaching work. During the past year 13,995 were in the special pioneer work and missionary service throughout the world, and 78,031 served as regular and temporary pioneers with the congregations world wide. This is not as many as the previous year, but it is hoped that during the 1973 service year many will prayerfully consider their circumstances and find it possible to enter and enjoy either the regular or temporary pioneer service. If they do, we will surpass the many hours devoted to the preaching work in 1971, when an all-time peak was reached. Though we were down 57,430 hours this year, as compared with 1971, we certainly had many more people in the preaching work and a higher number of persons baptized.
9, 10. (a) To what extent has Jehovah blessed this preaching work in the past few years? (b) Hence, what question presents itself, with what rather obvious answer?
9 From this brief summary of the 1972 service report we can see that Jehovah’s witnesses earth wide are certainly enjoying the rich blessing of the God in whose name they have chosen to walk. (Mic. 4:5) Without a question he is prospering the happy work in which they are engaged to his praise. Just think of it! In the last five years 680,871 have dedicated their lives to do his supreme will!
10 Do you too want to get a firm hold on the real life, everlasting life on a paradise earth? Then do not delay in associating with these dedicated footstep followers of the Lord Jesus Christ. Then, together with them, you too can share in the worship and service of Jehovah God.

Magazine Supply
Each congregation should give careful attention to the ordering of magazines. It is good to order what you need. Quantities can be adjusted as the needs increase or decrease. It is good not to run out of magazines. At the same time, it is not good to have magazines accumulate, thus wasting paper.
When offering current magazines, it is appropriate to ask for the contribution. Our experience has proved that publications are viewed as of greater value by the individuals who contribute for them.

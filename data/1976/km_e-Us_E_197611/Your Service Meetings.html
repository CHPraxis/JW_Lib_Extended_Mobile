Discuss need for Christian parents to appreciate responsibility to train children. Worldly parents often sidestep such responsibility by shifting it to teachers, school counselors, older relatives, etc. Not so with Christian parents. Children an inheritance from Jehovah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:127:3-19:127:5" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ps. 127:3-5</a>) How do you handle an inheritance from the Sovereign of the universe? Sincere Christians would handle such wisely, with extreme care. So children should be handled in this way. Parents themselves have responsibility to train children. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:6:6-5:6:7" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Deut. 6:6, 7</a>) How?</p>

<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sn"><strong>12 min: </strong>Song 95. Local announcements and Theocratic News. Then cover following: We live in special period of human history. Chapter of man’s life on earth while trying to be independent of God about to end. New chapter under righteous Kingdom rule about to begin. What are we to do? We face difficult times now and in future. Yet Jesus showed we should not be discouraged but should take heart. Deliverance is near. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:21:25-42:21:28" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Luke 21:25-28</a>) In the meantime we have work to do—preaching of Kingdom in all the earth and making disciples. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:28:19-40:28:20" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Matt. 28:19, 20</a>) Work still continues and has success. If people are to hear God’s voice, important we continue this work.</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sn"><strong>15 min: </strong>Youths—Are You Communicating? (Discussion and demonstration by young publishers who are good examples in field service.)</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">(3 min.) See there is need for all to share in preaching and teaching work if sheeplike people are to hear “voice” of Fine Shepherd. Young people need to hear, too, and our young publishers are in an excellent position to help them. How? By good communication. Young people usually know which youths are Jehovah’s Witnesses because the Witnesses communicate. New <em>Youth </em>book provides excellent material to use in talking to other young people. Could you read a chapter and then discuss it with others, explaining some of the main points and/or Scripture texts, without using the book? This is a fine thing to do. Note this young publisher:</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">(4 min.) Young publisher at school approached by new student at school. New student offers some marijuana or pills. Young publisher politely turns down offer. New student very surprised, as nearly everyone uses drugs of some form. Third student listening to conversation inquires about young publisher’s view on drugs. As new student walks away, young publisher proceeds to explain feelings to the inquiring third student and shows why he or she is not interested in drugs of any kind, covering main points in chapter on drugs in <em>Youth </em>book.</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">(4 min.) Demonstrate another young publisher speaking to schoolmate about points he has learned from <em>Youth </em>book. Pick a chapter that would have application in local area and have young publisher cover main points and scriptures in simple way.</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">(4 min.) Chairman briefly interviews two young publishers in demonstrations: Could ask these or similar questions: Do you find the <em>Youth </em>book is easy to understand? What helps you to remember the points well? Do you find the book helpful in talking to other young people? Do you find that other youths are interested in getting a copy of the <em>Youth </em>book for themselves? Conclude by showing that young publishers have a great advantage in speaking to other young people. Encourage them to use this advantage well as they talk about fine things they read in new <em>Youth </em>book.</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sn"><strong>20 min: </strong>Hearing the Voice of God and the Voice of Jesus. (Audience discussion using the Bible) In times past Jehovah’s voice has been audibly heard by humans. (Three occasions: [1] Jesus’ baptism. [<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:1:11-41:1:11" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Mark 1:11</a>] [2] Jesus’ transfiguration. [<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:9:7-41:9:7" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Mark 9:7</a>] [3] 33 C.E. shortly before Jesus’ last Passover. [<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:12:28-43:12:29" data-bid="7-1" class="b">John 12:28, 29</a>]) People today can also hear God’s voice. How? Does not require Jehovah to speak in a literal, audible voice. People can hear God’s voice by recognizing and paying attention with obedience to what God has caused to be written in His Word. “Voice” used as applying to “every utterance coming forth through Jehovah’s mouth.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:4:4-40:4:4" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Matt. 4:4</a>) Similar with voice of Jesus. Called himself the “fine shepherd” whose sheep “listen to his voice, . . . and the sheep follow him, because they know his voice.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:10:2-43:10:5" data-bid="9-1" class="b">John 10:2-5,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:10:11-43:10:11" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 11</a>) Christ’s “sheep” “know” his voice in that they recognize and acknowledge as true what Jesus said, as recorded in the Bible. They refuse to acknowledge the teaching of “strangers,” false shepherds. They obey his commands. How then will people today hear the voices of God and his Chief Shepherd? By hearing God’s commands and principles as set forth in the Scriptures. Who will tell them? Not the clergy! No, but only Jehovah’s Witnesses carry on work of preaching the good news of the Kingdom and teaching Bible truth in all the earth. Though Jesus Christ is not now speaking in person, people can ‘hear his voice’ through visible representatives, even as overseer Paul made appeal as substituting for Christ. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:5:20-47:5:20" data-bid="10-1" class="b">2 Cor. 5:20</a>) When Paul preached in Philippi people listened. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:16:14-44:16:14" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Acts 16:14</a>) How urgent that we carry on this same work today if people are going to hear God’s “voice”! We cannot ourselves judge if people are “sheep” or “goats.” Individuals not predestined for either class. All must hear, and we must continue to preach. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:10:14-45:10:14" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Rom. 10:14</a>) Are there still people in your territory willing to listen? Undoubtedly there are. Continue to preach the Word and let people hear the ‘voices’ of God and of Jesus. Then they can make a decision and in time show whether they are “sheep” who will gain life, or “goats” to be judged by Jesus as worthy of destruction. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:25:31-40:25:46" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Matt. 25:31-46</a>) All of us, whether young or old, can rejoice to share in this unique vocal work.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:11:29-40:11:30" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Matt. 11:29, 30</a>.</p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sn"><strong>13 min: </strong>Interview several young publishers who have had good success in placing the <em>Youth </em>book, either at school with youths or teachers, or in field, or by informal witnessing. Find out what they do and have them relate their experiences. Encourage all to use <em>Youth </em>book and call back to see if home Bible studies can be started with young persons in territory.

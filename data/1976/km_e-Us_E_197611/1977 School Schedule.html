<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>The Theocratic School Schedule for 1977 is being sent with this issue of <em>Our Kingdom Service. </em>This schedule should prove to be especially helpful to all those who enrolled in recent years. Note that the <em>School Guidebook </em>will furnish the Instruction Talk material throughout the year. Thus all will become more familiar with the <em>School Guidebook. </em>The Theocratic School has two objectives: (1) To improve our ability to present Bible truth, and (2) to make us more familiar with God’s Word, its doctrines and principles.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>The student talks will feature <em>Sermon Outlines, </em>the <em>Youth </em>book and the <em>Good News </em>book. By our going through these two books received at our district assemblies, all will personally profit thereby, as well as be helped in offering these books to others. Presiding overseers should check to see that the congregation has sufficient <em>Sermon Outlines </em>on hand, and if not, should order these at once.</p>

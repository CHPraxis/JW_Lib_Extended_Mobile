New Study Program
1 At our weekly congregation book study we are currently using the Manâ€™s Salvation book. It appears that most of the congregations will be able to complete their study of this book by the end of November. Therefore, beginning with December the Peace and Security book will be used for six months. After that it is planned that we will study the Holy Spirit book for the next six months.
2 So that there will be uniformity in the study of these books throughout the country, a schedule will appear each month in Our Kingdom Service beginning with December, listing the pages to be studied each week during that month. This will help to keep some from dragging out the lessons and others from hurrying through the material too fast. Also, this uniformity will be of aid when any brothers visit another congregation, as when on a vacation, for they will always know where the lesson is for any book study evening. This will also prove helpful to the presiding overseer as he may visit different book study groups as well as to the circuit overseer as he goes from one congregation to another.
3 If for any reason, such as assembly time or severe weather problems, a study is not held, the section scheduled for that week can be combined with the material scheduled for the following week. In such instances not all paragraphs have to be read, so that the study is completed within the hour.

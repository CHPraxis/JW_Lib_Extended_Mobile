Orders for the <em>Yearbook </em>in the following languages may be placed after the dates listed. December 1 — English. December 20 — French, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese, Spanish. January 20 — Dutch, German, Korean. <em>Yearbooks </em>are 50 cents each for publishers. These are cash items and so payment must accompany all orders along with a Remittance and Credit Request form. Regular and special pioneers on the list before July 1, 1976, may receive a free <em>Yearbook </em>by making request of the brother handling the literature. This will be included in the congregation’s order, and credit may be requested from the Society for the pioneers’ copies. Pioneers may obtain additional copies at 15 cents each.</p>

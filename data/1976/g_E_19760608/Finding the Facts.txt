Finding the Facts
Did you ever wonder what life was like in early Bible times? What people ate, drank and wore? What they did for entertainment? In what kind of homes they lived?
Factual answers to these and hundreds of similar questions are found in the 1,700-page alphabetical reference work Aid to Bible Understanding. Its publishers have endeavored to discuss every person, place, plant, river and animal mentioned in the Bible, as well as notable events and the record of Godâ€™s dealings with men.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">REGARDING the enemies of God’s people, the psalmist prayed: “O my God, make them like a thistle whirl, like stubble before a wind.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:83:13-19:83:13" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ps. 83:13</a>) In the psalmist’s homeland one may often see during the fall a number of star thistles being blown about as a rolling, whirling mass. This is probably what the psalmist had in mind by his prayerful expression.</p>

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb"><span id="page745" class="pageNum" data-no="745" data-before-text="745"></span>A GOOD promise, made by a reliable person, can influence the receiver to take rewarding action. All for the sake of a promise, how many of us today would be willing to become an alien, a man without a country, in a foreign land, for a hundred years? Amazingly, we have the historical record of just such a course! It is the case of a man from whom the Arabs claim descent, as well as their blood relatives, the Israelites. This common forefather of theirs received a promise the carrying out of which affects the whole human family for everlasting good.</p>
<p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="qu"> 2. Why did the realization of that promise call for action on the receiver’s part?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>The realization of this world-important promise called for action, as the promissory statement from God said: “Go your way out of your country and from your relatives and from the house of your father to the country that I shall show you; and I shall make a great nation out of you and I shall bless you and I will make your name great; and prove yourself a blessing. And I will bless those who bless you, and him that calls down evil upon you I shall curse, and all the families of the ground will certainly bless themselves by means of you.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:12:1-1:12:3" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Gen. 12:1-3</a>.</p>

Abram (later called Abraham) is an example to us in the way of taking due action to realize a promise that Abraham’s God makes to us.</p>
<p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="qu"> 4. How long was Abraham a man without a country in the land of Canaan; also his son Isaac and his grandson Jacob?</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>When Abraham was seventy-five years old, he entered the Promised Land, then a country foreign to him. He died at the age of one hundred and seventy-five years. On this account he was a man without a country for a whole century​—quite a time. His son Isaac, born to him in this foreign land not yet given to Abraham, was likewise a man without a country, but for even a longer period of time​—for one hundred and eighty years. Isaac’s son, Jacob, to whom the divine promise was passed along, was a man without a country for one hundred and thirty years before he was called down to Egypt, where he died. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:47:7-1:47:9" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Gen. 47:7-9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:49:33-1:49:33" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 49:33</a>) Yet, at his own request, this patriarch of one hundred and forty-seven years of age was buried in the Promised Land, the land of Canaan.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:50:1-1:50:14" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Gen. 50:1-14</a>.</p>

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>What was it that strengthened those three patriarchs to hold on in a foreign land and not to return to Ur of the Chaldeans? What helped them to endure in the alien land of Canaan for two hundred and fifteen years (1943 to 1728 B.C.E.) all together? It was their faith in Jehovah God and in the reliability of his unbreakable promise. To this effect we read, in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:11:9-58:11:10" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Hebrews 11:9, 10,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:11:13-58:11:16" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 13-16</a>:</p>

For he was awaiting the city having real foundations, the builder and maker of which city is God. In faith all these died, although they did not get the fulfillment of the promises, but they saw them afar off and welcomed them and publicly declared that they were strangers and temporary residents in the land. For those who say such things give evidence that they are earnestly seeking a place of their own. And yet, if they had indeed kept remembering that place from which they had gone forth, they would have had opportunity to return. But now they are reaching out for a better place, that is, <span id="page746" class="pageNum" data-no="746" data-before-text="746"></span>one belonging to heaven. Hence God is not ashamed of them, to be called upon as their God, for he has made a city ready for them.”</p>
<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu"> 7. How did Abraham make himself an undesirable person in the neighborhood of his birth, and what kind of “city” did he want?</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><sup>7 </sup>Abraham, as an example to his son Isaac and his grandson Jacob, was determined to die abroad rather than shrink back from his assignment and return to his native city, Ur of the Chaldeans. That pagan city being in the land of Shinar, Abraham even made himself an unwelcome person there in that neighborhood, because he pursued and put to rout four confederate kings from that area. These were Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of Goiim. Abraham and his troops despoiled those kings of all the valuable things and captives that they had seized during their invasion of the land of Canaan. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:14:1-1:14:24" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Gen. 14:1-24;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:7:1-58:7:1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> Heb. 7:1</a>) No longer did Abraham want Ur of the Chaldeans as his residential city. He renounced it. He preferred to live as a nomad in the Promised Land, desiring something better than that idolatrous, sinful city of his birth. Rather than a man-made city, Abraham, as well as Isaac and Jacob, wanted a city or government of which his God is the Builder and Maker. The foundations of Ur of the Chaldeans lie in ruins today, but not so God’s “city.”</p>
<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu">8, 9. (a) What kind of inheritance will Abraham get in the resurrection, and how? (b) According to <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:4:11-45:4:12" data-bid="39-1" class="b">Romans 4:11, 12</a>, how did Abraham become the “father” of Christ’s disciples, spiritually speaking?</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><sup>8 </sup>For Abraham’s faithfulness till death, Jehovah God promised him, not a heavenly inheritance, but an earthly one, the land of Canaan. So, at his resurrection from the dead, Abraham will be raised to life on earth. But at that time the earth will be under the absolute rule of the city “belonging to heaven,” the Messianic kingdom of Abraham’s most important Descendant, namely, Jesus Christ. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:11:16-58:11:16" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Heb. 11:16</a>) Abraham was an excellent example of faith to this glorious Descendant, the one through whom God’s promise to Abraham is fulfilled, for Jesus Christ is outstandingly the ‘seed of Abraham’ in whom all the nations of the earth will procure a never-ending blessing. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:22:18-1:22:18" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Gen. 22:18</a>) Spiritually speaking, Abraham is said to be the “father” of the disciples of Jesus Christ, no matter whether these have been taken from among circumcised Jews or from among uncircumcised non-Jews, the Gentiles. On this point, we read the following words:</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><sup>9 </sup>“And he [Abraham] received a sign [years after his becoming a wandering alien in the land of Canaan], namely, circumcision, as a seal of the righteousness by the faith he had while in his uncircumcised state [until he begot Isaac], that he might be the father of all those having faith while in uncircumcision [as Gentiles], in order for righteousness to be counted to them; and a father of circumcised offspring, not only to those who adhere to circumcision [the circumcised Jews], but also to those who walk orderly in the footsteps of that faith while in the uncircumcised state [as Gentiles] which [faith] our father Abraham had.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:4:11-45:4:12" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Rom. 4:11, 12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:15:6-1:15:6" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> Gen. 15:6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:17:7-1:17:17" data-bid="9-3" class="b"> 17:7-17</a>.</p>

<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><sup>10 </sup>Because Abraham became like a spiritual father to the disciples of his natural Descendant Jesus Christ, Abraham was used as a type of Jehovah God, who is the heavenly Father of all the “seed” by means of whom all the nations of the earth will be blessed. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:3:8-48:3:9" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Gal. 3:8, 9</a>) Thus Jehovah God is the Greater Abraham. From him comes the quality of faith, because he gives his holy spirit to those who worship him, one of the fruits that this spirit produces being faith. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:5:22-48:5:22" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Gal. 5:22</a>) His dependable <span id="page747" class="pageNum" data-no="747" data-before-text="747"></span>faithfulness to his promises inspires faith within us toward him. Far more so than Abraham, Jehovah is the Father of the faithful ones or of those having faith. By holding fast to such faith, we shall, like Abraham, enter into fulfillment of God’s promises to us. Our faith will aid us to endure until we get the things promised by God.</p>

<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu">11, 12. How are we, who, like Abraham, look forward to God’s promises, a people without a country, and how is this backed up by what is written in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:2:11-60:2:12" data-bid="40-1" class="b">1 Peter 2:11, 12</a>?</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><sup>11 </sup>Abraham is indeed an example to us today who look forward to the wonderful things promised to us by the God who does not lie. At present we still have men and women who, in a figurative way, are persons without a country. These are the ones who really have the faith of Abraham. They are the dedicated, baptized disciples of Jesus Christ, the Principal One of the ‘seed of Abraham.’ It is from no wrong standpoint that they are looked upon as a people without a country. This standpoint is backed up by what one of Christ’s disciples, the apostle Peter, wrote in his first letter addressed to those whom he calls “the temporary residents scattered about in Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:1:1-60:1:1" data-bid="12-1" class="b">1 Pet. 1:1</a>) In what sense were these Christians “temporary residents”?

<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><sup>12 </sup>“Beloved, I exhort you as aliens and temporary residents to keep abstaining from fleshly desires, which are the very ones that carry on a conflict against the soul. Maintain your conduct fine among the nations [or, the Gentiles], that, in the thing in which they are speaking against you as evildoers, they may as a result of your fine works of which they are eyewitnesses glorify God in the day for his inspection.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:2:11-60:2:12" data-bid="13-1" class="b">1 Pet. 2:11, 12</a>.</p>

But today, in this twentieth century of the Christian congregation, those of Jehovah’s Christian witnesses who survive the oncoming “great tribulation” will not move out of the system. Why not? Because this wicked system of things will itself be removed from the face of the earth in the “war of the great day of God the Almighty” in which the tribulation will end.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:21-40:24:22" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Matt. 24:21, 22;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:7:14-66:7:14" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> Rev. 7:14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:16:14-66:16:14" data-bid="16-3" class="b"> 16:14,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:16:16-66:16:16" data-bid="16-4" class="b"> 16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:19:11-66:19:21" data-bid="16-5" class="b"> 19:11-21</a>.</p>

Well, then, are we conducting ourselves as “aliens and temporary residents” among the worldly nations in the way advised by the inspired apostle Peter?

The reason for their doing this was that, as Peter said, “you are ‘a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for special possession, that you should declare abroad the excellencies’ of the one that called you out of darkness into his wonderful light. For you were once not a people, but are now God’s people.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:1:3-60:1:3" data-bid="17-1" class="b">1 Pet. 1:3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:2:9-60:2:10" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> 2:9, 10</a>) Obviously, then, such ones are no longer a part of this world that is alienated from God.

Consequently Jesus said to his disciples: “If the world hates you, you know that it has hated me before it hated you. If you were part of the world, the world would be fond of what is its own. Now because you are no part of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, on this account the world hates you. Bear in mind the word I said to you, A slave is not greater than his master.

As substitutes for Christ we beg: ‘Become reconciled to God.’ The one who did not know sin he made to be sin for us, that we might become God’s righteousness by means of him.”</p>
<p id="p51" data-pid="51" class="qu">23. In view of “the word of the reconciliation” that these Christian “ambassadors” carry, why are they not authorized to meddle in worldly politics and conflicts?</p>
<p id="p28" data-pid="28" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><sup>23 </sup>Because of being ambassadors substituting for Christ to <em>all </em>the nations, the commissioned Christians have to carry <span id="page750" class="pageNum" data-no="750" data-before-text="750"></span>“the word of the reconciliation” to people of all sorts of political persuasion​—to Democrats, to Republicans, to Socialists, to the Nazi-minded, to the Fascist-minded, to Communists, to Conservatives, to Laborites, and so forth. God’s “word of the reconciliation” is the same to all of these, without partiality. For this reason his “ambassadors substituting for Christ” cannot dabble in the politics of <em>any </em>country or become members of <em>any </em>political party anywhere. As “ambassadors” from God they are “aliens and temporary residents” no matter in what land they are preaching “this good news of the kingdom.” Remembering the apostle Paul’s words, “Our citizenship exists in the heavens” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:3:20-50:3:21" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Phil. 3:20, 21</a>), they appreciate that they have no right or authorization to meddle in political matters. They must remain strictly neutral toward national or local politics and all selfish conflicts of this world.</p>
<p id="p52" data-pid="52" class="qu">24. Despite being most law-abiding, what do these “ambassadors” experience from the world, as shown by Paul’s words in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:6:19-49:6:20" data-bid="45-1" class="b">Ephesians 6:19, 20</a>?</p>
<p id="p29" data-pid="29" data-rel-pid="[52]" class="sb"><sup>24 </sup>So they are the most law-abiding of people, paying taxes and acting in the best interests of the community. Yet these ambassadors who substitute for Christ are hated by the world, just as Christ himself was. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:22:21-40:22:21" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Matt. 22:21;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:13:1-45:13:7" data-bid="31-2" class="b"> Rom. 13:1-7</a>) It is not strange, therefore, that just about six years after Paul wrote what is said in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:5:19-47:5:21" data-bid="32-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 5:19-21</a>, he found himself a prisoner in Rome, Italy, and accordingly wrote to the congregation in Ephesus, Asia Minor, to pray for him: “That ability to speak may be given me with the opening of my mouth, with freeness of speech to make known the sacred secret of the good news, for which I am acting as an ambassador in chains.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:6:19-49:6:20" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Eph. 6:19, 20</a>.</p>
<p id="p53" data-pid="53" class="qu">25. One’s carrying out one’s Christian ambassadorship calls for what, and with what knowledge about possessions in mind?</p>
<p id="p30" data-pid="30" data-rel-pid="[53]" class="sb"><sup>25 </sup>Just the same as nineteen hundred years ago, one’s serving as an ‘ambassador substituting for Christ’ in among people today alienated from God calls for one to endure such suffering. As a pattern for us, Paul endured faithfully. He held onto his ambassadorship or his Christian ministry. He said: “In every way we recommend ourselves as God’s ministers, by the endurance of much, by tribulations, by cases of need, by difficulties, by beatings, by prisons,” and so forth. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:6:4-47:6:5" data-bid="34-1" class="b">2 Cor. 6:4, 5</a>) As a fellow sufferer, Paul could tell his Christianized Hebrew brothers to keep on enduring, just as they had endured much when they first got the light of Bible truth. Although they might lose all earthly material possessions, yet they, and he too, had “a better and an abiding possession.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:10:32-58:10:34" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Heb. 10:32-34</a>.</p>
<p id="p54" data-pid="54" class="qu">26. Why is there yet need for Christian ambassadors and emissaries to hold on in faithful endurance?</p>
<p id="p31" data-pid="31" data-rel-pid="[54]" class="sb"><sup>26 </sup>As ambassadors or as emissaries from God who substitute for Christ, we Christian witnesses of Jehovah today have need to develop the power of endurance, do we not? Yes, for we need to continue enduring. Since the end of the Gentile Times in 1914 we have gone through a lot of persecution and mistreatment in a hostile world. Still more of such experiences lie yet ahead of us before we realize the fulfillment of God’s promise of “new heavens and a new earth,” in which righteousness is to dwell forever. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:3:13-61:3:13" data-bid="36-1" class="b">2 Pet. 3:13</a>) The fulfillment of this promise is getting nearer and nearer. This generation among which all such unrighteous persecution of God’s ambassadors and emissaries has been committed since World War I of 1914-1918 C.E. is a marked generation. How so? In that it will experience God’s fulfilling of his promise to bring in the righteous new system of things. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:34-40:24:34" data-bid="37-1" class="b">Matt. 24:34;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:13:30-41:13:30" data-bid="37-2" class="b"> Mark 13:30</a>) So let us hold on confidently in faithful endurance!</p>

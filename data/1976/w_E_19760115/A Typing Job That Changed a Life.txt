A Typing Job That Changed a Life
● In India, one of Jehovah’s Christian witnesses who was assigned to speak at the “Divine Victory” District Assembly was able to arrange for a fellow worker at his place of employment to type up his notes. The worker became so engrossed in the material that he wanted to know whether he too could attend the assembly. Of course he could, and he did. The first day so impressed him that he applied for a leave of absence from his office. This being granted, he attended the entire assembly. Thereafter he began a serious study of the Bible, started going to all the meetings of Jehovah’s witnesses and soon began telling to others what he was learning. Though coming from a staunch Hindu family and having to face opposition, he has stood firm, wanting to be a loyal disciple of Jesus Christ.

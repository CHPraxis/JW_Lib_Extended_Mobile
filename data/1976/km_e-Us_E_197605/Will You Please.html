<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">All of us like to receive our magazines. But some new subscribers complain that the magazines do not start coming for months after subscribing. What can we do to avoid this?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><em>Publishers, </em>please turn in your subscriptions at the first meeting after you obtain them. Please make them out in duplicate.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><em>Congregations, </em>please send in all subscriptions <em>each week. </em>(<em>Organization, </em>p. 152) Some congregations have held them for from two to four weeks, but that should never happen. Always send a remittance form with the subscription slips.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Whenever you send in any subscriptions, even if there may be other items in the envelope, please write the word MAGAZINE on the envelope. All envelopes marked MAGAZINE will be opened quickly so we can give better service to subscribers.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">The Society is ready to do its part. Presiding overseers, please help us to give good service to all subscribers.</p>

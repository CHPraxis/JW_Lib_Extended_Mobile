<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn">◆ There are still congregations unable to cover their assigned territory regularly. We request that publishers or pioneers whose circumstances would allow them to go elsewhere for a few weeks or on a permanent basis write the Society, supplying the information requested on page 135 of the <em>Organization </em>book. Mention the distance you can travel. Give your letter to the presiding overseer. He along with the other committee members will review it and they will probably recommend that the branch office consider your availability. However, if anyone does not qualify, the service committee will kindly inform the applicant of the reason why they cannot recommend him and they will not send the letter to the Society’s office. (Same basic procedure as outlined for pioneers, on page 137 of the <em>Organization </em>book.)</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>Many more Bible study teachers are needed to teach those who may yet become disciples of Christ in the time remaining. This work is important, in view of what Jesus commanded.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:28:19-40:28:20" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matt. 28:19, 20</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>Some of us may, for various reasons, feel inadequate to share in Bible study work. But even if you are new in the truth and relatively inexperienced in field service, a sincere desire will move you to reach out and help people. One young man, himself still studying, happily shared what he was learning. An elderly woman was so interested in what he told her while he was working in her home that he started a Bible study with her. Imagine his joy to witness her baptism, just a few months after his own!</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>Can you younger ones share in Bible study work? Yes. Many of school age are now conducting studies with schoolmates, often doing so during a school lunch hour or free period.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>Are you a family head with many responsibilities? Some have started studies with fellow employees, conducting them during a lunch or coffee break. Or are you a busy housewife with smaller children? A number have been successful in cultivating the interest of a neighbor, often by talking over a cup of coffee or at the clothesline, thus leading to a Bible study.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>If you wish assistance, why not ask your book study conductor or the Bible study overseer. When the circuit overseer and his wife visit your congregation, they also will be glad to aid you in Bible study work.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup>Jesus commissioned his followers to do more than just preach. He urged them to make disciples. Are we doing that? Do we sincerely desire to do so? It is good to ask ourselves, “Do I really want a Bible study?” Jehovah has provided much to aid us in fulfilling this lifesaving commission.</p>

<p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sn"><strong>20 min: </strong>Serving Jehovah Together. To be handled by an elder, with audience participation. Explain that elders very much appreciate privilege and responsibility that is theirs, want to aid and encourage flock in every way, rendering personal assistance when problems arise. Elders desire to be of even greater help, but often face time limitations. In addition to presiding over congregational meetings, shepherding and other congregational responsibilities, what basic Christian obligations do the elders have? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:3:5-54:3:5" data-bid="11-1" class="b">1 Tim. 3:5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:5:8-54:5:8" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 5:8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:14-40:24:14" data-bid="11-3" class="b"> Matt. 24:14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:28:19-40:28:20" data-bid="11-4" class="b"> 28:19, 20</a>) We can help them by not unnecessarily adding to their load. They must handle weighty matters of a judicial nature but might enlist aid of other qualified ones in connection with other activities. All of us want to work and cooperate together in doing Jehovah’s will so elders can care for all of their responsibilities, including public preaching and disciple-making work.</p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">What can we do to cooperate with the elders? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:13:7-58:13:7" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Heb. 13:7,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:13:17-58:13:17" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> 17</a>; may be able to discuss problem or question before or after meeting, when working with elder in field service; not always necessary that a personal visit be made, perhaps consuming much time, or phone calls at a late hour.) What attitude toward one another will be helpful? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:4:8-60:4:8" data-bid="13-1" class="b">1 Pet. 4:8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:6:1-48:6:1" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> Gal. 6:1</a>) When faced with problems, is it always necessary to go to an elder for help? [Older sisters may be of assistance to younger sisters, <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/56:2:3-56:2:5" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Titus 2:3-5</a>; young persons should consult parents, <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:6:1-49:6:1" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Ephesians 6:1</a>; wives should consult their husbands, <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:5:22-49:5:22" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Ephesians 5:22</a>; all can check <em>Index </em>on Scriptural questions.] What are some things all of us should do before making weighty decisions? [<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:6:12-42:6:12" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Luke 6:12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:16-55:3:17" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> 2 Tim. 3:16, 17</a>] Should any of us always look to the elders to make final decisions for us? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:6:5-48:6:5" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Gal. 6:5</a>) Because of loving concern for congregation, all elders wish they could do more, had more time, but must balance their responsibilities.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:11:28-47:11:28" data-bid="19-1" class="b">2 Cor. 11:28</a>.</p>

● Should each Kingdom Hall display the yeartext?
It is recommended that the yeartext be displayed in the Kingdom Hall in countries where this can be done without difficulties resulting. The yeartext is selected each year to provide timely encouragement for Jehovah’s people from the Scriptures. And when newly interested people visit us at the Kingdom Hall they are usually impressed when they see a verse or two from God’s Word featured as a reminder. From time to time in meetings, specific reference can be made to the yeartext, especially when parts on the meetings are related to this theme.
Often it is best to display the yeartext at the front or side of the hall so it can be seen easily. If meetings in another language are held in the same hall, a yeartext in this language also could be featured. The size of the letters and the makeup of the sign itself should be appropriate and tasteful. Obviously one that is gaudy, with letters uneven or one that does not fit in with the decor, would not be appropriate. When it is time to design the yeartext, there may be someone in the congregation who has some decorating ability who might provide some suggestions on design and makeup. When the Kingdom Hall is in a home or a rented hall used by other groups, the elders can decide if it is practical to have a yeartext sign. If so, it may be necessary to construct it in such a way that it can be put up and taken down easily for each meeting.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">More and more reports are received from the field telling that many people are not at home when publishers call. Even when people are not at home, it takes time and energy to go from door to door. When we do not find people at home we might feel that we have not really accomplished much, but if we could leave a message that would aid them to learn about the truth, that would give us greater satisfaction.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">It is a pleasure to inform you that a small slip has been prepared entitled “You Had a Visitor.” This slip is about the size of a handbill and <em>should be folded before it is left under a door. </em>The message it contains should stimulate the thinking of those who find it when they return home. It has a coupon offering a free booklet and invites people to contact the local Kingdom Hall.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Orders may be placed now by congregations. These slips are $1.00 per thousand. When ordering them, ask for NOT HOME SLIPS. We hope this will prove to be a means of giving a further witness throughout the field.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">● With reference to the Messiah, John the Baptist said: “The one coming after me is stronger than I am, whose sandals I am not fit to take off.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:3:11-40:3:11" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matt. 3:11</a>) In the first century C.E., it was common for people to take off their sandals upon entering a home and then to put them back on when leaving. The service of taking off a person’s sandals was viewed as very menial, to be performed by the lowest slave. Therefore, in saying what he did, John expressed great humility, representing himself as unworthy of being even a slave of the Messiah.</p>

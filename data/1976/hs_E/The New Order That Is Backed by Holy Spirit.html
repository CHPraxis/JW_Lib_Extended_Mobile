<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="st"><strong>The New Order That Is Backed by Holy Spirit</strong></p>
<p id="p60" data-pid="60" class="qu"> 1. In spite of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:1:9-21:1:9" data-bid="64-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 1:9</a>, why will the coming order backed by holy spirit be something really new?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" data-rel-pid="[60]" class="sb">WHEN we speak about a coming order that is backed by holy spirit, we can really say: “See this; it is new.” Even wise King Solomon will not be able to apply to it his stated rule: “There is nothing new under the sun.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:1:9-21:1:10" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 1:9, 10</a>) Solomon’s saying has proved to be true till now with regard to the life pattern of man and woman and with regard to the rise and fall of man-made governments. But the order of things that the Creator of heaven and earth will bring in shortly will indeed be something new, something never experienced before in all human history.</p>
<p id="p61" data-pid="61" class="qu"> 2. Why is it to be expected that holy spirit would be behind the promised new order?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[61]" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>Holy spirit will be behind the coming new order. And why not? It was behind the writing of the Holy Bible, and this inspired book fairly overflows with the good news about the peaceful new order for trouble-weary mankind. When it is at last brought in within this generation, all those entering into the enjoyment of it will delightedly say: “This <em>is </em>new!” The omnipotent God, Jehovah, will prove true to his promise to mankind: “Look! I am making all things new.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:5-66:21:5" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Revelation 21:5</a>.</p>
<p id="p62" data-pid="62" class="qu"> 3. (a) What are new things about which the book of Revelation speaks? (b) Why will God’s new order not be a patched-up job?</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[62]" class="sb"><span id="page164" class="pageNum" data-no="164" data-before-text="164"></span><sup>3 </sup>Revelation, the last book of the Bible, speaks about new things, a “new name,” a “new song,” “new heaven and a new earth,” and “New Jerusalem.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:2:17-66:2:17" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Revelation 2:17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:3:12-66:3:12" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 3:12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:5:9-66:5:9" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> 5:9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:14:3-66:14:3" data-bid="3-4" class="b"> 14:3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:1-66:21:2" data-bid="3-5" class="b"> 21:1, 2</a>) These are exhilarating things about which to think and talk. And when a person appreciates the nature of the new things that are in store for mankind, it moves him to “sing to Jehovah a new song.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:96:1-19:96:1" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Psalm 96:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:98:1-19:98:1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 98:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:144:9-19:144:9" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> 144:9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:149:1-19:149:1" data-bid="4-4" class="b"> 149:1</a>) His new order will not be a patched-up job, a repairing of mankind’s old order, a trying to preserve as much of the old order as is possible and merely adding some new touches to it, thus using man’s old order as a base. This would never work. Jesus Christ himself said:</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="si">“No one cuts a patch from a new outer garment and sews it onto an old outer garment; but if he does, then both the new patch tears away and the patch from the new garment does not match the old. Moreover, no one puts new wine into old wineskins; but if he does, then the new wine will burst the wineskins, and it will be spilled out and the wineskins will be ruined. But new wine must be put into new wineskins.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:5:36-42:5:38" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Luke 5:36-38</a>.</p>
<p id="p63" data-pid="63" class="qu"> 4. Why will the old rebuilt Jerusalem not play a part in the New Order?</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[63]" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>In accord with this illustration, what God has foretold for mankind will be brand new. Old Jerusalem in the Middle East will not figure in it at all. When God executed his adverse judgment in the year 70 C.E., he had the Jerusalem of Jesus’ day destroyed. The Jerusalem that has been built since has not been built by His command nor by his approved people. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:4:21-43:4:21" data-bid="6-1" class="b">John 4:21</a>) The New Jerusalem is the thing! This will be no city structure here on earth, on the site of the <span id="page165" class="pageNum" data-no="165" data-before-text="165"></span>old Jerusalem. New Jerusalem will be heavenly. All we have to do is examine its description as given in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:9-66:22:3" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Revelation 21:9 through 22:3</a>, and we shall see that, because of its dimensions and features, it would never fit in with the terrain of old Jerusalem. In the inspired description, the New Jerusalem is called “the bride, the Lamb’s wife.”</p>
<p id="p64" data-pid="64" class="qu"> 5. The New Jerusalem is likened to whom, and how does this correspond with the language of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/38:9:9-38:9:9" data-bid="65-1" class="b">Zechariah 9:9</a>?</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[64]" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>“I saw also,” says the apostle John, “the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God and prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:2-66:21:2" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Revelation 21:2</a>) Just as here the New Jerusalem is likened to a woman, a bride, a wife, so the old Jerusalem was likened to a woman. For instance, when Jesus rode into Jerusalem on Nisan 9 (March 27), 33 C.E., as if he were a king-designate riding to his coronation, the prophecy of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/38:9:9-38:9:9" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Zechariah 9:9</a> came true: “Be very joyful, O daughter of Zion. Shout in triumph, O daughter of Jerusalem. Look! Your king himself comes to you. He is . . . riding upon an ass, even upon a full-grown animal the son of a she-ass.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:21:4-40:21:5" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Matthew 21:4, 5</a>.</p>
<p id="p65" data-pid="65" class="qu"> 6. How will New Jerusalem compare with the old city as to loveliness, and how does it come down out of heaven from God?</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[65]" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup>Ancient earthly Jerusalem was called “the city of which they used to say, ‘It is the perfection of prettiness.’” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/25:2:15-25:2:15" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Lamentations 2:15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:48:1-19:48:2" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> Psalm 48:1, 2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:50:2-19:50:2" data-bid="11-3" class="b"> 50:2</a>) Still, in beauty and glory, it could never compare with the heavenly New Jerusalem. This glorious new city comes down “out of heaven from God.” In what way? In that this new governmental body originates with God and it extends its power and authority down from heaven to the <span id="page166" class="pageNum" data-no="166" data-before-text="166"></span>earth, for the all-time good of mankind.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:2-66:21:2" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Revelation 21:2</a>.</p>
<p id="p66" data-pid="66" class="qu"> 7. In what way is the holy city, New Jerusalem, “the Lamb’s wife”?</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[66]" class="sb"><sup>7 </sup>In what way is the holy city “the bride, the Lamb’s wife”? In that it is made up of the congregation of Christ’s anointed disciples, his joint heirs in the Messianic kingdom. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:5:25-49:5:27" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Ephesians 5:25-27;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:11:2-47:11:2" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 2 Corinthians 11:2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:19:7-66:19:8" data-bid="13-3" class="b"> Revelation 19:7, 8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:22:17-66:22:17" data-bid="13-4" class="b"> 22:17</a>) With reference to each of these the glorified Jesus said: “I will write upon him the name of my God and the name of the city of my God, the new Jerusalem which descends out of heaven from my God, and that new name of mine.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:3:12-66:3:12" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Revelation 3:12</a>) Members of the “bride” are spiritual Israelites, in the new covenant, and they number 144,000.

<p id="p67" data-pid="67" class="qu"> 8. Why will Christ’s 144,000 joint heirs be a body of rulers that is brand new?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[67]" class="sb"><sup>8 </sup>The 144,000 joint heirs with the heavenly Bridegroom Jesus Christ will include no worldly politicians, not even political and ecclesiastical kings that have reigned in Christendom. They are a distinct heavenly body of rulers, something brand new. Being no longer of human nature, they have the “divine nature.” They are a “new creation.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:1:4-61:1:4" data-bid="16-1" class="b">2 Peter 1:4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:5:17-47:5:17" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> 2 Corinthians 5:17</a>) They have met the requirements for a disciple on earth to enter into the heavenly kingdom. They were “born again,” “born from water and spirit,” “born, not from blood or from a fleshly will or from man’s will, but from God.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:1:12-43:1:13" data-bid="17-1" class="b">John 1:12, 13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:3:3-43:3:3" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> 3:3,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:3:5-43:3:5" data-bid="17-3" class="b"> <span id="page167" class="pageNum" data-no="167" data-before-text="167"></span>5</a>) In <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:6:5-45:6:5" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Romans 6:5,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:6:8-45:6:8" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> 8</a> the spirit-begotten disciples of Christ read: “If we have become united with him in the likeness of his death, we shall certainly also be united with him in the likeness of his resurrection. Moreover, if we have died with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him.”</p>
<p id="p68" data-pid="68" class="qu"> 9. Christ’s resurrection was of what kind, in the likeness of which resurrection his 144,000 joint heirs are to be united with him?</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[68]" class="sb"><sup>9 </sup>What is “the likeness of his resurrection”? Well, how was Christ resurrected? In <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:3:18-60:3:18" data-bid="19-1" class="b">1 Peter 3:18</a> we are told: “Christ died once for all time concerning sins, a righteous person for unrighteous ones, that he might lead you to God, he being put to death in the flesh, but being made alive in the spirit.”</p>
<p id="p69" data-pid="69" class="qu">10. (a) What was God’s purpose in ‘preparing’ a body of flesh for his Son Jesus on earth? (b) For Jesus to live again after being put to death in the flesh concerning sins, how would he have to be resurrected?</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[69]" class="sb"><sup>10 </sup>By sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, God had humbled his Son, making him “a little lower than angels.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:8:3-45:8:3" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Romans 8:3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:2:7-58:2:9" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> Hebrews 2:7-9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:8:5-19:8:5" data-bid="20-3" class="b"> Psalm 8:5</a>) But God did not purpose for his only-begotten Son to remain a creature of flesh and blood forever, inferior to heavenly angels. God purposed to glorify him more highly than angels for his faithfulness to death in the flesh. So the perfect human body that God miraculously “prepared” for Jesus on earth was the body that Jesus offered to God once for all time in sacrifice. It was given for mankind to feed upon like bread; just as Jesus said: “The bread that I shall give is my flesh in behalf of the life of the world.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:10:1-58:10:10" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Hebrews 10:1-10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:6:51-43:6:51" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> John 6:51</a>) So, after his being “put to death in the flesh,” Jesus, if he were to <span id="page168" class="pageNum" data-no="168" data-before-text="168"></span>be raised to life again, had to be “made alive in the spirit,” as a heavenly spirit Son of God.</p>
<p id="p70" data-pid="70" class="qu">11. For Christ’s spirit-begotten disciples to be in the likeness of his resurrection, in what must they be “made alive,” and how does this harmonize with <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:15:42-46:15:54" data-bid="66-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 15:42-54</a>?</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[70]" class="sb"><sup>11 </sup>Like Jesus Christ, his spirit-begotten disciples must be “faithful even to death” in the flesh. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:2:10-66:2:10" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Revelation 2:10</a>) For them to be united with him “in the likeness of his resurrection,” they also, like him, have to be “made alive in the spirit,” as spirit creatures. In <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:15:42-46:15:54" data-bid="23-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 15:42-54</a>, we read of their kind of resurrection:</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="si">“It is sown in corruption, it is raised up in incorruption. It is sown in dishonor, it is raised up in glory. It is sown in weakness, it is raised up in power. It is sown a physical body, it is raised up a spiritual body. If there is a physical body, there is also a spiritual one. It is even so written: ‘The first man Adam became a living soul.’ The last Adam became a life-giving spirit. Nevertheless, the first is, not that which is spiritual, but that which is physical, afterward that which is spiritual. The first man is out of the earth and made of dust; the second man is out of heaven. As the one made of dust is, so those made of dust are also; and as the heavenly one is, so those who are heavenly are also. And just as we have borne the image of the one made of dust, we shall bear also the image of the heavenly one.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="si">“However, this I say, brothers, that flesh and blood cannot inherit God’s kingdom, neither does corruption inherit incorruption. Look! I tell you a sacred secret: We shall not all fall asleep in death, but we shall all be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, during the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised up incorruptible, and we shall be changed. For this which is corruptible must put on incorruption, and this which is mortal must put on immortality. But when this which is corruptible puts on incorruption and this which is mortal puts on immortality, then the saying will take place that is written: ‘Death is swallowed up forever.’”</p>

<p id="p71" data-pid="71" class="qu">12. (a) Since the resurrection of the 144,000 is in the likeness of Christ’s resurrection, this argues for Christ’s having what kind of resurrection? (b) Why is this a new resurrection, and what makes it the “first resurrection”?</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[71]" class="sb"><sup>12 </sup>Such a resurrection to incorruption and immortality in a “spiritual body” is what <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:6:5-45:6:5" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Romans 6:5</a> calls “the likeness of his resurrection.” This means that Jesus Christ himself had such a resurrection, not to life in a physical body that is corruptible and mortal and lower than angels, but in a spiritual body and as “a life-giving spirit.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:15:45-46:15:45" data-bid="25-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 15:45</a>) Now we can understand why, after his resurrection, Jesus had to materialize human bodies with the material clothing in order to make himself visible to his disciples during the forty days up till his ascension back to heaven. This is indeed a <em>new </em>resurrection, one invisible to human eyes. It has preceded the coming resurrection of mankind in general. It is also of first-class importance. So it is called “the first resurrection.” It is what the apostle Paul calls “the earlier resurrection.” Christ’s 144,000 joint heirs share in it. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:3:11-50:3:11" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Philippians 3:11</a>) These are the ones spoken of in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:20:4-66:20:6" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Revelation 20:4-6</a>:</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="si">“They came to life and ruled as kings with the Christ for a thousand years. . . . This is the first resurrection.

As such he could revitalize the kingdom that was based on Jesse, the father of kings over Israel. When Jehovah God anointed Jesus with holy spirit, this symbolic “twig” or “sprout” became the King-Designate for the Davidic kingdom. At the end of the Gentile Times in 1914, God enthroned him as King in heaven. Concerning his activity <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:11:1-23:11:5" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Isaiah 11:1-5</a> says:</p>
<p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="si">“And there must go forth a twig out of the stump of Jesse; and out of his roots a sprout will be fruitful. And upon him the spirit of Jehovah must settle down, the spirit of wisdom and of understanding, the spirit of counsel and of mightiness, the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of Jehovah; and there will be enjoyment by him in the fear of Jehovah.</p>
<p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="si">“And he will not judge by any mere appearance to his eyes, nor reprove simply according to the thing heard by his ears. And with righteousness he must judge the lowly ones, and with uprightness he must give reproof in behalf of the meek ones of the earth. And he must strike the earth with the rod of his mouth; and with the spirit of his lips he will put the wicked one to death. And righteousness must prove to be the belt of his hips, and faithfulness the belt of his loins.”</p>

He has brought about the regathering of the remnant of his anointed joint heirs from all parts of the earth to which they had been scattered by persecutions during and after World War I. He has brought them into a spiritual paradise, where they enjoy peace and harmony with God and produce abundant “fruitage of the spirit.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:5:22-48:5:23" data-bid="37-1" class="b">Galatians 5:22, 23</a>) The beastliness of the world is kept out!

<p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="ss"><strong>“A NEW EARTH”</strong></p>
<p id="p81" data-pid="81" class="qu">23. How securely will Jehovah put the new heavens and new earth in place, and what kind of action may it require for him to bring his people into the New Order?</p>
<p id="p37" data-pid="37" data-rel-pid="[81]" class="sb"><sup>23 </sup>The wicked old order, which has entrenched itself so deeply in the earth, must go​—into destruction! Jehovah is now getting all things ready for the glorious new order! He has ‘planted’ the new governmental “heavens,” embedding them so fixedly in his universal organization that they cannot be pulled up by men or demons. The “new earth” that he inaugurates he will put upon such a firm foundation that nothing can make it wobble or totter to its ruin. Into this new order he will bring the remnant of spiritual Israel and the “great crowd” even if he has to do as at the Red Sea back in Moses’ day, stirring up the waters and making them boisterous so as to cut a corridor for his liberated people to get through. Here is what he says in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:51:15-23:51:16" data-bid="41-1" class="b">Isaiah 51:15, 16</a>:</p>
<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="si">“I, Jehovah, am your God, the One stirring up the sea that its waves may be boisterous. Jehovah of armies is his name. And I shall put my words in your mouth, and with the shadow of my hand I shall certainly cover you, in order to plant the heavens and lay the foundation of the earth and say to Zion, ‘You are my people.’”</p>
<p id="p82" data-pid="82" class="qu">24. In whose mouth has Jehovah put his word, and why has he covered these with the shadow of his hand?</p>
<p id="p39" data-pid="39" data-rel-pid="[82]" class="sb"><sup>24 </sup>No obstacle put in His way by the enemies will prove to be insurmountable for Jehovah. Just as at Mount Sinai He put his word in the mouth of his chosen people through the mediator Moses <span id="page176" class="pageNum" data-no="176" data-before-text="176"></span>and thereafter he led them under the protective shadow of his hand into the Promised Land, so he has done for the remnant of spiritual Israel. He has put his word, his message of the hour, into the mouth of the spiritual remnant for them to confess openly before all the world, for their own salvation and for that of responsive hearers. A “great crowd” of “other sheep” have acted favorably upon what they have heard and have taken God’s word into their mouth. Because all of these have become his Christian witnesses, Jehovah covers them with the shadow of his hand for their protection in this world.</p>
<p id="p83" data-pid="83" class="qu">25. (a) Of what will Jehovah make the protected remnant a part, and what acknowledgment will He make to them? (b) What will God make the protected “great crowd” to be, and whose people will they be said to be?</p>
<p id="p40" data-pid="40" data-rel-pid="[83]" class="sb"><sup>25 </sup>Jehovah has an objective in this line of action. His objective is to make the faithful remnant eventually a part of the new governmental “heavens” as joint heirs with the King Jesus Christ. As for the “great crowd” of “other sheep,” Jehovah will make them the initial part of the “new earth,” the new earthly society in the New Order. By preserving the faithful remnant of spiritual Israel through the coming “great tribulation” he will be saying to these spiritual Israelites who are ‘approaching the heavenly Mount Zion and heavenly Jerusalem,’ “You are my people.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:12:22-58:12:22" data-bid="42-1" class="b">Hebrews 12:22;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:51:16-23:51:16" data-bid="42-2" class="b"> Isaiah 51:16</a>) Also, the protective “tent of God” will begin to be with the surviving “great crowd,” and, as <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:3-66:21:3" data-bid="43-1" class="b">Revelation 21:3</a> says, “they will be his peoples.”</p>
<p id="p84" data-pid="84" class="qu">26. What spirit will be absent from the New Order, and with what do the prospective entrants into it get filled now?</p>
<p id="p41" data-pid="41" data-rel-pid="[84]" class="sb"><sup>26 </sup>Holy spirit will operate and prevail in the globe-encircling new order.

<p id="p85" data-pid="85" class="qu">27. In the New Order what will take place that even advanced medical science of today cannot match?</p>
<p id="p42" data-pid="42" data-rel-pid="[85]" class="sb"><sup>27 </sup>We can only try to imagine how it will be here on earth after the “war of the great day of God the Almighty” at Har–Magedon and after the imprisoning of Satan and his demons in the “abyss.” Then holy spirit will have free reign earth wide. We are reminded of how amazingly holy spirit operated in the days of Jesus Christ and his apostles on earth nineteen centuries ago. Astonishing miracles took place, to the unspeakable joy of the people who benefited therefrom. Advanced medical science of today has nothing with which to match the instantaneous cures and healings that then took place by holy spirit. There were even resurrections of persons from the dead! Better than that, there was also spiritual healing by means of the proclaiming and teaching of the good news of Jehovah’s Messianic kingdom. There was a liberating of those held in bondage to false, traditional, death-dealing religion.</p>
<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="ss"><strong>NEW ORDER PROSPECTS!</strong></p>
<p id="p86" data-pid="86" class="qu">28. What part on earth will the surviving remnant have in the activities of the New Order, and until the time for what event?</p>
<p id="p44" data-pid="44" data-rel-pid="[86]" class="sb"><sup>28 </sup>Marvelous indeed were those miracles that took place during the days when the Christian congregation was being founded. But they were <span id="page178" class="pageNum" data-no="178" data-before-text="178"></span>merely foregleams of what is to be accomplished by holy spirit in Jehovah’s new order. We may expect the surviving remnant to participate in the thrilling activities at the start of the New Order. But for how long, we do not now know from the Holy Scriptures. They have a “marriage” to look forward to​—the heavenly marriage of the Lamb to his complete bridal congregation. At the time that this is to be realized, they will pass off the earthly scene and be rewarded with a happy part in the “first resurrection.” So they must prove faithful to the death.</p>
<p id="p87" data-pid="87" class="qu">29. Will the “great crowd” see the resurrection of the Bride class, or the resurrection of whom?</p>
<p id="p45" data-pid="45" data-rel-pid="[87]" class="sb"><sup>29 </sup>The resurrection of the Bride class will be invisible to the eyes of the “great crowd” of tribulation survivors, who hope to reside forever in the paradise restored to the earth. But there will be resurrections on earth that will be visible to the “great crowd” at the “hour” for God by Christ to raise the human dead.</p>
<p id="p88" data-pid="88" class="qu">30. In the case of the ransomed human dead, upon what does it depend as to whether their resurrection will lead to everlasting life or to a judgment of condemnation?</p>
<p id="p46" data-pid="46" data-rel-pid="[88]" class="sb"><sup>30 </sup>Jesus Christ himself awaits that hour. He foretold it when he was discussing the day of world judgment and said: “The hour is coming in which all those in the memorial tombs will hear his voice and come out, those who did good things to a resurrection of life, those who practiced vile things to a resurrection of judgment.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:5:27-43:5:29" data-bid="46-1" class="b">John 5:27-29</a>) In the case of all those resurrected by virtue of the ransom sacrifice of Jesus Christ, it all depends upon their future course under Christ’s kingdom as to whether resurrection leads eventually to everlasting life on a paradise earth or leads finally to a judgment by which they are <span id="page179" class="pageNum" data-no="179" data-before-text="179"></span>condemned to everlasting destruction. Those who then yield to the prevailing holy spirit and let it become the directive force in their lives will gain eternal life in Paradise. Those who resist the holy spirit then so evidently in operation will suffer the penalty for sinning against the holy spirit, namely, eternal death.</p>
<p id="p89" data-pid="89" class="qu">31. What promise made on the day of his death does the King Jesus Christ still feel obligated to carry out, and when will the “hour” for this strike?</p>
<p id="p47" data-pid="47" data-rel-pid="[89]" class="sb"><sup>31 </sup>The heavenly King, Jesus Christ, still feels under obligation to carry out the promise that he made to the sympathetic evildoer who died alongside him at Calvary, on that dark day of Nisan 14, 33 C.E. Of course, that impaled evildoer is now dead and remembers nothing. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:9:5-21:9:5" data-bid="47-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 9:5,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:9:10-21:9:10" data-bid="47-2" class="b"> 10</a>) But the glorified Jesus Christ remembers his words to the sympathizer: “Truly I tell you today, You will be with me in Paradise.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:23:39-42:23:43" data-bid="48-1" class="b">Luke 23:39-43</a>) In view of this reference to Paradise, the “hour” for Jesus to let the evildoer in the memorial tomb hear his voice will not strike until the restoration of Paradise to earth is well along and the resurrected evildoer can notice the change in the earthly scene. By conforming his life to the holy spirit that comes from God through Jesus Christ, the evildoer can make his resurrection the kind that eventuates in eternal life in the earth-wide Paradise.</p>
<p id="p90" data-pid="90" class="qu">32. Among those received back from the dead to earthly life there will be what “cloud” mentioned in Scripture?</p>
<p id="p48" data-pid="48" data-rel-pid="[90]" class="sb"><sup>32 </sup>We then on earth will receive back from the dead not only our redeemed relatives and friends but also the faithful men and women of ancient times who were witnesses of Jehovah and who were moved by holy spirit. These will include the <span id="page180" class="pageNum" data-no="180" data-before-text="180"></span>“so great a cloud of witnesses,” running from John the Baptizer all the way back to the first martyr for Jehovah, namely, Abel. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:11:2-58:12:1" data-bid="49-1" class="b">Hebrews 11:2 through 12:1</a>) These will likely have an influential part in the New Order.</p>

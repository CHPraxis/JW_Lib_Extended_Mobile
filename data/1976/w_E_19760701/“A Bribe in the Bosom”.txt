“A Bribe in the Bosom”
● Proverbs 21:14 speaks of “a bribe in the bosom.” In this case the “bosom” evidently refers to the upper fold of a garment above the belt. It was there that the bribe was kept concealed until such time as it would be transferred, in secrecy, to the “bosom” of another person.

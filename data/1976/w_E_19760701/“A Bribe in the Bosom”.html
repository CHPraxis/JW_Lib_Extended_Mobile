<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">● <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:21:14-20:21:14" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Proverbs 21:14</a> speaks of “a bribe in the bosom.” In this case the “bosom” evidently refers to the upper fold of a garment above the belt. It was there that the bribe was kept concealed until such time as it would be transferred, in secrecy, to the “bosom” of another person.</p>

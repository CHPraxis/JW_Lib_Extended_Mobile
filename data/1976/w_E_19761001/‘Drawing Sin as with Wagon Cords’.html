<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">◆ The prophecy of Isaiah pronounced “woe” upon those ‘drawing sin as with wagon cords.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:5:18-23:5:18" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Isa. 5:18</a>) Israelites who were thus addressed evidently made a practice of sin. They were attached to it like draft animals tied with cords to wagons that they pulled. Such persons were in line for experiencing woe at the execution of Jehovah’s righteous judgment.</p>

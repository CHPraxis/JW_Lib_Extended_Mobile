‘Wisdom Is a Tree of Life’
● A Bible proverb speaks of wisdom as being “a tree of life to those taking hold of it.” (Prov. 3:18) The person possessing such wisdom has the insight and good sense to heed God’s commandments. This safeguards him against taking a foolish course that could lead to an early death. For example, the man who ignores the inspired warnings against sexual immorality may contract a venereal disease and may, as a result, die a premature death. On the other hand, the person who acts in harmony with godly wisdom is shielded from such sad consequences. In his case, wisdom has proved to be a “tree of life.”

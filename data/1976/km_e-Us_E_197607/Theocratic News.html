<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn">◆ None of the 408 Witnesses associated with 11 congregations in the Friuli area of northern Italy were killed or injured during recent earth tremors. However, 59 families among them either lost homes in the quake of May 6 or are to have them demolished because they are no longer safe. Brothers in other parts of Italy, as well as in Germany and Austria, quickly provided adequate aid in the form of food, drink, clothing, funds and tents. The Society’s branch office in Rome says, “Our brothers are receiving four times more help than other people.” Their meetings are held mostly in the tents, and they are busy preaching the good news to others in this stricken area.</p>

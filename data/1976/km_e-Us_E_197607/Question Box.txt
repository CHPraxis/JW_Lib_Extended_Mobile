Question Box
● Is it appropriate to have several contribution boxes in a Kingdom Hall, each labeled for a different purpose?
This is something the local elders may decide if there seems to be some reason for the arrangement. As the Organization book states on page 149: “Contribution boxes are provided at our meeting places so that each one can have a part, ‘just as he has resolved in his heart.’—2 Cor. 9:7.”
On occasion (a week or so ahead of time, if circumstances permit) the elders may recommend to the congregation that whatever contributions are received a certain night be used for relief purposes. Some may find it appropriate to have a separate contribution box to start a building fund. So matters may be handled in different ways.
It is recommended that contribution boxes be provided at the various book study locations. Funds received at these locations are added to the congregation cash account and are used for Kingdom Hall expenses or for advancing Kingdom interests as the congregation may direct.

Announcements
◆ A series of eight special public talks is being planned for the benefit of all congregations for the weeks of November 7 through December 26. It is recommended that elders keep this in mind when making plans for meetings for the coming months. In due time, both the titles of the talks and outlines of the material will be provided to each congregation.
◆ Starting in September the subject of the circuit overseer’s talk will be “What Kind of Name Are You Making with God?” District overseers will speak on the topic “Keep Seeking God’s Kingdom.”
◆ July literature offer: Watchtower or Awake! subscription, or four pocket-size books for $1.00, or one for 25c, depending on needs of territory. August: True Peace and Security, for 25c. September: Any pocket-size book for 25c.
◆ Beginning July 1, 1976, the cost of all handbills will be $1.00 per thousand. Only handbills for circuit assemblies and handbills for congregations listing the various meetings will be printed. No more handbills for circuit overseers’ visits to congregations, or handbills listing the various talks to be given to the congregation, will be printed.

“Do Not Be Shocked”
● Does the fact that there is much oppression in the world surprise or even shock you? Such oppression is nothing new. A keen observer of ancient times wrote: “If you see oppression of the poor, and violation of rights and justice in the realm, do not be shocked by the fact, for the high official has another higher than he watching him and above these are others higher still.” (Eccl. 5:7, New American Bible; Ec 5:8 in many other translations.) Lesser officials are watched by higher officials, and these, in turn, by those having still greater authority. Being at the bottom, so to speak, the lowly person feels the brunt of the pressure from men who seek their own advantage at the expense of those who are subject to them.
This, however, does not mean that ruthless men are actually getting away with something. In the final analysis, they will have to render an account for their actions to the Supreme Sovereign, Jehovah God. The Bible tells us: “Vengeance is mine; I will repay, says Jehovah.”​—Rom. 12:19.

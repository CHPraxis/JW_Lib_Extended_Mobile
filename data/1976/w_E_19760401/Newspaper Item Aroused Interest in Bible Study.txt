Newspaper Item Aroused Interest in Bible Study
SHORTLY after an article on the persecution of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Malawi was published in the Gull Lake Advance newspaper, a woman telephoned a Witness family living thirty-five miles away in Swift Current, Canada. She had read the newspaper article about the religious persecution in Malawi and wanted a Bible study. As the parents were not at home, she left a message with the son. When the call was returned, this woman explained that half of her family were Catholics and the other half were Jehovah’s Witnesses but that she had no religious affiliation. From observing the Witnesses, however, she had concluded that they seemed to have an inner peace and contentment, which she very much desired. She wanted a Bible study for herself and her fourteen-year-old daughter. Also, if the study could be conducted after school her two younger children could be included. Although not able to find the Witnesses in Gull Lake, where she lived, she was delighted now to learn that there was a Kingdom Hall in her own town.
Thereafter the Witness who received the phone call got in touch with persons in the Gull Lake Congregation, who were going to have a meeting that night. On their way to the meeting, they called on this interested woman. That very evening the woman and her fourteen-year-old daughter came to the Kingdom Hall, and she and her children are continuing to make fine progress in their study of the Scriptures.

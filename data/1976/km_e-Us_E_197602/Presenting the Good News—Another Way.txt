Presenting the Good News—Another Way
1 In order to carry out our commission to make disciples, we endeavor to start home Bible studies with those who show interest. The Bible study work has been effective in assisting many thousands to become true disciples of Jesus Christ. However, what might we do where someone displays some interest in the Bible and yet shows resistance to becoming involved in a formal study of some publication?
2 Here is where the Christian teacher can learn to be flexible, adaptable, ready to cover the study material in another way. The apostle Paul was successful in being flexible, and he recommends his example to us.—1 Cor. 9:19-23; 11:1.
3 When someone is willing to discuss only the Bible, but not with the aid of another book, some publishers have found it very effective to go along with the wishes of such a person, and they convey the good news successfully. One way of doing this is to jot down on notepaper that will fit into your Bible six to eight key scriptures from a chapter of the Truth book. Most of us are very familiar with this publication. We know the Scripture texts and understand them well. So if we use the key scriptures from one of the chapters and have the context well in mind, we can carry on a lively conversation with the interested person based on these key Bible texts. We ought to endeavor to guide the conversation, keeping it progressive and on the main points brought out in the Scripture references, while at the same time allowing the other person to express himself. In handling the call in this way we will really be covering information brought out in the book, theme by theme, but the householder will not feel tied to a formal study.
4 If you are experiencing difficulties with starting studies in your territory you may wish to try this way of teaching where someone is willing to have a discussion.

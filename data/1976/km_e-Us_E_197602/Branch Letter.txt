Branch Letter
Dear Kingdom Publishers:
Here we are in 1976 just as eager to preach the good news as at any time before. We still have the assignment from Christ Jesus, “Go . . . make disciples of people of all the nations,” and this we are earnestly trying to do. As we know, the three new booklets are designed to aid in this. How many of them have you placed? Have they assisted you to start a new study?
Our brothers in Malawi and in Mozambique do not have all the printed aids that we do, but they continue to praise Jehovah. Even the vicious persecution that has come on them has resulted in the giving of a tremendous witness. (Phil. 1:12-14) We have at hand reports from all parts of the United States, besides Kenya, South Africa, Hong Kong, Malaysia, England, Canada and France, telling what is happening to our brothers in Malawi. Copies of the Awake! report on Malawi were furnished to representatives to the United Nations, to all U.S. congressman and senators. We know of over seventy radio stations that have carried the story. At least ten TV stations have featured it. Thus the world is hearing what is happening to Jehovah’s people because they uphold God’s kingdom. All of this contributes to the separating of people as foretold in Matthew 25:31-46.
Some time ago, you may recall, we announced the purchase of a large new printing press, but the manufacturers are slow in making delivery. They promised it for June, and then October and then December, and now for February. We hope it will be soon. But, regardless, we will use the equipment that we have and will gladly provide all the literature that you may need. Keep making good use of it in the field while there is still freedom to do so. Remember, our brothers in Malawi cannot go from house to house, but we can.
Your brothers,
BROOKLYN BRANCH OFFICE

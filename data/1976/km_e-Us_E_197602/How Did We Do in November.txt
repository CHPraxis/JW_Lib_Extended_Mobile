How Did We Do in November?
How marvelous it was to see 577,362 sharing in Kingdom service and the disciple-making work during November! We exceeded the previous peak in publishers, May 1975, by 16,465! Yes, honest-hearted ones continue responding to the good news of the Kingdom, and what a pleasure it is to help them. In all, we have now had six Kingdom News distribution campaigns, and during each of these months new peaks in publishers were reached.
Another wholesome development was that publishers averaged 10.4 hours during November, a nice increase from the 9.2 hour average of October. The more time we spend in field service, the more people have opportunity to hear the truth. As all of us utilize every opportunity to start Bible studies with the use of the three new booklets, surely more people will be attracted to the truth and the Christian way of life.

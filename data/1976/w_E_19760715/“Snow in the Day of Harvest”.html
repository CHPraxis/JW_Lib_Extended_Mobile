<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">● At <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:25:13-20:25:13" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Proverbs 25:13</a>, the refreshing effect of a faithful envoy upon those sending him forth is compared to the “coolness of snow in the day of harvest.” Evidently this refers to the refreshing coolness of a drink chilled with snow from the mountains, something that would be greatly appreciated by those working hard in the harvest.</p>

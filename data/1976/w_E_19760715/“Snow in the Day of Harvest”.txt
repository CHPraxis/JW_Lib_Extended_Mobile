“Snow in the Day of Harvest”
● At Proverbs 25:13, the refreshing effect of a faithful envoy upon those sending him forth is compared to the “coolness of snow in the day of harvest.” Evidently this refers to the refreshing coolness of a drink chilled with snow from the mountains, something that would be greatly appreciated by those working hard in the harvest.

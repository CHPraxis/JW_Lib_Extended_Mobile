<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">● In a village of western Africa, one of Jehovah’s Christian witnesses left a copy of <em>The Watchtower </em>at a non-Christian religious edifice. The caretaker of that building later announced to the villagers, ‘An angel of God has brought a message to the village,’ and held up the magazine. He then took it upon himself to say that anyone wanting a blessing from God should contribute ten cents or more for a piece or page of the magazine.</p>

Bible Truth Spreads in an Unusual Way
● In a village of western Africa, one of Jehovah’s Christian witnesses left a copy of The Watchtower at a non-Christian religious edifice. The caretaker of that building later announced to the villagers, ‘An angel of God has brought a message to the village,’ and held up the magazine. He then took it upon himself to say that anyone wanting a blessing from God should contribute ten cents or more for a piece or page of the magazine.
One elderly man bought a page. What he read on that one page was enough to arouse his interest in the Bible’s message. Soon he began studying the Scriptures with Jehovah’s Witnesses and made excellent progress.

Come to the “Sacred Service” Assembly!
ALL dedicated Christian worshipers of Jehovah God, take note! Also all you persons interested in knowing more about God and the Bible! All of you are invited to attend one of the “Sacred Service” District Assemblies that are to be held throughout the world beginning in the summer of 1976. Last year, according to partial reports received from 36 countries, at least 2,375,681 persons attended. How many will attend this year? Will you be one of them? You will be greatly blessed if you are!
This assembly will provide just what you need in the way of spiritual food. Each day will feature one aspect of a Christian’s sacred service. The theme of the first day is “Sacred Service as a Family.” Among other things the program will deal with family problems and will spell out what is required of Christian husbands and wives. Especially will all young folks benefit from the talk “What Does Youth Want out of Life?”
“Your Sacred Service in the Congregation” is the theme of the second day. Our need of Jehovah’s organization will be highlighted. Also, how elders can cooperate with one another and how all can derive more benefit from the circuit overseer’s visit. As a rule, the baptism will take place on this day, the subject of the talk being “Baptism Opens the Door to Sacred Service.”
The theme of the third day will be “Sacred Service in the Field.” Encouragement will be given to make our field presentations more Biblical. How we can make the most of all our opportunities will also be discussed, as well as how to be more fruitful in making disciples and our privilege to devote more time to witnessing.
“Enduring in Sacred Service” is the theme of the fourth and final day of the assembly. The need to keep the right mental attitude regardless of the time will be stressed. Also, how we can stand firm in faith and how prayer can help us. The public talk “Will Serving Jehovah Solve Your Problems?” should prove to be most helpful to the public and especially to those newly interested. The assembly will close with two talks that should deepen our appreciation of all the good things heard and stimulate us to act on what we have learned.
A new feature of this assembly will be that from the second day on, the program will begin with a review of the previous day’s highlights. And each day a drama will be presented, two based on Biblical events and two in modern settings. Before the Assembly, it is suggested that you read Second Kings chapters 22 and 23, and Daniel chapters 1 and 3.
Are you conscious of your spiritual need? (Matt. 5:3) Then put forth all possible effort, yes, leave no stone unturned, to attend one of the “Sacred Service” District Assemblies.

International Conventions, 1978
God’s Word clearly states that the “scene of this world is changing.” (1 Cor. 7:31) Despite the increasing uncertainty and tension as the present system of things nears its end, the activity of God’s people must move ahead in having the “everlasting good news” declared in all the earth. (Rev. 14:6) Therefore, if it be Jehovah’s will, a series of international conventions will be held during the year 1978. Announcement at this time will provide opportunity for the brothers to make vacation plans and other essential preparations.
A five-day program will be presented at each convention. In the northern hemisphere the conventions will likely fall within the months of June, July and August, and in the southern hemisphere during the months of December 1978 and January 1979. There will be a limited number of large conventions in the United States, Canada and other large countries. Also, group movements of delegates will be arranged for travel to specific regions abroad, such as the Caribbean, Central America, South America, Scandinavia, Europe, West Africa, Asia, South Pacific, and Israel.
At each convention we hope to have special programs in languages other than the local native tongue, particularly where the number of foreign delegates warrants this.
In due course the Society will take a survey in all congregations to determine how many plan to travel in one of the Watchtower Tour group movements to a foreign region and attend several conventions. It is expected that some of our group convention movements will originate in lands other than the United States and Canada.
We suggest that any correspondence to the Society on the subject be delayed until after we take a preliminary survey through the congregations.

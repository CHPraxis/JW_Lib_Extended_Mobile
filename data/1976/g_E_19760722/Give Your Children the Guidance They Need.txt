Give Your Children the Guidance They Need
The key to protecting children against drugs is to teach them Bible principles.
One thirteen-year-old said: “The kids nowadays have nothing to believe in, like me, I had nothing to believe in. I lived to get ‘high.’”
But this youth changed. Bible instruction helped!
The book Listening to the Great Teacher, based on the teachings of Jesus Christ, can help you to protect your children against drugs. Read with them the chapter “Tempted by the Devil.” This hard-covered, illustrated book of 192 pages is yours for only 25 cents, postpaid.

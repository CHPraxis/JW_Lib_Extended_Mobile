Good Conduct Unites a Family
WHEN people begin changing their lives to bring them into harmony with God’s will, family members are at first not always favorably impressed. Eventually, however, they may come to appreciate the beneficial changes one has made and therefore themselves begin studying the Bible.
This was the experience of a man in the Republic of San Marino. His bad habits made a happy homelife impossible. Rather than spending time at home with his family he was often at a bar in the evening. Disturbed about his way of life, he prayed to God for help in shaking off his bad habits. Later, while visiting his mother one day, he learned that she was studying the Bible with Jehovah’s Witnesses. He began attending this study, but this only gave rise to family opposition_ His wife took no interest in what he was learning. She even threatened to leave him and take the children.
Then, one day, this man got into an argument with his father-in-law about family matters. His father-in-law got so angry that he struck his son-in-law with his fists. Even though the son-in-law knew that he was right, he did not retaliate. He forgave his father-in-law and harbored no resentment against him. Impressed by the conduct of her husband in this matter, the wife began to investigate the beliefs that her husband had accepted. She started attending the meetings of Jehovah’s Witnesses. Commenting on developments thereafter, the husband says: “I began a Bible study with my children and my wife, and it is a joy to see how she is making progress and how we are now a united family.”

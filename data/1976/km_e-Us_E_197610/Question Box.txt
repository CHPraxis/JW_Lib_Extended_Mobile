Question Box
‚óè To what extent can ministerial servants who are not especially good speakers be used on the service meeting program?
Some ministerial servants who are not especially good speakers nevertheless are encouraging and helpful to others, loyally and regularly support all congregational arrangements, are zealous in the field service and thus have the respect and the love of the congregation. It would be for the elders to decide to what extent they might be used on the service meeting. An elder or a more capable ministerial servant could be assigned as chairman of the part and others can be used to share in the assignment according to their ability. Thus the congregation benefits by hearing from such brothers occasionally on the service meeting, and these brothers are encouraged by being appropriately used on the platform.
There are some brothers who are not yet appointed as ministerial servants but who have good speaking ability, show a good spirit, and have the respect of the congregation. Can they be used on the service meeting? Again, it is up to the elders to decide. Such ones might be fitted into an assignment under the chairmanship of an elder. Arranging to have these brothers thus assigned could add interest and variety to the program.
We will still want to keep in mind, however, the high standard that the Bible sets for those who teach and the need to use only qualified speakers as chairmen. (Please see Question Box of January and February 1975 Kingdom Ministry.) The arrangement for younger and newer brothers to receive training and experience in speaking is not through the service meeting, but through the Theocratic School, commenting at meetings and field service. It is the elders who have the primary responsibility to teach on the service meeting. We hope the observations made above will provide a balanced view without detracting from the high standard of instruction we should receive at our service meetings.

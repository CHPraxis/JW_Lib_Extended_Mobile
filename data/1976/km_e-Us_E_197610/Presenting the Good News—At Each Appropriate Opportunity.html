<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>Are you prepared to talk about the truth as you go about your daily tasks? Jesus and his apostles were. Whether it was when they had especially set aside time for public witnessing or when simply making a stop at a well or marketplace, they were prepared to talk. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:4:7-43:4:26" data-bid="1-1" class="b">John 4:7-26;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:17:17-44:17:17" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Acts 17:17</a>) We likewise should have a keen desire to share the good news and be prepared to do so at times other than those regularly set aside for witnessing. We may be in the middle of something not directly related to the preaching work, but when an opportunity presents itself we should take advantage of it.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>Many opportunities for informal witnessing present themselves. A sister may be busy with housework when a salesman calls. She might ask “Does anyone ask you if you are one of Jehovah’s Witnesses?” This could lead to her giving a witness. At work or school there may be opportunities during lunch breaks to explain why we do not participate in some things others do. There may be opportunities to explain our view of holidays, honesty and respect for authority. Our good conduct may cause others to raise questions along this line.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:3:15-60:3:15" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Pet. 3:15</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>Using public transportation provides many occasions to share the truth. Some publishers always carry copies of <em>The Watchtower </em>or <em>Awake! </em>or some other literature to read. Then noting that some around them have nothing to read, they do the kind thing and offer them something to read to help them to pass the time. This too calls for planning in advance as to how to turn such an occasion into an opportunity to forward the Kingdom interests.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>Confinement in a hospital or visits there present excellent opportunities for informal witnessing. Many prepare in advance, taking along a variety of literature and jotting down scriptures such as those having to do with Jehovah’s view of blood. They are ready then to talk with doctors, nurses and others as opportunities open up. You may have to spend several days in a room with others who are convalescing. Talk with them about your hope. Many have learned the truth in this way.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>One sister, who spent quite a lot of time in hospitals as a patient recently, had a number of fine experiences witnessing to the hospital staff. She asked one nurse if it had required much discipline to learn her profession. The sister commented that she also had exercised considerable discipline to become a teacher of the Bible. The nurse had some questions on prayer, and so arrangements were made to talk with her again later that day during her time off. A discussion followed during which she showed considerable interest and took the <em>Truth </em>book.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup>Many of us are in the truth today because our interest was first kindled through some casual contact with God’s people. We should leave no avenue untried in an effort to preach God’s Word before the end of this system. Why not think more about the opportunities you have for informal witnessing? Give thought in advance as to how you will take advantage of them. Be prepared so that you will be able to present the good news at every appropriate opportunity.</p>

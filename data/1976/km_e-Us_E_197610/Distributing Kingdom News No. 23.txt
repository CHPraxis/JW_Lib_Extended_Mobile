Distributing Kingdom News No. 23
From November 5 to 14 we will have the privilege of distributing Kingdom News No. 23 entitled “Why So Much Suffering—If God Cares?” So that we will be sure to give this message the best possible distribution in our territories, it would be good to begin organizing now. The elders and ministerial servants in charge of the various departments involved can start getting things in order so that territory and supplies can be handed out to publishers well in advance. Special meetings for field service can be arranged beforehand and the publishers informed.
Be sure to make this ten-day period one of increased activity. With the elders taking oversight to see that the work is well organized and with all publishers setting aside extra time to share in this special effort, Jehovah’s blessing will surely be evident and the work will be accomplished smoothly and on time by our 7,324 congregations.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A total of 547,122 publishers shared in the preaching and teaching work in October, the highest number out in one month since we established the peak of 560,897 in May 1975. Very encouraging indeed! But what about hours, studies, etc.? Here is something for all of us to think about soberly! Together we devoted 7,727,176 hours to the field service, 750,669 less than October of last year. We conducted 289,339 home Bible studies, which was 21,760 less than last year. Reports from Bible-study-minded publishers show that they are still finding persons in the field with whom they start home Bible studies. If there are lives yet to be saved, then surely we will want to be active, giving such worthy ones the opportunity to hear!</p>

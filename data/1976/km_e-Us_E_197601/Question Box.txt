Question Box
● Is it proper to write the Society’s branch office to ask that lodging be provided with brothers in your own or another country or in the city where the branch office is located?
The work of the Society’s branch office is to advance the preaching and teaching of the good news about God’s kingdom. Arranging for temporary or permanent accommodations for travelers is a personal matter. No provision has been made at any branch office for supplying information regarding brothers with whom one might find accommodations on a temporary or a permanent basis. Persons wanting such information should obtain it from personal sources instead of writing to the Society or visiting one of its offices for this purpose. However, the Society’s branch offices can provide information as to times and places of congregation meetings and, when necessary, can usually offer suggestions as to where public accommodations for lodging are available.
In connection with assemblies, a special department is set up to handle rooming accommodations. Those planning to attend a particular convention should write to the rooming department in the assembly city; however, if the rooming department address is unknown, someone wishing to attend an assembly in another country may mail his room request form to the branch office for forwarding to the convention rooming department.

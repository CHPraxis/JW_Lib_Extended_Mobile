<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">“As a thorny weed has come up into the hand of a drunkard,” says <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:26:9-20:26:9" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Proverbs 26:9</a>, “so a proverb into the mouth of stupid people.” One who is intoxicated can injure himself or others as with a thorny weed. Similarly, the person lacking understanding can do damage by misusing a proverb, applying it in a way that does not fit.</p>

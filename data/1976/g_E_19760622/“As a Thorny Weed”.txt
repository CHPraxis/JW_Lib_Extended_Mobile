“As a Thorny Weed”
“As a thorny weed has come up into the hand of a drunkard,” says Proverbs 26:9, “so a proverb into the mouth of stupid people.” One who is intoxicated can injure himself or others as with a thorny weed. Similarly, the person lacking understanding can do damage by misusing a proverb, applying it in a way that does not fit.

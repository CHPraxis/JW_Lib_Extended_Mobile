<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Is it reasonable to believe that it did? Is life the result of just simple chemical combinations and reactions?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><em>Scientific American </em>of September 1973 observed: “Life itself is an awe-inspiring multitude of natural chemical reactions. Sir Macfarlane Burnet put it succinctly: ‘It is very humbling to realize that there is more information packed into the head of one spermatozoon [microscopic male reproductive cell] than there is in all the volumes of the <em>Journal of Biochemistry.”’​</em>—Page 103.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Surely the amazing complexity of life supports the Bible’s explanation that life came about, not as a result of chance combinations and reactions of chemicals, but by the creative power of God.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:36:9-19:36:9" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ps. 36:9</a>.</p>

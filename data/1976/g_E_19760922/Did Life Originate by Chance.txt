Did Life Originate by Chance?
Is it reasonable to believe that it did? Is life the result of just simple chemical combinations and reactions?
Scientific American of September 1973 observed: “Life itself is an awe-inspiring multitude of natural chemical reactions. Sir Macfarlane Burnet put it succinctly: ‘It is very humbling to realize that there is more information packed into the head of one spermatozoon [microscopic male reproductive cell] than there is in all the volumes of the Journal of Biochemistry.”’​—Page 103.
Surely the amazing complexity of life supports the Bible’s explanation that life came about, not as a result of chance combinations and reactions of chemicals, but by the creative power of God.​—Ps. 36:9.

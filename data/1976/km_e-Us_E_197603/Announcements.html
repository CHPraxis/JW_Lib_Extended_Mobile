<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn">◆ <em>Kingdom News </em>No. 22 will be distributed from May 1 to 10. The Society will consign tracts to each congregation without these being ordered. The number sent to each congregation will be at the rate of 100 per publisher, including regular and special pioneers, based on the peak number of publishers so far during the 1976 service year. If you receive more than needed, inform the office in writing of the number you wish sent next time. Special pioneers <em>in isolated territory </em>will be sent their supply directly from the Society. This time, circuit and district overseers, and special pioneers with congregations, will obtain tracts from congregation’s supply.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sh">◆ The Society is again arranging for a limited number of regular pioneers to serve temporarily as special pioneers in isolated territory during two or three summer months. The minimum requirement will be 150 hours in field service. Each assignment is organized for a team of two. Before writing to the Society, arrangements should be made for a partner (give partner’s name when writing) and a car that is in good condition. Some financial assistance will be provided.</p>

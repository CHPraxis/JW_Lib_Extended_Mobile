<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">“Good morning. My name is . . . I am making brief calls on neighbors this morning to share with them God’s promise of a world without crime [other conditions could be used, if preferred]. Of course, conditions are getting so bad today that many sincere people are saying, ‘Where is all of this heading? Will things ever get better?’ Perhaps you have given this some thought, too. [Permit reply, if person inclined.] Did you know that Jesus foretold the very things we are experiencing today? Note his words here as quoted from the Bible. [Hand extra copy of March 15 issue to householder and, after directing attention to quotation of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:21:25-42:21:26" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Luke 21:25, 26,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:21:28-42:21:28" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 28</a> on page 163, read from your copy.] Note, while Jesus knew these bad times were coming, he gave a real basis for hope. Things will not just keep getting worse with no hope of relief. This article in <em>The Watchtower </em>[point to title of article] discusses how God will soon remove these wicked conditions and bring peace and happiness to mankind. Notice what is stated in conclusion on page 164. [Read next-to-last paragraph of article.] This article is a sample of what is published in <em>The Watchtower </em>every two weeks. I am sure you would enjoy having it come to you regularly so you may benefit from its encouraging message. I can arrange for twenty-four issues to come to you during the year for only $1.50.”</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">â—† Fighting between opposing forces in Beirut, Lebanon, has forced brothers there to confine their meetings and field service to daylight hours. Meetings are held in small groups. One sister was killed by a sniper as she was hanging clothing to dry on the roof. Several brothers were abducted and later released. One was badly beaten. Some in the mountain villages were able to hold their circuit assembly. All rejoice that they can continue to praise Jehovah despite these difficulties.</p>

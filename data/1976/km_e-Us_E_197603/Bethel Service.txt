Bethel Service
Those desiring to enter Bethel service will be interested to know that there is a new application form. Persons now being called to Bethel are asked to stay for one year as a ‘test of their fitness first,’ and at the end of that year they may request to remain and continue their service. (1 Tim. 3:10) It is hoped that many will take advantage of this privilege of full-time service.
Those applying should be at least 19 years of age and not over 35. It should be kept in mind that much of the work at Bethel requires strong, healthy young men. If you are interested in serving Jehovah in this very special way, you may request an application form by writing to the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society of New York, Inc. (Attention: Personnel Committee), 124 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn, New York 11201.

Branch Letter
Dear Kingdom Publishers:
For us March and April always prove to be busy and happy months. We all look forward to the special activities arranged. Have you considered temporary pioneering for a month, or even for two weeks? It will be an ideal time for many to enroll as temporary pioneers, especially young folks who will be on school vacation for a few days. Last March over 9,000 enrolled, and in April, over 17,000. Perhaps many more will be able to serve as temporary pioneers this year.
Why not talk it over as a family or with several others in the congregation? Parental encouragement may be just what is needed to help many young ones to taste the joys of temporary pioneering. One young sister wrote the Society: “With much encouragement from my family and with Jehovah’s blessing, I found that I could pioneer a half day of each school day. It really sharpened my appreciation of the privilege and joy of serving Jehovah and helping people in these last days. In addition it has served as a protection from the influences of worldly schoolmates.”
Yes, pioneer service brings blessings! Recently, after a zone visit to the branches in Mexico and Central America, Brother Knorr particularly mentioned that missionaries from early classes of Gilead are still serving there. That means that they have enjoyed full-time service, as pioneers and in Bethel homes, for over thirty years! In Mexico, Brother Knorr said, 81,371 persons are now publishing.
While some of us may not be able to be pioneers, all of us can continue to encourage the youths and share with them in the increased service activities at this time of the year. May your blessings be many.
Your brothers,
BROOKLYN BRANCH OFFICE

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">We rejoice with the 4,342 who symbolized their dedication by baptism this month. Also, it was gratifying to see that 12,376 more publishers shared in field service than in December 1974. However, there were other features of the report to which we can give thoughtful consideration. For example, the number of hours devoted to preaching was 365,674 less than one year ago. So, can we all increase our opportunities to share the good news, even though winter months make it somewhat more difficult?</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">NEARLY a million worshipers of Jehovah and interested persons in the United States are looking forward to the summer of 1976 with keen anticipation. Why? Because of the spiritual blessings they know are in store for them at the district assemblies being arranged. Ninety-four assemblies are planned for the continental United States this summer.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Think of what it will mean to attend one of these assemblies! While here you are away from most contact with worldly people and can enjoy to the full the association of your brothers. Their speech is wholesome and they desire to improve their spirituality. That is one thing that makes assemblies of Jehovah’s witnesses so outstanding, for at them one can witness Christian principles in operation on a major scale. Besides receiving counsel and instruction through the convention program, everyone present will be a recipient of the spirit of the occasion. Also, God’s spirit will be there. This one fact alone makes attending worth while.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Furthermore, to see thousands of people working together out of love, willingly giving of themselves without pay, is a profound blessing in this day and age. To behold men, women and children singing together, learning and praying together is uplifting and faith-strengthening. What joy these large gatherings bring to all of Jehovah’s people! Will you, too, be present this summer to show your appreciation? Our prayer is that everyone will be able to attend an assembly. The following information is being provided to assist you to benefit to the full from the fine provisions made at each convention.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><strong>OUR CHRISTIAN CONDUCT: </strong>How we conduct ourselves while attending assemblies is very important. Not only does good conduct make things pleasant for others, but it can serve as a fine witness to outsiders. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:2:12-60:2:12" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Pet. 2:12</a>) Any who accept our invitation to attend the assembly ought to be able to see by our conduct that we truly reflect unselfish love and concern for others. Thus it is good to remind ourselves of the importance of being thoughtful and considerate. We are Jehovah’s people. When we get together we want to reflect this fact wholeheartedly, both at the assembly grounds and throughout the assembly city. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:3:23-51:3:23" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Col. 3:23</a>) By the way we conduct ourselves we bring honor or dishonor to Jehovah’s great name. By being patient, cooperative and taking the lead “in showing honor to one another,” we will cause others to say, “God is really among you.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:12:10-45:12:10" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Rom. 12:10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:14:25-46:14:25" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 1 Cor. 14:25</a>) Remember, Jesus said: “By this all will know that you are my disciples, if you have love among yourselves.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:13:35-43:13:35" data-bid="4-1" class="b">John 13:35</a>) Love, unselfish consideration for others, is essential in operating the assemblies of Jehovah’s people.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">A number of situations arise at conventions where we have the opportunity to manifest our Christian love and consideration for others. For example, the Society has for a number of years worked diligently to arrange for convention sites having ample capacity to seat all who were expected to attend. At most assemblies this has worked out successfully.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">However, it has been noted that even at the many facilities where there are far more seats available than those actually in attendance, there still has often been a problem for persons desiring to find a seat in which to sit. Many times they have been unable to find a seat because someone has needlessly put something on the seat beside him either to save it or to serve as a place to keep his belongings. How thoughtful and considerate, yes, loving, to keep our belongings under our own seat, on our lap or in the checkroom so that those who are looking for seats will know what seats are available without having to ask as they walk along the aisles. It shows courtesy to occupy <em>only one seat.</em></p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">A balanced view, of course, would indicate that in certain instances some could save a seat or two for good reason. Families may need seats together; volunteer workers may be coming to sit with their families soon after the sessions begin; individuals may momentarily leave to go to the washroom; also, interested persons may be coming to occupy seats next to Witnesses who have arranged to sit with them. The loving thing in such instances would be to save the seats for a reasonable length of time. However, when we place objects on blocks of seats for persons in our congregation or others who are capable of finding seats for themselves, is this showing love for those who really need seats at that time? Is this “keeping an eye, not in personal interest upon just your own matters, but also in personal interest upon those of the others”?—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:2:4-50:2:4" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Phil. 2:4</a>.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">In the past, seats have sometimes been saved and never occupied during an entire session. People were forced to stand or go to a place where they could not see or even hear well, thereby missing that whole portion of the program. Thus, if we are holding a seat or two and the session starts, our Christian conscience should move us to relinquish any seats we are saving, unless we know that those who were sitting there will return soon. Please cooperate with the attendants in these matters.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">It has also been observed that at some facilities numbers of brothers have arranged to be at the gates or doors of the convention building by five or six o’clock in the morning so that they would be there when the building opened and could rush in to save whole sections of seats, very often the very choicest ones, by laying magazines and books on them. When we stop to think about this, could we say that doing this truly reflects well upon our Christian personality? Truly, at an assembly of Jehovah’s people the principle prevailing should be that “love . . . does not behave indecently, does not look for its own interests.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:13:4-46:13:5" data-bid="6-1" class="b">1 Cor. 13:4, 5</a>) How refreshing it is, instead, to see others, including younger persons, freely offer their seats to elderly or infirm persons who may not have found a place to sit and listen. By such loving concern for others we honor our God, Jehovah, who has taught us what love really is.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">During sessions, it is important to remember others around us and to be considerate. If we engage in conversation with family and friends while the program is going on, we not only miss vital instruction ourselves but also disturb others nearby. Endeavor to plan each day’s activities so that, when the sessions begin, you will be in your seat and ready to give full attention to the spiritual food that <span id="page4" class="pageNum" data-no="4" data-before-text="4"></span>Jehovah has arranged. If a small child begins to cry, and you are unable to quiet him after a few moments, it shows loving consideration to take him to an area where he will not disturb others.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">When children are sitting with their parents at assemblies and paying attention, this is a fine thing to see. But this is not something that can be left to chance. As parents, do we always arrange to have our children sit with us and keep them with us, even before and after the sessions? Or do we just let them roam around the assembly grounds at will? Attendants have had to speak to such children and even take them to their parents and explain what they have done. Even children of Witness parents have a few times thoughtlessly or deliberately committed acts of vandalism or involved themselves in mischief that has harmed persons and property. This, of course, results in detracting considerably from the good name of Jehovah and his people, to the point of actually at times bringing reproach on the organization, thus requiring that local elders look into such matters. So why not make a real effort to keep your children with you at the assembly and help them to enjoy its blessings even more by your loving companionship? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:6:7-5:6:7" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Deut. 6:7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:31:12-5:31:12" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 31:12</a>) In this way the good conduct of our children will also bring praise to Jehovah.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">There are other occasions also when our good conduct at assemblies reflects favorably on us and our Creator, Jehovah. If others are waiting in line at a food or literature counter, how fine it is to avoid crowding in front, but rather wait patiently for our turn or even perhaps offer our place to someone in need of extra consideration. Occasionally we may see a new person or a child who does not display Christian qualities as fully as we feel he should, but instead of losing our Christian composure, we should look upon it as an opportunity to set the example for such ones in Christian kindness and patience. We realize that they lack experience and it is our hope that by their being at the assembly and listening and learning from the example of mature servants of Jehovah they will eventually progress in Christian stature.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Sharing in keeping the assembly grounds clean is a good way that we can set an example of cleanliness. It is helpful if we not only dispose of any trash in the proper receptacle, but also look under seats and elsewhere after the sessions are over to pick up what may have been dropped and dispose of it properly. This is the loving thing to do also in consideration of those who have volunteered for cleaning the premises, making their job easier.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">By far the majority of Jehovah’s witnesses, both young and old, at such large assemblies have proven themselves to be fine Christians in conduct and attitude and this has not gone unnoticed by others, even those outside of the organization. Note the comments made by the supervisor in charge of a coliseum in Arizona at an assembly last year: “You seem like one big family, an organized group, not like five thousand kids running mayhem around the building. I don’t know how you people do it! Your children are very well mannered, not many children crying like at other events. You folks are really special. I hope you come back and use our facilities again, come back again, please.” A security guard for the same coliseum said: “Your surroundings are clean and no one throws trash on the floor, children even put their papers in the trash receptacle. The children are well behaved.”</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">Such experiences show us that when we reflect the fruitage of God’s spirit in all our activities and especially at our conventions, Jehovah’s great name truly is honored by what we do. Christian love on the part of both young and old as expressed by good manners, which may include saying ‘Thank you,’ apologizing, etc., will also work toward the enjoyment of the assembly by everyone. (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:4:10-2:4:10" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Exodus 4:10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:18:27-1:18:27" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> Genesis 18:27;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:19:2-1:19:2" data-bid="8-3" class="b"> 19:2</a>.) Many other fine points on our conduct in such matters are discussed in <em>The Watchtower </em>of June 15, 1970, under the heading “Showing Love for One Another at Assemblies.”</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb"><strong>WHAT TO WEAR?: </strong>Another way in which we can contribute to the fine atmosphere of the assembly is to dress appropriately for the occasion. Remember, many new ones are in attendance at assemblies. They have been told that Jehovah’s witnesses dress modestly, in good taste, and that they avoid the appearance of worldly people. But what if they now attend the assembly and find many dressed otherwise? This is one reason why it is important to dress with good taste and not according to the extreme tastes of worldly people. If you are doubtful that some kind of dress would be appropriate, then it is best not to wear it. By following good standards of modesty you can help to adorn the assembly in a spiritual way.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:2:9-54:2:10" data-bid="9-1" class="b">1 Tim. 2:9, 10</a>.</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb"><strong>ROOMING: </strong>During April the Society will send a supply of Room Request forms to each congregation, on which will be printed the address of the rooming headquarters for each assembly. This will be in ample time for all to complete their arrangements to attend. Some choose to contact hotels and motels themselves and make arrangements, but often more economical arrangements can be made through the convention rooming department. When you receive your copy of the Room Request form from your congregation, please fill it out very carefully and mail it directly to the rooming headquarters address for the assembly city where you will be attending (NOT to the Society), doing so <em>no earlier than six weeks ahead of the date of the assembly you have selected.</em></p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">If you receive a rooming assignment and later have to change your plans and cannot accept it, please send word (1) to the landlord, whose name and address are shown on your assignment card, and (2) to the convention rooming department so that the room may be reassigned. When rooming assignments are made by the convention the landlord is advised of the name and address and date of arrival of the ones assigned. Many householders purchase linens, fix up the rooms, rearrange their own families for sleeping, etc., to accommodate those coming, and they have a right to expect those assigned to be there. If one assigned is unable to take the assignment and fails to notify the landlord in advance, normally the one renting the room(s) might consider that the brother or sister actually owes the money for the room, since Christians are to be true to their word in all things. Whether you stay in a private home or hotel, be courteous and exemplary in conduct, and be considerate in using the facilities.</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">There will be no trailer camps at the conventions, but the convention rooming department for each assembly will gladly furnish available information on commercial or other trailer parking facilities if there are such places available in that area.</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb"><span id="page5" class="pageNum" data-no="5" data-before-text="5"></span><strong>VOLUNTEER SERVICE: </strong>Jesus Christ, the Son of God, said: “There is more happiness in giving than there is in receiving.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:20:35-44:20:35" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Acts 20:35</a>) There will be ample opportunity at the assemblies to give of one’s abilities and talents to serve the needs of others. There will be plenty of opportunity for all who willingly offer themselves to work side by side with Christian brothers and sisters of various races and nationalities to care for the assembly departments and needs. Such serving, motivated by love, will cause their joy to be full, because they find pleasure in assisting their Christian brothers.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:110:3-19:110:3" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Ps. 110:3</a>.</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">Why not plan to volunteer as individuals or as family groups? Younger children can work under the supervision of parents or older members of the family. Brothers having families could perhaps volunteer to serve as attendants in sections where they will be sitting with their families. If you cannot serve all four days, your doing so for any other period of time will be very much appreciated and helpful.</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">The department heads know that everyone wants to hear the program. So, to the extent possible, they endeavor to arrange matters so that those who volunteer are able to hear as much as possible. When there are enough volunteers, it is possible for nearly everyone to hear the entire program.</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">Application for Volunteer Service forms should be filled out completely and signed by your presiding overseer and then <em>sent to the rooming address for the convention city you will attend </em>(NOT to the Society). If you later find that you are unable to serve in your assignment, please advise the volunteer service department at the assembly city of the change. During April the Society will send a supply of Volunteer Service forms to each congregation for use by the publishers.</p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb"><strong>TRAVEL ARRANGEMENTS: </strong>Do you have room in your automobile for a pioneer, someone that does not have a car, an elderly brother or sister who needs special help, or an interested person who wants to attend? Make their joy complete as you share in this greater happiness of giving in their behalf.</p>
<p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb"><strong>A WORD OF CAUTION: </strong>Regardless of the assembly you attend, you should lock your car at ALL times and NEVER leave anything showing in a parked car. Keep your belongings locked inside the trunk of your car. Also, beware of pickpockets. They often mingle in large crowds. And, for the same reason, do not leave anything of value unattended on seats at the convention.</p>
<p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb"><strong>CONVENTION PIONEER IDENTIFICATION: </strong>Regular pioneers who were appointed on or before February 1, 1976, will be sent the Convention Pioneer Identification for use at a district assembly during the service year. These will be sent to the presiding overseer along with the monthly statement for May. Pioneers, be sure to bring your Convention Pioneer Identification to the assembly and treat it as cash, as no replacements will be available. It can be used to obtain the regular food tickets at the assembly. It will also be needed to obtain literature from the bookroom at pioneer rates.</p>
<p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sb"><strong>FIELD SERVICE: </strong>Starting the weekend prior to each assembly and on until the day before the program begins, there will be a concerted effort made in and around the assembly city to invite the public to attend the entire program. Millions of handbills are being printed for special house-to-house distribution. Publishers living in the assembly cities and nearby will be invited to share. If you plan to travel from out of town to an assembly, could you arrange to arrive a day or two early to share in this work? If so, request your rooming accommodations accordingly. And on arrival at the assembly city go to the address of the rooming department for territory and handbill supplies.</p>
<p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="sb">Why not also plan to spend some time while in the assembly city, either in the morning or in the evening, engaging in informal witnessing on your way to the sessions or when returning to your accommodations? Take advantage of every opportunity to speak about the good news and to invite everyone possible to attend the assembly, especially those in whose home you may be staying. If any of the handbills remain from the special distribution, these may be obtained at the bookroom and used to aid in such informal witnessing.</p>
<p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="sb"><strong>PROGRAM TIMES: </strong>The program for the assemblies, in most cases, will begin on Thursday morning at 9:55. Arrange to be there then. Do not miss anything on the program. At most locations, the immersion will be on Friday and those who have made a dedication and who wish to symbolize this by water baptism at an assembly should have gone over the eighty questions with the elders before convention time. Bathing suits and towels should be brought from home by each one who plans to be baptized. We encourage you to arrange your schedule so you do not have to leave the convention prior to 4:00 p.m. on Sunday, when the convention closes.</p>
<p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="sb">Please note that variations of the above schedule are that the Spanish-language assembly in Inglewood, California, on June 27-30, will have the program run from Sunday through Wednesday. Also, for the Elmont, N.Y., assembly on August 4-7 the program will run from Wednesday through Saturday and for the assembly on August 8-11 the program will run from Sunday through Wednesday. We encourage those who will attend these particular assemblies to keep in mind that the full program will be presented and so you will not miss any portion of the program by attending one of these. The baptism for the above-mentioned Inglewood Spanish-language assembly and the Elmont assemblies will be planned for the second day of each assembly.</p>
<p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="sb">To assist you in making plans to attend one of the 94 district assemblies, the following chart is being provided to indicate the assembly city nearest each circuit throughout the continental United States. Therefore, to the extent possible, we recommend that you attend the convention shown for your circuit unless vacation plans or other circumstances make it more convenient for you to attend elsewhere. In some cases it is necessary to balance the size of the crowd with the seating facilities available and so some congregations in those circuits marked with an asterisk (*) may be slightly closer to another convention city, but it would be best, if possible, to attend the assembly indicated so there will be plenty of room. Where the chart indicates that a portion of a circuit attend a particular assembly, such as 1/2 or 1/4, etc., it simply means that those living in the part of the circuit closest to that assembly would attend where indicated, <span id="page6" class="pageNum" data-no="6" data-before-text="6"></span>but the rest of the circuit would attend another assembly closest to them as shown on the list as well. There are also listed a number of cities where two or three assemblies are being held in succession and we are recommending that the brothers in the circuits listed in the chart attend during the particular week indicated, to the extent possible, to assure adequate seating for everyone.</p>
<p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="sb">Note: It has become necessary to change the dates for the Billings, Montana, assembly from June 24-27 to July 8-11.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>We have been using the three new booklets for two months in starting studies, and likely by now you are just about completing one of the booklets with those who have been willing to study. What progress is it reasonable to expect at this point? That will depend to some extent on the student. But in most instances it should be evident whether they really want to get an accurate knowledge of Jehovah’s ways and apply these in their own lives.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>If they show a sincere interest in the truth, should we assume that now they can get the spiritual food they need at the congregation meetings? No; in most cases that would not be realistic. They need further personal help. It would no doubt be very beneficial to study with them the <em>Truth </em>book or perhaps <em>True Peace and Security.</em></p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>The concluding paragraphs in each of the three booklets lend themselves well to continuing the study. First, on completing a booklet you might make a brief review of the things learned, and then ask specific questions to stimulate further interest. Be prepared with your personal copy of the <em>Truth </em>book and an extra copy. Using the table of contents, show the person that the book takes up these subjects as well as others. Instead of asking whether the individual would like to study for six months, you may find it better simply to talk about plans for next week.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>As you study the book, in many cases you will find that it is best to cover the material at a moderate pace, reading each paragraph. But some persons may want to have more of a Bible discussion than a paragraph-by-paragraph study of the book. With them you might simply discuss the study questions and look up and discuss the scriptures. This will impress on their minds the fact that it is <em>the Bible itself </em>that answers the questions. As for the reading of the paragraphs, you might select just a few key ones in each study to read together. In this way, students that are able to progress quickly can be aided to do so.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>If you have not already started a study in one of the new booklets, we encourage you to keep this as a goal. If you need help, do not hesitate to talk to the Bible study overseer, your book study conductor, or others who are sharing in Bible study work. Those who are starting studies report the following to be necessary things to getting a study started: (1) A real desire for a Bible study and prayer to Jehovah to bless your efforts to start one. (2) A good amount of house-to-house work in order to find interested ones. (3) Being alert to opportunities for starting a study. (4) Promptness in returning to follow up interest. (5) Determining what Bible subject is of interest to the individual. And (6) being enthusiastic and positive.</p>

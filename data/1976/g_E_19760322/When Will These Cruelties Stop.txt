When Will These Cruelties Stop?
WHETHER in refugee camps or concentration camps, the message heard from the Malawian Witnesses is one of steadfast courage and faith. Even in the prison camps, they keep up a program of regular Bible discussion and congregational meetings so as to maintain their Christian spirituality. They find encouragement and consolation in words such as those of the apostle Peter:
“Beloved ones, do not be puzzled at the burning among you, which is happening to you for a trial, as though a strange thing were befalling you. On the contrary, go on rejoicing forasmuch as you are sharers in the sufferings of the Christ.”​—1 Pet. 4:12, 13.
Jehovah’s Witnesses in Malawi are not some unusual “splinter group” with a separate set of standards or views, different from those held by Jehovah’s Christian witnesses world wide. Like Jehovah’s Witnesses everywhere they seek to be exemplary in payment of taxes and obedience to laws. They accept without question the instructions of the apostle Paul at Romans 13:7: “Render to all their dues, to him who calls for the tax, the tax; to him who calls for the tribute, the tribute.” The attacks on them stem from no failure on their part in such civic duties. Nor do they stem from any subversive activities hostile to the State. Like Jehovah’s Witnesses around the earth, they are peaceable and peace-loving persons. Thus, a report on “Jehovah’s Witnesses in Africa” by Ernie Regehr in The Christian Century says that they are “universally praised as hard-working and morally upright citizens.”
Those who try to force and intimidate these Christians to purchase cards as members of their political party are the violators of Malawian law. The card is not an identification document for all citizens; it has nothing to do with taxation. It is, as it plainly states, a political party card, As far back as October 6, 1969, Malawi’s Life President, Dr. H. Kamuzu Banda, publicly stated that no one in the country should be forced to buy a political card. But his words have never been backed up by governmental protection against pressure tactics or open violence upon those not buying the cards.
Whether you agree with the stand of political neutrality or not, do you believe that those who take that stand should be persecuted, imprisoned, beaten, maimed or even killed? Yet that is what is happening in the republic of Malawi. If you are appalled at this unjustified persecution of Christians in Malawi, what can you do? You may choose to express your sentiments by letter, writing to officials of the Malawian government whose names and addresses are here provided.
Not only people throughout the world have taken note of these atrocities. Such cruelties are not ignored by Jehovah God whom these Christian Witnesses serve. He has clearly granted them “power beyond what is normal” and they have endured. Before the world at large, they are establishing a remarkable record of integrity and faithfulness.​—2 Cor. 4:7-9.
The spotlight of truth is on Malawi. Acts of brutality against peace-loving, law-abiding, morally upright Christian witnesses of Jehovah in that land are not shrouded in darkness and hidden from public view. They have become known earth wide. What will Malawi’s public officials do to bring an end to the cruelties? Lovers of freedom and justice are waiting to see.

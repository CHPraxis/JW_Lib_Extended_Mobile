Branch Letter
Dear Kingdom Publishers:
At the beginning of April there was a series of five meetings held in different sections of the United States with the circuit and district overseers. The Society was interested in their observations on a number of things in connection with our worship and field service and a very valuable and interesting interchange of encouragement resulted.
We thought you would be quite interested in one of the main points that was brought out rather consistently at all of these meetings. This had to do with the need on the part of all of our brothers to get better acquainted with the Bible in connection with personal study and Christian meetings and to learn how to use it to greater advantage in resolving problems as well as in preaching the good news in the field service.
Likely you have noticed too that Our Kingdom Service has encouraged the use of the Bible wherever possible in our public worship. Not only does this stamp us as Christ’s disciples, but reading directly from it gives power and authority to our words. To get better acquainted with God’s Word, many of our brothers are increasing their reading of it on a daily basis.
Over the years we have featured the distribution of the New World Translation twice each year in the field service. Isn’t it fitting that we should do so, making the Word of God available to the people in our territory since we truly are a Bible-based congregation? Interestingly, from 1942 down to 1976, 34,330,375 copies of the Scriptures, the whole or in part, have been produced here in Brooklyn. Most of these have been copies of the New World Translation.
We certainly are delighted to be serving with you brothers, producing Bibles and Bible literature, and we count it a privilege to be working with you in connection with your field service needs. May Jehovah continue to go with all of us. Please accept an expression of our warm Christian love at this time.
Your brothers,
BROOKLYN BRANCH OFFICE

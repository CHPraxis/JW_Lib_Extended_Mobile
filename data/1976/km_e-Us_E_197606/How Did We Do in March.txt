How Did We Do in March?
How encouraging it is to note the continuing fine field service efforts we shared in during March! In view of the fact that 7,148,062 hours were devoted in public worship, undoubtedly a powerful witness to the truth was given. As we continue to work together in the field as families, with fathers taking the lead, surely Jehovah will continue to bless and reward us greatly.

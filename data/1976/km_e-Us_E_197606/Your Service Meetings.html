<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sn"><strong>20 min: </strong>The Woman’s Role in Strengthening the Family. Mothers usually spend more time with children in early formative years than fathers. They can be a marvelous influence for good and can have considerable impact on the habits and attitudes developed in early years. Ask audience such questions as: What should mothers discuss with their children from infancy so young minds can be molded along spiritual lines? How can mothers train children in harmony with <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:6:6-5:6:9" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 6:6-9</a>?

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:12:1-21:12:1" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Eccl. 12:1</a>) Young people appreciate parents who spend time with them. Do you know what is in the hearts of your children? In addition to taking them with you in the field service, how can you determine this? Good to take advantage of every opportunity to inculcate knowledge and understanding of Jehovah’s Word in their hearts. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:6:4-5:6:9" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Deut. 6:4-9</a>) For example, what do your children know about the soul, paradise earth and resurrection? Make sure they understand fundamental Bible doctrines and can explain them. Good to train them to memorize at least one scripture supporting each doctrine. Also, would be beneficial to learn the nine fruits of the spirit and have a scripture to back up or support each one. Many things we can do to train our children so that in later years they will have a fund of knowledge to draw from when problems arise or issues come up. Could have parents demonstrate what one or two children in the congregation have accomplished along these lines. Fit the experiences to local circumstances and situations. Allow time for comments on what young people, especially, and their parents have learned from this meeting and what they resolve to do to improve their relationship with Jehovah and their parents.

<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sn"><strong>15 min: </strong>Proper Respect for Congregation Meetings. Discussion. Stress the role of elders and ministerial servants in taking the lead in showing proper respect for meetings; being at the Kingdom Hall early, being seated during meetings and not carrying on other business, unless of an urgent nature that cannot be done at other appropriate time; keeping meetings on time; parents encouraged to sit with children during meetings, children should be taught by parents to be attentive, should not be allowed to unduly disrupt meetings. Whispering excessively should be avoided as well as other distractions. Highlight thought that Kingdom Hall is a house for Jehovah’s worship, and we should appreciate keeping it clean and in good repair. This part should be given in a balanced way, reasoning with the audience so that respect is built up for this feature of our Christian worship.</p>

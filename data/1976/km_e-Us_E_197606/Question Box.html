<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"><strong>● What should be our view of presentations suggested in <em>Our Kingdom Service </em>designed for the house-to-house activity?</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">These are suggestions. We all appreciate the wisdom of being prepared to have something definite to say about the good news when we engage in field service. Presentations are provided often in <em>Our Kingdom Service </em>and give us a variety of things we might say. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:9:22-46:9:22" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Cor. 9:22</a>) These are especially helpful if we are working our territory quite often. Nonetheless, we appreciate that there are many different situations and objections that come up in various sections of the country and we need to be flexible. It is good to tailor our presentations to arouse the interest of the householder.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">If a presentation suggested in <em>Our Kingdom Service </em>can be adapted to local usage, you may want to make use of it. But if you have developed something that is more practical for your territory and you are able to express the thoughts more readily, you are free to use your own presentation. The main thing to keep in mind is that we are preaching the good news of the Kingdom. If we make the message clear and uncomplicated, using our Bibles to good advantage, surely we will have many blessings from Jehovah.</p>

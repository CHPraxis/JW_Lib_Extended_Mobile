A ‘Writhing Wilderness’
● “The voice of Jehovah itself makes the wilderness writhe, Jehovah makes the wilderness of Kadesh writhe,” so reads Psalm 29:8. Evidently the voice of Jehovah is here being compared to a violent storm rushing from the mountains in the north to the region of Kadesh in the south. That wind blows the sand about in a way that makes it appear that the dry wilderness is writhing, that is, twisting and turning as if in pain.

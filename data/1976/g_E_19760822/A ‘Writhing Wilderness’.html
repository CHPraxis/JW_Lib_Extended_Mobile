<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">● “The voice of Jehovah itself makes the wilderness writhe, Jehovah makes the wilderness of Kadesh writhe,” so reads <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:29:8-19:29:8" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 29:8</a>. Evidently the voice of Jehovah is here being compared to a violent storm rushing from the mountains in the north to the region of Kadesh in the south. That wind blows the sand about in a way that makes it appear that the dry wilderness is writhing, that is, twisting and turning as if in pain.</p>

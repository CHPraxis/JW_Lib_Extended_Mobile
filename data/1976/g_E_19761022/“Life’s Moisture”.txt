“Life’s Moisture”
When King David on one occasion held back from confessing his sin to God, he experienced bad mental and physical effects. “My life’s moisture,” said David, “has been changed as in the dry heat of summer.” (Ps. 32:4) During a summer drought a tree loses considerable moisture. Likewise David’s attempt to repress a guilty conscience and his resultant anguish produced a tremendous strain on him, sapping his strength and energy.​—Ps. 32:3.

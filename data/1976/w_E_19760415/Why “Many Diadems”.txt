Why “Many Diadems”?
● Revelation 19:12 describes Jesus Christ, the “King of kings and Lord of lords,” as having “many diadems” upon his head. Why is this? When having authority over more than one land, kings of ancient times often wore more than one crown or diadem. For example, the fact that Upper and Lower Egypt were ruled over by one monarch could be seen from the royal headdress​—a double or combination crown. The many diadems upon the head of the Lord Jesus Christ, therefore, would point to his having extensive, earth-wide dominion as “King of kings.”​—Rev. 19:16.

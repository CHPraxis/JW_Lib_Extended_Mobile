<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">At <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:41:14-23:41:14" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Isaiah 41:14</a> we read Jehovah God’s encouragement to Israel: “Do not be afraid, you worm Jacob, you men of Israel. I myself will help you.” Their being likened to a worm was not with a view to degrading the people. Rather, this called attention to the fact that Israel was like a lowly, helpless creature, puny, either in its own eyes or that of enemies. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:22:6-19:22:6" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ps. 22:6</a>) How comforting and reassuring, then, was God’s promise to come to the aid of his people!</p>

Why a Worm?
At Isaiah 41:14 we read Jehovah God’s encouragement to Israel: “Do not be afraid, you worm Jacob, you men of Israel. I myself will help you.” Their being likened to a worm was not with a view to degrading the people. Rather, this called attention to the fact that Israel was like a lowly, helpless creature, puny, either in its own eyes or that of enemies. (Ps. 22:6) How comforting and reassuring, then, was God’s promise to come to the aid of his people!

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Newspapers report what is happening in the world. But they do not give the solution to world troubles. Nor do they tell about the one government that will solve them.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">You need the <strong>Watchtower </strong>and <strong>Awake! </strong>magazines, for they give this information. They provide evidence that a government by God will soon take over earth’s affairs and bring a grand change for the better. You can receive both magazines (four copies a month) for one year. Send only $3.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Please send by mail a year’s subscription for <em>The Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>for which I enclose $3. Also send free the six timely booklets <em>There Is Much More to Life!, A Secure Future​—How You Can Find It, Is There a God Who Cares?, “This Good News of the Kingdom,” “Look! I Am Making All Things New,” </em>and <em>One World, One Government, Under God’s Sovereignty.</em></p>

‘Words like Oxgoads’
Wise King Solomon wrote: “The words of the wise ones are like oxgoads.” (Eccl. 12:11) A goad​—a long pointed rod, sometimes tipped with a sharp metal point—​was used for driving and guiding draft animals. Similarly, the words of wise persons serve in a stimulating way to guide and motivate the hearers to act in harmony with them.

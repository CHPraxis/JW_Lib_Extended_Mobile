Can You Read It in the Newspaper?
Newspapers report what is happening in the world. But they do not give the solution to world troubles. Nor do they tell about the one government that will solve them.
You need the Watchtower and Awake! magazines, for they give this information. They provide evidence that a government by God will soon take over earth’s affairs and bring a grand change for the better. You can receive both magazines (four copies a month) for one year. Send only $3.
Please send by mail a year’s subscription for The Watchtower and Awake! for which I enclose $3. Also send free the six timely booklets There Is Much More to Life!, A Secure Future​—How You Can Find It, Is There a God Who Cares?, “This Good News of the Kingdom,” “Look! I Am Making All Things New,” and One World, One Government, Under God’s Sovereignty.

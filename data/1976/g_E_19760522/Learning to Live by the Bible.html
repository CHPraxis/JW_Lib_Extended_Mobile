<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"><strong>◆ </strong>A young Jewish man living in a Eurasian city was being encouraged by his local rabbis to take up rabbinical training. They did this in spite of knowing that he was not leading a moral life. As he was considering their urgings, Jehovah’s Witnesses contacted him. Though he knew the Hebrew Scriptures well, he agreed to study the Bible with them. Soon he realized that just knowing what the Bible teaches is not enough but that practicing what it says is also important. Upon reading an article in <em>The Watchtower </em>about the Christian view of courtship, he was convinced that his way of life was not pleasing to God. He went to his rabbis and pointed out their failure in not having taught him the importance of living in harmony with the Holy Scriptures. The rabbis were unable to provide any satisfying answers.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">He decided that Jehovah’s Witnesses were not only teaching the true religion but also living by it. So he continued his Bible study with even greater appreciation and began to change his life. He even visited all the girls with whom he was carrying on illicit affairs, sat down with them and read to them the article about courtship. Two of these girls are now actively sharing Bible truth with others, and he himself has become a baptized disciple of Jesus Christ.</p>

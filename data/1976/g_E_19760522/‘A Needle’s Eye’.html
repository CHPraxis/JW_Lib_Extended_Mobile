<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"><strong>● </strong>Illustrating the difficulty of gaining entrance into the Kingdom, Jesus Christ said: “It is easier for a camel to get through a needle’s eye than for a rich man to get into the kingdom of God.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:19:24-40:19:24" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matt. 19:24</a>) Just what was that needle’s eye? It was the eye of an ordinary sewing needle. Says <em>An Expository Dictionary of New Testament Words: </em>“The idea of applying ‘the needle’s eye’ to small gates seems to be a modern one; there is no ancient trace of it. The Lord’s object in the statement is to express human impossibility and there is no need to endeavour to soften the difficulty by taking the needle to mean anything more than the ordinary instrument.”</p>

‘Coming Under a Shadow’
A shadow cast by a crag, cloud, building, tree or some other object can provide welcome protection as, for example, from the hot sun. That is why the Biblical expression to ‘come under the shadow of something’ means to come into a place of protection, security or refuge. For example, Lot said to the men of Sodom regarding his angelic guests: “Only to these men do not do a thing, because that is why they have come under the shadow of my roof.” (Gen. 19:8) See also Isaiah 32:1, 2.

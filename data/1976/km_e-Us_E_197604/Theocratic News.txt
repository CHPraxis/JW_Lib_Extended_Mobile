◆ There was a concerted effort to publicize the Malawi persecution. Newspapers, radio and TV stations were contacted. By February 1, over 1,000 newspaper stories about Malawi had appeared in the U.S.A., with over 12,000 column inches of space devoted to it. At least 430 radio stations covered the story. There have been about 100 radio and TV interviews. The response from the listening public has been outstanding. Many persons contacted the stations for more information as to what they could do to help.
Numerous individuals were moved to write to officials who they felt might be able to help. A Harvard University scientist wrote the World Council of Churches. Other persons wrote to various Presbyterian churches or church bodies. As a result, that Church’s headquarters sent a letter to all Presbyterian pastors disclaiming any “direct organizational relationship with the Church in Malawi.” A U.S. Senator entered two long newspaper articles about the Malawi persecution in the U.S. Congressional Record.
Latest reports from Malawi indicate that the persecution continues.

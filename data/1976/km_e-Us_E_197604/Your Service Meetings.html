<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="ss"><strong>WEEK STARTING APRIL 25</strong></p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="ss"><strong>‘We Ought to Be Teachers in View of the Time.’ (</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:5:12-58:5:12" data-bid="2-1" class="b"><strong>Heb. 5:12</strong></a><strong>)</strong></p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sn"><strong>10 min: </strong>Song 54. Introduction on theme. Following baptism, early Christians continued to learn. Many became able to teach God’s Word, but some did not make that progress. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:5:12-58:5:14" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Heb. 5:12-14</a>) In recent years many have been baptized, so is not surprising there is room for improvement in being teachers. But some long baptized need to be teachers, too. Are you a teacher?</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sn"><strong>15 min: </strong>Teaching and Making Disciples. Discussion based on <em>Aid, </em>page 1579, par. 5, through 1580, par. 3. Qualified men in congregations have heavy responsibility of being teachers. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:12:28-46:12:28" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 Cor. 12:28;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:3:2-54:3:2" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 1 Tim. 3:2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:3:1-59:3:1" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> Jas. 3:1</a>) But all Christians are to be teachers when making disciples. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:28:19-40:28:20" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Matt. 28:19, 20</a>) Developing ability to teach is a fine objective for each of us. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:5:12-58:6:2" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Heb. 5:12–6:2</a>) Requires desire to teach and effort to learn what and how to teach. Are you applying yourself?</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sn"><strong>20 min: </strong>Become a Better Teacher of God’s Word. Audience participation; based on <a class="xt" data-xtid="3" href="jwpub://p/E:1101968005/"><em>Truth </em>book, chapter 5</a>. Audience should review that. In teaching we can use fine material in publications. Do we learn their contents so we can employ their reasoning and key texts even when we do not have publications available? Two or three brothers come to platform, taking part of interested persons; ask chairman realistic questions (not trick ones) on subject—can paraphrase questions 7, 13, 20, 27. Phrase the questions in a way that a non-Witness would. Chairman invites audience to present texts and reasoning in answer, without opening <em>Truth </em>book.</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">To teach well we need to know what the Bible says and how we can reply when confronted with questions. Do we try to remember key texts and lines of reasoning? Urge placing <em>Truth </em>book in May after tract distribution. Use it as a tool in teaching others. Chairman might give <em>brief </em>presentation.</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sn"><strong>15 min: </strong>Concluding Remarks. Reviewing plans for tract distribution (May 1-10), encourage all to share, including new ones. Cover territory thoroughly, starting with areas not covered with last tract. Continue distribution until supply is exhausted or territory is covered; adjacent congregations may be able to help. Short observations on tract’s contents. Comment on Question Box. Song 60.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Response to release of the new booklets was outstanding! Our report reflects that we put them to good use immediately, distributing 1,355,777 during January! Very fine indeed! This shows that we appreciate new instruments that will help us to teach the good news more effectively. More importantly, the zealous distribution confirms our genuine desire to assist other people to gain the marvelous blessings to which these booklets point in God’s Word. Many have already reported excellent results in starting new studies, which shows that we have been applying the suggestions given for their use. Let us continue to carry them regularly, being alert to any opportunity to start a study, enabling more sincere persons to learn about Jehovah’s purpose.</p>

Question Box
● Is it advisable for someone to hold a territory permanently?
For various reasons, individuals may find that covering a certain territory best suits their circumstances. For example, some who lack transportation find it convenient to have territory near home. Or, someone with physical limitations may prefer territory where there are few stairs to climb. It is good when territories can be made available to help such publishers to maintain a regular share in the preaching work.
Yet, where practical, there are advantages when they turn in a territory assignment after covering it a few times. This allows others in similar circumstances to visit that territory. Also, it is often beneficial to have different publishers make calls in a territory, recognizing that people respond to various personalities. A publisher of a different age, with another approach, or who calls at a different time of day, may have greater success in reaching certain persons. Allowing a variety of publishers to cover a territory may result in what we all desire—an effective witness to everyone. The field overseer can coordinate matters to accomplish this.
If someone feels that circumstances recommend his holding on to a certain territory assignment, then it may be that periodically others can be invited to share along with him in covering it. The book study conductor may be able to help by arranging occasional group witnessing. When others are able to develop interest or start studies, they may want to continue calling. Or such calls may be turned over if the publisher holding the territory assignment is in the best position to follow up the interest effectively.
The determining factor is: What will be in the best interest of the people in the territory? We want to care for the territory in a way that will result in the greatest assistance for all sheeplike ones.

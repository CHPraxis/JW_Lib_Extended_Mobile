Some specifically request that nothing be left at their home. We should try to comply with that. A dated note can be put in the territory envelope showing name of householder who made the request and advising publishers visiting there to avoid leaving anything under the door at that home when the householder is not contacted. If householder moves, note may be destroyed.</p>

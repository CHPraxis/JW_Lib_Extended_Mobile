Fine Conduct Provides a Witness
● “Let your light shine before men, that they may see your fine works and give glory to your Father who is in the heavens.” (Matt. 5:16) These words spoken by Jesus Christ highlight the fact that the way a person conducts himself can have a powerful effect on others, causing them to develop appreciation for true worship.
This was the case with a bus driver in Finland. In his youth he had developed a dislike for religion because of his parents’ fanaticism. But this changed in 1975, when he drove a bus chartered by a group of Jehovah’s Witnesses who were attending a convention in Helsinki. Not having anything else to do during the day, he attended the convention and listened to the program. On the last day of the assembly while driving the conventioners home, he said to them:
“I called you ‘friends’ when we left for the convention on the first day, and did it just as a matter of form. But now I can call you ‘friends’ from my heart. Your deep sincerity, outstanding friendliness and your affection for one another have made a great impression on me. I have not had any time for religion before, but now I must say that you have changed my outlook. I want to look into your religion.”

The Bible Helps to Promote Family Unity
TODAY many families face serious problems because of not applying the Bible’s counsel in their lives. However, once they start doing so, there are amazing changes for the better.
A man living in Spain relates: “My economic situation in the world was quite prosperous. I was the owner of a publicity agency that was doing very well. However, my marriage was shattered by adultery. Each of us lived a separate life to the point of having an assigned day for ‘marital unfaithfulness.’ The day it was my wife’s turn I stayed at home and looked after the two children and vice versa. Nevertheless, I realized that things could not go on like that. I wanted to put my life in order. I asked God to help me, and help came in a most unexpected way.
“I was in a painter’s attic studio with other friends when one of them, looking at his watch, said: ‘I’m going. I’ve got a Witness waiting for me at home.’ I asked him, ‘What’s that?’ His answer stirred my interest and so I went along to listen. I was put in contact with Jehovah’s Witnesses in my neighborhood, and my wife and I started to study. Little by little we made changes in ourselves, not only in a moral sense, but even to the point of my leaving the publicity firm to avoid undesirable contacts. Thanks to Jehovah, the family is now united.”

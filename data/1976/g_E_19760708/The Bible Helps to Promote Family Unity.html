<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">TODAY many families face serious problems because of not applying the Bible’s counsel in their lives. However, once they start doing so, there are amazing changes for the better.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A man living in Spain relates: “My economic situation in the world was quite prosperous. I was the owner of a publicity agency that was doing very well. However, my marriage was shattered by adultery. Each of us lived a separate life to the point of having an assigned day for ‘marital unfaithfulness.’ The day it was my wife’s turn I stayed at home and looked after the two children and vice versa. Nevertheless, I realized that things could not go on like that. I wanted to put my life in order. I asked God to help me, and help came in a most unexpected way.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“I was in a painter’s attic studio with other friends when one of them, looking at his watch, said: ‘I’m going. I’ve got a Witness waiting for me at home.’ I asked him, ‘What’s that?’ His answer stirred my interest and so I went along to listen. I was put in contact with Jehovah’s Witnesses in my neighborhood, and my wife and I started to study. Little by little we made changes in ourselves, not only in a moral sense, but even to the point of my leaving the publicity firm to avoid undesirable contacts. Thanks to Jehovah, the family is now united.”</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">“THE Jehovah’s Witnesses have a reputation for tenacity which is legendary. They flourish in all the world’s nations, even in countries where they are under mandatory punishment, by death.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“In Jamaica they have shown a steady growth when all other major denominations show a decline. The following incident shows why:—</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“On a recent field trip to the Portland Caves we travelled on a desolate dirt road for about 30 minutes without seeing a single person. The only signs of civilization were occasional goats which seemed wild. We parked at the foot of a precipitous limestone outcrop and climbed some of the most god-forsaken territory in this country.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">“On our return to the cars, dirty, tired and thirsty it seemed that not even a breeze had passed since we parked. However, under each windshield wiper there was a brand-new tract which must have been placed there by a Jehovah’s Witness (whether in spirit or flesh, I can’t say). T.J.”​—<em>The Daily Gleaner, </em>Kingston, Jamaica, W.I.</p>

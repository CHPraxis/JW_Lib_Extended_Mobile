Tracts That Leave Their Tracks
“THE Jehovah’s Witnesses have a reputation for tenacity which is legendary. They flourish in all the world’s nations, even in countries where they are under mandatory punishment, by death.
“In Jamaica they have shown a steady growth when all other major denominations show a decline. The following incident shows why:—
“On a recent field trip to the Portland Caves we travelled on a desolate dirt road for about 30 minutes without seeing a single person. The only signs of civilization were occasional goats which seemed wild. We parked at the foot of a precipitous limestone outcrop and climbed some of the most god-forsaken territory in this country.
“On our return to the cars, dirty, tired and thirsty it seemed that not even a breeze had passed since we parked. However, under each windshield wiper there was a brand-new tract which must have been placed there by a Jehovah’s Witness (whether in spirit or flesh, I can’t say). T.J.”​—The Daily Gleaner, Kingston, Jamaica, W.I.

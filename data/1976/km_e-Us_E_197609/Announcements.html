<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">◆ Since the offer for September is any pocket-size book on a contribution of 25c, you may use whichever one your congregation has in good supply. If additional supplies are needed, Brooklyn has a good stock of the <em>Evolution, Peace and Security </em>and <em>Eternal Purpose </em>books, although other publications can also be ordered. October offer: <em>Awake! </em>subscription, with three booklets, for $1.50.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn">◆ Some circuit assemblies have been adapting district assembly forms for circuit assembly use, using cards marked “Administration,” “Volunteer,” etc. This hardly seems necessary for an assembly of circuit-assembly size.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn">◆ The congregation accounts should be audited on September 1, or as soon thereafter as possible, by the presiding overseer or someone appointed by him.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn">◆ Out of Stock in U.S.A.:</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="si"><em>Elberfelder </em>Bible—German</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="si">Bible—Vietnamese</p>

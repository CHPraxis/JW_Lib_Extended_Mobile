<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"><strong>● Might a discussion using the Bible alone be reported as a study?</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Usually one of the Society’s publications provides the basis for studying the Bible with an individual. But at times persons are unwilling to use any literature other than the Bible. Yet such persons may be willing to have us discuss the Scriptures with them on a regular basis. We can then <em>systematically </em>consider different themes, using six to eight scriptures found in a chapter of one of the publications. (See “Presenting the Good News,” <em>Our Kingdom Service, </em>February 1976.) Such systematic discussions can be reported as a Bible study after they have been held at least three times. (See <em>Organization </em>book, page 127.)</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">As the individual gains confidence, an appropriate publication might be introduced. When this is done, we do not want to give the impression that we are changing from a <em>Bible </em>study to a <em>book </em>study. The householder should continue to feel that he is studying the Scriptures, which is what he is, in fact, doing when you read, highlight and explain the scriptures in the material.</p>

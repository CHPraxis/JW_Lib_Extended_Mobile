After two or three answers proceed with the following demonstration: An experienced publisher, after greeting the householder, asks: “Have you ever asked yourself, Why does God permit so much suffering?” After householder’s reply, publisher reads <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:3:8-61:3:9" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Peter 3:8, 9</a> and directs his attention to <a class="xt" data-xtid="1" href="jwpub://p/E:1101968008/"><em>Truth </em>book (Chapter 8)</a> for further information.</p>

<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Conclude with another demonstration, using the same scripture but featuring the <em>Peace and Security </em>book. Householder refuses literature offer. Ask audience why we should make a note of this call. Inform congregation that this month the service meetings will discuss the return visit activity and how we can share in it. Meetings will show that everyone can share and that it is not too difficult. Encourage audience to think about people whom they might call on to stimulate further interest in the Kingdom message and, with them in mind, to take note of what is said on the service meeting programs.</p>

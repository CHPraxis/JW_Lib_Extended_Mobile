Announcements
◆ Since the offer for September is any pocket-size book on a contribution of 25c, you may use whichever one your congregation has in good supply. If additional supplies are needed, Brooklyn has a good stock of the Evolution, Peace and Security and Eternal Purpose books, although other publications can also be ordered. October offer: Awake! subscription, with three booklets, for $1.50.
◆ Some circuit assemblies have been adapting district assembly forms for circuit assembly use, using cards marked “Administration,” “Volunteer,” etc. This hardly seems necessary for an assembly of circuit-assembly size.
◆ The congregation accounts should be audited on September 1, or as soon thereafter as possible, by the presiding overseer or someone appointed by him.
◆ Out of Stock in U.S.A.:
Elberfelder Bible—German
Bible—Vietnamese

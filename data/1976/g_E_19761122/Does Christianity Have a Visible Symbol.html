<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="st"><strong>Does Christianity Have a Visible Symbol?</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">THROUGHOUT human history the religions of the world have featured numerous visible symbols. Stars, moon crescents, fish, dragons, gargoyles​—these and many other symbols have appeared in the writings and art of the world’s religious systems.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Is there a visible symbol for Christianity? Do you think of the cross? What about the figure of a fish, which appears on some ancient artifacts associated with Christians? Or is there perhaps some other visible symbol representative of Christianity?</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Let us consider first the cross. Many English translations of the Christian Scriptures employ the word “cross” for the instrument upon which Jesus was nailed to die. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:2:8-50:2:8" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Phil. 2:8</a>, <em>Authorized Version</em>) But was it really cross-shaped?</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><em>The Imperial Bible-Dictionary </em>points out: “The Greek word for cross, <em>staurós, </em>properly signified a <em>stake, </em>an upright pole, or piece of paling, on which anything might be hung, or which might be used in impaling [fencing in] a piece of ground. . . . Even amongst the Romans the <em>crux </em>(from which our [word] <em>cross </em>is derived) appears to have been originally an upright pole.” It is true that on occasion these terms were used to refer also to cross-shaped objects. In these cases, however, the contexts of accounts employing these words describe crosses. But that is not the basic meaning of either the Greek <em>staurós </em>or the Latin <em>crux.</em></p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Furthermore, the Bible also designates the instrument upon which Jesus died by the Greek word <em>xylon. </em>According to a Greek-English lexicon by Liddell and Scott, this word means <em>“wood </em>. . . II. <em>a stick </em>or <em>piece of wood </em>. . . III. later, <em>a tree.” </em>In the <em>Authorized Version </em>this word is rendered as “tree,” as at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:5:30-44:5:30" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Acts 5:30</a>, where we read: “The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom ye slew and hanged on a tree.”​—See also <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:13:29-44:13:29" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Acts 13:29;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:3:13-48:3:13" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Galatians 3:13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:2:24-60:2:24" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> 1 Peter 2:24</a>, <em>AV.</em></p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">But do not writers early in the Common Era claim that Jesus died on a cross? For example, Justin Martyr (114-167 C.E.) described in this way what he believed to be the type of stake upon which Jesus died: “For the one beam is placed upright, from which the highest extremity is raised up into a horn, when the other beam is fitted on to it, and the ends appear on both sides as horns joined on to the one horn.” This indicates that Justin himself believed that Jesus died on a cross.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">However, Justin was not inspired by God, as were the Bible writers. He was born more than eighty years after Jesus’ death, and was not an eyewitness of that event. It is believed that in describing the “cross” Justin followed an earlier writing known as the “Letter of Barnabas.” This non-Biblical letter claims that the Bible describes Abraham as having circumcised three hundred and eighteen men of his household. Then it derives special significance from a Greek-letter cipher for 318, namely, IHT. The writer of this apocryphal work claims that IH represents the first two letters of “Jesus” in Greek. The T is viewed as the shape of Jesus’ death stake.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Concerning this passage, M’Clintock and Strong’s <em>Cyclopædia </em>states: “The writer evidently was unacquainted with the Hebrew Scriptures, and has [also] committed <span id="page28" class="pageNum" data-no="28" data-before-text="28"></span>the blunder of supposing that Abraham was familiar with the Greek alphabet some centuries before it existed.” A translator into English of this “Letter of Barnabas” points out that it contains “numerous inaccuracies,” “absurd and trifling interpretations of Scripture,” and “many silly vaunts of superior knowledge in which its writer indulges.” Would you depend on such a writer, or persons who followed him, to provide accurate information about the stake on which Jesus died?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">The cross did not become popular as a symbol in Christendom until the fourth century C.E., when Roman emperor Constantine adopted the labarum, a flag bearing the symbol <strong>[Artwork​—Greek character]</strong>. However, this represented, not Jesus’ death stake, but the Greek letters <em>khi </em>(X) and <em>hro </em>(P) one atop the other. Many began to view this symbol as depicting the first two letters of the Greek word for Christ (<em>XRistos</em>).<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span></p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">What about the symbol of a fish? Objects dated as far back as the second century C.E. have been found bearing this figure along with the Greek word for fish, ICHTHÝS. This is understood by many as a cipher for the Greek expression <em>Iesous CHristos THeou Yios Soter, </em>meaning “Jesus Christ, Son of God, Savior.” Is the fish a truly Christian symbol?</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">According to <em>The Interpreter’s Dictionary of the Bible, </em>fish frequently appear in ancient pagan symbolism, often apart from water scenes. “In such cases,” notes this reference work, “it would seem to have symbolic significance, possibly to represent deity, power, fecundity, etc.”</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">The same publication further notes that certain Jews adopted use of the fish symbol from pagan religious customs, adding: “It is probable that the considerations mentioned [in this regard] account in part for the appearance of the fish in the art of the oldest Christian catacombs. How early the Greek word for ‘fish’ (<em>ichthýs</em>) came to be interpreted as a cipher for ‘Jesus Christ, Son of God, Savior’ . . . we do not know; but once this identification was made, the fish became a standard Christian symbol.”</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">The Bible, however, sets forth no visible symbol for Christianity. Christians today, therefore, must be on guard not to adopt such a symbol. For example, watchtower-like designs appear on some buildings and Kingdom Halls of Jehovah’s Witnesses. There is nothing wrong with these in themselves. Possibly they may help persons to identify property owned by Jehovah’s Witnesses. However, at no time should anyone look upon such things with reverence, as if they were a visible sign of Christianity. Jesus taught that, rather than through visible symbols, “by <em>this </em>all will know that you are my disciples, if you have love among yourselves.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:13:35-43:13:35" data-bid="4-1" class="b">John 13: 35</a>.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">While visible symbols have always been a feature of non-Biblical religions, they were absent from Christianity at its beginning. As in the first century C.E., so today, true Christians must conform to the Scriptural standard: “We are walking by faith, not by sight.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:5:7-47:5:7" data-bid="5-1" class="b">2 Cor. 5:7</a>.</p>

<div id="fn1" class="fcc"><p id="p18" data-pid="18">On this point, <em>The Companion Bible </em>comments in Appendix 162 on “The Cross and Crucifixion”:</p></div>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sf">“Crosses were used as symbols of the Babylonian sun-god, <strong>[Artwork​—Symbol]</strong>, and are first seen on a coin of Julius Caesar. 100-44 B.C., and then on a coin struck by Caesar’s heir (Augustus), 20 B.C. On the coins of Constantine the most frequent symbol is <strong>[Artwork​—Greek character]</strong>; but the same symbol is used without the surrounding circle, and with the four equal arms vertical and horizontal; and this was the symbol specially venerated as the ‘Solar Wheel’. It should be stated that Constantine was a sun-god worshipper, and would not enter the ‘Church’ till some quarter of a century after his having seen such a cross in the heavens. . . . The Lord was put to death upon an upright stake, and not on two pieces of timber placed at any angle.”</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">■ A Syrophoenician woman once approached Jesus Christ with the request that he please free her daughter from demon possession. At first he declined, saying: “It is not right to take the bread of the children and throw it to little dogs.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:15:26-40:15:26" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matt. 15:26</a>) Why did Jesus Christ say this?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">As he explained to this non-Jewish woman, he had been sent exclusively “to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:15:24-40:15:24" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matt. 15:24</a>) The Jews generally viewed a non-Jew as being like a ceremonially unclean animal, a dog. However, in using the expression “little dogs,” Jesus Christ was not being unduly harsh. He was referring to dogs that might be kept in a home and not to wild dogs of the street. Still, Jesus’ words evidently served to test the faith of the Syrophoenician woman. And she revealed both a right spirit and a strong faith. Drawing on the words of Jesus, she replied: “Yes, Lord; but really the little dogs do eat of the crumbs falling from the table of their masters.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:15:27-40:15:27" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matt. 15:27</a>) On hearing this, Jesus Christ commended her great faith and healed her daughter.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:15:28-40:15:28" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Matt. 15:28</a>.</p>

Why Stated in Terms of “Darics”?
● The “daric” was a Persian gold coin. At 1 Chronicles 29:7 part of the contribution for the temple during the reign of King David is given in terms of darics. Since the daric was unknown in David’s time, Ezra, the writer of Chronicles, evidently converted the original figure into terms then current and familiar to his readers. This is somewhat similar to what English translations today have done in stating money values. For example, the Authorized Version speaks of the “denarius” as a “penny.”​—Rev. 6:6.

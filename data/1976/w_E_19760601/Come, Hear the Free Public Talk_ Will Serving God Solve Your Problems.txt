Come, Hear the Free Public Talk: Will Serving God Solve Your Problems?
Would you like to know how to cope with your problems successfully? Would you like to hear how a sure solution to problems can be realized in the near future?
Then come to hear the principal talk at the current district assemblies of Jehovah’s Witnesses. The assembly program also features helpful Bible discussions on practical matters of life and full-costume Bible dramas. In just the British Isles, Canada and the United States, over a hundred cities will host the four-day assemblies.
Contact the local Kingdom Hall of Jehovah’s Witnesses to find out where the nearest assembly will be held, or write the publishers of this magazine.

● What might be done to assure that our service meetings conclude with emphasis on spiritual matters?
When a service meeting concludes with a fine Scriptural discussion or with practical counsel for our field service, it has a wholesome effect on all of us. But, as we know, this meeting not infrequently ends with an extensive list of announcements, many of which are quite similar from week to week.
Of course, there are announcements that need to be made, but with some forethought perhaps many of these could be handled in other ways. Might reminders about cleaning the Kingdom Hall, for example, be given at the book study locations to the groups assigned for that week? Details concerning plans for field service may, at times, be fitting at the end of a meeting, but often they could be included in an earlier portion of the service meeting program that directly discusses field service. Also, if some portion of the meeting includes thoughts about showing loving concern for fellow Christians, might not this be a good place to work in any needed remarks about visiting any publishers who may be ill or in need of encouragement? If there are miscellaneous announcements that really need to be handled and that do not fit the program for the evening, why not simply take a few minutes for them toward the beginning of the meeting, perhaps during or after one of the earlier parts?
In this way, the conclusion can be used for upbuilding Scriptural exhortation, for warm encouragement to share in field service, for review of fine points learned and perhaps for some brief thoughts to whet everyone’s appetite for the forthcoming public talk and Watchtower study. It is beneficial to have a well-qualified brother handle this part.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sh">Dear Kingdom Publishers:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">In recent months it has been our joy to see quite a number of new faces here at Bethel.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Some are the children of parents who themselves once served at Bethel. These parents still have fond memories of their life here, so they encouraged their children to share in the privileges that they once enjoyed. Many here were encouraged by their parents to pioneer, and this became a stepping-stone to Bethel service.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Other brothers among us have no relatives in the truth. As their knowledge of the truth increased, their desire to serve Jehovah to a greater extent grew. Today these brothers are at Bethel and are happy to be a part of a far larger family than they had before learning the truth.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:10:29-41:10:30" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Mark 10:29, 30</a>.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Here at Bethel there are rich spiritual blessings to be enjoyed. We have association with the largest single group of the remnant of Christ’s anointed brothers on earth today. Our association all day every day is with dedicated servants of Jehovah. Newcomers enjoy a four-month course in the Bethel Entrant’s School, with classroom discussions on Monday evenings. For all of us there are the stimulating discussions of the daily text each morning and the <em>Watchtower </em>study each Monday evening. Several of our family have been in Bethel service for more than fifty years. Others were baptized as recently as 1975.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">We encourage dedicated brothers, especially those who are single and between nineteen and thirty-five years of age, to consider prayerfully whether they could serve Jehovah and their brothers as members of the Bethel family.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">We keep busy here and time passes very rapidly. Like you, we have plenty to do in Jehovah’s service. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:15:58-46:15:58" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Cor. 15:58</a>) We send our warm love to all of you.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sj">Your brothers,</p>

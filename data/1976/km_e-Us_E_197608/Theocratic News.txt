◆ We are glad to report that in Mozambique the brothers were able to celebrate the Memorial in the Milange refugee camps. An incomplete report shows 15,697 in attendance.
◆ From Sierra Leone comes a report of a new peak of 1,200 publishers; one out of every four engaged in pioneer activity. The Memorial attendance (triple the peak of publishers) and new peaks in return visits and Bible studies give promise of further increases to come.
◆ For the third consecutive month Israel reports a new peak in publishers; 276 shared in field service in April.
◆ In Papua New Guinea a new peak of 711 reported field service. The greatest witness ever given there in a single month was accomplished as 13,864 hours were spent in the service. New territories are opening up.
◆ There has been excellent response to the distribution of “Kingdom News” No. 22. Here in Brooklyn we have received requests for 9,317 booklets. The responses were over two and a half times as numerous as those following any other of these campaigns.

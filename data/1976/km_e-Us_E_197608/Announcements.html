<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">◆ Literature offer for August: <em>True Peace and Security, </em>for 25c. For September: Any pocket-size book, on a contribution of 25c.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn">◆ The October 8 <em>Awake! </em>and October 15 <em>Watchtower </em>will be special issues. Be sure to order early the extra copies that you will need. It would be helpful if the present field overseer would care for this before the end of August.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn">◆ Each congregation will receive two Literature Inventory forms and should take an actual count of campaign literature in stock as of September 1. Cash items, such as <em>Aid </em>book, large-print Bible, <em>Concordance, </em>etc., should NOT be counted in your inventory. Please fill out the forms and return the original to us no later than September 6. Keep the carbon copy for your files.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn">◆ It is requested that on the next literature order for the congregation, presiding overseers order 12 monthly congregation report cards, 12 report cards for each regular pioneer, report-desk envelopes and other forms needed for the 1977 service year.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn">◆ The Society is now transcribing the braille <em>Watchtower </em>with current material taken, in most cases, from the fifteenth-of-the-month issue of the English <em>Watchtower. </em>The partner arrangement will remain in operation and the second reader will be the one to keep and use the magazine. This will allow the second reader (they alternate each month) to be able to comment and follow along at the <em>Watchtower </em>study at least twice every other month. This will no doubt be a spiritual boost to our blind brothers. Any who may not have subscribed for the free braille magazine before are encouraged to do so.</p>

A Note to Elders
● At the meeting of the body of elders early in September arrangements should be made for rotation of assignments of oversight.
● The one who has been presiding overseer for the past year is to prepare a year-end report, read it to all the elders and send it to the Society.
● After new assignments of oversight have been worked out, it would be appreciated if the elder who filled any given position during the past year would arrange to spend time with the newly assigned brother to acquaint him with details concerning the work. Additionally, each one would do well to study carefully details concerning his assignment as set out in the Organization book.
● If the congregation’s permanent address, which is on file with the Society, can still be used, please do not change it simply because there is a new presiding overseer.

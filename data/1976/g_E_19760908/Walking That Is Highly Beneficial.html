<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">● For a person to walk through beautiful parks and forests can be a real delight and also provides beneficial exercise. Many find great pleasure in walking with close friends or family members. The best companion for walking, however, is the Most High. But how can one walk with the invisible God?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The Bible says: “Will two walk together unless they have met by appointment?” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/30:3:3-30:3:3" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Amos 3:3</a>) How does this apply to our walking with God? The Almighty has extended to humans the invitation to walk with him as his approved servants and friends. The individual accepts that invitation or makes an “appointment” to walk with God by seeking to enter into a relationship with him. From then on, in his daily affairs of life, he should conduct himself as if he were in the literal presence of God. He should be found following the Bible’s admonition: “Whether you are eating or drinking or doing anything else, do all things for God’s glory.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:10:31-46:10:31" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Cor. 10:31</a>) In such walking, we need to be modest. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/33:6:8-33:6:8" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Mic. 6:8</a>) This means recognizing the superiority of God’s ways to our own and humbly conforming to these.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">By walking with God we can rest assured of his continued guidance and help. We can also look forward to the prospect of walking with him in modesty for all eternity. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:3-43:17:3" data-bid="4-1" class="b">John 17:3</a>) Truly, walking with God is of the greatest benefit both now and in the future.</p>

What Can Be Done?
FREEDOM-loving people everywhere will agree that what should be done is that the Benin government should grant freedom of worship to its citizens; also, that the cruel treatment of Jehovah’s Witnesses should be stopped. And government officials, particularly President Mathieu Kerekou, can do these things. Then, why don’t they?
The government claims that it is not against religion. The fact is, the People’s Republic of Benin professes to grant freedom of worship. In point nine of his discourse on National Orientation on November 30, 1974, President Kerekou said:
“The Revolution of the People of Benin keeps a strict neutrality with respect to belief in a religion, in so much as the expression of that belief does not constitute a hindrance to the development of our Revolution.”
Yet the claim is broadcast in Benin that Jehovah’s Witnesses “deliberately trample underfoot point nine of our discourse on National Orientation of November 30, 1974.” And so the Witnesses are called “sworn enemies of our democratic, people’s revolution.” Yet this simply is not true, as persons everywhere who know Jehovah’s Witnesses will testify. As already noted, a local chief in Benin said that the Witnesses are his best people. They pay their taxes on time and they share in communal work.
Around the world Jehovah’s Witnesses have gained this reputation as good people. The African Weekly, in its issue of August 30, 1950, noted: “Once they join the Watch Tower . . . these Christians do not fight among themselves, . . . Although one is not a member of their Church yet one must say that they have love in their hearts.” Another African publication titled “Personality” observed in its November 21, 1968, issue: “Jehovah’s Witnesses seem to be bursting with good qualities and to be almost free from the bad.”
An Asset to Benin
Rather than undermine the government, the good behavior and morality of Jehovah’s Witnesses are an asset to the countries where they live. After Benin’s Interior Minister, Michel Aikpe, was reportedly caught committing adultery with President Kerekou’s wife and killed last year, a radio broadcast said: “All militants, men and women, should learn a lesson from this event. Some have not yet understood that the demands of the revolution extend to all fields, including their life and their moral attitude in society.” Where so-called patriots may fail, Jehovah’s Witnesses, by their example and speech, exercise a fine influence, and they do much to help to develop in society a proper moral attitude.
Furthermore, there is no danger that Jehovah’s Witnesses will ever be involved in any political rivalry or conspiracy, as when just last October there was a plot allegedly organized by former president Emile Zinsou to overthrow the Benin government. Rather, Jehovah’s Witnesses remain strictly neutral regarding political affairs. They obey the Bible command to “be in subjection to the superior authorities,” which authorities are earth’s rulers. (Rom. 13:1, 2) Almighty God permits these earthly rulers to exercise authority until the time when his appointed heavenly king, Jesus Christ, will take control of earth’s affairs.
It is only when it comes to matters that involve God’s laws that Jehovah’s Witnesses are under obligation to obey Almighty God rather than men. (Acts 5:29) This means that they cannot give to any humans, emblems or nations the honor and worship that they sincerely believe belong only. to God.
It is our heartfelt hope that President Kerekou will personally examine this serious situation, and see that action is taken in favor of decency and freedom of worship. If you feel compassion for those who suffer because of holding to their conscientious beliefs, you may wish to send a telegram or a letter of appeal to President Kerekou and one or more of the officials of the People’s Republic of Benin whose names are listed with this article.

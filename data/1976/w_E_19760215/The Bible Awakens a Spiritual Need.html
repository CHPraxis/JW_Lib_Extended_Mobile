<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">● At times a person’s reading just a few verses of the Holy Scriptures can awaken an awareness to spiritual need.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A woman in the Philippines, for example, had never read the Bible. When she was young her father had obtained a Bible, which was given to her upon her marriage. Later, while working in her husband’s jewel-cutting shop, she ran out of wrapping paper and so started using pages from her Bible for that purpose. She continued doing this until one day she was startled to see on one page the name “Jehovah” in all capital letters. She read further and was impressed by the reference to the wicked being destroyed because of not knowing Jehovah.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Thereafter the woman preserved what was left of the Bible and began reading it regularly. On one occasion, while selling jewels from house to house, she came upon a group of people studying the Bible with one of Jehovah’s witnesses. She invited the Witness to come to her home to study the Bible with her. Now she and her four children are all serving Jehovah. Truly the Bible had awakened a spiritual need, with good results.</p>

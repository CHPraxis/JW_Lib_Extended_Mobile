<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">The public has in recent years been warned from many of the problem of the pollution and destruction of earth’s ecology. Dr. Oscar W. Johnson, professor of biology at Moorhead State College, discussed some of the steps necessary in his essay “The Impact of Industry Upon Our Environment.”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Professor Johnson observed: “It is no longer heretical to suggest that our traditional view of ‘progress’ has to change. Our planet is finite.” As to steps he feels are necessary, he mentioned stabilizing population growth, a new technology to recycle instead of exploit, and massive programs of pollution abatement. Finally, he pointed out: “War will have to become obsolete if the human species intends to meet the economic demands associated with becoming a member of a self-sustaining ecological system. Perhaps this last requirement will be the most difficult of all.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Whereas a review of man’s history seems to point to the improbability of war coming to an end, the Bible describes Jehovah God as the One who “is making wars to cease to the extremity of the earth.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:46:9-19:46:9" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ps. 46:9</a>) That is a blessing that will exist earth wide when his heavenly kingdom acts to replace human rulership with divine rulership.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:2:44-27:2:44" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Dan. 2:44</a>.</p>

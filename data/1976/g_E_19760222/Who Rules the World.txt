Who Rules the World?
Unsuspected by the political rulers, Satan “the great dragon” controls them and is leading them to destruction
When you examine world affairs, does it not seem that a wicked unseen force is manipulating world rulers? You may be surprised to know that the Bible shows this actually to be the case!
The book The Truth That Leads to Eternal Life presents the Bible teaching on this matter. Read its chapter “Are There Wicked Spirits?” You may have this hardbound book for only 25 cents, postpaid.
Please send The Truth That Leads to Eternal Life. I enclose 25c.

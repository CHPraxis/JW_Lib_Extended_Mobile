<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">If the Author of the Bible and the Creator of the animals is the same One, we would expect Bible references to animals to be accurate. They are. Note this observation from the book <em>The Marvels of Animal Behavior: </em>“The Bible, which mentions some 100 kinds of animals, is a veritable treasure-house of references to man’s relationship with ‘the fish of the sea . . . the fowl of the air, and . . . every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.’ Biblical commentators often showed insight as animal behaviorists. <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:8:7-24:8:7" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Jeremiah (8:7</a>) notes the migration of birds: ‘Yea, the stork in the heaven knoweth her appointed times.’ . . . Biblical laws decreeing kindness to animals are the cultural source of some of our own humane laws.”</p>

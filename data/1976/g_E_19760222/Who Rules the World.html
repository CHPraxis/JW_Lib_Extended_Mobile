<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sa">Unsuspected by the political rulers, Satan “the great dragon” controls them and is leading them to destruction</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">When you examine world affairs, does it not seem that a wicked unseen force is manipulating world rulers? You may be surprised to know that the Bible shows this actually to be the case!</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The book <em>The Truth That Leads to Eternal Life </em>presents the Bible teaching on this matter. Read its chapter “Are There Wicked Spirits?” You may have this hardbound book for only 25 cents, postpaid.</p>

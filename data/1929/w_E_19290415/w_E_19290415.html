<h3><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark1"></a>THIS JOURNAL</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4">ITS SACRED MISSION</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">T</span><span class="font3">HIS journal is published for the purpose of aiding the people to understand the divine plan. It provides systematic Bible study in which all its readers may regularly engage. It gives announcement of the visits made to Bible classes by traveling speakers, announces conventions, and gives reports thereof. It announces radio programs and publishes suitable Bible instruction for broadcasting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It adheres strictly to the Bible as God’s revealed Word of Truth. It stands firmly upon the great ransom sacrifice </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">as </span><span class="font3">the fundamental doctrine by which all doctrines are measured. It is free from parties, sects and creeds of men. It does not assume a dogmatic attitude, but confidently invites a careful examination of its utterances in the light </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font3">the infallible Word </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font3">God. It does not indulge in controversies, and its columns are not open to personalities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">TO US THE SCRIPTURES CLEARLY TEACH</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">THAT JEHOVAH is the only true God, the Maker of heaven and earth, and is from everlasting to everlasting; that the Logos was the beginning of his creation; that the Logos became a man; that he is now the Lord Jesus Christ in glory, clothed with all power in heaven and in earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">THAT GOD created the earth for man, created perfect man for the earth and placed him upon it; that man wilfully disobeyed God’s law and was sentenced to death; that by reason of Adam’s wrongful act all men are born sinners and without </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font3">right </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font3">life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">THAT JESUS was made a human being in order that he might become the Redeemer of man; that he gave his life a sacrifice for man and thereby produced the ransom price; that Jesus the divine was raised from the dead, ascended Into heaven, and presented the value of his human sacrifice as the redemptive price for man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">THAT FOR MANY CENTURIES God, through Christ, has been selecting from amongst men the members of his church, which constitutes the body of Christ; that the mission of the church is to follow in the footsteps of her Lord Christ Jesus, grow in his likeness, give testimony to the name and plan of Jehovah God, and ultimately be glorified with Christ Jesus in his heavenly kingdom; that Christ, Head and body, constitutes the “seed of Abraham” through which all the families of the earth shall be blessed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">THAT THE WORLD HAS ENDED; that the Lord Jesus has returned and is now present; that Jehovah has placed Christ Jesus upon his throne and now commands all nations and peoples to hear and obey him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">THAT THE HOPE OF THE PEOPLES of earth is restoration to human perfection during the reign of Christ; that the reign of Christ will afford opportunity to every man to have a fair trial for life, and those who obey will live on earth for ever in a state of happiness.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">In order that friends throughout the United States and Canada may prepare at once to give thorough notice in local territory, announcement is made at this time of another nation-wide broadcast of the message of the kingdom of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">An address by the president of the Society, with opening and concluding musical offerings, will be broadcast simultaneously by radio stations regularly associated in the watch</span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">tower network and also by transmitters, including</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">List of twenty-one watchtower network stations appears in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower</span><span class="font2"> for March 1, 1929, page 66.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This sixty-minute program will be presented in New York city Sunday, April 21, beginning at 10:00 a.m., Eastern Standard Time, and will be audible in other American time zones, as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Central Standard, beginning at 9:00 a.m.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Mountain Standard, beginning at 8 : 00 a.m.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Pacific Standard, beginning at 7:00 a.m.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is suggested that classes and individuals In territory served by any of the above-named stations may share In giving this witness by advertising this program in local newspapers two or three days in advance of the date of broadcast. Let frequent announcement be made also, wherever possible, at the microphone of local radio stations during the week before.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">CANVASSING PARTIES</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">All canvassing parties and all individuals who canvass should mention the radio station in that vicinity that </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">is </span><span class="font3">broadcasting the truth. This often proves a means of opening the way to place the books into the bands of the people. Have in mind that the chief purpose of the radio Is to call the people’s attention to the truth and then furnish the opportunity for them to get a wider understanding </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font3">the truth by reading what is being printed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Every one engaged in the house-to-house work in territory now served by broadcasts of the watchtower network program may have a share in telling the people that this unique service is available every Sunday. The “Radio Slip” supplied by the Society, described more particularly in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower</span><span class="font3"> for March 1, 1929 (page 66), is proving to be a convenient and effective method of giving public notice of this chain program.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">OPPORTUNITY FOR SERVICE</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It seems likely that we shall find It necessary to increase our factory force at Brooklyn from time to time to care for the increasing work. Any unencumbered brothers desiring to participate in this branch of the service will be sent questionnaires. When returned to us they will be filed for call when required.</span></p><img src="w_E_19290415_files/w_E_19290415-2.png" alt="" style="width:475pt;height:54pt;"><a name="caption2"></a>

<h4><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark5"></a>GOD OF BATTLE</span></h4>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“Thus saith the Lord unto you, Be not afraid nor dismayed by reason of this great multitude; for the battle is not yours, but God’s.”—2 Chron. 20:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">J</span><span class="font4">EHOVAH caused the above words to be spoken by his prophet to the inhabitants of Jerusalem. The real purpose at the time was to make a picture showing God’s power and his means to care for his own. The picture and instruction given was written for the aid and comfort of the people of God on earth at the end of the world. The Christian now really devoted to the Lord is a member of Jerusalem, which means God’s organization. Manifestly it is the will of God that his sons now on the earth should claim to themselves the promise in this text. It is in time of war that the promise applies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">PEACE</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">* In the Scriptures it is written that Jehovah is “the God of peace”. (Heb. 13: 20) How can it be consistently said in the Scriptures that he is the ‘God of battle’ conducting a great war, as it is written: “The Lord is a man of war: the Lord is his name”? Jehovah is the great God of peace. He abides in a state of calm and tranquillity. He is never disturbed by controversies. By his Word it is revealed that he is seated with a rainbow about him. Thus he is pictured as dwelling in sanctified peace.—Rev. 4:3; Ezek. 1:28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">'Jehovah never provokes war. For ages God’s name has been defamed and reproaches cast upon him, but Jehovah never suffers any disturbance of his peace of being by reason thereof. Residing in the highest heavens, he gives forth wisdom which is always pure and peaceable. (Jas. 3:17) The ways of the wisdom which he gives are always ways of pleasantness and peace. (Prov. 3:17) There is often great confusion amongst his creatures, even among those who are his people, but “God is not the author of confusion”. (1 Cor. 14:33) When it is his will he casts his enemies into confusion. In the midst of great confusion of war and battle, God can not be moved into confusion. He is the great God of peace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">DUE SEASON</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">* God is long-suffering and of great mercy. (Num. 14:18; Ps. 86:15) But his due time comes to take</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">action to preserve his name for the good of his creatures. In Noah’s day he was long-suffering with the evil ones, but when the time came for him to take action he did so. (1 Pet. 3:20) “To every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven. ... A time to love, and a time to hate; a time of war, and a time of peace.” (Eccl. 3:1-8) Such is the rule by which Jehovah governs himself. Being all-wise, he acts exactly at the right time, and therefore in due time.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>5</sup> Jehovah God is the source of all life. All right to life proceeds from him. If his creatures rebel against him he cuts them off from the privileges of life. If the creature forgets the name of his Creator and follows God’s enemy he goes in the way of destruction. Therefore, for the good of his creatures God at the proper time brings his own name before them. He makes for himself a name by the demonstration of his power, which shows that there is none like unto him. Such is not for the profit that God receives therefrom, but is for the profit of his creatures.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>6</sup> The great enemy of God is Satan the Devil, who because of his wickedness has put himself beyond the blessings of Jehovah. God hates his enemies for their wickedness and will destroy them in his due time. His enemy Satan seeks to draw all of God’s creatures into the pathway of evil which, if followed to the end, would mean destruction. By putting his name before his creatures God informs them of the way to life. His act is therefore wholly unselfish. He is the God of love.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>T</sup> Jehovah God does not maliciously engage in war. He could not have malice toward his creatures, because he does not possess malice. His law is perfect and right, and he abides by it himself. (Ps. 19: 7, 8) His laws have been repeatedly violated. Being righteous, he must enforce his laws. In his own due time he does that very thing. He judicially determines what shall be done with the wicked, and in his own due time he executes his decree or judgment of righteousness. The wars of Jehovah are therefore merely the proper and timely enforcement of his laws. The </span><span class="font2">115</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">enforcement of his decrees takes the form of war. Jehovah can choose any instrument he may choose to act as his executioner; but at the same time it is God’s war, because it is the enforcement of his judgment.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>8</sup> Sometimes a people or a nation without a cause or excuse made an attack upon God’s chosen people and God used the Israelites as his executioner to punish them for their wrong doing. (Ex. 17:8-16; 1 Sam. 15:2,3) When the Israelites repeatedly violated God’s law he enforced the decree against them by using others to act as his executioner. (Ezek. 21:24-27; Jer. 39:5-8) Men used as instruments of Satan have wrongfully charged God with being guilty of bloody and unjust wars. Every war that has been fought by Jehovah has been for the benefit of those who would have life and has therefore been fought for the vindication of God’s law and name.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">FIRST WAR</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>8</sup> The first declaration of war was at the time of Adam’s sin in Eden. Lucifer, trusted officer of Jehovah, was guilty of rebellion against God. He became the enemy of God by reason of his deliberate violation of God’s law. Lucifer’s purpose was to make himself a ruler like unto Jehovah and build a great organization of his own, in defiance of God. To that end he led the creatures of God into sin. Lucifer set himself up to be worshiped and placed himself in opposition to the great Creator. He became opposed to Jehovah, as his name Satan indicates.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>10</sup> The course of Satan was covetous and rebellious. He desired something to which he was not entitled. He resorted to treason to obtain that desire. His course placed God’s other creatures in danger of destruction because of the violation of God’s law. For such treasonable act God decreed that the deliberate law-breaker Satan must die. He deferred the execution of his judgment, well knowing that Satan would further harden his heart and that his hatred of God and his law and of all creatures who would take God’s side would thenceforth increase and that this would afford opportunity for God’s creatures to prove their loyalty or disloyalty unto God. The agency which God will use to enforce his decree or judgment, he names; and in due time that old Serpent the Devil shall fall at the hands of the “seed of the woman’’. He announced that he would “put enmity . . . between thy seed and her seed [the seed of the woman] ; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel”. (Gen. 3:15) “The woman” here refers to the covenant which produces the seed, which seed is Christ, God’s executive officer.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>11</sup> Adam chose to follow Satan, the god other than the great Jehovah God, contrary to God’s law. (Judg. 5:8) The entire human race has suffered in consequence thereof. The earth therefore became the scene of war begun by Satan. The first blood in the war was shed by Satan when he caused Cain to slay his brother Abel. From then till now Satan has made war on every one who has taken his stand firmly on the side of Jehovah God. To keep his name before his creatures that they might see the supremacy of his power and know that life can come only from him, God has at stated times manifested his warlike power against the enemy.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">LORD OF HOSTS</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>1S</sup> Jehovah is the only lawgiver. (Jas. 4:12) He is the Supreme in command of the forces of righteousness. He has a vast number of intelligent creatures and forces in his organization and is therefore called “the Lord of sabaoth”, which means the Lord of armies or military forces. (Jas. 5:4) He is “The Lord of hosts, . . . the King of glory”. (Ps. 24:10) He is the Lord God of hosts and his strength is supreme. (Ps. 89:8) That means that Jehovah God has a great host and that he is in command thereof. The “Captain of the host of Jehovah” is his beloved Son Christ Jesus, whom Jehovah has clothed with full power and authority. (Josh. 5:14) Christ Jesus </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">is </span><span class="font4">Priest or chief officer of the Most High. In his Word God speaks of his beloved Son as acting in such a capacity. (Ps. 110: 4; 45; 1-9; Rev. 19:11-14) The righteous angels are in his organization and members of his great host. Those on the earth wholly devoted to God are counted as </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font4">part of his army. Each division of the army of the Lord is assigned to duty. The fact of such great organization is proof that it is to be used in God’s appointed time. Satan has a tremendous organization, the power and extent of which is little appreciated even by those who claim to </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">be </span><span class="font4">on God’s side.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">PRIZE</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>13</sup> The cause against which Satan and his army fights is the good name of Jehovah. The prize of war is the human race. Satan covets that prize and has staked his all that he might win it. He is the certain loser and must suffer everlasting defeat and destruction. God appointed Lucifer as overlord of man. Instead of treating this office of trust as a sacred charge Satan thought out a scheme of robbery to seize the human family and hold it for himself. God could have prevented Satan from so doing, but had he done so, good and evil could not have been contrasted and the creation would never have learned the lesson that obedience leads to life and rebellion leads to death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>14</sup>Perfect wisdom said: ‘Let Satan do his worst; let man make his choice; and let all creation learn that God alone can give everlasting life, with the blessings incident thereto. ’ As a result of Adam’s sin the human race has been brought into sin. “All we </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">like sheep have gone </span><span class="font4">astray.” </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">In a </span><span class="font4">parable Jesus pictures the human race as a lost sheep and himself leaving the courts of heaven and going forth on a lonely and dangerous journey to fight for and recover the strayed sheep. On that mission Jesus must be successful, because he is the Son and executive officer of the Most High and clothed with complete power and authority.—Luke 15: 3-7.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4"><sup>15</sup> Satan the enemy has the human race blinded and under his control, and the day must come when Satan and all of his hosts shall be put under foot and the human race fully reconciled and restored to God. To accomplish this act for humanity a great war is necessary, and Jehovah the great God of battle will fight that battle against Satan and his hosts and win it. The forces are now rapidly gathering for that battle, and soon it shall be fought.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">BATTLE ALIGNMENT</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>16</sup> Satan and his angels, all invisible to man, and all human agencies that willingly support his organization are on the enemy’s side. All the world is on Satan’s side now, and his forces Satan is gathering and forming into battle line. On the side of Jehovah God is his beloved Son as Captain in command, the resurrected saints, all the holy angels of heaven, and those from amongst men who have been taken out from the world and brought forth as the sons of God. In these latter days God has revealed to his people who are on the earth the hideousness of Satan’s powerful organization. He has also shown them something about his own organization. Now he is revealing to them their position in the line of battle and showing them what their duties and privileges are. Jehovah is in supreme command. He needs no one to help him. To be on his side now is the most wonderful privilege. The question now is, Who is on the side of Jehovah God?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>17</sup> Few among men have the faith in God and devotion to him to take their stand on his side. Many are afraid of the visible part of Satan’s army because such have little love for or faith in Jehovah God. Only the remnant count not their lives dear unto them and wholly trust in Jehovah. They are blind to everything except the doing of the will of God. They know that within themselves they are helpless against the gigantic organization of Satan, but with full confidence in God they fervently pray: “Save now, I beseech thee, 0 Lord: 0 Lord, I beseech thee, send now prosperity. ’ ’—Ps. 118: 25.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">THE CHRISTIAN AND WAR</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>18</sup> What is the proper place for a Christian in time of war between nations? Suppose that there is a war between the British nation and the nation of America and that in both of the nations reside some true followers of Christ. What shall they do with reference to taking sides and fighting in the war?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>19</sup> Many nations call themselves “Christian”, and their clergy attempt to find some reason to say that the nation in which the clergyman resides is fighting a just cause which is approved by God. Their position is entirely false. The wars between the nations are not fought according to the will of God. Since none of the nations of the world are God’s nations, he has not directed and does not direct their wars. Jehovah indulges in war to enforce his judgment for the violation of his law. The nations of earth are not acting as God’s instruments to carry on war among themselves. Their wars are selfish and are prompted by Satan, the god of this world. If the nations of the world wish to fight one another, that is their affair and not the affair of the Christian. The Christian has no right to say to another person, ‘You shall not go to war.’ If the person is a part of the world, he must determine for himself what he wishes to do.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>20</sup> If one is wholly devoted to the Lord God, he must be governed by God’s law. No real and true follower of Christ Jesus can have any room for doubt as to what he should do concerning his participation or non-participation in the wars of the world. To such Jesus said: “Ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world.” (John 15:19) There is no partnership between Satan’s organization and God’s organization, and especially the child of God can not fight in the wars between the nations.— 2 Cor. 6:15-18.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>21</sup> But suppose the nation in which the Christian has his earthly domicile enacts a law compelling all persons within certain ages to perform military service, put on the uniform and go to war and use the instruments of destruction to kill. What shall he do? The Apostle Paul answers: “Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness ? ’ ’—Rom. 6:16.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>22</sup> The law of nations says, ‘You shall go to war and kill.’ The law of God, by which his sons must be governed, says, “Thou shalt not kill.” (Matt. 5:21) “Love worketh no ill to his neighbour; therefore love is the fulfilling of the law. ”—Rom. 13: 9,10.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>23</sup> The true Christian obeys the law of God. That is the Christian’s creed. For this reason the Bible Students devoted to the Lord refuse </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">to</span><span class="font4"> take military service, because they are true followers of Christ and must obey God’s law. When the law of the land is right it will be in harmony with God’s law and all true Christians will obey it of course. Laws are made to keep wrong-doers in check. The Christian is not a wrong-doer. Love is the rule by which he must be governed, and that means always to do right. But suppose the Christian is threatened with imprisonment or death if he declines to be obedient to the law of the land commanding him to go to war and kill his fellow man. The apostle answers that question in these words: “Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto God, judge ye.” (Acts 4:19) Therefore the creed which is the teaching of the Bible, and which is that which the Bible Students, as Christians, believe, forbids them from engaging in military service that might lead to the taking of human life. Far better would it be to suffer death at the hands of man for doing right than to do wrong in the sight of God and suffer destruction.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">“ In the great war which Jehovah fights against Satan, do not the true followers of Christ form a part of God’s great army ? and therefore do they not go to war ? They are members of God’s army; but God’s law does not require them to take human life. The weapons which they use are not carnal. (2 Cor. 10: 4) The true follower of Christ is a member of God’s holy nation, which God has taken out of the world for his name and to be witnesses and to show forth his praises. (1 Pet. 2:9,10; Acts 15:14) In these days, when God is setting up his kingdom, he has made the truth so clear that there is no longer any excuse for any of his children to be in doubt of their proper course. “Come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing; and I will receive you. ’ ’—2 Cor. 6:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>20</sup> Those who have devoted themselves to God and unreservedly taken their stand on his side have been assigned to a definite position in God’s army, and that assignment has been made by Jehovah. His Word makes the Christian’s duty clear. His position requires the Christian to sing forth the praises of Jehovah by telling out his purposes, and while he does so God will do his fighting in His own good way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>26</sup> What Jehovah was to Israel, and what he did for Israel in time of danger and war, he is now to those who are of Zion, or the temple class, his own people. When the Israelites were about to enter Canaan, and there to meet their enemies, Moses, speaking for Jehovah, said: “The Lord your God, which goeth before you, he shall fight for you, according to all that he did for you in Egypt before your eyes.” (Deut. 1:30) After instructing Joshua in the audience of the people, Moses, as God’s mouthpiece, said: “Ye shall not fear them: for the Lord your God he shall fight for you.” (Deut. 3:22) Whenever God put the Israelites in battle array facing the enemy he instructed them in these words: “And it shall be, when ye are come nigh unto the battle, that the priest shall approach, and speak unto the people, and shall say unto them, Hear, 0 Israel; ye approach this day unto battle against your enemies: let not your hearts faint; fear not, and do not tremble, neither be ye terrified because of them; for the Lord your God is he that goeth with you, to fight for you against your enemies, to save you. ’ ’—Deut. 20: 2-4.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>2T</sup> A great crisis had arisen in Israel when the city of Jerusalem was threatened by the combined armies of Ammon, Moab and Mount Seir. God sent a message to his people by his prophet and said: “Thus saith the Lord unto you, Be not afraid nor dismayed by reason of this great multitude; for the battle is not yours, but God’s.” Then Jehovah God gave specific instruction to his people concerning what they should do. He told them to put singers in the van of the army, and to have these march out in battle form singing the praises of Jehovah God. They obeyed him, and ‘when they began to sing and to praise, the Lord set an ambush against the enemy and slew them’. (2 Chron. 20:15-22) The divine record of those events was made for the specific benefit of God’s people now on earth.—Rom. 15: 4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>28</sup> The church is now entering into “the day of battle and war”. (Job 38:23) By reason thereof the remnant is now in the most perilous position. (Rev. 12:17) The safety of the remnant now depends upon God, and complete protection he will furnish to all who fully trust him and obey his commandments.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>29</sup> Let no one be induced to believe that he can now remain passive, lukewarm or in an indifferent attitude and at the same time receive the protection of the Lord. Some foolish persons, thinking themselves Christians, say that the Society is a book-selling concern. That statement is false because it emanates from the enemy who uses his wily and fraudulent means to overcome the people of God. Let the remnant be not at all disturbed by this saying.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>80</sup> Jehovah needs no one to fight his battles, because he is all-powerful. He permits the remnant now to be in battle alignment as a favor to them. He sends them forth with his message in printed form to serve notice upon the rulers and nations. To the remnant he says: ‘ I have put my words in thy mouth, and . . . covered thee in the shadow of mine hand [power], while I set my government in order.’ (Isa. 51:16) Why would he put his words in the mouth of the remnant? That they should be his witnesses to tell the people that Jehovah is God.—Isa. 43:10,12.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>31</sup> We are now in “that day”, and God commands his people to sing, even as he commanded the people of Israel. “And in that day shall ye say, Praise the Lord, call upon his name, declare his doings among the people, make mention that his name is exalted. Sing unto the Lord; for he hath done excellent things: this [make] known in all the earth. Cry out and shout, thou inhabitant of Zion: for great is the Holy One of Israel in the midst of thee. ’ ’-Isa. 12: 4-6.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>82</sup> These are God’s commandments, which the remnant must keep if they would have the protection promised in the hour of great battle. Those who are of the remnant will not thrust each other now, but, as foretold by the prophet, ‘with the voice together shall they sing, and they shall see eye to eye.’ (Isa. 52:8) Let the church bear in mind that God’s people on earth, forming a part of his organization, constitute the only part in the alignment of battle that is vulnerable. When the supreme assault is made by the enemy the remnant is the only visible part of the organization of the Lord on earth that will not be cut down. These will stand because of their absolute trust in God and obedience to his commandments.— Zech. 14:1,2.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">NOTICE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>88</sup> In the armies of the world, secrecy of movement is maintained. In fact it is now claimed that in event of another war between nations it will begin without a declaration and that the first attack will be by surprise. Jehovah’s course is exactly contrary to that. He serves Satan and the officials of his visible organization with due notice of what he will do. Nor docs God take this course in order to bring about a peaceable settlement. He seeks no arbitration with the enemy. He has declared his decree, and the time has come to execute it, and therefore he serves the enemy with an ultimatum which under no conditions will be altered. Satan, knowing that the time is short in which to prepare for battle, hastens the preparation therefor. (Rev. 12:12; 16:14) While this is in progress God commands his remnant to go out and tell the rulers and the people what he is about to do. His remnant is commanded to sing Jehovah’s praises because the time is at hand when God will make a name for himself in the great battle of Armageddon, which is the battle of the great day of God Almighty.—Rev. 16:14-16.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>34</sup> Because of the approaching battle, Jehovah commands his witnesses to proclaim the day of the vengeance of our God. (Isa. 61:2) The time has come when Jehovah will vindicate his name before all creation. God will have all nations of the earth to hear this message, and therefore he commands that the message shall be given before the final trouble.— Matt. 24:14, 21, 22.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>35</sup> How could any of God’s sons be faithful and true to him if they either failed or refused to obey the commandments now to give the witness to God’s name? Jehovah does not need the remnant or any one else on earth to fight, or even to serve notice, but he has given his remnant this place of honor as a favor to them. That is the position of such in his army, and these are commanded to sing the praises of Jehovah while he moves into action against the enemy to destroy him.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">WEAKNESS AND STRENGTH</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>88</sup> The visible part of Satan’s organization is great and powerful. The visible part of God’s organization on earth, made up of his fully devoted sons, is very small and its members weak in themselves. If the little company of anointed ones should proclaim the truth for a million years and place in the hands of </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">every </span><span class="font4">living creature a book explaining the Bible, that would not overthrow Satan’s organization. That is not the purpose of the witness work. The little company of Christians on the earth have nothing to do with destroying Satan’s organization or any life. “The battle is Jehovah’s.” He has a good and worthy reason for the apparent great disparity in the two armies. One of such reasons is to afford the opportunity to fully test the faith and confidence of God’s anointed ones. He wants the anointed to be strong in him and in the power of his might.-Eph. 6:</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">10.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>37</sup> Jian trusts in visible power. The remnant of the Lord trusts in Jehovah’s power. “Some trust in chariots, and some in horses: but we will remember the name of the Lord our God.” (Ps. 20:7) “The horse is prepared against the day of battle: but safety is of the Lord. ’ ’—Prov. 21; 31.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>38</sup> A second reason for this apparent discrepancy in the alignment of battle is that when creation sees that the victory was not gained by human power they will know that the victory is the result of Almighty God’s power exercised. They will then know that ho is the Mighty God of battle and that “the battle is God’s”. The fact that a small company of people on earth is on the Lord’s side singing his praises before and during the battle will further magnify before the people the power and strength and glory of God. Thus he will make a name for himself to the end that all who desire to live may with complete confidence and trust turn to him and learn to know the true God and his beloved Son Christ Jesus and live.—John 17: 3.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>39</sup> Some claiming full consecration to the Lord will drop out of the battle alignment before the great fight. They will not take a part in the singing of the praises of Jehovah. Some will make the excuse: </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">‘I </span><span class="font4">have not the time ’; and others, ‘ I have not the ability. ’ Both excuses show a lack of faith in God and of </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font4">love for him. Such manifest a selfish love and fear. All that the Christian has, including his time, belongs to the Lord. His ability is measured by the spirit of the Lord which he possesses. God foreshadowed this class. When the Israelites were about to go into battle God commanded that every man who loved his house or his wife or his vineyard more than he loved to obey God, and every one who was fearful, should get out of the line of battle and return to his home. (Deut. 20: 2-9) That was written for the benefit of the Christians now on earth. Even so now, as the battle alignment is being made up, God says to the indifferent and lukewarm and those who love the things material more than they love God: ‘Stand aside, and let him march to war who loves God and counts not his life dear unto himself. ’ To those who love and trust God completely he says: ‘ The battle is not yours, but mine. Trust me and show your faithfulness and love for me, and I will preserve you and give you the victory.’ -Rev. 3:16; Prov. 3: 5, 6; Isa. 26:3; Ps. 31: 23 ; 27: 4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>40</sup> The security of the remnant is in the Lord. The members thereof know that they are in the secret place of the Most High and abiding under the shadow of his power. They know that their strength is in the Lord. Because they are on the side of the Lord God, they know that no weapon formed against them shall prosper. (Isa. 54:17) With full confidence in Jehovah they say: “Thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle. ’ ’—Ps. 18: 39.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>41</sup> While it is true that the remnant is fighting on the Lord’s side, their own activities will not bring the victory. It is quite clear that the remnant is not fighting for the Lord. God does not need any one to fight for him. For their own good, God gives those of the remnant the opportunity to fight on his side. The enemy organization aims to destroy the remnant. (Rev. 12:17) Therefore such are the ones that are in danger. The Lord, therefore, will fight for those who are of Zion. Concerning this the prophet of God said: “ So shall the Lord of hosts come down to fight for mount Zion, and for the hill [highest part] thereof. As birds flying, so will the Lord of hosts defend Jerusalem [that is to say, with the swiftness of birds will God fly in defence of his own organization] ; defending also he will deliver it; and passing over [as the mother bird hovers over her young] he will preserve it.’’—Isa. 31: 4, 5.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>42</sup> General Allenby led the allied armies against the Turks who were holding the city during the World War. He caused airplanes to fly over the city repeatedly before it surrendered. The general foolishly applied this prophecy to himself and induced himself to believe that God appointed him to capture Jerusalem. Of course the prophecy has no reference whatsoever to the literal city of Jerusalem. It applies only to God’s organization, which was foreshadowed by Jerusalem.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>43</sup> ‘ ‘ Thou art my battle axe and weapons of war: for with thee will I break in pieces the nations; and with thee will I destroy kingdoms.’’ (Jer. 51:20) This text is in exact harmony with the aforementioned prophecy of Isaiah. The words of Jeremiah are addressed to Jesus, the executive officer and High Priest of Jehovah, who fights the great battle in the name of Jehovah. (Ps. 110:4; 2:9; Dan. 2:44) The body members, and particularly those on the earth, have nothing whatsoever to do with the wielding of destructive weapons, but they are counted in and share with Christ Jesus in the victory as a bride shares with her bridegroom.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>44</sup> Those of the remnant have the honor of being the standard-bearers on earth of the Lord’s army. The standard of the Lord committed to that hap</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">py class is </span><span class="font4">the message of </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">God’s </span><span class="font4">Word. With this they are “terrible as an army with banners’’, and among them the Lord Jesus is the StandardBearer among ten thousand. (Cant. 6:4; 5:10, margin) All of the anointed now have the honor of raising high the standard of the Lord. ‘ ‘ In the name of our God we will set up our banners. ’ ’—Ps. 20: 5.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>45</sup> Every Christian who has been brought into the covenant with God by sacrifice must take his stand on the side of the Lord and be fully obedient to his commandments if he would receive God’s protection and the victory in the great warfare. Preservation and blessings are only to the faithful overcomers.</span></p></li></ul>

<h4><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark7"></a>THE EARTH TO BE MADE GLORIOUS</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">[Fifteen-minute radio lecture]</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">A</span><span class="font4"> FEW months ago a celebrated clergyman, in a radio talk, made this remark: “This earth is quite a juvenile planet. Let us robe it with God’s glory in man’s moral achievements, then Christ can come.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Judging man’s moral achievements by his record for the past six thousand years, there could not be much reason for expecting any improvement along these lines, for the moral conditions of the earth were never at a lower ebb than at the present time. If the robing of the earth in God’s glory is to be left to man, then it will never be accomplished. The proof of this statement lies in the fact that the past is cluttered with the wrecks of man’s achievements. Many, many governments, the best that man can produce, have gone down to destruction. Hundreds of church systems have appeared on the horizon, made desperate efforts to stem the tide of human selfishness, only to acknowledge defeat; and all must eventually give up the fight.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The statute books are glutted with laws, similar to the much-vaunted American prohibition law, designed to accomplish some of man’s wonderful moral achievements ; but across every one of them has been and will continue to be written the word </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">failure.</span><span class="font4"> It is impossible for </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">man</span><span class="font4"> to stop wars, crime, lawlessness, sin, sickness, immorality or death. It is impossible for man to perfect the face of nature. The soil is daily becoming more and more impoverished and less and less fertile. Justice is dead in the streets, and every day her mangled body is being trampled upon by those who are appointed to be the guardians of justice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">However, the Bible repeatedly pictures a glorious earth, robed in God’s glory; a perfect earth: where moral conditions will be perfect; where the face of mother Earth will be perfect; peopled with a race of human beings having perfect health and exercising perfect love toward one another and enjoying perfect life, liberty, peace and happiness. If this Bible picture is correct, it is self-evident that the condition can not be brought about by man’s achievements. Only the almighty power of Jehovah God can achieve such blessings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When Jehovah created this planet his purpose was to have a glorious earth, something that would be </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font4">credit to himself throughout all eternity, and something that would give everlasting and stupendous testimony to his attributes of wisdom, justice, love and power; indeed he knew the tendency of fallen man would be to appropriate the credit for the divine accomplishments to himself, and so Jehovah arranged to let man try his hand for six thousand years at bringing about some moral achievements, so that when Jehovah God himself should robe the earth in a most wondrous glory, no man could claim any credit therefor. God has decreed that no flesh shall boast in his presence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is wonderfully interesting to note the method used by Jehovah in making the earth glorious. Seven thousand years before his due time for having a. glorious earth, Jehovah created Adam and Eve and placed them on the unfinished earth. At that time the earth was unfit to be man’s abode, filled with thorns, thistles, briars, miasma; and so Jehovah God specially prepared a portion of the earth, perfecting it and making it fit to be the abode of perfect beings. He called that specially prepared place a garden, a paradise. It was a sample of what the entire earth was to be eventually.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In this garden nothing grew except that which was pleasant to the eye and good for food. (Gen. 2:6-8) Every convenience, every necessity, every comfort was there. A perfect environment adapted to perpetuate a perfect human life everlastingly and all necessary perfect foods were supplied by the Creator, the giver of all these good and perfect gifts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">God planned to let father Adam and his posterity make the earth glorious, and so commissioned Adam to do it and gave him 7,000 years to accomplish the work. During these 7,000 years his children would be bom, and at maturity each one would cooperate with their father in the work, and, of course, as the family would increase, their garden home would be too small, and, of necessity, they would be required to enlarge that garden, until eventually all the earth would be like the original sample.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The commission given to Adam, as found in Genesis 1:28 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Rotherham')</span><span class="font4"> reads: “Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth, and subdue it. ’ ’ God foresaw that it would take 7,000 years for enough of Adam’s children to be born to fill the earth, and he wisely so planned it all that at the time the earth would be brought to a state of perfection, his children would all be born, the work all finished, and the result would be an earth robed in God’s glory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The fact that God commanded Adam to do this, implied that he was given the power, the authority and the ability to do it. It implied also that he had the necessary information and knowledge to do it. Still another part of Adam’s commission was this: ‘Have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the birds and the beasts.’ This man was </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">authorized</span><span class="font4"> to robe the earth in God’s glory by his achievements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">But the commission given to Adam by his Creator was contingent on perfect obedience to the law of his Creator. Had he or his children never violated God’s law, they would be engaged in filling and glorifying the earth even in our day, and on until its completion. God plainly told him that if he disobeyed he would forfeit his commission. The record is that he disobeyed, was driven out of the garden and left alone to die, in the unfinished earth. His commission had been forfeited, and his work was stopped.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">God could no longer use either him or any one of his imperfect posterity in filling the earth with his glory. God has not commissioned any imperfect man .or men to do this work, and never will. Jehovah, however, has never changed his purpose, and still designs that the whole earth shall be filled with his glory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">But who is to do this work? If imperfect fallen man is out of the consideration, whom will Jehovah use? In clear and positive language the Bible declares that Jehovah God has raised up a </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">second Adam </span><span class="font4">to do the work, and the second Adam is none other than the resurrected Jesus Christ, who has “all power in heaven and in earth ’ ’.—1 Cor. 15: 45-47.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">More than eighteen hundred years ago our Lord Jesus Christ received his commission to do this work, but he has had to wait the Father’s due time for him to begin it. That time is now here, and he has already begun the work and God has given him a thousand years to accomplish it. Uis first work must necessarily be the destruction of all the miserable achievements of men. Jehovah says that he will ‘sweep the earth with the besom of destruction’. (Isa. 14: 23) This work began in 1914, and will soon end, when the battle of the great day of God Almighty shall have ground to powder the man-made nations of earth. All the man-made, God-dishonoring creeds of the “dark ages” must likewise be for ever destroyed. He will make wars to cease unto the ends of the earth. Profiteering, grafting, vice, immorality and crime must end under the iron rule of the Son of God, as must also sickness, pain and death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">After the destruction of Satan’s man-made organizations, and all others of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">man’s</span><span class="font4"> achievements, Christ will then take the stricken, humiliated and chastened race, and for the rest of his thousand-year reign will uplift, educate and bless them. In this work of uplift, education and blessing, not only are the living to share, but, according to the Scriptures, all the dead will come forth and share in these glorious blessings. In order that this work may not be hindered, we are told, Satan is to be bound during the thousand years. —Rev. 20:1, 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Now let us note some texts that describe the glory of the Lord which will fill the earth at the end of the thousand years of Christ’s reign, when he shall have turned the kingdom over to his Father, that God may be all in all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jesus said: “The hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his [the Son of man’s] voice, and shall come forth; they that have done good . . . and they that have done evil.” (John 5: 28, 29) With this the words of the Prophet Ezekiel agree: “Thus saith the Lord God, Behold, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">0 </span><span class="font4">my people, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font4">will open your graves, and cause you to come up out of your graves, and bring you into the land of Israel.” (Ezek. 37:12) In Isaiah 35:1,2 we read: “The desert shall rejoice, and blossom as the rose. It shall blossom abundantly.” In verses 5 and 6 of the same chapter we read with amazement, as follows: “Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened, and the ears of the deaf shall be unstopped. Then shall the lame man leap as an hart, and the tongue of the dumb sing. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Still another text which describes God’s glory in the earth is found in Revelation 21:4, and reads </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">as </span><span class="font4">follows: “God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away. ’ ’ Also, Isaiah </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">2:4, </span><span class="font4">“And they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruninghooks: nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In Isaiah 11: 6-9 we read: ‘ ‘ The wolf also shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid; . . . and a little child shall lead them. And the cow and the bear shall feed; their young ones shall lie down together: and the lion shall eat straw like the ox. And the sucking child shall play on the hole of the asp, and the weaned child shall put his hand on the cockatrice’ den. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain: for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Still again, in Isaiah 65: 21-23 we read: ‘ ‘ They shall build houses, and inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them. They shall not build, and another inhabit; they shall not plant, and another cat. . . . They shall not labour in vain, nor bring forth for trouble.” The same prophet says: “Instead of the thorn shall come up the fir tree, and instead of the brier shall come up the myrtle tree: and it shall be to Jehovah for a name, for an everlasting sign that shall not be cut off.”—Isa. 55:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Again, in Ezekiel 36: 35 we read: ‘ ‘ This land that was desolate is become like the garden of Eden. ’ ’ And the Apostle Paul, writing to the church at Philippi, says that ‘at the name of Jesus every knee shall bow, and every tongue shall confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father’.—Phil. 2:10,11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Thus seen, God’s glory, as it shall fill the whole earth, will consist of a redeemed and resurrected race, enjoying everlasting life on a perfect earth, every portion of which shall be like the garden of Eden. This race will recognize and worship Jehovah the one true God, without the limitations of creeds or sectarian bondage. They will love God supremely, and their neighbor as themselves. It will not be </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">man’s </span><span class="font4">moral achievements that will bring about these happy results, but the thousand-year kingdom of Christ; and when the work is completed it will be the achievement of Jesus Christ, Jehovah’s agent, duly authorized and empowered to do the work. God’s glory will consist of a happy, contented race of human beings enjoying life, liberty, peace and happiness for ever, Jehovah’s gift to his creatures.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark9"></a>JEHOVAH GOD, THE UNSELFISH ONE</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">[Thirty-five minute radio lecture]</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">S</span><span class="font4">ELFISHNESS means thinking of self first; considering our own interests or comforts without considering the interests, comforts or rights of others. A selfish person is a narrow-minded person who says and does things only because they will benefit and profit self in some way. Selfishness destroys all those tender qualities in the human make-up which make man like unto his Creator. It destroys the God-like qualities of sympathy, mercy, kindness, benevolence, pity, long-suffering, patience and love. The person who cultivates unselfishness will find himself cultivating a love for and an appreciation of the divine qualities. On the other hand, those who cultivate selfishness gradually become cruel and unmerciful.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Unselfishness means considering the interests, comforts and rights of others first. It means trying always to be a help and a blessing to others, even if it cost some sacrifice of personal comfort, convenience or money.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah God is unselfish in the absolute sense of the word. He has been planning and working for the blessing of the human race all through the ages. He has not been neglecting them, nor has he forgotten them. The Son of God, our Lord Jesus Christ, is also unselfish in the full and complete sense of the word. Like his Father, the great Jehovah God, Jesus has in mind always the blessing of the race. Without a doubt those angels who are still. in harmony with Jehovah God, and called ‘‘holy angels”, are likewise unselfish in a perfect or complete sense.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We need to get clearly into our minds, however, that there is no member of the fallen, sinful race who is unselfish in the absolute sense of the word. Some of the race are basely and beastly selfish. Others are unwittingly so; that is, they try to be unselfish and think they are succeeding, but because of lack of education, improper training, inherited weaknesses, poor judgments, poor reasoning faculties or </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font4">lack of ability to properly weigh the rights of others, they are not aware that they are selfish, and would resent and deny such an imputation. It often occurs that those who think they are unselfish, who think their every word and act is actuated by good and worthy motives, become puffed up with pride and are prone to consider themselves as being superior to their fellow men. This pride spoils them, for the reason that pride is selfishness in one of its worst forms. God hates the proud, and his Word says: “God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace [favor! to the humble.” —1 Pet. 5: 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Selfishness is one of the worst of all the forms of evil, and is also one of the most subtle, gradually and almost imperceptibly influencing every word and act and motive. Selfishness can never be fully overcome until the kingdom of Christ shall take charge of earth’s affairs, bind the Devil, and properly educate the people in ways of righteousness and truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In order that the perfect unselfishness of Jehovah God may shine out the more clearly, let us contrast it with some of the subtle forms of human selfishness which are not generally regarded as being selfish. For instance: Many people desire to go to heaven when they die, but behind this desire there is a selfish motive. They want to go to heaven in order to escape eternal torment, or to escape suffering in the flesh, or to enjoy themselves in ease and comfort and escape the necessity for having to work. All these motives are selfish, and without a better motive no person will ever get to heaven. Such people are thinking of their own personal comfort and pleasure and are not taking God into consideration in their desires.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">According to the Scriptures only the church class will ever go to heaven, while the remainder of the race are to live on the earth for ever. In offering the reward of heavenly glory and spirit bodies, the Lord had a particular purpose in view for them and a particular work for them to do. It is mentioned in Ephesians 3:21, which reads, “Unto him be glory in the church . . . throughout all ages,” that the true church is to show forth the glory of Jehovah. Peter expresses the same thought, saying to the church, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“Ye </span><span class="font4">are </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font4">chosen generation, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font4">royal priesthood, . . . that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light. ’ ’—1 Pet. 2: 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It would be entirely unselfish for anybody to desire to have the heavenly body and spirit nature and powers for the purpose for which God intended them, namely, to show forth his praises; but any other motive would be selfish.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">What a privilege and honor it will be to show forth Jehovah’s attributes of wisdom, justice, love and power throughout all eternity, to tell out his loving plans and purposes to all his creatures! This will mean </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">work,</span><span class="font4"> activity, and does not mean that any one will loll about in idleness, enjoying peace, contentment, liberty and life, with nothing to do. This work, however, will be a pleasurable one. Nobody will ever get weary or tired of the work. On the contrary, the joy of doing it will always increase as the ages roll around.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">But why does God desire that his name and work and plans should be made known to all his creatures? The answer is that he unselfishly desires to give all his creatures everlasting blessings; and these blessings can come to no one except he first learn what God’s work and plan is and then come fully into accord with the same and strive to cooperate with God in the accomplishment of that work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Those who thus desire to use their powers in the service of their Creator are unselfish, because they are considering the interests and work of Jehovah God first. They are not selfishly looking to their own comfort and convenience and pleasure. Selfishness is of Satan; and men must learn that there are only two masters, Jehovah God and Satan, and that the spirit which actuates Jehovah is love, a desire to bless, and that the spirit which actuates Satan is selfishness, self first, the very opposite of love. Satan loves to deceive the people into selfish motives and purposes, because he realizes that it will spoil them for Jehovah’s purposes and unfit them for Jehovah’s work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Another way in which Satan has deceived the people into a course of extreme selfishness, and which very few realize to be selfish, is by leading them to believe that they can spend their lives in self-gratification, in folly, in pleasure or in sin, and neglect Bible study and prayer,-and also neglect to confess their sins and ask for forgiveness daily, and then, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">on </span><span class="font4">their death-bed and with their last breath, call upon God for pardon, and expect him to give them the highest reward he has to give to any of his creatures, even the same reward that he has promised to those who are faithful even unto death. Persons who do this are selfish in the highest degree. They consider only themselves in this life, and then, when they come to die, they continue to think only of themselves and expect God to give them that which they do not deserve and to which they are not entitled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Satan is the author of this and all other forms of selfishness, and this appeal to self and self-gratification is the strongest appeal that he can set before any of God’s creatures. It is the most subtle temptation of the adversary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Let us notice some Bible illustrations of extreme selfishness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">God created a wise and beautiful creature called Lucifer, and placed him in Eden as a guardian and protector to father Adam and mother Eve. He was given great power and authority, and wisdom. Realizing his power and authority, and seeing the wonderful dominion of the heavenly Father, he became ambitious to have a similar dominion. In other words, he became selfish. To accomplish his purpose it was necessary to win the allegiance of Adam and Eve away from God and to get them to serve him. That was the first manifestation of selfishness, and the record of it is found in Isaiah 14:12-14 and Ezekiel 28:13-16. Lucifer succeeded in his wicked designs, and then and there his name was changed to Satan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Satan tempted mother Eve along the same line of selfishness. God had forbidden Adam and Eve to eat a certain fruit, on pain of death. Satan persuaded Eve to think that God was'selfish in forbidding her to eat this fruit; and the record, as found in Genesis 3:6, is as follows: “And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof and did eat. ’ ’ Her selfishness consisted in self-gratification. She desired to be wise and to have something good to eat, and something that looked pleasant and desirable. She gave no thought to God or the fact that he was her Creator and benefactor. This is the second example of selfishness given to us in the Scriptures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Another example of extreme selfishness is given, in connection with Adam. His selfishness consisted in loving his wife more than he loved his Creator and benefactor. God had forbidden him to eat the fruit, and the record is that “Adam was not deceived”. (1 Tim. 2:14) He knew the consequences of his act; he knew that he was sinning; but he selfishly desired to please his wife, and neglected to honor and please Jehovah God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">These three acts of selfishness, Lucifer’s, Eve’s and Adam’s, are responsible for all the sin and evil, disease and death, in the earth today.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Selfishness never pays; it never brings blessings, but always results in injury and evil. Selfishness, however, pretends to offer blessings; but, when indulged, it is invariably found that the seeming blessing is in reality a curse.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In sharp contrast with this Satanic spirit of selfishness, let us now examine the loving spirit of unselfishness manifested by Jehovah God. Properly, our first question is, Who is Jehovah God? According to the Scriptures he is a spirit being having the divine nature, without beginning, and therefore not a created being; he is described as being all-wise, just, loving, and all-powerful; he is declared to be the creator of all things in heaven and in earth, and we are told that all “his work is perfect”; he is the author of a code of laws which are laid down in the Bible and which are declared to be absolutely just; we are told that nothing but good and perfect gifts ever come from his hand; he created Adam and Eve and placed them in Eden on trial for life; they violated his just law, and he sentenced them to death and drove them out of Eden and left them alone to die.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">God permitted Adam and Eve to eke out an existence for several centuries, during which their posterity was born; but finally, being unable to stave off the death penalty longer, they both died. God has permitted their descendants to live, some longer and some shorter periods of time, and to bring forth other descendants, who likewise eventually died. For more than six thousand years he has permitted sin and death, with its wars, crimes, pestilences and famines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">God claims to be the author of the book called the Bible. In it is a record of the creation of Adam and Eve, of their sin and their condemnation, and of the awful consequences of that condemnation. In this same Book, and written by the hand of the same prophets, is an oft-repeated promise of a full and complete recovery of Adam and his children from the effects of the condemnation which Adam brought upon himself; a promise of a time when the whole earth shall be like the garden of Eden, when the desert shall blossom as the rose, and when every man shall sit under his own vine and fig tree, with nothing to molest or make afraid; a promise that all who are in their graves shall come forth from the tomb and enjoy life, liberty and happiness on the earth for ever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The question now arises, Has not God been selfish in permitting Satan to live and evil to exist for six thousand years? The majority of people, and even those who profess to love and serve Jehovah God, think that God was unjust in permitting these conditions to exist, or else they think that he lacked wisdom or misused his power. Such people are prone to criticize and condemn Jehovah for what they think is a great injustice. They voice their criticism and condemnation in these words, saying, ‘If I were God, I would not permit evil, and I would kill the Devil at once.’ People who thus criticize and condemn Jehovah are lacking in reverence and modesty, and have an oversupply of self-esteem.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is selfishness that leads people to thus criticize the heavenly Father. They desire ease and comfort for themselves. They desire to be free from pain, from poverty and the necessity for work, and are too lazy, or else too conceited, to inquire into the reason why God permits evil and why he permits the Devil to exist.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Their selfishness leads them to jump to the conclusion that God is selfish, wicked and unjust. A peculiarity of a selfish man is that he is biased, prejudiced and unreasoning. He can see only one thing, namely, the gratification of his own selfish desires.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Now let us ask, Why did God permit evil?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">According to the Scriptures, God created this earth that it might be peopled with a happy, contented and sinless race of human beings, men and women. He arranged that their every need should be supplied, and that they should enjoy life, liberty, peace and happiness for ever. Many texts prove this statement. In Ecclesiastes 1:4 we read: ‘ ‘ The earth abideth for ever. ’ ’ In Isaiah 60: 21 we read: ‘ The righteous shall inherit the land and dwell therein for ever. ’ In Psalm 115:16 we read: “The earth hath he given to the children of men ’ ’; and when God created Adam he told him to ‘multiply and increase and fill the earth’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">According to God’s plan, nobody could have the blessings of life, liberty and happiness, until he had first been tested, proven and found worthy of the same. This feature of his plan is in entire harmony with wisdom, justice, love and power. No unselfish person can object to it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Hence, we find, according to the Scriptures, that God created Adam and Eve, gave them a beautiful paradise home, supplied every need, and placed them on trial for life, setting before them life on condition of obedience, and death on condition of disobedience. No unselfish person can object to this course. Let us bear in mind, though, that the penalty for disobedience was death; that is, they were to return to the dust, as they were before they were created. There was no promise made to Adam that he would go to heaven if he obeyed, or to eternal torment if he disobeyed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Thus seen, we see also that God had made his plan in the alternative; that is, should Adam not sin, God would follow a certain course; but should he sin, God would pursue a different course. Adam did sin, and God sentenced him to death and drove him out of the beautiful Eden home and left him alone to die. Deserted by Jehovah God, Adam became a subject of Satan, and became filled with the spirit of Satan, which is selfishness. His posterity inherited this selfishness, and we can see it in even the best people of earth today.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">After Adam had sinned and proven himself unworthy of life, and had been sentenced to death, what was then God’s plan respecting him? The Bible answer is that God planned to bind the Devil for a thousand years and to deliver Adam and all hia posterity from death by resurrecting them, and then to give to every member of the race an accurate understanding of his glorious plans and purposes, and place them (and Adam again) on trial for life, just as Adam had been on trial for life. This trial or test of their faithfulness would be more advantageous than Adam’s first trial, because each member of the race would have something that Adam did not have, namely, an experience with sin, sickness, selfishness and the Devil, which would be helpful in the matter of deciding whether they would choose life or death. God wanted an earth full of free moral agents, that is, a race of men and women who would voluntarily choose that which is right because they loved righteousness and hated iniquity. His plan was that those who, after having been given a fair trial, with an accurate knowledge of the truth and every help necessary, would yet love iniquity, should die the second death, that is, die the second time. This class will go into everlasting destruction, from which there is to be no resurrection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Surely there is no selfishness in this feature of God’s plan. In permitting evil he was considering the eternal welfare and happiness of the race. No just and honest man can object to this. An innately selfish man might object to going into second death, because he would want to live for ever to gratify his selfish propensities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">But, we ask, why has God taken so many centuries to work out his plan ? Why did he permit evil during all these centuries?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There are at least two reasons for allowing so many centuries for the completion of his plan. First, it would require all these centuries for enough people to be born to fill the earth. Jesus himself tells us that when the resurrection begins, “they neither marry nor are given in marriage”; hence we can see that births must and will cease as soon as enough people have been born to fill the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Another reason for this long period of time is that when Adam sinned his posterity became extremely selfish. It is written that ‘God is not in all their thoughts’. Realizing this selfishness, Jehovah thought it wise to let them try out their own selfish plans and schemes, that they might learn some lessons thereby. The one great lesson which all men must learn is that there is no help in man-made schemes; that no blessing can come from them. The majority of the race have not yet learned this lesson, but are still urging different man-made schemes of government, different man-made forms of religion, and urging every form of blue-law and sumptuary law that men can devise, hoping thereby to lessen the evil that is in the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There is only one way to remove sin and evil, and that way is the Lord’s way. The Lord is well aware of this fact, but the race has not yet learned it. They still t</span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:line-through;">hink</span><span class="font4"> that they can legislate righteousness into people; and God is letting them try to do it, in order to convince them of their folly. It would seem that six thousand years of failure would convince them; but they are not yet convinced.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We must get the thought that God is not the author of evil. Evil results from the fact that men do things in their own way and not in God’s way. The time is soon to come when God will again take a hand in the affairs of men. He will bind Satan for a thousand years, and write his own law upon men’s hearts and rule with a rod of iron, which means that he will compel obedience to his laws. Under this compulsion men will get blessings until they shall learn that obedience leads to life, and that it was their disobedience which caused all the sin and suffering on the earth. Why do men disobey ? The answer is, Because they are selfish and want their own way. Why does God permit evil? The answer is, Because he is unselfish. Sin is repugnant to Jehovah God, but he has unselfishly endured it for six thousand years because he could overrule it for man’s good, because he could teach certain lessons by it. In Romans 9:22 we read Paul’s words: “What if God, willing to shew his wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much longsuffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In Psalm 76:10 we are told that God will make the wrath of men to praise him. How will he do this? The answer is that he will so overrule evil that it will be a blessing, by making it a means of teaching men valuable and helpful lessons. Their experiences along the line of having their own way and along the line of selfishness will finally convince them that God’s way is best and right, always. Then, too, their remembrance of all these experiences throughout all eternity will help them to keep from sin in the ages to come.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Thus, God will demonstrate his wisdom, justice, love and power. He will prove that he was always right, that he has always been unselfish. He will show those people who have censured and criticized him in the past, that their wisdom was what the Bible calls “the wisdom of this world” which is “foolishness with God”, and that they were wise in their own conceit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">God was unselfish when he sent his only begotten Son into the world to die for sinners. Think of a father’s denying himself the fellowship and companionship of an only and beloved son for a period of thirty-three and a half years, and permitting men to hate and smite and finally kill that son by nailing him to a cross! Think also of the unselfishness that Jesus manifested toward the race in willingly becoming the Lamb of God who would take away the sin of the world by dying for the race!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When God has bound the Devil for a thousand years, and has brought forth from the tomb all that are in the graves and has written his law on their hearts and engraved it on their minds until all shall know him from the least of them unto the greatest of them, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">then</span><span class="font4"> men will be ashamed that they criticized him and found fault with his plans and purposes. They will be ashamed also of all their past efforts to bring blessings to the race by using their own schemes and ignoring God’s way. They will then learn that leagues of nations were man-made schemes formed for the selfish purpose of oppressing and exploiting weaker nations; that federations of churches were likewise man-made schemes for the selfish purpose of controlling the liberties of other people, and that all prohibition laws were also the products of selfishness whereby one class of people attempted to control others. No good ever resulted from selfishness ; and this accounts for the failure of the League of Nations, Federation of Churches, and all prohibition laws.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah God never authorized a League of Nations, for the reason that he did not organize any of the nations. God made the entire human family of one blood and intended them to live as </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">one</span><span class="font4"> family, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">one </span><span class="font4">nation. Satan, using the selfish ambitions of men, split up the people into nations; and the Scriptures tell us that Satan’s nations shall be dashed in pieces as a potter’s vessel, and that eventually there will be one government under the whole heaven.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">God never authorized the Federation of Churches, because he recognizes only </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">one</span><span class="font4"> church; and he tells us that the list of membership is not kept on earth, but that their names are written in heaven. The multiplicity of churches, with their jargons of creeds, was foisted upon the world by Satan, who used ambitious and selfish men to accomplish this purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">God never authorized a prohibition or any other sumptuary law to control the consciences or actions of others. Leagues of nations, federations of churches, and prohibition laws are instruments of force, of compulsion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah is all-powerful and yet </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">never uses force. </span><span class="font4">He will reign in the hearts of men. He wants only those to serve him who serve him in spirit and in truth. The time is coming when every knee will bow and every tongue confess to Jehovah God. When that time arrives there will be no League of Nations, no church federations nor prohibition laws. Men will delight to do God’s will, and force will be unnecessary. In Matthew 5:39 we read that Jesus said, “I say unto you, That ye </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">resist not evil”;</span><span class="font4"> but the politicians, financiers and clergymen think this statement by Jesus is foolish, and so continue to use various forms of force, and their every effort has been, is, and will continue to be crowned with failure, because their motives and efforts are along selfish lines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">On the contrary, Jehovah God, who, if he chose, could force the people to do his will, has not done so. He has permitted mankind to follow their selfish ways and schemes without interfering. He has had the best interests of mankind at heart, and knew that the only way that the race would ever learn the lesson that God’s ways and plans are best would be by letting man try out all his own ways and plans. God knew their plans would fail because of their being selfish.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">For six thousand years Jehovah has grieved and suffered as he witnessed the folly of his creatures; but he endured it all for their sakes, that they might learn the needed lessons. He was thinking of their best interests, their eternal future welfare; and so he has endured with much long-suffering, patience and forbearance, all the sin and evil, all the folly and calamity, wars, etc., which man by his own disobedience has brought upon himself. What an example of self-restraint, of absolute unselfishness, is thus manifested by Jehovah God!</span></p>

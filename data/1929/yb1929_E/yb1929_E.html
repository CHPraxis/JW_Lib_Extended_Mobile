It may serve as a testimony to the name </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font6">Jehovah God, and bring aid and comfort to the people. All organizations of the world are selfish. By that is meant that each organization looks for some benefit to itself from others. The International Bible Students Association is not an organization of this world. Jehovah God has an organization to carry out his plan. This Association or Society, by the grace of the Lord, is a part of God’s organization because unselfishly devoted to and serving him. It claims no power of its own. Its help and authority come from the Lord. It desires no help from any one or any thing that is against Jehovah God. During the year past, and prior thereto, it has been faithfully endeavoring to magnify the name of Jehovah. It is engaged in advertising his King and kingdom, well knowing that the kingdom of God is the only means for the blessing of the oppressed millions of people on earth.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark1"></a><span class="font6">The Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society is a corporation created and organized under the laws of the State of Pennsylvania for the purpose of carrying on an educational work amongst the people. It is devoted to giving instruction in the Bible. It was originally organized in 1884. Its official residence is Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Since 1909 it has main-</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">i </span><span class="font6">tained its main operating office at 124 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn, Neiv York.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Peoples Pulpit Association is a membership corporation organized and created under the laws of the State of New York. Its purposes are identical with that of the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, and its organization is for the purpose of aiding in carrying on the work for which the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society was organized. It was organized in the year 1909 and maintains its official residence at 124 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn, New York.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The International Bible Students Association is a corporation created and organized under the laws of England, with its official residence at 34 Craven Terrace, London, England. It is also an associate organization of the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, organized to carry on more efficiently the educational work concerning the Bible. It maintains its main operating office at 124 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn, New York.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">These three corporations have the same president. The other officers are practically the same. They all work in conjunction with each other, and the three separate corporations are maintained for convenience.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">These corporations are not business concerns. They are not organized to make money, nor to engage in making money. They are non-stock corporations and no one receives a pecuniary profit therefrom. They are created solely to meet the legal requirements of the countries wherein they serve and to hold together the property necessary to carry on a benevolent work in an orderly way. The primary purpose of the organization is to aid the people in obtaining a better understanding of God’s purpose and the means to be employed to bring them the promised blessings of life, liberty and happiness. These corporations are Charitable organizations within the proper meaning of that term. A charitable organization is one that puts forth an unselfish effort to aid others, without the desire or hope for pecuniary profit. The organization is benevolent in that it seeks to benefit the mind of the individual and to aid the people in a better course of living. It is a public benefit in that it enables the creature to see his obligation to the Creator and to his fellow men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">All the consecrated Christians that go to make up the members of the Society are preachers of the Word of God. They are ordained ministers. The ordination of each one is that provided and set forth in the commission which Jehovah God grants to all who are in Christ Jesus, to wit: “The spirit of the Lord God is upon me; because the Lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek: he hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound; to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord, and the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all that mourn.’’ (Isa. 61:1, 2) Supplementary thereto a number of men in each ecclesia or congregation are ordained by the congregation by electing them and appointing them to office as servants in the congregation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The methods employed by the organization for preaching the gospel are, to wit: The holding of publie meetings which are addressed by speakers; the use of the radio for the broadcasting of the gospel of the Lord’s kingdom; and by any and all of those who are consecrated to the Lord calling at the homes of the people and there exhibiting to the inmates or the dwellers in such homes the gospel sermons in printed form, and giving them an opportunity to avail themselves of books or booklets containing such printed sermons. The work of preaching the gospel in all of the above-mentioned manners is not followed as a vocation by any for a living or a pecuniary profit. Those who go from door to door and preach the gospel by carrying to the people the printed books and booklets, take a nominal sum of money for such sermons published in book or booklet form and use the same to defray expenses incident thereto. This work is done entirely unselfishly and in the interests of the people and to the glory of God, and is therefore charitable and benevolent. Those thus engaging in preaching the gospel do so on each and every day as opportunity affords, including Sunday. To earn their livelihood they engage in some secular employment during certain hours of the day, and then, out of love for the Lord and for his truth, they preach the gospel in the manner above stated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The term “International Bible Students” is a generic one which applies to all the consecrated and anointed Christians throughout the earth who work together harmoniously in the proclamation of the message of God’s plan. In many towns and cities in various nations there are classes or ecclesias; that is to say, men and women who assemble themselves together in an orderly way for Bible study and to work together systematically for the spreading of the message of God’s kingdom on earth. These various organizations or classes recognize the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society and its associate corporations as instruments for the carrying on of the Lord’s work amongst his people on earth. The official paper or journal of the organization is </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower, </span><span class="font6">published twice each month at Brooklyn, New York It contains usually a leading article discussing some important Bible question. This publication is used regularly as a text for Berean study by the many classes of International Bible Students. It also contains lectures or brief discussions of Bible questions suitable for broadcasting or otherwise for use at public meetings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The term “the Society’’ is used as a general term to represent all the consecrated and anointed Christians on earth who are harmoniously working together in the promulgation of God’s message to the peoples of earth. The above corporations are not the Society, but said corporations are the servants of the Society. Those associated therewith believe that the Lord is using the Society, composed of his anointed people, as his witnesses on earth concerning Jehovah God and his plan for the salvation of the human race.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The corporate organizations diligently seek to cooperate with consecrated Christians in performing the work above mentioned. The International Bible Students Association has no membership rolL Members are not sought, but all are welcome to meet together who believe the great truths taught by the Scriptures and who honestly and earnestly engage in the Lord’s service.</span></p><a name="caption1"></a>
<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>TEACHINGS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">As an evidence that the Society is strictly adhering to proclaiming the message of God’s Word as taught by Jesus, the holy prophets, and the apostles, there is set forth herein an epitome of the truths so taught, to wit:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">That Jehovah is the only true God; that his name has been pushed aside by so-called Christians for many centuries; that the Devil has blinded even Christians to the truth concerning him; that the world is totally blind; that the time has now come for God to make for himself a name in the earth and he commands his people, as his witnesses, to proclaim his truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">That the Bible is the inspired Word of God, and that it contains a statement of the divine plan for man’s salvation and blessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">That the great fundamental truths prominently set forth in the Bible are these: Adam, the first man, was created perfect in organism and endowed with the faculties of wisdom, justice, love and power; that he wilfully violated God’s law in order to join his wife Eve in the transgression which Satan had induced her to commit; that the Lord God justly sentenced him to death and expelled him from Eden; that all of his children were begotten and born thereafter, and that hence they were begotten in sin and brought forth in iniquity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">That God made promise that through the seed of Abraham he would bless all the families of the earth, </span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">an</span><span class="font6">d that in due time he would redeem man from death and ransom him from the power of the grave; that he would raise up a mighty ruler unto whom the people shall be gathered; that in due time he sent to earth his beloved Son, who died upon the cross, whom God raised up from the dead and who by his death and resurrection provided the great redemptive price for mankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">That since the death and resurrection of our Lord, beginning with Pentecost, the Lord has been selecting the members of the body of Christ; and that these, Jesus the Head, and his body members, constitute the 'seed of promise’ according to the promise which God made to Abraham.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">That Christ Jesus taught his followers to pray for the coming of God’s kingdom that God’s will might be done on earth as in heaven, and promised that he would return in due time and set up his kingdom; that the great hope of the church from Pentecost forward has been the second coming of the Lord, the completion of the church and the inauguration of God’s kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">That God’s provision for one’s becoming a member of the church, which is the body of Christ, is this, to wit: Belief in Christ Jesus as the great Redeemer of mankind; a full consecration to do God’s holy will; justification of the one consecrating, which justification is obtained by the act of Jehovah in justifying or determining that one is right with him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">That justification by faith during the Christian era is for just one purpose, which is that the one justified may be a part of the sacrifice of the Lord, and hence such has made a covenant with the Lord by sacrifice; that then God begets such an one by his spirit to the divine nature and inducts him into the body of Christ and anoints him; that thereafter such Christian must perform his part of the covenant faithfully unto death, and that thus doing he will receive full membership in the body of Christ and an abundant entrance into the heavenly kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">That when Jesus was on earth his disciples propounded to him the question as to what would be the proof of his presence and the end of the world; that his answer was couched in prophetic phrase; that he gave a statement of conditions that would exist at the time of the end of the age and the setting up of his kingdom, to wit, the World War, famines, pestilences, revolutions, return of the Jews to Palestine, the persecution of Christians, and then a period in which the gospel of the kingdom must be proclaimed to all the nations as a witness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">That the proof shows that the Gentile Times ended in 1914; that there God, according to his promise, set his anointed King, Christ Jesus, upon his throne (Ps. 2:6); that there followed a great conflict in heaven between Christ on one side and Satan on the other, in which Satan was cast out of heaven; that since then the Lord has come to his temple and is now strengthening his people for the final experiences on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">That God in his Word has declared his purpose to overthrow Satan’s wicked organization and to thereby release the peoples of earth from great oppression; and that he will accomplish this by a demonstration of his power and in a time of such trouble as the world has never known, and that this demonstration of power will convince all creation that Jehovah is the Almighty God; that then the authority of unrighteous men in the earth will cease and God will establish the world in righteousness, which righteous government shall be upon the shoulder of his beloved Son and will endure to the eternal blessing of mankind.—Ps. 96: 10; Isa. 9: 6,7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">That the reign of Christ will be for the purpose of granting to every one of the human race, both dead and living, an opportunity for life, and that to this end all those who have died in ignorance of God shall be awakened and given a knowledge of the truth; that the church alone participates in the first resurrection; that all the families of the earth shall have an opportunity to know the Lord and to obey him, and that those obeying shall be granted the blessings of life everlasting in peace and happiness upon the earth for ever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Bible Students believe that the only reason for their being on earth at this time, and the only excuse for the existence of their organization, is that they might be witnesses that Jehovah is God and that his kingdom is at hand; that the Devil has for so long a time blinded the people to God’s truth and that now the time has come for God to make for himself a name; that God will have his people bear testimony of him to the world, and then will follow the great conflict which shall mark the final end of earth’s wicked organizations; and that such trouble is not a fight in which the Christian shall participate, but is a fight of God Almighty against the Devil’s organization ; and that the part to be performed by the Christians on earth is to faithfully represent the Lord by telling others of God’s purposes, and thereby to show forth his praises. The Bible Students are earnestly attempting to do this part.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The International Bible Students Association has no membership roll and is not seeking membership. All who believe in the truths taught by Jesus and the apostles, and who now believe in the presence of the Lord and that the time has come for him to set up Ins kingdom, and who desire to participate and, to the best of their ability and opportunity do participate in giving the witness to the name of Jehovah, are counted in as members of the Association or Society. All such, in obedience to the admonition of the Apostle Paul, are standing shoulder to shoulder, fighting for the gospel of Jesus Christ and never quailing before the enemy. These have entered into the joy of the Lord, namely, seeing that the time has come for the establishment of the kingdom and the vindication of Jehovah’s name, it gives them great joy and delight to tell this good news to others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Bible Students, in the performance of what they understand to be their covenant and in diligently trying to be witnesses for Jehovah, are now doing their part to hold up the standard of the Lord to the people, to remove the false doctrines that have stumbled the people and to point the people to God’s great way of returning to him, and are thereby bringing consolation to all those who desire to be free. Believing that the time has come when a witness must be given to the kings and rulers of the earth, as well as to the peoples, they are earnestly putting forth their best efforts, gladly spending what little money they have and also their time and energy in spreading amongst mankind the good news that Jehovah is God, that Christ Jesus is the King, that God has set him upon his throne and that he bids all the peoples of earth to give heed to his message and to render obedience to his rule.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It was centuries ago that God promised Abraham that in his seed all the families of the earth shall be blessed. As surely as God has placed the sun in the heavens to give light to the earth, just so surely is his promise of blessing the people to be carried out. That time of blessing is now about to begin. He will have all the people brought to a knowledge of the truth, that they may avail themselves of the promised blessing. His consecrated and anointed ones making up the Bible Students organization count it their greatest privilege to represent Jehovah as his witnesses and to carry his gracious message of deliverance to the people, well knowing that all who hear and obey the Most High shall live for ever.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>MINUTES OF MEETING</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">Pursuant to a notice duly given as provided by law and by the by-laws of the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, the corporation convened in annual meeting at ten o’clock Wednesday, October 31, 1928, at Carnegie Hall, county of Allegheny and city of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The meeting was called to order by the president and was opened with prayer. It was unanimously agreed that the reading of the minutes for the previous meeting would not be required but that they stand approved as made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The first order of business was the submission of the report by the president. The report being very lengthy, the president submitted a resume thereof with the understanding that the report be printed in book form and circulated amongst all who may desire a copy. The report was gratifying to all who were present, and many words of commendation and thankfulness to the Lord were spoken by those who had heard.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The treasurer also made his report, which was received and approved.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Those attending the annual meeting were specially impressed with the blessings the Lord has bestowed upon our brethren in foreign countries, who have been giving the witness under adverse conditions. As an expression of appreciation and loving-kindness toward the brethren in foreign lands the following resolution was offered, supported by a number of brethren, and, when put to a vote, was unanimously adopted, to wit:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The shareholders of the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, assembled in annual meeting of the corporation at Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, U. S. A., this 31st day of October, 1928, desiring to express their love and appreciation of the cooperation of the brethren in foreign countries, do adopt the following resolution, to wit:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We send greetings and Christian love to our brethren throughout the earth. Our hearts are thrilled at the evidences of loving zeal in the service of the Lord and of the work accomplished by our brethren, especially in foreign lands, who under great opposition are exalting the name of Jehovah God and lifting up a standard for the people. The annual report as submitted by our president, Brother J. F. Rutherford, is gratifying beyond expression and is another evidence of the directing hand of Jehovah, through his chief executive our Lord Jesus Christ, and of the fact that his message of comfort and deliverance is reaching the people. To him we render our thanks and praise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Further, that our prayers rise to the Lord for the continuance of his grace and favor throughout the coming year, to the end that an even wider witness may be given.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Further, that we appreciate our heavenly Father’s guidance of the affairs of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society, and of his provision for his people’s needs through </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower</span><span class="font6"> and associated publications.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Further, that a copy of this resolution be sent to our brethren in foreign lands, also that it be embodied in the Annual Report for the year now concluding.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There being no further business before the annual meeting, it adjourned.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>president’s report</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">To the Lord’s Watchmen:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Because as president of the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society it is my privilege and pleasure to make report to God’s people, I bring to you a brief statement of the work done by the Society during the year now closing. You will understand that our fiscal year ends the last day of September. The annual report is made on October 31.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There is a reason why this work is going on in the earth, and there is a reason why we are engaged in it. It is well to call one another’s attention from time to time to these reasons. Before the beginning God knew the end. This he shows by his prophetic Word, and from time to time reveals the meaning thereof for the encouragement of those who have been and are objects of his loving-kindness.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>HIS WATCHMEN</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah caused his prophet to say: “Thy watchmen shall lift up the voice; with the voice together shall they sing; for they shall see eye to eye, when the Lord shall bring again Zion.’’ (Isa. 52:8) God’s anointed ones on the earth are aware of the great truth that the Lord has come to his temple. The temple class is made up of the anointed ones of God, and such are in his dwelling. (2 Cor. 6:16) In God’s due time Chnst Jesus comes and takes account with his stewards to whom he had committed his kingdom interests. Some he found had proven themselves slothful and unfaithful servants. Others had proven faithful, and to the latter the Lord said: “Well done, thou good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.” (Matt, 25:21) The faithful ones thus approved of the Lord are the ones constituting his watchmen. To such all his goods or kingdom interests from that time forward are committed, and hence that class becomes the “faithful and wise servant”.—Matt. 24:45-47.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">By the mouth of his prophet God gave another picture for the encouragement of his approved opes. The robe of righteousness is the symbol of approval by Jehovah. The robe is furnished by Jehovah, and the Bridegroom brings the approved ones under that robe. All judgment is committed to him, and he aets as the great representative of Jehovah in this capacity. There is therefore a close and sweet relationship formed between Christ and the faithful ones on earth. The faithful, being received into this condition and approved, arc the feet members of Christ, because they are the last ones on earth. These are the ones that make up the ‘wise virgin’ class. Seeing their position of favor they rejoice with great joy.—Isa. 52:7-, 61:10; Matt. 25:1-10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Still another beautiful picture is given by the Lord God for the comfort and encouragement of his people. He caused his prophet to write: “He that dwelleth in the secret place of the Most High, shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty.” (Ps. 91:1) Those who enjoy this blessed privilege respond: “I Will say of the Lord, He is my refuge and my fortress: my God j in him will I trust.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This prophecy tells the anointed ones that they are in the place of security and have complete protection from the Almighty God as long as they remain there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Watchmen are those whom the Lord has put on watch to give attention to his interests. The watchman is not one man, but is made up of a company of creatures wholly devoted to the Lord. None of these creatures are perfect in themselves, but their love for the Lord and faithfulness to him are pleasing to Jehovah, and these approved ones are the recipients of his precious promises. (Ps. 31:23) Surely the Lord would put no one on watch to give attention to his interests unless that one had shown his love and devotion to God. Just as surely no one will remain on watch unless he continues to manifest his love and faithfulness to the Lord. Love for God means keeping his commandments. No one can be faithful to the Lord unless he loves the Lord. Love must be the propelling motive, the moving cause of the action of the servant. Love means unselfish devotion of one’s every faculty to the Lord. The love of the anointed for God is proven by his joyful devotion to God, and, particularly in the day of judgment, is shown by faithfully keeping God’s commandments. (1 John 4:17, 18, 5:3) No one can possibly abide in God’s love unless he is diligent in keeping God’s commandments. This is conclusively proven by the words of Jesus: “If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father’s commandments, and abide in his love. These things have I spoken unto you, that my joy might remain in you, and that your joy might be full.”—John 15:10,11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The foregoing scriptures emphasize the fact, which is now clearly seen, that there must be at the same time a class faithful to the Lord and also a class claiming to be God’s children but who are less faithful. Those who are less faithful have received and held the truth because they have wanted the best for themselves. The members of the faithful class hold the truth in the love of the truth because they delight to show forth the praises of Jehovah God, who has favored them with his great light. It is therefore clearly shown by the Scriptures that the watchmen are made up of those who are faithful and true to the Lord. To remain a member of the watchman class means that one must continue faithful and true to the Lord.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>identification</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">It is possible for the anointed to learn who is and who is not of the watchman class. The prophecy says: ‘ ‘ Thy watchmen shall Eft up the voice; with the voice together shall they sing.” The voice is a symbol of a message. The prophecy, therefore, must mean that the watchmen have a message to be delivered and that the message is one of joy to their hearts. They do have a message to deliver. That great message is that Jehovah is God; that Christ is earth’s rightful governor; that God has placed his governor upon his holy throne; that the final conflict with Satan is about to be fought; that such conflict will result in complete victory for the Lord, and that God’s name will be vindicated and the people of earth delivered. What a marvelous message to commit to men for delivery ! Could any one know and appreciate this message without being thrilled with joy? All the watchmen having the same message and all being moved by the same spirit, of necessity they sing together the praises of Jehovah. (Isa. 12: 4-6) Such is God’s commandment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Then the prophet of God says: “The watchmen . . . shall see eye to eye. ’ ’ They see that the Lord is in his temple: that Jehovah is the source of light and truth and that “his lightnings” from time to time flash forth disclosing to the temple class his purposes toward his anointed. They see by the light of God’s truth that he has a work which the temple class must do. All members of the temple class, looking to the Lord God, and therefore looking in the same direction, see the truths exactly in the same way and are in exact harmony with the work that God has for them to do. They break forth in song; they walk shoulder to shoulder; they work as one well-organized body. There is no sound known to man so harmonious and beautiful as the human voice. The illustration here is an apt one. His watchmen, on the earth, and therefore in the flesh, unitedly and harmoniously engage in the same thing and always with the same purpose in view. Their course of action is harmonious, sweet and beautiful because their sole purpose is to glorify God by keeping his commandments. This is another proof that the Society is composed of those faithful anointed ones scattered throughout the earth but united in action and harmoniously engaged in watching over the kingdom interests. Those who continue faithful in thus performing their duty and obligations will continue to be of the watchman class, and in God’s due time will enter into the fulness of j°y-</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The reader may examine this report of the activities of the Society during the year just passed and then determine for himself whether or not this is the Lord’s work on the earth at this time. If he comes to the conclusion that it is the Lord’s work, then it means that the Lord has something that he might do to be in line for the blessings which God through Christ will shortly bestow upon the obedient ones.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>HEADQUARTERS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">The headquarters of the Society is at 124 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn, New York, U. S. A. The three corporations that operate together to carry on the work of the Society throughout the earth are, to wit, the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, the Peoples Pulpit Association, and the International Bible Students Association. The executive offices of each corporation are at the above address; also the office of secretary and treasurer is there. The Society has more than thirty sub-offices in different parts of the earth. Each one of such sub-offices has a local manager appointed by the president. The president is the general manager of the entire organization, and the management is conducted from the Brooklyn headquarters. Every month each manager submits to the president a detailed report to be examined and cheeked, so that every detail of the work may be properly in hand and the cost of production and maintenance and the general conduct of the work may be intelligently known and directed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At the same address is the Bethel home, which now consists of a building of approximately 120 rooms with modern conveniences, making it a suitable place to house those who work in the Lord’s service. The home is not elaborately furnished, of course, but it is pleasing and comfortable. Approximately 180 persons are in the house of the Bethel home. Most of these are young men. The purpose is to maintain a good working force. Two persons occupy each room. Each room is fitted with two single beds so that each one may have a bed to himself. It is also fitted with tables and lights for private study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There is a general assembly room, where the brethren may congregate for music or conversation. There is a library, where quiet study may be had by those who wish to be there in the evening. There are music rooms used for instruction and practice both in vocal and in instrumental music preparatory for the radio programs. These rooms are used daily for the purposes mentioned. Other rooms are fitted with typewriters for use by the brethren in preparing their discourses for radiocasting and for other occasions of speaking.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Bethel home has a house manager, whose office is on the first floor below the entrance. He looks after the affairs of the home generally and in detail. Each person entering the home reports to the manager or to his assistant and is required to register. The purpose of registering is to enable the management to know who is in the house and to what room assigned and why he is there. This is necessary with reference to guests as well as to those who occupy rooms permanently. The work of the manager’s office includes the buying of the food, preparing of the meals, serving the meals, the cleaning of the house, and generally looking after the work that goes on there. There is a well-organized force of assistants working under his direction. Each one, being devoted to the Lord, does his or her part with gladness of heart.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>DAILY ROUTINE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">Of necessity the Bethel home must be conducted in an orderly way. No other way would be pleasing to the Lord. To this end, rules are had for the government of the home. A printed copy of the rules is placed in the hands of each one who enters the home for service. He is requested to study these rules and abide by them. At 6 : 30 o’clock in the morning the rising signal is sounded. Every one is expected to arise immediately, take a bath and prepare for the day. At 7 a.m. the breakfast signal is sounded and the entire family assembles in the dining-room. The morning devotion is led by the president when present. When he is absent, some one else is designated to fill this place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Morning devotion consists of singing a song previously selected for the day. Then prayer is offered by the one leading or by some one whom he requests. After this the blessing upon the food is asked by some member of the family. Following that, the breakfast meal is served; and during the service the Bible text </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">ior</span><span class="font6"> the day is read and is freely discussed by the members of the family, particularly those who are elders in the ecclesia. At the conclusion of the discussion and the reading of the comment contained in the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Year Book,</span><span class="font6"> the president sums up in a brief statement especially appropriate to the daily text. The family then stands while being dismissed with prayer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At eight o’clock in the morning all members of the family are expected to be diligently performing their respective duties. Some operate the laundry, others mend shoes or press clothes, others prepare the food, others cook it, others wash the dishes, and give attention to the dining-room, while still another company cares for the house. Each one performs-his service faithfully as assigned, doing it always as unto the Lord because he is doing service that is necessary to carry on the Lord’s work. All who are admitted to the home and assigned to service first file a questionnaire declaring that they are fully consecrated to the Lord and in full harmony with the work that the Society is doing. The purpose is to have the members of the family in full harmony and working with one object in view, namely, that of proclaiming the gospel of God’s kingdom. It is readily to be seen that no one is expected to remain at the home unless he performs service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At noon an hour is given for the serving of the food and the discussion of Bible questions. Any one of the family or any one visiting the family may propound a Bible question. The one presiding calls Upon various brethren to give their expression on the question and then there is a free and open discussion of the question by any one who may desire to participate therein. At the conclusion the one leading sums up the question by covering the points that have been previously brought forth. A similar course is followed at the evening meal. In fact, at the time of serving each meal in the dining-room there is also a time and occasion for the study of the Bible and the time is so occupied.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In addition thereto, all members of the household have time for personal and private Bible study in their respective rooms; so, in fact, every room in the house is devoted to the Lord’s work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Regular Berean Bible study classes are conducted in the home almost every evening. On Monday evening there is a study of some leading article in </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower.</span><span class="font6"> The attendance at this meeting is limited to members of the family. This meeting is usually led by the president of the Society. Those Living outside of the home and who are members of the congregation may attend other study meetings and also the praise, prayer and testimony meetings, but the Monday meeting is exclusively for the f</span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">ami</span><span class="font6">ly, that the family may have a special opportunity to discuss important questions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Appointments are made regularly for either members of the family or those outside who desire to consult the president on personal matters. These appointments are always made through his secretary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">From early morning until 10:30 o ’clock at night, the Bethel home is a busy place. At 10:15 the signal is dashed, which is a warning to prepare for retiring, and eveiy one is expected to retire quickly and extinguish the lights, that the proper rest may be had preparatory for the next day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The printing and manufacturing work is done at 117 Adams Street, where the Society maintains its factory. Manuscript for the various publications is there set in many different languages and the printing and manufacturing work is done on machines operated by consecrated hands. There also the detailed work of the radio is carried on. The general management of all the work, however, is done from the Columbia Heights executive offices.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>RADIO</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">The value of the radio for communicating to the people grows steadily. There are many improvements today that ■Were not enjoyed by radio operators a few years ago. There are so many stations operating simultaneously, however, on close radio frequencies that continuous reception over a wide area is not satisfactory. The Society has put forth its best endeavors during the year to use the radio to tell the good news of the kingdom to the people. It has met much opposition. Satan’s organization is now in control of earth’s affairs and of course, it is to be expected, would oppose the broadcasting of the truth concerning God's kingdom. To be sure Jehovah could instantly put out of working order all of Satan’s organization and the radio stations operated by it, but it seems that his due time has not yet arrived so to do. The mere fact that God permits Satan to interfere with the use of the radio must be construed to mean that such permission is for a wise purpose known unto the Lord. Trusting in him implicitly, his people may go confidently on, knowing that in his due time he will cause the radio to be used to give his message of the kingdom as widely as he wills it to be used.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">NATION-WIDE BROADCASTING</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font6">A nation-wide broadcast was arranged for May 13, 1928. The originating station of the program was WGY, at Schenectady, New York. Fifty-one radio stations were linked together by wire. These stations were located at various points in the United States so that the speech on that occasion covered the major portion of the country. The president of the Society delivered the lecture on that occasion from a theater at Albany, New York, and simultaneously the fifty-one radio stations carried the speech throughout the land. In response to this lecture a great number of telegrams and letters were received showing a splendid reception, and much interest was manifested by the people. At the same time WGY broadcast the lecture on a short wave length which made it possible for long distance reception, and reports showed that the lecture was plainly heard in Scotland and portions of Continental Europe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">On Sunday morning, August 5, 1928, the president of the Society delivered a public address at the State Fair Grounds Auditorium, Detroit, Michigan, before the International Convention of Bible Students assembled there. The subject of the lecture was “Ruler for the People”. It was delivered in support of a resolution offered at the time before the convention and which, at the conclusion of the lecture, was unanimously adopted by the convention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Arrangements were made to broadcast this lecture throughout the United States and Canada. A total of 107 radio stations participated in this simultaneous broadcast. Immediately following the lecture and musical program, a large number of telegrams were received from various parts of the United States and Canada, announcing that the reception was clear and well received. In many places halls were taken and loud speakers installed, while in many private homes audiences assembled. Also in some places loud speakers were installed in public parks. Within a short time thereafter a flood of letters were received from various parts of the country, with many requests for copies of the lecture The Society’s presses at 117 Adams Street, Brooklyn, have been running steadily for twenty-four hours a day for more than a month printing the booklet entitled, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Peoples Friend, </span><span class="font6">which contains the resolution adopted, also the speech in support thereof, and another address delivered on another occasion. Upward of five million copies of this booklet in the English language have been printed, and these are now in course of distribution among the English-speaking people. In addition thereto, the booklet is being printed in many other languages for distribution in America and Europe, also in parts of Asia and Africa.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">On Monday morning, August 6, 1928, the president of the Society broadcast from the Detroit Auditorium the same lecture for the special benefit of the peoples of New Zealand and Australia. This was done by short wave radio frequency from station WGY at Schenectady, New York, the speech being transmitted by telephone wire from Detroit to Schenectady. Reports from these countries show that there was a very fair reception both in New Zealand and in Australia. At the same time, many heard in different parts of South America, the Canal Zone and islands of the sea.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The cost of the broadcasting of this program was contributed to by a number of brethren throughout the land. Therefore many had part in sending forth the good news to hungry souls, some of whom are held as “prisoners” in the ecclesiastical systems. Others confined to hospitals or to sick beds in their homes, and many others throughout the countries of the earth, were made glad by hearing the message that Jehovah is now sending forth to the people.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark20"></a>LOCAL RADIO STATIONS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">The Society owns and operates radio stations WBBR, situated at Staten Island, New York, and WORD, at Chicago, Illinois. These stations have broadcast programs concerning God’s kingdom regularly during the year and with good effect. Both stations, however, have been greatly handicapped and put to much disadvantage by reason of being compelled to broadcast on unfavorable wave lengths or radio frequencies While the radio belongs to Jehovah, we must keep in mind that Satan and his organization still control the affairs of this world. God’s due time to completely destroy the enemy from the earth is not yet. Manifestly the Lord is permitting Satan to interfere with the broadcasting of the Truth. Such interference comes chiefly from the clergy, who claim to represent the Lord, but who in fact represent Satan, whether they know it or not. The Lord could prevent this interference, but he sees wise not to do so. Probably the Lord wants his people to have some tribulation in the broadcasting field as well as elsewhere. All these experiences tend to advertise the King and his kingdom. We may be confident that when the Lord gets ready to have all the radio stations of the earth broadcast his message of truth, he will do so. We will continue to go on in the way he permits, knowing that his perfect wisdom is directing the course of his people and that in due time he will cause all experiences to redound to Ins own glory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The new allocation made by the Federal Radio Commission becomes operative November 11, 1928. Under that reallocation WBBR is required to broadcast on a wave length of 230 6 meters, and WORD, at Chicago, on 202 6 meters. Since WORD was built to operate on a wave band between 300 and 600 meters, it is entirely impossible to broadcast on </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">a </span><span class="font6">wave length of 202 6 meters. There is but one thing left for us to do at the present time, and that is to reconstruct the equipment at great expense of effort and money. We hope that the reconstruction may enable us to continue to use WORD to good advantage. Our own engineers could do the reconstruction work; but since the patents for the equipment are owned by private corporations, we must bow to their method of doing the work and pay what to us seems to be an exorbitant price. Since the beginning of the radio work there has been manifested a continuous opposition, and this opposition has kept us busy trying to overcome it and to still go on with the work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Society has special contracts with stations WHK, at Cleveland, Ohio, and KFWM, at Oakland, California. These contracts provide that the Society has the exclusive privilege of broadcasting Bible truths over such stations. These two stations have been broadcasting the Society’s programs throughout the year and with splendid results, and for this we give thanks to the Lord as for all good things which proceed from him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Society’s stations that for some time operated in Canada were compelled to cease broadcasting because the government declined to renew the licenses therefor. No legal or other adequate reason was assigned for such arbitrary action on the part of the government. It is manifest that the influence of the clergy got in its work through the principal of their flock and caused arbitrary action to be taken. There were less than tivo hundred complaints made against the stations there broadcasting Upon these few complaints the license was denied The people rose up en masse against such action. Meetings w<sup>r</sup>ere held which were addressed by prominent Canadian citizens who are not Bible Students and who spoke in favor of the Society's stations Later a petition was presented to the government, signed by approximately five hundred thousand Canadian citizens. The petition protested against the action of the government and asked</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">that the licenses of the Society’s stations be renewed. The matter is still pending and will be again heard in Parliament. This opposition has been blessed by the Lord in this, that it has caused a great amount of advertising of the truth throughout Canada and a far greater number than ever have been looking into the truth and buying the literature and thereby informing themselves. If it be the Lord’s will, we hope to see these Canadian stations again broadcasting the truth to a better advantage than before.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During the fiscal year other stations have broadcast the Society’s programs giving the message of the kingdom. This, of course, has been done under contract. Stations broadcasting the message for the Society during the year totaled 143, and are distributed throughout the earth as follows: United States, 127; Canada, 8; Australia and New Zealand, 8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In addition thereto there has been occasional broadcasting of the truth in South Africa, India, Switzerland and other parts of Continental Europe. Without a question of doubt, the Lord has given his blessing to the radio method of preaching the gospel of the kingdom. Great multitudes of the people who never before heard the truth concerning God’s plan have been enabled to hear by radio while sitting quietly in their respective homes. Then, when called upon by the colporteurs or class workers, they have readily purchased the books and begun the study of God’s plan. This gives proof that, notwithstanding all the opposition that the enemy may put forth, the gospel of the kingdom goes grandly on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During the year the radio stations not only have broadcast the truth in the English language but have also broadcast the kingdom message in the German, French, Greek, Syrian, Armenian, Norwegian, Swedish, Polish and other languages. The radio has thus been one of the strong features during the year for making known the name of Jehovah and his purpose of establishing his righteous government on the earth.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark21"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark22"></a>AMERICA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">It was in America that the gospel of the second presence of our Lord began to be preached. That was about fifty years ago. That does not mean that there were consecrated persons only in America. On the contrary, many other countries were the residences of people consecrated to do God’s will. It seemed pleasing to the Lord, however, to have the message of present truth begun to be sent forth from America. Probably that was due to the fact that America has a more cosmopolitan population than any other country on earth. In this land the people have come from all countries of the earth and have made America their place of residence. Because all nations of the countries claiming to be Christian arc represented in America, it may well be said that the gospel began to be preached here to all nations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During the period of approximately forty years from the beginning of the preaching of the second presence of our Lord, the chief work of the anointed was to study the Word of God and to interest others who were seeking the truth, to study his Word. During that period of time the Lord restored to his people the great fundamental truths that had so long been hid from their vision. This enabled the consecrated to see their privilege of separating themselves from worldly organizations and to come together for communion and fellowship in the spirit of the Lord. The work therefore was more in the nature of gathering out of Babylon, and assembling together to build one another up in the most holy faith. There was witnessing work done, of course, but most of the witnessing work in that period was done by a small number of men going from place to place and preaching the gospel by word of mouth, and by a small number of men and women as colporteurs calling from house to house and preaching the gospel by telling of the Lord and his purpose to bless the obedient ones of the human race. That means brought a goodly number of persons together and into present truth. Many of such accepted the truth because it appealed to them as being the best religion they had ever heard about. They saw that Jehovah God is the great God of love and that he would not torture any one in hell torment, but that the fate of the wilfully wicked is destruction. That great truth, restored to the people, released many from great mental distress. During that period of forty years the anti-hell doctrine of the Bible was specially stressed and with a good purpose and to the Lord’s glory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Those who saw that God in his loving-kindness had made provision, through the death and resurrection of his beloved Son, to save the human race were not only relieved but made glad. They saw also that God was separating from the merely nominal systems those who loved him and that he was bringing them together in a company by themselves. They accepted the truth and made a consecration to do his will. Some of these had a selfish purpose in view, in this, that they looked forward to the time when they would receive a personal reward by being taken to heaven, be relieved of all their woes and troubles and be for ever in bliss and ease. They were not particularly impressed by the love of God, exhibited by him toward mankind, and the privilege of magnifying his name amongst men. They gave a greater amount of glory to Jesus because he had died for mankind. They had a desire to be made in the likeness of the Lord Jesus and, to do this, they insisted that they must be diligent in developing a beautiful and sweet character. That which claimed their attention chiefly was getting ready to go to heaven and to go just as soon as possible. The date 1914 was undoubtedly a marked date in the Scriptures, which was seen by those in the truth, and they looked forward to that time believing and hoping that they would be taken to their heavenly homes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Then when 1914 came and those above described found themselves still on the earth, they ■were disappointed. Many of them were dismayed and wondered if they had figured out the matter just right. Some had been so rash as to say that if God's plan did not fully mature in 1914, then they would cast the truth a,ide. They had a chanee to do that very thing and some of them did it and fell away.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At the same time there was another class walking side bv side with their biethrcn, more fully devoted to the Lord and who were not looking so much for a place of ease and comfort as they were interested in doing what they could to the glory of the Lord in obedience to his commandments. They realized that in themselves there was no perfect thing, that all they had or hoped to be was by the Lord’s grace, and their great desire was to magnify the Lord and his great plan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">From 1914 to 1918 was a strenuous time for the consecrated. In 1918 the great testing time was reached, and many of those who had made a covenant with the Lord by sacrifice were shaken out. That was a fiery time, and it had been foreshadowed by the ending of the experience of Elijah the prophet, During the period of forty years all the consecrated walked together; and now a time of separation had come, and this was foreshadowed by the separating of Elijah from Elisha. It marked the end of a certain work and the time for the beginning of another.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Those that were more fully devoted to the Lord rejoiced to know that God, in the exercise of his loving-kindness, had provided salvation for all and that in due time all would have an opportunity for life. They saw the great privilege of service and understood that serving the Lord was a means of proving their love for him and faithfulness to him. Uppermost in the minds of such was the fact that God in his due time would establish a kingdom or government of righteousness, that Christ Jesus would be the Head of that government and that there would be associated with him those who should prove themselves faithful and true to him before the establishment of that government in full sway. They appreciated the necessity of being faithful to the Lord and put forth their best endeavors to faithfully and truly perform their covenant by looking after the kingdom interests committed to them. This they did by seizing opportunities of serving the Lord. They did not fully understand what it meant to have the kingdom interests committed into their hands, but they knew it was of greatest importance to prove faithful to God and to Christ Jesus, Therefore they endeavored to take advantage of opportunities to bear witness to the name and majesty of God and of his beloved Son.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower</span><span class="font6"> has heretofore given ample Scriptural proof showing that the Lord suddenly came to his temple in 1918; also that he came to his temple for the purpose of judgment or taking account, first with his servants; that there he did take account with the consecrated, and those whom he found earnest and faithful he gathered together into the temple condition, gave them the robe of righteousness, which signifies approval, and the garments of salvation, enabling them to identify themselves as the Lord’s children, and constituted them the “faithful and wise servant”. It was shortly thereafter that those more fully devoted to the Lord understood the purpose of God to have a witness given in the world. The World War ceased in 1918, and these faithful ones understood thereafter and appreciated the commandment of Jesus, to wit: “And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations: and then shall the end come.” (Matt. 24:14) They began to appreciate the further fact that such are constituted God’s witnesses to declare his Name and majesty in the earth. God revealed to them the distinction between his organization and the Devil’s organization. From 1922 forward they began a more strenuous witness which has gradually increased in velocity even unto the present time and which has clearly received God’s manifest approval by his continued blessings. This work done by the faithful was foreshadowed by the experiences of the Prophet Elisha The work beginning about 1922 spread to other countries and nations. Likewise the more active witness work that began in America was taken up in other parts of the earth and has been greatly blessed by the Lord During the past six years there has been a gradual increase of the witness work although the number engaged therein has not materially increased and in many places the number has grown less There is conclusive evidence given by the Lord’s Word and by the extraneous facts that he will have the witness work now given in the earth, and the anointed ones are more keenly appreciating their great privilege of having a part in this work. Just how long the Lord will have it continued we do not know, so far as years and days are concerned; but we do know that the Lord through his prophet has said “Until the cities [Devil’s organized systems] be wasted without inhabitant, and the houses without man, and the land be utterly desolate.” (Isa. 6:11) By that we understand that God will have the witness go on until Armageddon, and probably even for a time after Armageddon, and this witness will be done by his anointed ones on earth For this reason the anointed are not particularly concerned about the day or the hour or the year that they may finish their earthly course. That which concerns them is to be faithful and true to the Lord in performing with gladness what he has given them to do.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark23"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark24"></a>OFFICE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">It is believed that the work of the Lord should be done in the most efficient manner possible. In order to do the witness work it appeared to be the Lord’s will that the Society organize an efficient office force at the American headquarters. This has been done. Likewise an efficient office force has been organized at other headquarters throughout the earth. The work at the office at headquarters was arranged under departments, to wit: Service department, which includes the colporteurs, pioneer colporteurs, auxiliary colporteurs, regional service directors, and class workers ; Translation department, wherein the message is translated into twenty or more languages and prepared for the typesetters and is set in the same factory ; Stencil department, which systematically arranges and handles all the names and addresses of those who subscribe for </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower</span><span class="font6"> and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font6">; Correspondence department, which handles all the correspondence to the office concerning orders, inquiries, questions, etc.; Proofreading department, which examines and marks all the manuscript and reads the proof after it is set in type; Radio and Lecture department, which has control of the public speaking, which includes those who travel from place to place and address the interested and the public either in halls or by radio; the Bookkeeping, the Cost, Control and the Dispatch departments. All these departments are under the supervision of one office manager and the general supervision of the president.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Each department puts forth its best endeavors to perform the duties assigned and not get in the way of some other.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">By the cost control the office is enabled to keep an accurate account of the progress of the work in the factory as well as in the office. A budget arrangement is put in operation and the material for manufacturing the books, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower, The Golden Age</span><span class="font6"> and other publications, is ordered in quantity and at the best possible price. It is known before we begin what it will cost to produce a book, and then the selling price may be fixed accordingly. It was Jesus who said that a wise man, before building a house, sits down and counts the cost. Following this advice the office diligently endeavors to determine approximately the number of books and booklets to be manufactured within a year, and estimates the cost, and then contracts arc made for the purchasing of material accordingly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">By the dispatch control system each man who works in the office and factory has his duties assigned to be performed at a certain time, and the dispatch clerk is able to follow the work from the beginning to the end. There is a schedule by which every one is expected to act. The president is told by the dispatch clerk when the manuscript must be in the hands of the proofreaders and, from that time until the book is ready for shipment, each one in the office and fae-tory is expected to follow the schedule as faithfully as a railway train is run by schedule. By this means the work can be systematized and is done economically. The office controls the factory, which is situated in the same building. The work at the office begins exactly on time each day, and all work ends at the same hour. Every one is expected to be at his desk during such office houra</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark25"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark26"></a>FACTORY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">It was clearly seen about 1922 that if we were to give the witness that the Lord has indicated must be given by his people, some means must be provided for the printing and manufacturing of books. While all the money belongs to the Lord, it does not seem to please him to give it all to his people at one time. He knows that they must have some experiences in order to learn the needed lessons. God is the Great Economist.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">To be required to pay worldly concerns for the manufacture of books would preclude the distribution of a great number of books. Worldly concerns operate their plants for pecuniary profit, and the ones buying the books would have to pay that profit, of course. Some means had to be provided to manufacture books at the least possible cost, so that the people could get them at a reasonable price and the colporteurs could have a small amount to defray their expenses in going from door to door. The contributions made by the brethren would not be sufficient to meet all these expenses. It seemed clear that the gospel must be preached in a large measure by the distribution of books and booklets. For this reason arrangements were completed to build our own structure and install our own machines, make our own light and power which operates the machines, and then to do the work in the most economical manner possible. It was necessary to go into debt in order to erect the building and install the machines; but, by making a small profit on the books and applying the contributions as far as possible, the Society hopes to be enabled to greatly reduce this debt and, in time, to pay it off. Promptly each year the interest on the debt is paid, and each year some of the brethren who are able to do so, gladly contribute their bonds, thereby canceling so much of the debt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There is a very great expense involved in carrying on the work even in tins economical way; but the Lord has provided, and we give him the glory therefor. We must rest in confidence that he will continue to supply the needs to do His work, because it is his work. At the same time his anointed on earth must do everything within their power, and then he does for us what we can not do. Without him we could do nothing, but the Lord expects his anointed ones to be workers together with him and to count it the greatest privilege thus to do. During the year it has been necessary to install some new machines in order that the work may be more efficiently done. The Lord has approved this.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark27"></a><span class="font4"><a name="bookmark28"></a>MATERIAL</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">By the Lord’s grace we buy our material for the manufacture of books, at a reasonable price, ouch material is purchased in large quantities. During the year 1927 the factory at Adams Street consumed 82!) tons of paper in the printing of magazines and books. During the fiscal year of 1928 the same factory consumed 1250 tons of paper for the same purpose. It will thus be seen that this quantity of paper would make a good-sized freight train of cars loaded with paper.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During the year ending 1927 the Society used at this factory 160,000 yards of cloth to bind books; whereas in the year ending September 30, 1928, there were 211,160 yards of cloth used for the same purpose Last year we used 8,350 pounds of ink; whereas for the year 1928 we used 24,550 pounds of ink for the printing Recently we have been enabled to install a machine by which we make ink, and from now on we shall need to buy only the raw material from which the ink is produced. The other supplies for the factory, such as thread, glue, cartons, etc., are purchased in quantity and at the best possible figures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At the office and factory there are now employed 146 men and women. They work not merely to put in time, but they put forth their best efforts to the glory of the Lord. Time and again men of other factories come to the Society’s factory to inspect it and, after watching its operation, express great surprise and admiration concerning the efficiency with which the work is there done. Frequently one of these will say, “How do you get men to work like these men? We can’t do it for love nor money.’’ They are unaware of what real love for the Lord means. These men are working because they have the spirit of the Lord and because they wish to glorify his name. They have the spirit of Elisha that moves them to loving zeal and devotion to the Lord, fearless of what any creature might say or think concerning them. They do with their might what their hands find to do to the Lord’s glory.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark29"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark30"></a>PRODUCTION</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">The members of the Lord’s army both in and out of Brooklyn headquarters will be keenly interested in knowing what the Brooklyn factory produced during the fiscal year ending September 30, 1928. It will be seen that there was a marked increase of production in 1928 over that of 1927. The reason for that increase was the greater need of books and booklets in the field. During the fiscal year just ended the large press devoted to booklets was required to work fifty-one days extra time. This time was made up by running the press on three shifts of eight hours each, or twenty-four hours a day. The binding machinery also was required to work extra time. Below, the figures showing the production for 1927 and for 1928 are set in separate columns in order that comparison may be had.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">The grand total of production for 1927 was 9,939,353; for 1928, 15,014,452.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This shows an increase of books for 1928 over that of 1927 of 744,685 volumes; increase of booklets, same year, 4,801,314; </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age,</span><span class="font6"> an increase of 140,600. At the same time it will be seen that there is a decrease in the production of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower. </span><span class="font6">This shows that the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Watch Tower</span><span class="font6"> list has been reduced 2,419. This should be kept in mind when we come to consider the distribution of the literature, which we will see has increased, notwithstanding the decreased number of those who read </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower.</span><span class="font6"> It proves that the Lord will do his work by the zealous ones and with the small number, even as he did in Gideon’s time. The net increase of books and booklets of 1928 over 1927 is 5,045,999; and it will be interesting to compare this with the distribution for the year ending.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark31"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark32"></a>DISTRIBUTION</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">Books are shipped from the factory at Brooklyn to individuals, to our sub-stations or depots in Chicago, St. Louis, and Oakland, California, and also to foreign branches. The shipments of books from the headquarters and the three depots show a most interesting increase over the year previous. Sales to classes, pioneers, colporteurs, auxiliary colporteurs, branches, and retail sales, have all very materially increased. The total sold for 1927 was 6,445,246, whereas in 1928 there were 8,868,458 sold. This means an increase of 2,423,212. The sale of Bibles during the same period of time shows a small decrease. In 1927 the sale was 4,708, and in 1928, 4,070.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The book sales for the foreign languages show an increase of 58,986 books and 457,113 booklets, or a total increase of books and booklets for 1928 over 1927 of 516,099. This covers books manufactured at the Brooklyn factory in the foreign languages. The net increase of books and booklets in the English language alone from this factory and sent out was 1,906,475.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During the fiscal year just closed the Society published three new books, to wit, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Creation, Reconciliation,</span><span class="font6"> and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Government.</span><span class="font6"> It was to be expected, of course, that this might reduce the sales of books previously published, but even with these three new books in the field, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Harp of God</span><span class="font6"> shows an increase over 1927 of 169,907 copies. There was a total sale of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Harp</span><span class="font6"> during the year 1928 of 481,026. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Deliverance,</span><span class="font6"> which was published late in 1926, also made a good showing in 1928. During the latter year there were placed in the hands of the people 627,235 copies of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Deliverance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Another interesting item which shows the trend of the mind to be fed on certain things. During 1927 we published a new booklet, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Where Are the Deadf </span><span class="font6">distributing that year 896,551 copies In 1928 the Society published two new booklets, to wit, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Last Days </span><span class="font6">and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Prosperity Sure,</span><span class="font6"> and the sales of these aggregated 2,086,324 copies; and in addition thereto there were placed in the hands of the people 709,888 of the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Where Are the Dead?</span><span class="font6"> booklet. The number of people desiring to know where their dead friends are is increasing ; and this is gratifying. They are seeking the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is interesting to note that in 1928 the Brooklyn factory manufactured 2,950,233 bound volumes and shipped out or distributed 2,767,522, leaving a supply of only 182,711 at the end of the year. This proves that the production of the factory during the fiscal year closing is only fifteen days ahead of the distribution. It indicates there is still more work to be done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A great number of booklets have been produced during the year, as will be observed from the production account; and yet, according to the record of distribution, there is only a month’s supply now on hand. This is encouraging.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark33"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark34"></a>FIELD SERVICE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">Let it always be kept in mind that the field service is the work of actively preaching the gospel of the kingdom. The real business of the Christian now on earth is to announce God’s righteous government. Going from house to house and carrying the message of the kingdom in printed form and exhibiting it to the people is the method of the Society to preach the gospel of God and of his kingdom and of his Christ. No law-making body m America has any right to interfere with this method of preaching the gospel. This work is in no wise affected by the Interstate Commerce Law, for the reason that it is not engaging in any commercial business. The first amendment to the Constitution of the United States, which is the fundamental law of the land, provides for the freedom of preaching the gospel. Every one of God’s anointed is commissioned to preach the gospel of the kingdom (Isa. 61:1, 2) To be obedient to the Lord’s commandment, all such must now preach the gospel. (Matt. 24:14; 1 Cor. 9:16) In America no one has the right or power to issue a permit providing for or limiting the preaching of the gospel. It can not be a violation of any law in America to preach the gospel. In America the gospel of the kingdom is preached by colporteurs, pioneer colporteurs, auxiliary colporteurs and class workers, and this is done by going from house to house and exhibiting in printed form discourses to the people, and affording them an opportunity to have the same. The taking of a small price for such books or booklets is not engaging in business for profit within the meaning of any law. If it is lawful for clergymen to harangue the people and take up a collection on Sunday or any other day, or for some other organization to draw a crowd in the streets, speak to them and take up a collection, surely it is lawful to put the gospel in the hands of the people in their homes and receive a small amount of money therefor to defray expenses. For this reason, and because commanded to preach the gospel, any one who is arrested for so doing should claim the protection that the law of the land guarantees. Paul set the precedent for such a course, and that with God’s approval. (Acts 25:11) Let no one in America, therefore, seek a permit at the hands of any official of any town, city or other municipality for preaching the gospel of God’s kingdom. Let them go on in obedience to the Lord’s command, and, when interfered with, call attention to the fact that they are doing that which the law guarantees they shall be permitted to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During the past year </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower</span><span class="font6"> has stressed the importance of service, for the reason that such is commanded in God’s Word. The Lord’s approval and blessing has been upon the same, and this has been proven by a great increase in number of the consecrated ones entering the colporteur service. In addition to what </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower</span><span class="font6"> has said, special bulletins showing the privilege of engaging in the work have been sent out to the consecrated. Also a series of seven letters of the same import were sent to the classes. Gradually more have come into the field until the peak of the registration of those in the colporteur service in the United States was reached on September 28, last, showing a total of 1,183 regular colporteurs. When the auxiliary colporteurs are added to this, the total number engaged in the colporteur service at the close of the fiscal year is 1,922.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A marked increase began with the IBSA week of May. At that time the sales of the books took a decided increase. In the month of June the bound volumes distributed by colporteurs exceeded one hundred thousand for the month. September, however, broke all records. That month the colporteurs placed in the hands of the people 133,755 bound books. During the last five months of 1928, more than three times as many books were sold as during the first seven months. This shows a steady and marked increase.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The total of books placed in the hands of the people in 1928 by the American colporteurs represents an increase of 264% over previous years. This is undoubtedly due to the increased number of colporteurs in the field and active in the service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Many of the most isolated sections of the country, seldom heretofore canvassed, were visited by colporteurs in 1928. Special arrangement made for pioneers has encouraged the workers to visit these rural districts, so that during the year a great number of farmers and mountaineers have received the literature. Seeing the poverty of many of these people, the colporteurs have exchanged their books for chickens, eggs and other farm products and have lived upon these themselves. It would be difficult to work the rural districts in the winter, and therefore arrangements are made for pioneer colporteurs to work in the business sections of the largest cities during the winter. This is proving a great stimulus to the colporteurs. The colporteurs appreciate the necessity of cooperation, and regularly make their reports each month to the office at Brooklyn; and this enables the office to keep in close touch with them, aiding and advising them. Analysis of these reports shows that during the year the number of bound books placed in the hands of the people by the colporteurs totaled 697,370.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark35"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark36"></a>CLASS ACTIVITIES</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">The ecclesias or classes are made up of men and women who claim to be consecrated to the Lord. Some of their number have a deeper appreciation than others of their privileges in preaching the gospel by going from house to house. Some have, in a measure, been inclined to a gradual awakening to a deeper realization of the opportunities of serving the Lord. It has been only a few years since the classes were organized for the service work. The fiscal year of 1927 showed well, but the year 1928 far surpasses anything in the past.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At the close of the fiscal year 1927 there were 866 classes organized and engaged in the field service work preaching the gospel from house to house. At the close of the fiscal year of 1928 there were 931 classes organized and engaged in this same work. At the close of 1927 there were daily workers from among the classes to the aggregate of 18,602. At the close of 1928 there were 21,766 persons engaged in this field service work in the classes. The total sales for the year 1927 by class workers were, to wit, 252,952. For the year 1928 the total sales were 302,774. The total number of books sold, at the close of 1927, was 352,959; whereas in 1928 at the close of the fiscal year it was 580,008. The increase in sales for 1928 over 1927 was 20%. The increase in number of books sold was 64%. The increase in number of workers was 50%.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There were three factors that influenced the class activities during the year 1928, all of which had a bearing on the increased sale of books as well as on the number of workers These three are, to wit:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">the ‘'freedom ’ ’ campaign : On October 1 a campaign began for the distribution of the booklet </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Freedom for the Peoples.</span><span class="font6"> There was a concentration on this booklet for one month. The enthusiasm shown m this campaign brought many other workers into the field.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">colporteur campaign: This campaign commenced November 1, 1927, just when the friends were enthused over the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Freedom</span><span class="font6"> drive, and had much to do with the awakening of many in the classes to their responsibilities. The result was, about one thousand of the best and most efficient workers were taken from the classes and enrolled as colporteurs. But this was more than overcome by the effect it had on the classes as a whole. The new workers, of course, had less experience than the older ones and the sales per worker were less, and this reduced the average number of sales during the year; but their persistence in the work and their zeal bore the fruit. The Lord’s blessing was with them. The work gradually increased, so that at the end of the year these new workers were much more proficient than in the year previous. Sales for 1928, therefore, kept increasing every month, due to the fact that the workers kept going steadily into the field.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">organization : The activity of the campaign of the classes was increased, and their efficiency increased by better organization. This organization eliminated much of the dead timber, and the faithful and earnest ones, more fully appreciating their privileges, went forth to the work. Also the three new books that were brought into the field during the year enthused the friends to greater activity. The net result for the year is that the classes are in better condition spiritually and from the standpoint of organization and activity than at any previous time.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark37"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark38"></a>REGIONAL SERVICE DIRECTORS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">Heretofore the Society has kept regularly in the field speakers designated as &quot;pilgrims”. The name of these has been changed to “regional service directors ’ ’. In other words, the pilgrim service has been succeeded by the work of the directors. These directors visit the classes, instruct them how to organize and to work efficiently in the field, and at the same time serve them by delivering discourses upon the present truth. These discourses enable the friends to see their greater privilege of service. These service directors also instruct the brethren in active and practical field service, and this has been a great stimulus to the work during the year. There was a tendency on the part of those engaging in the pilgrim work to become ecclesiastical. The service directors, however, are more practically engaging in preaching the gospel and are therefore having the blessings of the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During the fiscal year these service directors have visited 502 classes. They have traveled over a distance of 66,033 miles, and have held many meetings as well as given practical instruction for the service.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark39"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark40"></a>LECTURES</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">In addition to the regular service directors during the year there have been 115 men engaged in delivering lectures and aiding the classes in the service. Seventy of these are English-speaking men, while the others according to number are as follows: Polish 8, German 10, Greek 4, Hungarian 3, Lithuanian 3, Ukrainian 2, Colored 4, Japanese 1, Spanish 2, Italian 2, Russian 1, Armenian 3, Portuguese 1, French 1. These have all been directed from the radio and lecture department of the Society’s office -at headquarters. They have held a total of 2,122 public meetings, with an attendance of 163,018; a total of 4,503 class meetings, with a total attendance of 228,641. The aggregate mileage traveled by these men has been 648,246 miles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The last above mentioned includes members of the Bethel family. These brethren go out Saturday afternoons and Sundays, aiding the classes in practical field sendee and serving them on Sunday afternoons and Sunday evenings.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark41"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark42"></a>SUNDAY CANVASSING</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">The consecrated finally awakened to the fact that Sunday is the most appropriate time and the most effective time to preach the gospel, for the reason that on that day the major portion of the people rest from their daily labors. Some had the idea that going from house to house was breaking the Sabbath. Such a conclusion, however, is entirely erroneous. When it is always kept in mind that the work of the classes in calling at the homes is preaching the gospel, nothing could be more appropriate. Some of the members of the classes have been reproached by people because they were thus going from house to house on Sunday. The reply has been, “I see you have just been to the church Why isn’t that breaking the Sabbath equally or more? You went there to hear something and paid the preacher. I preach the message of the Lord’s kingdom to you. This is our method of preaching the gospel.” Invariably this argument overcomes all opposition argument.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As the brethren are seeing their privileges in this regard, Sunday mornings have been devoted especially to canvassing from house to house. The meetings that have heretofore been held at three o’clock in the afternoon have been changed to four, thus providing more time for canvassing during the day. Then further study meetings are held in the evening on Sundays. There have been some classes and some members of other classes that have objected to the Sunday work and have refused to have part in it. Of course that is the privilege of each one. It shows, however, a lack of appreciation of the opportunity that God has offered to preach the gospel to his glory. Every class that is engaged in the Sunday morning canvass has reported progress and many blessings. In fact, it affords every one of the class the opportunity to preach the gospel, whereas heretofore we have permitted one to do all the preaching and the others to sit silent, some listening and some not even doing that. Now the Lord’s spirit has been poured out upon men and women and each one is privileged to have a part in preaching the gospel in the manner above stated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In addition to the meetings above mentioned, the consecrated have delivered lectures regularly over radio stations to the number of 127 stations in the United States, each broadcasting every Sunday. It is wholly impossible to enumerate the audience, but estimating that the average audience was 5,000 a lecture it shows what a tremendous number have heard the truth in this manner. Without a doubt the audiences have been much larger than that. The effect upon the distribution of the books and booklets is to increase it in a marked degree in the vicinities where these radio lectures have been given. This is proof that the Lord is using the radio to his glory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">IBSA WEEKS</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During the year two weeks were set aside especially for general canvassing throughout the earth and these have been designated as IBSA weeks. The first was May 13 to May 20; the second, August 26 to September 3. In the year 1927 there was only one week set aside for this purpose, and without doubt the special IBSA weeks have also had much to do in the great increase of distribution of books and booklets during the year.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark43"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark44"></a>SERVICE CONVENTIONS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">During the year there have been held a number of two-day local service conventions. The arrangement is after this manner. The classes residing in contiguous territory unite in holding their monthly service convention. In this manner many classes have been united in the service. The reports from everywhere show that such conventions have brought about splendid results in giving a witness to that community. No adequate comparison can be made between these conventions and the public meetings, as the advantage is all on the side of the service convention. The cost of these conventions is much less than of public meetings ; yet many more people are reached. Furthermore it affords opportunity for all men and women who are consecrated to the Lord to engage in the witness work. These conventions have been served by members of the Bethel family and others in their local classes, and by still other brethren who are on the road.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The usual method has been, to have these conventions on Saturdays and Sundays, and to use part of the day on Saturday and part of the day on Sunday for canvassing parties. The speaker assigned gives a talk to the class on Saturday evening, especially on some up-to-date part of present truth. Sunday morning from about 9:30 a.m. to 1 p.m., the time is devoted to canvassing. Luncheon is served and a meeting held in the afternoon. Sometimes on the Sundays canvassing has been extended to the entire afternoon, the speaker addressing the convention in the evening. The hour for the meeting is arranged to suit the convenience of the convention in that community.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Many who attend these conventions have felt keenly their lack of qualification to engage in the work. They have been timid and fearful but, coming in contact with other brethren of like precious faith, hearing their experiences and seeing their efforts put forth, have been enthused to participate, with the result that many of the weaker ones have grown strong in the Lord and have greatly rejoiced in the blessings received from the Lord while engaged in the service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is not an unusual thing for a little assembly of fifty persons canvassing Saturday or Sunday morning to place from 150 to 450 books. Where the conventions extend for a period of three days the sales range from 600 to 2000 books to the convention. Assuming that there were 1200 placed and that each one of the booklets contained, on an average, two sermons, there would be more than 2400 sermons or discourses delivered in that vicinity, which far exceeds any public meeting that could be held.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Another pleasing feature of these conventions is that they are conducive to increasing the spirit of unity and harmony amongst the brethren. They have no time nor inclination to gossip. They talk about up-to-date truth that appears in </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower</span><span class="font6"> and the books. They encourage and comfort each other and enthuse one another to participate in proclaiming the message of the kingdom. The opinion is here expressed that these local conventions are destined to more closely unite the brethren in the spirit of the Lord, to enable them to see eye to eye and together to lift up their voices in proclaiming the message of God’s great day of deliverance.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark45"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark46"></a>INTERNATIONAL CONVENTION</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">The outstanding convention of the year was the one held at Detroit, July 30 to August 6. About ten thousand attended this convention. Thursday and Saturday were set aside as service days. Four thousand seven hundred fifty-seven persons engaged in the field service and placed a total of 67,260 books and booklets. That convention was a great spiritual uplift to all present, and more firmly united the really loyal and faithful ones than any other convention we have had in recent years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">On Sunday morning the president of the Society delivered a public address before the convention, which address was broadcast over the largest chain of radio stations ever hooked together in one broadcast up to that time. The stations, tied together by wire and including those that re-broadcast by taking the message from the air, totaled 107 stations. The public address was given in support of a resolution presented to the convention and unanimously adopted by the convention at the conclusion of the address. That resolution, because of its importance, is here set out to be preserved in the record:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Bible Students in international convention assembled do declare themselves against Satan and wholly for Jehovah of hosts, and emphatically announce further these vital truths, to wit:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">First:</span><span class="font6"> That the peoples of earth, organized into forms of government and under the control of a superior and invisible ruler, constitute the world;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Second:</span><span class="font6"> That Jehovah is the only true and Almighty God and the source of all just authority; that he is the King Eternal, the God of justice, wisdom, love and power and the true friend and benefactor of all creation;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Third:</span><span class="font6"> That Jehovah delegated to his son Lucifer the authority to be the overseer of man; that Lucifer became disloyal, rebelled against God and caused man to fall away from righteousness, and since that rebellion Lucifer has been known by the titles Dragon, Serpent, Satan and Devil; that Satan the Devil has caused strife amongst the nations and is responsible for all the cruel wars, wicked murders, all heinous crimes and other corrupt acts that have been committed; that until now Jehovah has not restrained Satan from the exercise of power and influence over man, to the end that mankind might learn the baneful results of evil doing; that for many centuries Satan has been the invisible ruler of the world, constantly defaming the name of Jehovah God and working great injury to men and nations;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Fourth:</span><span class="font6"> That Jehovah promised that in his due time he would restrain Satan and establish a righteous government in the earth that men might have an opportunity for life everlasting in happiness; and to that end he anointed his beloved Son Jesus to be the redeemer and invisible ruler of the world ;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Fifth:</span><span class="font6"> That Jehovah’s due time has come to fulfil his promise and to clear his reputation in the minds of all creation; that Christ Jesus has taken his high office as the executive of Jehovah and the great issue now is, Who is God and who shall rule the peoples and nations?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Sixth:</span><span class="font6"> That because Satan will not surrender his wicked rule over the nations and peoples of the earth, Jehovah of hosts with his anointed executive officer Christ Jesus will press the conflict against Satan and all of his forces of evil, and henceforth our battle-cry shall be, THE SWORD OF JEHOVAH AND OF HIS ANOINTED; that the great battle of Armageddon soon to begin will result in the full restraint of Satan and the complete overthrow of his evil organization, and that Jehovah will establish righteousness in the earth by and through Christ the new ruler and will emancipate mankind from evil and bring everlasting blessings to all the nations of the earth;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Seventh:</span><span class="font6"> Therefore the due time has come for all who love righteousness to take their stand on the side of Jehovah and obey and serve him with a pure heart, that they may receive the boundless blessings which the Almighty God has in reservation for them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The foregoing resolution, together with a copy of the address delivered at the time and another lecture on “Antichrist”, has been embraced in a booklet entitled </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Peoples Friend.</span><span class="font6"> Shortly after the close of the fiscal year of 1928 the distribution of the booklet began throughout the earth. The American factory at Brooklyn printed 5,000,000 of these in the English language, to be distributed in the United States, Australia and Great Britain. Canada printed in addition thereto about 400,000 for Canada. Continental Europe has printed millions of these for distribution, and doubtless we shall be able to report next year that there was a wider distribution of this booklet than of any other that has yet been published.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark47"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark48"></a>CORRESPONDENCE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">During the year there has been a voluminous correspondence carried on at the Brooklyn headquarters. Letters and cards received numbered 224,383. Letters and cards dispatched numbered 165,624.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark49"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark50"></a>BETHEL FAMILY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">During the year the members of the Bethel family have maintained their enthusiasm for Saturday and Sunday field service work. They have found that the radio, station WBBR has been a great help in affording an entry into the homes and has enabled them to place great numbers of books and booklets. In addition thereto several other stations in the vicinity of New York have broadcast the truth, which has also been an advantage in the field service work. The family appreciate this privilege and delight to spend their spare moments in the field service work. While, of course, for them the manufacturing of the books is of first importance, getting into the field and distributing some of them is a great impetus to those of the </span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">famil</span><span class="font6">y who are permitted to have a part in it.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark51"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark52"></a>THE WATCH TOWER</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">The Lord has placed his blessing upon </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower</span><span class="font6"> during the year. The purpose of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower</span><span class="font6"> is to communicate present truth to those who read it, and especially to those of the anointed. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower</span><span class="font6"> has stressed the importance of service because God’s Word demands that it shall be done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Throughout the entire land the organized classes of Bible Students use </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower</span><span class="font6"> as a text for study. These studies are held during the week and sometimes Sunday evenings. The study is on the leading articles in </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower,</span><span class="font6"> and the reports are gratifying. These reports testify to the many blessings received by those who engage in the study. There is a study held each Monday evening in the Bethel Home on some article in </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower.</span><span class="font6"> The attendance is limited to the members of the Bethel family in order to furnish opportunity for every one to participate. Each member of the Bethel family will testify to the blessings received from this study.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark53"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark54"></a>THE GOLDEN AGE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">The popularity of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font6"> continues to increase, as is shown by its subscription list. Many who are not devoted to the Lord also take much pleasure in reading the articles therein contained. It also furnishes a means of communicating to the people the radio talks that are delivered by some of the brethren, and this gives a wide publication to the truth. The number of copies of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower</span><span class="font6"> and of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font6"> published during the year has been previously set forth herein.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark55"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark56"></a>DIVERS LANGUAGES</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">At the Brooklyn headquarters the work is earned on in languages other than English as follows: Arabic, Armenian, French, German, Greek, Hungarian, Italian, Lithuanian, Polish, Roumanian, Ukrainian, Russian and Spanish. In what is known as the foreign department of the office are desks, each presided over by a brother who speaks and writes his respective language as above outlined. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower</span><span class="font6"> is published in these languages, correspondence carried on in the languages, and the books and booklets published and distributed in these various languages.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark190"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark191"></a>ARGENTINE</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">The Society’s branch office in Argentine, South America, is at Buenos Aires. The number there interested in the truth is small, but they manifest the seal peculiar to the Lord’s house. The work is small, but there is a healthy increase over the report for 1927. During the year 962 meetings were held, with </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">total attendance of 41,870. Free tracts to the number of 217,700 were distributed. Letters dispatched, 802; received, 520; packages dispatched, 299. Total number of books placed in the hands of the people during the year was 8,939 volumes. In addition to this, old copies of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font6"> to the number of 685 were distributed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The work here is carried on chiefly in Spanish, but there are some German-speaking people also in the vicinity. There are 61 subscribers to the German </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Watch Tower,</span><span class="font6"> 257 subscribers to the Spanish </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Watch Tower,</span><span class="font6"> and 409 subscribers to the German </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Commenting on the zeal of the brethren there, Brother Muniz, the local manager, writes: “The friends here work very harmoniously, though few in number. As they can not do much financially they turn in the full price for the literature which they sell, for the further work. They are so zealous for the work that the very poorest would think it a wrong act on their part if they kept anything from the sale of the books, even for carfare. We thank our heavenly Father and Redeemer for so many blessings received during the year and unanimously send our love and appreciation. During the year twenty-three persons were immersed.”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark192"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark193"></a>AUSTRALIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">Like other parts of the field, Australia shows a decided increase in the work during the year. Bound volumes placed in the hands of the people totaled 77,913, and booklets 208,014, making a grand total of 285,927 books and booklets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">From the letter accompanying the report the following is taken:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">This period proved to be one of joyful service and has been fraught with rich blessings from the Lord. There has been a gratifying Increase in the output of books and each department is healthy and vigorous. For this we are deeply grateful to the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">COLPOBTKUB WOBK</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark194"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">A few months ago the colporteur work was reorganized. Following the appeal from Headquarters, outlined In the circular, “Where Are the Nine?” the Australian Branch sent a letter to all the classes urging the friends to arrange their affairs in such a way that, if possible, they might give more time to the service of the Lord. The result was splendid, and from all over Australia letters were received from zealous brethren promising to give so many hours a week to active field service. la a few weeks the total number of registered colporteurs jumped from 18 to 66. These were classified as follows: Pioneer colporteurs, 21; class colporteurs, 25; auxiliary colporteurs, 20. A few of these have dropped out again for various reasons, but at the time of this writing there Is still an active army of 55 workers In the colporteur field. Pioneer work In Australia la very difficult The Inland population of this huge continent is very sparse, and to reach the small townships much time and expense is often Involved. By faithful and persistent effort, however, these difficulties are overcome, and with joy of heart the witness Is given in these scattered districts. Good work Is being done in Queensland by means of a well-equipped modern motor van, by which it is possible to visit places which have never before had the witness. The Brisbane class is building a second van for the same purpose. In Western Australia, also, the main local ecclesla is putting a motor van on the road In order to more effectively cover the vast Interior of that state.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">sbbvicb wobk</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">This phase of kingdom activity has also been reorganized. The new &quot;Organization Method” recently suggested by Headquarters has been adopted in Australia with gratifying results. The classes have been placed upon a better footing, and the output of books has Increased proportionately. At the beginning of the year 20 classes were reporting to this office. Today there are 43. Each of these has a definite territory assignment and is organized for service. There is an average of about 250 workers in the field each week. A splendid witness was given during the May and August IBSA service weeks. Approximately 400 workers were in the field on each occasion. The grand total of books and booklets sold was 22,372. For the encouragement of the workers a local Bulletin Is published each month, giving a comparative analysis of the work done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">RADIO WORK</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">The Society owns one station In Australia, which broadcasts the kingdom message three and four nights a week alternately. In addition thereto, Melbourne, Sydney and Adelaide broadcast through a local station regularly each week. Other classes also broadcast as opportunity offers. Many expressions of appreciation are received from llsteners-ln, and the sale of books has been helped thereby. It was long ago hoped that greater facilities for broadcasting the message would have opened up through the erection of the Society's own stations, but this has been hindered by a “circumlocution” government which thinks and talks and appoints endless commissions, but which does nothing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">In concluding this report, dear brother, we wish to Inform you of the deep appreciation of the Australian brethren of your untiring devotion and your unswerving loyalty to the great Jehovah and his anointed King. As Is evidently the case in America, we find some here who are only halfhearted in the proclamation of the message, and others who stand by and criticise. Nevertheless there is in every ecclesia a noble band who have the true spirit of the “remnant” and who with humble boldness and faithful consistence preach the Word in season and out of season, and whose joy In the Lord is their strength.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">AUSTRIA</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Society’s branch office in Austria is at Vienna. Recently the Society has acquired its own house in Vienna at a very reasonable price. The house will be sufficient for offices, storeroom for the literature, and a place for the brethren to live while working there.. In connection therewith there is also a small garden, where vegetables may be grown for food.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark195"></a><span class="font6">Austria is a very mountainous country and requires great effort to carry on the work. Frequently both brothers and sisters ride their common bicycles from one hundred to two hundred kilometers within </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">day, canvass a village, and return. It makes it difficult, therefore, to canvass more than twenty or thirty villagers in one day. From the local brother’s report the following is quoted:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">There has been a great Increase In the distribution of literature during the year; 275,847 books and booklets have been placed in the people’s hands. Remembering that Austria has only six million population, the result is favorable. Two hundred fifty-eight class workers and eleven colporteurs have been in the field during the year. The friends In Austria have a great appreciation of the privilege of personally cooperating in the work of going from house to house. They manifest much joy in the work. Many efforts were made to hinder the brethren in their work, but nothing frightens them or deters them from putting forth their best efforts.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark201"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark202"></a>BLIND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">To be afflicted with physical blindness is a great calamity. To comfort such with the message of truth is a great privilege. Our branch office maintained in Logansport, Indiana, is doing its best to reach and aid the blind. While it doesn’t cover as large a scope as we should like to see, at the same time there has been a steady increase in the work during the year just past. When we call to mind that a small booklet of sixty-four pages in print requires one large volume costing a dollar or more to produce, when printed in the blind language, we can understand how much work there is in preparing the literature. The Society is loaning literature and has arranged with some libraries for carrying literature for loaning to those who are blind and who desire to see by their mental vision something of God’s great plan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It would be advantageous if brethren in every part of the land would try to interest their blind neighbors in the study of the Lord’s Word and to communicate with the Society’s office at 1210 Spear Street, Logansport, Indiana, for further information.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The following is quoted from the report of the brother in charge of the work for the blind:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">From a spiritual standpoint the work for the blind has been a great success during the past year, and especially since the Detroit convention. By your permission we had an exhibition of our work at the convention, which consisted of Braille copies of </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Harp, Deliverance, Comfort for the People, A Desirable Government,</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Where Are the Deadf</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> together with </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Watch Totter</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Prayer-Meeting Text Comments</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> and pictures of the machines with which we do the work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">The object of this exhibit was merely to instruct the seeing workers and to create an interest among them in reaching the blind with literature that they can read for themselves. This seems to have accomplished its purpose in part, at least. The number of readers of </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Prayer-Meeting Text Comments</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> has increased from 63 in July to 103 In October.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Since turning our book-lending over to the Chicago Public Library, Mr. Peterson, who there has charge of their work for the blind, tells me that he has received several requests for literature which apparently have come through our work at Detroit. He does not keep a record of our books separate from his own, so he can not report as to how many he Is lending; but he says our books do not get to stay in the library very long. I have received a few letters commending the way the Chicago Public Library Is handling our books.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark203"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark204"></a>BRAZIL</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">The Society maintains its office in Rio de Janeiro. The work there is carried on chiefly in the Portuguese language. There are nine small classes in the vicinity. Public meetings during the year have totaled 65, with an attendance of 1,885; total class meetings, 935, with a total attendance of 11,806. Four have symbolized their consecration during the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In addition to the Portuguese language, there are a few small classes of Hungarian brethren. Some of the brethren in Sao Paulo are engaged in the pioneer colporteur service. Not very many of the brethren have engaged in the active field service work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Society installed a small printing press at this depot, and on this press </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower</span><span class="font6"> in the Portuguese is printed; also a number of booklets have been printed. During the year there have been 1,983 copies of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower</span><span class="font6"> and 121,600 free tracts printed and distributed. Books and booklets distributed from this office totaled 3,507. It seems that in a great country such as Brazil a larger witness work should be carried on, but we are pleased to know the Lord is blessing the efforts of the brethren who are at work. These are zealous and earnest, and doing with their might what they can. Doubtless the Lord will open a wider door of opportunity if it is his will.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark205"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark206"></a>BRITAIN</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">Aside from the American office, the British branch at London is the longest in service. It is gratifying, in looking over the years passed, to note that for sev-era! years there has been a continuous increase of the work in that land. The year ending September 30, 1928, shows the most splendid results. No previous report has even approached it, much less equaled it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Then it must be, indeed, that the British friends who are in the present truth are zealous for the Lord. The number subscribing for </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower</span><span class="font6"> is less. This in no wise hinders the Lord’s work from going grandly on. The time was when canvassing for books by the classes on Sunday mornings would have been thought improper. Not so now. The British brethren have come to realize that going from door to door calling upon the people is preaching the gospel and that each one who thus goes has a part in fulfilling the commission which God has given to those that love him. The number of classes throughout the land is small, and the number of each class comparatively small, yet the work shows a greater effort put forth and greater results than heretofore.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During the fiscal year ending September 30, the facts show that 386 classes have engaged in the field service. In that land canvassing permits are issued by the Government. Such permits were obtained by 5,991 brethren. Those engaged in calling at the homes made the aggregate number of 5,618,452 calls. That was more than double the number of calls made in any previous year. Truly the gospel is being preached in the land of the British Isles in harmony with the Lord’s co</span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">mmandm</span><span class="font6">ent given to his people. The anointed everywhere will take a keen delight in perusing the report of the activities of the brethren during the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The manager of the British office at London has submitted a detailed report. It speaks for itself, and nothing better can be done than to quote from it as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">It Is </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">a.</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> great pleasure to be able to send a report which shows a large Increase in the activities </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">of</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> the brethren In Great Britain and In Ireland, and the consequent Increase in the literature placed In the hands of the people. When reporting to you last year that there was then a very considerable Increase on the previous year, 1926, I expressed the belief that though the country was entering Into a time of money pressure, yet the outlook for the service of witnessing to the Lord by the brethren who engaged In the service work and by the colporteurs was quite good. That has proved to be so, but the output for the year just concluded exceeded all expectations. Whereas last year's output was 752,071 books and booklets, this year the figure Is 2,496,149, or more than three times as many. Of these, 1,281,000 are </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Freedom</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> booklets; but apart from these the Increase is 463,078. For these figures, which Indicate so much of zeal on the part of the brethren, and also tell of a witness to the establishment of the kingdom of our God and of his Christ, we thank God. Unquestionably this great work has been done because the brethren have realized more than ever the privilege of being colaborers with God in his work of establishing his kingdom, and that It Is part of his great purpose to do his work by means of the people which he has drawn to himself, a people formed for his name, his servant class. And a clearer realization of this has meant a better understanding of the fact that Jehovah has himself organized this service under the Lord whom he has appointed. This has resulted In the brethren’s holding themselves more ready to learn the best ways of doing the Lord's service and In their placing themselves under guidance to that end. There is more of the spirit of unity, more of a realization that the church is one body set apart by the Lord for his work and tl&gt;at he has his own means of guiding his work. The number of workers has not greatly Increased ;</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">but their zeal and activity and their readiness to seize opportunities have increased, and all this has meant Increased ability in service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">SERVICE WORK</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Naturally the larger portion of this total of nearly 2,500,000 books has gone to the people through the class service work. There are 386 classes tn the British field organized for service, with 5,991 registered workers. The result of their sales is 1,678,124 books, over 1,200,000 of an Increase on last year’s figures. The number of calls these brethren have made Is 5,618,452, an increase of 3,000,000 calls over last year. As in the class territory there is a population of about 26,000,000 persons, this represents abont 5,500,000 homes. The calls made show on average an actual canvass at each home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">The number of classes on our books, large and small, is 452: some are quite small and some are new, but the difference between the number of classes actively engaged (386) and the total number shows that there is yet both privilege and opportunity not being taken up. We are doing all we can to help the brethren to realize their privilege of service for him who has called us out of darkness into his marvelous light, that as children of light there may be a witness given to him, and to bring the brethren to realize the duty that lies upon every one who has been favored by God with a knowledge of the truth and with the privilege of serving him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">The members of the Bethel family have enjoyed their share In the service. During the year they have made 38,163 calls and sold 13,598 books and booklets. This Is twice as many calls and sales as last year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">The Sunday morning service Is not only much enjoyed by all the brethren, but has proved to be one of the best times of the week, both for actual sales and for getting In touch with the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">COLPORTEUR SERVICE</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">The colporteur report Is very good. There Is no Increase In the number engaged In the service (at present the number of whole-time colporteurs Is 201), but there Is a very considerable Increase in the output. The number of books sold last year, 257,425, has been about doubled this year, the figure standing at 503,381. What is true of the class service work Is true of the colporteur service. The brethren are constantly gaining In ability in doing the Lord's work, and besides this, the colporteurs are looking at the service as a regular business and are putting more time Into the work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">For a considerable portion of the year we have had special canvassing parties In the larger cities, paying attention to the business centers, and the work has been very productive. The brethren are quite expert In selling full sets of books. It is evident that there Is a very considerable opportunity of service in this direction, and this phase of the work Is being pushed. Good colporteur work has been done In Ireland, more particularly In the northern counties. There the Irish people buy the books readily If they have money, but it Is almost Impossible to establish meetings. In the Free State we have found work very difficult. It has been almost impossible to hold meetings, but the colporteurs have been working with a measure of success. The people of the Free State are too much under the direction of the priests and are too steeped In their religious beliefs to listen to the truth or to purchase the books, and In some cases the colporteurs have been ill-treated and some of the books burnt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">The Pilgrim service, now known as the Lecture service, Is quite small. Only four brethren are engaged all the time; another gives about a half-month’s service per month. These brethren have made 1,132 visits, and the attendance at the meetings has been 38,412 persons. Besides these the Bethel office brethren have made 282 visits, with an attendance of 7,717 persons. The time of the pilgrims Is mainly spent In helping the classes to more active service, and evidently to the advantage of the work of the Lord. It Is found to be much more profitable for the brethren of the class visited to go out In the afternoon with the pilgrim In service work, than to sit In an often drowsy meeting listening to an exhortation. The </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Towers</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> clearly provide the necessary ex-hortatlon, and it is evident that the Lord’s time has come for those who know his truth to carry It abroad to all who have ears to hear, and as a witness against those who oppose themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">PUBLIC WITNESS</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">There has been but little done In the public witness service. The special corps of brethren who were out In the country witness work Is now almost disbanded. All together, 1,273 meetings have been held in the north of Ireland, with an attendance of only 18,192 persons; but from these and the resultant canvass 17,224 books were sold.</span></p>

These sold rapidly, and the brethren are anxiously waiting the opportunity of passing forward their message to the people. This is true also of the new booklet, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Peoples Friend.</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> Tomorrow we expect to receive our first consignment. The brethren are ready to put these also in the hands of the people, and we shall make a very special effort during the times which have been allocated to the distribution of the booklet. I know how pressed you have been at the factory, but we hope that our supplies may arrive in time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">It Is plainly seen that it is by the newer books that the message of present truth is to be carried to the people. The foundation for the work was laid In the past: now the message Is pointed. We thank the Lord for the later books and their enlightenment and comfort, and for the urge they contain In themselves to witness to the honor of Jehovah's name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">OONVENTIONS</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Conventions have been held during the year In Belfast, Bristol, Liverpool, Edinburgh, Glasgow. They all proved to be a helpful time to the brethren, and at each of them the service work was kept In prominence. The convention In Glasgow, which was held at the end of September, proved to be a real stimulus to the brethren as they realized Jehovah's purpose in bringing his people Into a unity, and that he not only had pnt his spirit into the hearts of his people to do his work, but had made full preparation for their needs to be supplied that they might have that wherewith to minister to the people. The great work done at beadquarters In Brooklyn, and the provision Jehovah has made In the establishment of the office and factory there, were emphasized. It was realized that all these preparations were not of men, nor by men in the sense of being a human organization, but were of the Lord through those whom he had raised up to do his work. It was with an evident burst of pleasure the convention there sent love and good wishes to you In your work for the Lord. On the service days at the conventions 2,812 brethren took part, and 7,758 books were sold.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">There is no great change in the general outlook in the country as compared with last year. The country holds on its way with an apparent measure of prosperity; but there is much poverty, and the great Industries are suffering; indeed, many of the big concerns are losing money, being unable to hold their own in world competition. There is at the present time a dullness in political affairs, and there is no man In prominence In the country who commands general confidence. It seems as if the Lord bad arranged to give bls people a time of service, comparatively quiet from political or stirring social events; so that, though there Is nothing of note to help the brethren to sell the books, at the same time there is freedom from conditions which prevent sales. This means, then, that by constant service and close appreciation of the privilege of being a minister for Jehovah, the brethren can serve him to their own advantage, and to the good of the people, and to the glory of Jehovah's name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">The best outside help in pointing the need for a guide to the people is in the deplorable condition of organized religion. The Church of England, which taught the world to sing “Onward, Christian Soldiers”, and said, “We are not divided,” Is being torn asunder by Internal dissension. To the surprise of many the division over the use of the new prayer-book has brought to light another dissension. The Anglo-Catholic section, leaning to Romanism, is, like Rome, averse to Modernism, and for the same reason, namely, fear of removing the foundations of the church. All this open division is breaking down the influence of that church. The Nonconformists are not Increasing in Influence, and this gives the messenger of the kingdom a good opportunity to tell of the coming of the King and the blessings of the kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">The Bethel family rejoices in its privilege of service. It has been kept busy with the constant receipt and dispatch of the books which now come to us so easily (and so carefully packed) from headquarters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">As we have not been privileged to have you with ns in Britain during this year, the brethren are quite expectant that we shall be favored with a visit as early as possible next year. There Is no doubt that your presence always brings a great stimulus to the work, and speaking as your representative and on behalf of the brethren I would urge that you pay us a visit for a general convention as early as you can find it convenient to do so.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">In British Guiana those who are really devoted to the Lord are few in number, but this in no wise deters them in their faithfulness and service. From the local manager’s report the following is quoted:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">The Father's guidance and loving care, however, has been continually manifest In all our affairs, and for this we desire to express our gratitude.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Our Sunday canvass (no longer confined to the morning hours, but frequently lasting for the greater part of the day) continues to prove our best working time. The friends who take part In these drives are encouraged and refreshed from week to week, and the public Interest Is Just as great, though the extreme poverty on all sides is appalling.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">During the Easter holidays we again visited the county of Berblce (twenty workers leaving the city), and In four days we put out 1,000 </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Creation</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> and 1,200 booklets. We had hoped to repeat this witness again this year, but have not succeeded in making arrangements up to the present.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark225"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark226"></a>CANADA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">During the fiscal year the work in Canada has been carried on in the spirit of the Lord. The local manager says: ‘ ‘ The Lord has added his blessing with the result that the greatest witness for the truth ever given in this land has been made. Praise ye the Lord! ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Devil’s organization is strong in that land and very active, but this has in no wise deterred the brethren from putting forth their best endeavors. On the contrary, it has spurred them on to greater efforts. The enemy succeeded in preventing our radio stations from broadcasting. It is so manifest that this action was taken contrary to the wishes of the people that it has stirred up a great desire amongst the people to know more about the truth. We may expect the Lord to overrule this to his glory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During the year the Society has placed in the field several automobiles arranged in the form of a house for living in, and these have proved so advantageous that arrangements are being made to put others in. In order to reach the people along the shores of Newfoundland a boat has been purchased and manned, and this also is in the service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The local manager’s report well covers the ground, and the following is quoted from it:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">The past year has been one of tremendous activity In the service of our King, resulting In what of course must be expected, a tremendous struggle between the forces of truth and the forces of darkness. Satan has put forth strenuous efforts to stop the flood of truth sweeping over the earth, and while upon the surface he may appear to succeed In curtailing one activity, others break forth in lieu thereof; the Lord’s arm is not shortened.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">RADIO</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">One Instrument of the Lord In the hands of his people In this land was the witness by means of radio. This service was being carried on energetically from coast to coast and a mighty witness given, which witness (so far as radio In Canada Is concerned) appears to have reached a climax In the public lecture delivered by you at the general convention In Toronto In 1927. From that time on the antagonism of the clergy class became more and more manifest and, when we saw that the Government was inclined to give a hearing ear to their desire to curtail our radio activities, we immediately commenced an energetic campaign In the hope of offsetting their influence. This campaign was engaged In by all the fully consecrated throughout Canada, including the colporteurs, and took the following form:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Firit:</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> We had printed a petition addressed to the Premier of Canada, calling upon him to give no heed to the protest of the clergy and others but to give every encouragement to the I. B. S. A. to continue their programs of music, education and Biblical instruction. This petition </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">was </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">signed by 466,938 citizens of Canada and In due course was presented in the House of Parliament.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Second:</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> The public and interested were Invited by various means to write the Premier, the Minister In charge of radio, and In particular the Member of Parliament for their own constituency, protesting against the Government’s action and calling upon their own members to oppose same. The result was that all members were flooded with correspondence expressing indignation and protesting at the thought of the Government's considering the refusal to renew the licenses of the I. B. S. A.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Third:</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> Mass meetings were arranged and held from coast to coast, addressed by representatives of the Society and various influential citizens of Canada, at which meetings resolutions of protest were presented and almost invariably unanimously adopted. These were addressed to the Premier and in due course forwarded to him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Fourth:</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> In addition thereto I had prepared and presented to each Member of Parliament a statement of facts in regard to the whole situation, and also a further statement In reply to the excuses that were given by the Minister of Marine and Fisheries, for his contemplated action.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Fifth:</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> To the end that any member desiring further Information might have same, personal Interviews were arranged, and, in addition thereto, I had two long conferences with Mr. Cardin, the Minister of Marine and Fisheries. Inasmuch as he had no justification for his action whatsoever he was very much embarrassed throughout. He said he had acted upon the presentation of the matter by his deputy and that now in the face of our discussion he was going to thoroughly investigate the matter for himself; that if he found he was unjust, unfair, he hoped to be big enough to change the matter and give his deputy orders to that effect; that a further cabinet meeting was to be held In connection therewith and that he would report to me the outcome in the course of a few days. He has not been true to bls word. He has never reported to me the outcome of the discussion with the cabinet; and inasmuch as he has no just cause for his action (as you know and as I know), he has therefore been further untrue to his promise, for he has not called upon bls deputy to Issue licenses. Cardin himself stated he was not influenced by the Roman Catholic Church. That may or may not be true; but at any rate I am fully persuaded that Johnston, his deputy, was and is but a tool of the hierarchy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Despite this enormous petition and tremendous protest of the people of Canada, the Government autocratically and arrogantly carried out Its policy and refused to renew our licenses, with the result that the first day the stations were oft the air the Premier was flooded with telegrams of protest and, according to the press report, received over fifteen hundred that day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">As a result of the protests of the various members of Parliament, the Department was called upon to table the correspondence received by it in the way of complaints upon which they claimed they based their action. When this correspondence was tabled It was revealed that all told they had received but 119 Items, Including letters, newspaper clippings, etc., in regard to our stations over a period of four years’ activities In radio. Many of these were from their own Inspectors, some favorable, some unfavorable ; forty-four letters were In regard to our broadcasting’s Interfering with the reception of programs from other stations (a complaint common to all stations) ; seventeen letters and a petition signed by 199 Individuals were direct complaints against the nature of our programs and, in particular, the Biblical interpretations presented by the speakers; and the others were of a miscellaneous nature as to being too frequently on the air, etc. On the other </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">bun</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">d the Department had received thousands and thousands of letters expressing approval of the programs and pleasure therein.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">In due course the matter was debated in the House, and not one member of Parliament, other than the Minister </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">hims</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">elf, spoke in favor of the Government's action, but, on the contrary, spoke very scathingly thereof. The debate occupied approximately two days, and as a result the</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Government has been forced to appoint a radio commission to Investigate the whole matter of radio.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">The fight Is by no means over, and It Is our intention to extend the campaign further upon a tremendous scale during the coming session of the House, flooding the country with literature and laying before the people the facts in connection therewith, Including the full text of the debate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">While our own four stations are closed down for the present, we are still broadcasting in this land over eight other stations that we have hired, five of which we broadcast over every Sunday.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">It seems to me, from results as hereinafter outlined, that. Instead of Satan's stemming the flow of truth by his action, he has created a greater Interest therein than ever before manifest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">HOUSE-CABS</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">The friends throughout the land, realizing the tremendous Interest that had been awakened, were feverishly desirous of taking full advantage thereof. The suggestion was made that the classes In various districts cooperate In putting into service house-cars fully manned with brethren and well supplied with books and literature. After consideration the Society agreed to construct the cars for the different districts and finance them until such time as the classes were able to reimburse the Society In connection therewith. The result has been that eleven house-cars were put Into the service. The Society placed In charge of each car a captain or driver, and then volunteers from the classes manned the cars. The director of the largest class in each district was appointed house-car director, applications for service were made to him, and he arranged to place the brethren in such a way as to most suitably fit in with their vacation periods.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">The results have been excellent. While the cars have been In actual operation for only an average of approximately three months, 37,014 books and booklets have been sold, of which almost fifty percent were bound volumes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">It might be mentioned that these cars are fully equipped with every accommodation for Bleeping, as well as for caring for the meals of those in the service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Plans as authorized by you are now under way for the construction of more house-cars, not only for the classes but also for the colporteurs, and It Is our hope to have a large number of cars sweeping the country from coast to coast during 1929.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">I would like to tell you of the many wonderful experiences that the friends have had and of the many advantages of these house-cars, as told by the friends, but time will not permit. However, I will take the space to quote from two or three letters:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;One thing was brought out very clearly in the work, and that is the great advantage of the house-car as a means of reaching the greatest number of people In the shortest time, at minimum expense. Additionally, the territory where the car worked has been canvassed many times; but still there Is room, and the way has been prepared for the message, It is a wonderful and economical way to bear witness to the truth in the scattered territory, and these cars seem to fill a long-felt wont.”—Geo. Young.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;During all of last month the house-car has been working In territory very sparsely settled, operating under what would ordinarily be considered great hardships. Real roads are so few and the homes often so scattered that thirty calls make a long day’s work. In spite of these things the brethren who have been out are all very enthusiastic about this feature of the Lord’s work. We find Sunday the best day to work and have had very few objections.”—Geo. P. Naish.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot; ‘More cars and more workers’ should be our slogan, and must be if the witness is to be effective. I am assured that never has a better work been done than that at present being performed by these cars, and still there is room for more. Surely our heavenly Father is abundant in his goodness In providing such full and free opportunities for the glorification of his name. I can only see the need for more cars, and pray that the Lnrd will supply that need. All the workers hre most enthusiastic and ask only for further opportunities.”—Geo. A. Ware.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">SCHOOL TEAMS</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">The house-car work Is taking, to a large degree, the place of the school team service. This year we had only two cars In the school team work, but these teams have done excellent work. They have not held as many meetings as In previous years, directing their efforts more particularly to the canvassing feature The total sales of books and booklets amounted to 14,928.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">COLPOBTEUBS</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">The number of colporteurs in the Held has averaged only fifty. It is regrettable to note that so few are engaged In this noble feature of the Lord’s service. Those who have been engaged therein, however, have given a good account of themselves, having placed during the year 139,792 books. In their service they have had much Indeed to contend with; particularly Is this true In regard to the activity in the Province of Quebec. There the opposition of the Catholic clergy continues In no uncertain way. Time and again the brethren have been arrested, cast Into prison, balled out, the cases fought, and, by the Lord’s grace, the victory won. In fact, in every case thus far the decision of the courts has been In favor of the colporteurs. So we have much to be thankful for.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">NEWFOUNDLAND WORK</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">To the end that a greater witness might be made In Newfoundland, Brother J. D. MacLennan, of Glace Bay, was sent over there to take charge of the work In that land. Owing to the fact that the greater bulk of the people live along the coast line and are Inaccessible by railway, Inasmuch as the railroad runs through more or less the center of the country and the highways are not such as to allow serving by automobile, a boat was purchased to care for the work In the outlying territory. It is a boat 55 feet long, 11) feet beam, 7 feet high, 34 tons gross. I had hoped that this boat would be In service In May, but owing to Brother MacLennan's being very seriously </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">sick </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">for several weeks and then, further, one or two becoming traitors to their trust, the boat was held up until July; but I am glad to report that after It did get Into action the results were very encouraging, 2,411 books having been placed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Inasmuch as we could not get a brother in the truth qualified to serve as engineer, we had to hire a man outside, and these delays cost money. The total expense In connection with the operation of the boat amounted to $850.71, showing a net loss of $557.71. This, of course, was quite disappointing. However, a beginning has been made and the witness given, and I look to the Lord to overrule and bless all to redound to his praise and glory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">I am happy to report that for next year I have arranged for two brethren to go over from Canada, one a qualified engineer who has been in the colporteur service in Western Canada for some time and who is thoroughly acquainted with Newfoundland, having been bom there and engaged in the seafaring business in and around that country for some years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">REGIONAL SERVICE DIRECTORS</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">The abandoning of the pilgrim department and the inauguration of that of the regional service directors has proven to be an excellent change. In place of the pilgrims’ admonishing the brethren to activity In the service, yet staying at home themselves, they too are now leading the forces In their active service work. In place of saying &quot;Go” they are saying &quot;Come”. This has resulted In great encouragement to the friends everywhere. The example is good and the Lord will bless those who are faithfully setting a proper example to the workers—an example of active service accompanied with an enthusiasm based upon faith in and love for the Lord’s cause.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Bvery one of the Lord’s people now Is active. 7%e faithfulness and zeal of the Lord’s people, prompted by their</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">love for Jehovah and his cause, Is catching, and this Is reflected In no uncertain way In the wondeiful results that have been obtained In this field of activity during the past year. While still some may doubt that we have passed from the Elijah phase of the church’s activity Into that of Elisha, and that the Lord has in very fact poured forth a double portion of his spirit upon his people, those who are abiding in the secret place of the Most High and who are ‘walking in the light as he is in the light’ are in no doubt upon the point. Of course all recognize that success is in itself no evidence of the Lord’s favor or approval, but when one knows clearly from the Lord’s Word that the work he is engaged In is the work of God in the earth, and then sees that work prospering In his hands, he knows that the Lord’s blessing is attending his efforts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">The great change of the work from the Elijah phase to the Elisha phase, and the pouring forth of a double portion of the Lord's spirit upon his people’s efforts, is Impressively revealed by making comparison between the results attending the efforts of God's people in the earth in 1918 as compared with 1928. The following comparison shows what has taken place in this land, and I know that what has taken place here is simply an illustration of what has taken place the world over. It might be well also to bear In mind that these excellent results were obtained despite the fact that the Lord's people were engaged for six weeks of the year in the petition campaign work, and during that time few books were placed in the hands of the people.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">FOREIGN</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">FRENCH WORK</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">The witness among the French people is gradually Increasing as the prejudice is being broken down. A considerable increase has taken place this year in the amount of French literature placed in the hands of the people, as compared with previous years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">UKRAINIAN WORK</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">In addition to Brother Zarysky and other brethren serving as representatives of the Society in visiting the classes, we have had In the service one school team. Owing to the poverty of these people, however, and to the fact that they are so scattered, it has been a difficult service to perform; and while the results have not been great, they have been considerable, and we trust that the Lord’s blessing will rest thereon. This work has been included herein under the heading “School Teams”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">In accordance with your authorization, arrangements have now been completed for the Ukrainian work to be organized with an office in Winnipeg, under the direction of Brother Zarysky, and we hope that it will result In giving a greater witness to the people of the Ukrainian tongue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">GERMAN WORK</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">While an effort was put forth to arrange for a more active campaign among the German people during the year, little In fact was done. It had been our hope to arrange for a school team to work among the people of the German tongue, but this we have failed to do. The Lord has raised up none who are qualified to serve as permanent workers, but In his providence a one-day convention was held in southern Saskatchewan, and his blessing was poured out upon them on that occasion. During a portion of the year one brother was sent forth, and the friends were much encouraged by his services.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">CONVENTIONS</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">All told, arrangements were completed for fourteen conventions. Qf this number nine were for the English brethren and five for the foreign. They were service conventions, and the Lord blessed them to the end that a good witness was given by his people upon each occasion. All went away strengthened and refreshed, and we trust the conventions have resulted in much good.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">In view of the results obtained It Is hardly necessary to state that the friends throughout this land are In a very healthy condition spiritually. They are more united today than ever before in the history of the church. There have, of course, been some local troubles in different ecclesias, and one or two divisions. This, however, is no more than we should expect. The facts show that the zeal of the Lord and the Joy of the Lord go hand in hand- The Lord's people are happy and Joyful In his service, loving to spend and be spent in singing forth the honor of his name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">In this service we have all been greatly strengthened and helped by the wonderful articles that have come forth in </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower.</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> Truly the Lord has richly blessed you in your service, and us through you. May his blessing continue to abide with you and abound I</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">The office and factory staff here have had a great amount of work to do and have been happy in that. They have faithfully done with their might what their hand has found to do.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">It will be seen that the subscriptions for </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> are fewer, and the actual workers in the field fewer; yet there were more books and booklets put In the hands of the people during the year by 289,417 copies than during the previous year. This reminds us of the words of Jesus: &quot;For unto every one that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath.&quot; (Matt 25 : 29) The Lord's work will go on to a completion and to his glory.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark227"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark228"></a>COLORED</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Some wonder at times why there is &amp;&nbsp;Colored branch. This is not because there is any difference between the white and the colored brethren. The real </span><span class="font6">reason is to afford our colored brethren a better opportunity to meet the people of their own race and to interest them in the Lord’s work. When there is a convention for the consecrated the colored brethren meet with the white, of course.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The brother who has charge of this work in America is in fact a service director. He travels from place to place organizing the classes and encouraging them, and shows them the great advantage of service. The work during the year has been progressing and has had the Lord’s blessing. From the report of the field service director, Brother Banks, the following is quoted:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">The conditions afield are little different from those of last year. True there are some who are not walking with us this year, and this seems to Indicate a continued test of “faithfulness” (Hab. 2:4). But the causes of the divergence are not doctrinal differences, but rather a slowing down as a result of lack of spiritual vision on the part of those who are looking with a longing eye upon the material things, and who possibly never have seen the unfolding of the heavenly things &quot;prepared for the remnant”. Again there are some who have given evidences of divine favor in the past, and who have been so saturated with the knowledge of the truth prior to the present test of service, just as a sponge would be saturated for the purpose of watering plants or growing flowers. These were &quot;so happy they did not know what to do”. Now that we see with a clearer light what Is the will of the Lord; when the light of the moon has become as the light of the sun, and the sun Is sevenfold, as the light of seven days, there Is now a delight In squeezing the sponge and In carrying the good news of the kingdom to the benighted &quot;multitudes In the valley of decision”; and now we are so happy that we DO know what to do and have the privilege of doing It, and this brings additional joy. To eat and drink at the Master’s table In the Lord's house appears to be conditional, as when In colonial days the “Those who will not work may not eat&quot; rule was In vogue. To serve the Lord with gladness, to wear the “wedding garment”, Is now understood and practised by some more than by others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">All classes and Individuals making service essential to their faith (fulness) are those who see eye to eye and have little or no time for dissensions or quarrels. These are satisfied with their portion and are generous enough to wish the same for others and labor to give expressions In deeds for their highest good. But, on the other hand, where there Is quarreling and strife for advantage, the spirit of service is quenched.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">The literature appears to be one of the things &quot;prepared”, as It serves as a means of gaining admittance to the homes and an Introduction to the Inmates many of whom would spurn the Idea of receiving a message from others than those who have been prepared at one or another of the theological grist-mills; and before they realize It they have the witness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">It Is with concerted effort of late that the denominational men canvass to warn the people against the literature and to prevent It from getting Into the churches. This is in sharp contrast with the opportunities afforded last year, but there are still some of them open to us. We could not expect them to be otherwise than hostile, If the witness is given uncompromisingly. In canvassing in a certain city in Ohio, out of fifty homes I found only one who spoke favorably of the church and Its system of government. In view of this fact It seems apparent that the breach is widening, thus giving the message of truth prominence by Its separateness from other teachings in the minds of the people, and to the chagrin of the clergy who have no place to flee. The battle Is the Lord's, and we are his servants, delighting to push the fight to the gates of his enemies (and ours) (Ps. 139:20-24), in defending the honor of bls name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">In the last three or four months particularly, the visits bave been for three days, and with more time for field canvassing, holding meetings at night only. We have spent</span></p>

<p><a name="bookmark229"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">CZECHOSLOVAKIA</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In Czechoslovakia the work is making progress. The Society maintains a house or depot at Brunn and also a small depot at Kosiee. These have been recently acquired to aid in carrying on the work. The literature and books are kept in stock at these points that they may be put out amongst the people. There has been much opposition against the truth on the part of the government, incited by the Catholics, and yet the message continues to go forth. During the year a number of the brethren were arrested and imprisoned, and others fined, for canvassing amongst the people for the books. Therefore the colporteurs work under a great handicap because of the governmental opposition. The common people, however, are liberty-loving and love the truth and are anxious to have it. Two German brethren have traveled through the country this year and aided much in organizing the work. As an evidence of the progress of the work in that country, last year 26,894 books and booklets were put in the hands of the people; whereas in 1928 the number was 64,483. During the year 2,000 meetings were held throughout that land, with total attendance of about 40,000 persona. Twenty-five thousand copies of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower</span><span class="font6"> and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age </span><span class="font6">were put in the hands of the people; also about 75,000 tracts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Like everywhere else in “Christendom” the truth is opposed by Satan’s organization; but notwithstanding the opposition, the brethren faithfully press on.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark230"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark231"></a>NORTHERN EUROPEAN OFFICE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">The Society maintains at Copenhagen, Denmark, a general office under the supervision of a brother. This office has jurisdiction over Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Lithuania, Latvia and Esthonia. While there is a local manager in each one of these countries, the Northern European Office serves as a clearing house for the above countries. The output of books during the year in these countries totaled 104,752; booklets including </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Freedom for the Peoples </span><span class="font6">booklet totaled 1,060,664. The output would have been greater except for inability to get the books from the printer in time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In transmitting the general report covering these countries, Brother Dey of the Northern European Office says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">The outstanding feature of the year was the message of </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Freedom</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> and the way It went out In two weeks 206,504 were sold and our order for half a million had to be increased by 150,000. In Finland particularly It attracted attention In the press, and a professor also spread himself In Norway. He was dealt with faithfully both In the press and In </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Golden Age.</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> In Finland also a good witness was given. The booklet was well received. A. university professor Ln Copenhagen remarked to the worker who brought his, “So this is the 10 ore booklet I have beard so much of. I am glad you have called with my copy.” In another instance a communist called to get the books advertised. &quot;Rutherford is a bold man,” he said, &quot;how many of these booklets have you spread?” On being told 100,000 had already gone in Denmark, he continued, “My goodness, it is enough to cause a revolution!&quot; At all events it will open many peoples' eyes and prepare them for more. There have never been so many postal requests for the books advertised.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Last year 73 colporteurs and 42 auxiliaries put out 167,914, but this year 86 colporteurs and 60 auxiliaries managed 379,800. Of these, 41,669 were books and 110,961 were </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Freedom.</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> The classes spread 624,606, while public meetings and office sales accounted for the balance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">In the May IBSA week, 1,441 took part and spread 9,652 books and 37,726 booklets; total, 47,378. In the August effort 1,501 took part and sold 8,267 books and 74,580 booklets; total, 82,847. In each case these efforts succeeded </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Freedom </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">campaigns, so the brethren were “faint yet pursuing”. Additionally, in August, at the month end there was little money. The result was not so good as last year, on that account.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">In Northern Europe 3,471 partook of the memorial; but the average out each week, though ten more than last year, was only 780. There is a large disparity between 3,471 and 780 and the “Where Are the Nine?” leaflet issued by the Society was a searching reminder to each of the consecrated as to his responsibility as part of “that servant” at this time. Again our Lord says: &quot;Where are the nine?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">In the Baltic States this year 111,470 books went out of office as against 48,602 last year. The number of brethren out each week was only 41 in all three countries. Nevertheless, they actually sold a total of 99,377. Of course It is not always a disadvantage not to know the language. In Esthoma an English brother newly out from London sold 576 in IBSA Week. It Is encouraging to see so much accomplished by so few. The territory is fruitful, and one can gather some Idea of why the Devil’s organization Is so anxious to keep us out of Soviet Russia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">More and more the managers are considering how the organization of the work can be improved, and we find the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Bulletins</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> and suggestions from headquarters very helpful to that end. As the brethren come to see more clearly the hideousness of the Devil’s organization they are desirous of being more closely associated with God's organization. In many places the brethren prefer talks to </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Tower</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> studies and sometimes the pilgrims give talks. Nevertheless, an earnest endeavor Is being made to have all the brethren appreciate the brilliant and frequent flashes of light our Lord himself Is giving us from his temple. As their appreciation Increases, so in like ratio does their desire to spend and be spent In the Lord’s service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Many conventions have been arranged In the various countries and these have been much blessed to all participating therein. In each case service has been engaged In, and on such occasions the Lord seems to pour out a special blessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">We were glad to have the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Messenger</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> reports of the Detroit Convention, and surely the thrill therefrom will be felt all around the earth. There will be a renewed determination on the part of the brethren everywhere to go forward shoulder to shoulder against the Devil's organization. We are confident this will be reflected In next year’s reports from Northern Europe.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark232"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark233"></a>DENMARK</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">The Lord’s anointed in Denmark continue to show the zeal peculiar to his house. Small in number but strong in the Lord, they press on in the work. During the year they have placed in the hands of the people 21,834 bound books, and booklets to the number of 222,715. When we take into consideration the great scarcity of money in that little country, this is a remarkably good showing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The number of classes has increased by eleven, and nine more classes have organized for the service. The total number of class workers has increased by sixtyseven. Only two were giving their entire time to the colporteur service, and seven to the auxiliary colporteur service. During the year there has been a decrease in subscriptions for </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower,</span><span class="font6"> but an increase in the subscriptions for </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">From the local manager’s report the following is quoted :</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">The workers have generally manifested real joy in the work. Some who have not felt any joy in this way of proclaiming the kingdom have dropped out of our ranks, but others come to appreciate it more and more and are sometimes able to relate inspiring incidents met with in connection with their efforts. We are longing for closer fellowship with our glorious Head and to be more conformed to his Image and to be better fitted for bls service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Two conventions have been held during the year, a small one in a city In Jutland, at Easter, and our yearly convention in Copenhagen, in August. Both were surely the means of encouraging the friends, and service days were arranged for In connection with each. At the first one twenty-eight symbolized their consecration; at the latter, twenty-one. Besides these conventions, smaller one-day conventions have been held in several places during the year.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark234"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark235"></a>ESTHONIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">In Esthonia the work makes slow but steady progress. The brethren there are small in number but zealous in the Lord’s work. Only two classes in that land are organized for service, and six in the service work. There is an average number of four in the work each week, and one in the pilgrim service. During the year 116 meetings have been held for the friends, with a total attendance of 930; and 24 public meetings, with an attendance of 5,854. In addition to the class workers, there are three whole-time colporteurs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At the depot, letters received totaled 297; and letters dispatched, 320. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletins</span><span class="font6"> to the number of 220 have been sent out. In communicating the report the local brother says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Looking back over the past year we have cause for rejoicing In the great things which the Lord has done for us as we have sought to sing forth the honor of his name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Last year the total number of books sent out from the office was just over 10,000. This year It Is well over 20,000. We are aiming higher for the year upon which we are now entering.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Sometimes It seems such a big job to get the kingdom witness effectively given with only a handful of workers; but, on the other hand, we have many evidences of the Lord’s blessing and assurances that he Is leading in this fight The people are beginning to sit up and take notice. They are realizing that the Lord has a remnant here who are going to send this good news broadcast throughout the land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">During the year our operations have been mainly in the towns, although our two Finnish colporteur sisters have managed during the summer to work many of the villages served by the* railway or steamboats. We are making plans to get much of the rural territory worked during the coming year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">We have had much help from Finland, several Finnish brethren having come across to assist in the work. Some have been able to spend only a short time here, but it helped to carry the truth to parts which otherwise would not have been touched.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">The first Esthonian convention was held in Reval, in June, and a wonderful time It was. There were twenty-five present, and in the work we sold over 500 books. At the convention four of the brethren were baptized.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Public meetings have been held In various towns, and in all places the attendances have been good and much interest manifested by the people Brother Dey spoke at many of these, while two lectures were given by Brother Harteva in Esperanto with interpretation Into Esthonian.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">COLPOBTEUBS</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">The arrangement you made for getting two colporteur brothers from Britain has proved good. These brothers will soon be working in the southeast part of Esthonla, which up to the present has not been touched. In this district the Russian-speaking people outnumber the Esthonlans We watch with interest the effect of the message there. In conclusion, let me assure you the morale of the Lord’s army here Is good; we want to push on and win through.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark236"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark237"></a>FINLAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">In the far-away land of Finland the message of the kingdom still continues to go forth to the Lord’s glory. During the year thirty-two local conventions have been held; with a total attendance of 2,659. Of this number, 1,376 took part in the field service on Service day; and the total sales amounted to 13,800 books and booklets. At these conventions eighty symbolized their consecration. These conventions were a great stimulus. Like all other parts of the earth, there is opposition there to the truth; but the zealous ones give no heed to this but press on with the work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">From the report transmitted by the local manager the following is quoted:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Formerly no one had been able to dream of such a big and marvelous witness for the truth In our country. The output of books has been so great that almost every second family In the whole country has got a copy. For that reason </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">have been able to remark to those who have refused to take our books: &quot;Last year the output was one book for every fifth family, this year the output will be one for every second family, it is only a question of time when these books will be in every home, because it is the Lord's will that all shall know the truth. And the truth Is going out with such a force that by and by all must pay attention to it” Many, advised by the clergy, have burned the books, but have afterwards bought them again. As a very characteristic feature I can mention bow one at the end of my lecture came and said: “I have already three times burned your </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Hell</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> book, but now I will buy the fourth.” So we rejoice as we see how the blessed work is going on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">As the work has been more thoroughly organized and the friends have learned better to follow the advices sent from the Office, the work has progressed wonderfully. True the great adversary has made a very strong attack, so that still more have left and some have been greatly hindered in doing the work; but the faithful ones have &quot;girded up the loins” of their mind and with the Lord's aid pressed forward, and the result has been astonishing. It is indeed the Lord’s work and not man’s.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In Finland there are sixty-seven classes, of which fifty-three are organized for the service. During the year there were 603 engaged in the service work, with an average each week of 212. There are three in the regular pilgrim service and seven others doing local work. There are twenty-seven whole-time colporteurs and fourteen auxiliary colporteurs. Letters received totaled 8,755; and letters dispatched, 11,609. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletins</span><span class="font6"> sent out, 9,273. Subscriptions for </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age </span><span class="font6">in Finnish, 11,788; Swedish, 718. Total number of copies of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font6"> sold, 346,564.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">From the above it will be seen that the total sale of books and booklets during the year was 276,559. This makes a good showing for that small country, and we rejoice with our brethren in their opportunities for service.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark238"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark239"></a>FRANCE, BELGIUM AND SAAR BASIN</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">In France and Belgium there is some work carried on in the French language and another part of the work in the Polish language amongst those who live in the northern part of France. The work is more directly under the supervision of the Society’s office at Berne, Switzerland. Yet there are both French and Polish brethren in France acting as local directors. In this part of the land 300 class workers are engaged in the service, and during the year they put in the hands of the people 2,860 bound volumes and 121,554 booklets. There are seven regular colporteurs and two auxiliaries. The results of their labors during the year were 9,078 books and 27,150 booklets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Of course the Polish work in France is in addition to the above figures. There are 170 class workers amongst the Polish brethren, and these class workers during the year placed in the hands of the people bound books to the number of 3,277, booklets 31,885. During the year there were twenty-two exhibitions of the Photo Drama at which 1,196 books and 16,610 booklets were sold. Upward of thirty thousand people attended the exhibitions of the Photo Drama. Concerning the work in France and Belgium, the following excerpt is taken from the local manager’s report:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">A special effort was made with the revised Photo Drama In Northern France, Alsace-Lorraine and In the Saar Basin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">More than 30,000 people witnessed the exhibitions and thousands of books and booklets were left In the hands of the people as a result</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">At Saarbrucken, for instance, the Photo Drama was attended each day during the four exhibitions by 1,200 to 1,500 people. At Dudweller, after the hall had been hired and advertised, two clergymen prevailed upon the proprietor, a widow, to break the contract. Another hall was hired quickly. Both clergymen had warned the people from the pulpit not to attend, and on the first evening of the exhibition one of the clergymen stationed himself at the entrance of the hall that was advertised. He wore a black garb and a sad face, and tried to prevent the people from entering the hall. A brother stood near him In the garment of praise and the joy of the Lord shining in his countenance ; he kindly Invited the people to go to the new hall a little farther away. The people responded to him and not to the preacher, and filled the hall quickly; some stood outside and a thousand people listened attentively to the message of the kingdom. The speaker, in closing the exhibition on the last evening, thanked the two preachers for their help in advertising the Drama.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">In order to save expenses In many places In Northern France, the Drama was shown to Poles from five to seven o’clock and to German people from eight to ten, on the same day, and in the same hall. The brother operating the Drama machine writes: “The clergy, of course, are disturbed, but many prisoners indicate their joy as they behold how the prison doors are opening and that deliverance Is near. The Drama serves here as the artillery to fire upon the enemy bulwark in order that the Infantry, the service workers, may advance. Even If until now the message In France has been received chiefly by foreign nations, I am convinced that it is now the right time to begin a systematic work amongst the French people.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">POLISH WORK IN FRANCE</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">The work amongst the Poles has also grown during the year. Forty-eight public lectures were held, and 674 class meetings. The Poles are zealous; they do not content themselves with working In their neighborhood, but a number of classes have taken the responsibility upon themselves to reach distant territories. Seeking their own people In France many travel a hundred kilometers by bicycle and find the Poles not only in the mining sections but also in the country on farms, to give to them the message of the kingdom. Some of the Polish brethren have even begun to witness to the French and have had a marked success with the French </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Freedom</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> booklet. The Polish brethren are beginning to see the oneness of the Lord’s work and the necessity for doing the work according to the Lord’s method and organization. During the year 332 Polish brethren have symbolized their consecration by baptism. There are now about 1,000 consecrated Polish people in France. There were eight special conventions held amongst them. A brother from the Berne office was usually present.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">GEBMAN WORK IN FBANCE</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">It can be said that here also the friends are appreciating more and more the service of proclaiming the new government. In Lorraine a great deal of interest is manifested and we have organized groups of Interested ones who are served regularly by speakers from Saarbrucken and Strasbourg. In Alsace and Lorraine about 50,000 </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Freedom</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> booklets were distributed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">ITALIAN WORK IN FBANCE</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">In France there are many different nationalities. The Photo Drama has also been shown to Italians. An American Italian brother has come to France to work and he reports that he sold in less than one month 36 Volume 1, 39 copies of </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Harp,</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> 668 booklets and 12 Bibles. In two separate villages he took two subscriptions for the Italian </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Tower</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> without even having a copy with him to show them. In both cases these families had read some literature and gladly bought more books from him. He says: &quot;All these things truly Indicate that here Is an open door.&quot; One</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Italian, who by mistake attended the German exhibition of the Drama, without understanding what was said, at the close of the meeting wanted to buy a &quot;false prophet&quot; Bible to compare with the true Bible. He then bought most of the literature published in Italian and became very much interested after the Italian brother called upon him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">The Polish people have been driven out of their country and in France they are getting the truth. Mussolini drives good Italians out of his dominion and, behold, the Lord gives them the truth In France!</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">FRENCH WORK IN FRANCE</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">At the Basel conveutlon a brother In his lecture referred to the woik in France and asked the brethren assembled in convention to present the French work to the Lord, and he asked also for workers to enter the field. As a result, a number of colporteurs, including two couples, have made themselves free for the service In France and in Belgium. The Lord has opened the door and he Is fulfilling his word: &quot;I have given him for a witness to the people.”—Isa. 55“ 4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It may be said here that a plan has been formulated for a greater work m France. The Society will open an office in Paris, particularly for the work in France. The Lord builds the city, and blessed are they who now dwell in Zion and are privileged to share in his work!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">The French </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Freedom</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> booklet went out so quickly, beyond our expectation, that we had to publish three editions. The price and the condition of selling literature in France and Belgium are so favorable that a zealous, diligent worker can find a better place In the regular colporteur work than many a worker In the Devil’s organization, &quot;Bring ye all the tithes Into the storehouse [make yourselves free for the Lord to serve him with all your strength and all your time] that there may be meat In mine house, and prove me now herewith, saith the Lord of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven and pour you out a bless-</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Ing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it I&quot; “Behold, I have set before thee an open door, and no man can shut it.”—Rev. 3: 8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">BELGIUM</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Also in Belgium there are signs of growth. A small group has been formed at Brussels and has begun to be active. We expect to begin exhibitions with the Photo Drama in Brussels in November. A young couple from Holland, who also speak French, are moving- to Brussels to spend their entire time in the colporteur service.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark240"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark241"></a>GERMANY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">The results of the work in Germany for the fiscal year closed on September 30 are gratifying beyond description of words. The Lord has blessed the brethren who have put forth their efforts, and, notwithstanding a great amount of opposition, the work has gone grandly on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It will be remembered that the Society has a printing establishment and book-making factory at Magdeburg, Germany, It became necessary during the year to remove an old building on the grounds and erect a three-story reinforced concrete building. This is about completed and the machines are being installed. The entire first floor is occupied as a pressroom. The second story is for the color presses and composition work. The third story contains the offices. The work on this building has been done chiefly by brethren, and therefore in a very economical manner.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It was also necessary to purchase some new machines and this has been done at considerable expense, but the Lord by his grace has provided the money so that the work may be carried on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The production of this factory during the year, although hindered by building and moving machinery, is as follows, to wit: Bound books, 391,000; booklets, 7,215,000; almanac calendars, 360,000; calendars with block, 65,000; other calendars, 10,000; </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Watch Tower </span><span class="font6">and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age,</span><span class="font6"> 9,434,960; free tracts, 9,279,200.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">DISTRIBUTION</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The distribution of literature from the German headquarters during the year was as follows, to wit: Books and booklets, 6,771,388. When we call to mind that the later books, to wit, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Creation, Reconciliation </span><span class="font6">and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Government,</span><span class="font6"> are just now in process of manufacture, the above is a splendid showing. In addition to the above, there were placed in the hands of the people 930,000 copies of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower,</span><span class="font6"> 7,459,960 copies of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font6"> and 950,000 free tracts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">ORGANIZATION</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During the year 1928, 9,705 class workers engaged in the work. In addition to this, in a great campaign in regard to taxation hereinafter mentioned, the friends canvassed and obtained 1,200,000 signatures to a protest to be filed with the Government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During the year meetings were held to the number of 8,117, with an attendance of 2,187,604. From the report submitted by the local manager the following is taken:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">It is with thankfulneBs that we look back to a year of blessed opportunities in the service of our Master, and with much joy it is noted by via that, by the fact that the truth is stated In so wonderfully clear a manner in the new books and booklets published by the Society, great results could be got In all parts of the work, and that the Increasing light, given by </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower,</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> is encouraging the consecrated ones to still greater efforts In this short total report following I give a short extract of the most Interesting features of the single results:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">CONVENTIONS</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">There was no general convention this year In Germany, because the German brethren did not wish to have it without the president’s being there. Also due to want of suitable halls large enough for a greater convention, various conventions were held in several parts of Germany, to wit: In Dresden, with approximately 5,000 participants; an un-ascertalnable number of Germans took part in Basel convention, perhaps several hundred; 3,500 friends were in Berlin at convention; convention in Essen Is expected to see approximately 4,000 friends; and in Konigsberg and Danzig perhaps 500 to GOO brethren will assemble in each of those cities Further, approximately thirty one-day meetings were held in all the country during this year, with the number in attendance totaling 15,000. At nearly all of these conventions arrangements were made for general field service, and during two working hours, at the convention in Berlin, nearly 40,000 books and booklets were sold.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">SERVICE WEEKS</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">In the first service week of this year there were spread in Germany 340,917 books and booklets, of which 37,000 were bound volumes; and during the second service week 353,883 books and booklets were spread, of which more than 16,000 were bound volumes; therefore during those two weeks 694,800 books and booklets were placed in the hands of the people, more than 54,000 being bound volumes; and, further, some single numbers of </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> were sold and new subscriptions were obtained.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">BADIO</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Two times radio addresses were delivered, but thereafter all stations refused to broadcast further lectures of the Bible Students Association. We are now working out a plan for protest against that violation done to the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">WOEK FOB THE BLIND</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Since the work for the blind is done In this office, this branch also has made considerable progress, for during the last year there was an average of approximately 400 readers a month, two hundred of whom are readers getting literature regularly. Twenty-eight of these are consecrated, to whom </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> is being sent regularly. During 1928, 1,362 books for the blind were produced and bound In this office; 6,052 books were sent out in (all together) 2,950 parcels.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">DEPARTMENT OF LAW</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">The strong opposition of the enemy against the truth Is clearly revealed by some figures given by the department of law, which also show that the enemy made most of bls efforts In vain. The figures show that 1,660 legal proceedings were taken against friends working during the past year. Of these, 762 are brought to an end at present; 898 are still pending. In these 762 the Lord did help us to get a verdict of &quot;Not guilty” for 729; in 33 cases a Judgment In disfavor was entered, but the latter In major part due to missing the right time for sending in objection to the order of punishment received, or similar formalities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">For some time there has been a concerted effort put forth by Catholics and Protestants to cause what is known as a turnover tax to be Imposed upon all the Society's literature In Germany. If this effort had succeeded, It would have made It almost Impossible to distribute any literature In Germany. The mutter was taken before the Finance department of the country, which decided adversely to the Society. Then an appeal was taken to the courts, and recently a decision was handed down In favor of the Society. The important point decided Is that the Society is an organiza-tlon of public benefit, and therefore should be exempt from such taxation law. It Is hoped that this will open a wider way for the distribution of the truth.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark242"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark243"></a>HOLLAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">In proportion to the size of Holland and the small number of the Lord’s people there, the work during the year 1928 brings joy to the heart of every one who is interested in the kingdom. From the report submitted by the local manager the following is copied:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">With much gratitude to our heavenly Father we again finished a year In his royal service. This year, 1928, was marked by such progress as never before. The witness has been given more thoroughly throughout the country. This Is due to the fact that more brethren were able and willing to spend all their time In the colporteur service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">In the yearly report of 1927 we expressed our expectation that the number of colporteurs would be enlarged during next year, And the number did increase; and how? During the greater part of the year there were eight regular colporteurs in the field. They were working In all districts of Holland. But It is not so easy for the colporteurs to keep up, as it is difficult to sell bound books to the people In Holland.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">During the year we got two new means of spreading the kingdom message, to wit: </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Freedom for the Peoples</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Deliverance.</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> The booklet </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Freedom</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> found a ready sale, and in eight months we sold over 25,000 copies. Also the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Deliverance</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> book: in seven months we sold over 1,079 copies, which is a very good result for Holland.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">In 1927 the sale of books was double as much as the year before. The year 1928 saw the total sale Of books again far more than doubled. In 1927 we sold 23,668. In 1928 we had the grand privilege of placing over 60,000 books and booklets in the bands of the people. This is five times as many as in 1926.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Here follows a list of the literature sold In the Dutch language iu Holland;</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Besides, we sold over 1,200 books In different languages, especially In German and Polish.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">This year we started the work amongst the Polish- and German-speaking people In the mining districts In the south of Holland. Some Polish brethren came from France to work in the mines, and this opened the opportunity for the Lord's people to give the witness of the kingdom to the oppressed ones. We never had this opportunity before, because this section is Boman Catholic. But now many books are being sold there by two colporteurs. Now there Is a class organized and they will continue the work begun by the colporteurs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">We have also begun with the Photo Drama exhibitions In Holland, Before writing this report we gave one exhibition which may be called a success to some extent We sold 132 small books and 36 bound books. There were 100 people present.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">BAD10</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">As the Lord Is using the radio in order to give an effectual witness to the people, we tried to get permission to broadcast Brother Rutherford’s Albany lecture on “The Truth&quot;. The Lord overruled the matter and we received permission to use one of the two Dutch stations for one hour. We received many letters of appreciation after the lecture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">OFFICE</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">We received 862 letters and cards and sent 563 letters and cards. The enlargement of the work made it necessary that another person be added to help in the office; and so, since April of this year, there are two brethren who are doing the work In the office, namely: The translating of the publications of the Society, correspondence, shipping of </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Watch Tower</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> in different languages, shipping of the books, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">The IBSA weeks brought good results in Holland. In the first week we sold nearly 2,500 books, and in the second week a few less, but the zeal for the Lord's work was clearly manifested.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">We are very glad for the results of this year, as the workers are but few and they need to be encouraged. But by the results they begin to realize that the Lord is making a name for himself on the earth, and they are glad to cooperate and to give the witness. And so we enter the new fiscal year very hopefully.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark244"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark245"></a>HUNGARY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">The work in Hungary has been done under a very great handicap. A brother who formerly had to do with the work there became ambitious and went into the way of Satan, greatly injuring the work and almost making it impossible to go on. Now the work is being reorganized and progress is being made. The brethren there are not even permitted to assemble for public meetings or private meetings. They can meet only in private homes behind locked doors and curtains drawn. During the year 1,500 meetings of this kind were held, and the total attendance was 32,000. There are twenty-two classes in Hungary, besides a number of other small groups not organized.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In spite of all the difficulties, the Lord has blessed the brethren there to the extent that they have been able to place in the hands of the people 1,028 bound volumes and 20,282 booklets, and 55,000 free tracts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A good portion of this persecution has been brought about by the unfaithfulness of the one who pretended to represent the Lord. We are hoping that this difficulty may soon be overcome.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark246"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark247"></a>INDIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">The work in India is greatly handicapped by reason of few brethren to do the work. The opportunity is open for some English-speaking brethren to go there and participate in the work. Preferably these should go from England, because of India’s relationship with England,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During the year three English colporteurs and four speaking the vernacular have engaged in the work. One English class organized for the work, and fourteen vernacular. The total number of class workers during the year was twenty-one English and forty-one vernacular. Fifty public meetings in English have been held, and 550 in vernacular. The total attendance has been 44,000. Letters received, 528; dispatched, 506.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During the year </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Harp</span><span class="font6"> and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Freedom for the Peoples</span><span class="font6"> have been published in Malayalam, and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">World Distress</span><span class="font6"> in Kanarese. The total of books, English and vernacular, sold during the year was 20,150. Five native conventions have been held, and five radio lectures have been delivered. From the local man, ager’s report the following is taken:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">There has been a grand total of 20,150 books and booklets sold. This Is more than double the figures for 1926-7. The figure Is made up as follows: English bound books, 6,213; booklets, 10,696; vernacular books, 1,632; booklets, 1,609.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Considering the fact that India, Burma and Ceylon cover an area almost as big as the U. S. A., with a population of more than twice as many people, and that there are only two full-time workers (for English work) and an average of four and one-half class workers per week, these figures give us cause for encouragement. Truly the Lord has not been negligent in the supply of grace and strength to us, and we are grateful to him for the privileges of service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">I wish I could give a better report of class workers. Many who profess to be consecrated to the Lord in this country seem to belong to the Laodicean Church: they are neither cold nor hot. There Is only one class (English) properly organized for service work. Two or three other classes exist where regular meetings are held and Isolated ones engage In the service. Special mention might be made of one brother who, in spite of family ties and his dally secular work, makes time for regular, systematic service for the Lord. A sister In Ceylon has also shown great zeal and devoted much time to bearing witness for the Lord. Some are handicapped for scope and might engage in the service more regularly if they lived In more populous places, but on the whole the class service work has not progressed as well as I had hoped it would.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Facilities were given at the beginning of the year for the use of the Bombay Radio Station. Five addresses were given and then excuses were made that we were not orthodox, and further permission was refused. Further efforts will be made in due time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Extensive tours were made during the year and the message of the kingdom was carried Into some of the remote parts of the earth. Brother Wright made a thorough tour of Burma, lasting five months, and left behind him a trail of truth which will undoubtedly bear its fruitage in due time. The rate of progress is greatly hindered through lack of workers. One of us must remain in attendance at the Bombay office, which means that only one worker at a time is free for traveling.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">The </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">World Distress</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> booklet was published In Kanarese, and an interesting experiment was made by Introducing</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">It among the native Indian market towns and villages. In thickly congested markets, chock-full of a mixed medley of Hindoo and Mohammedan merchants, this little booklet sold like the proverbial hot cakes Not only did this booklet carry its own message of truth, but it opened the way for the sale of many English volumes in places where It would not be worth visiting with merely English literature. It was no uncommon thing to sell fifty booklets in three hours. The editor of a Kanarese religious periodical invited ns to supply articles for his paper, and now </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Deliverance</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> is being run as a serial every fortnight.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">The work among the Indian Christians of Travnncore has gone on apace. The brethren there are zealous and active. Twice as many books have been sold during the year just closed as during 1926-7. There were 550 public meetings held, attended by about 40,000 people. The Indian brethren labor under great difficulties, often having to tramp many weary miles under a burning sun with little accommodation for the personal comforts of life. A car would greatly facilitate their means of travel, for Travancore Is a country of good roads but little railway development There are fourteen native classes organized for service, with forty-one workers reported. There are thirteen full-time workers.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark248"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark249"></a>ITALY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">There is not much to report from Italy because it is almost impossible there to do the work. The opposition of Satan’s organization is strong and forbids the distribution of the Society’s literature. There are several friends in Italy, however, who meet quietly and do what they can to reach others with the litera-ature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Italian government obtained from its ambassador at Washington, D. C., information concerning the Society. The ambassador made a very reasonable report, setting forth the facts, which report should have tended to open the way for the distribution of the truth. However, the Italian government, influenced by Rome, issued the following order: “For the security of the national Government, must stop in the kingdom every activity of the Bible Students.” No reason assigned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The brethren in Italy, however, still have hope that the Lord will open the way for the wider witness in that country. The Society still maintains a depot in Italy, and the brethren do, in the best manner possible, what they can to encourage others in the truth. From the local manager the following is quoted:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Needless to say that, not only we, but also the brethren throughout Italy, are suffering by this action ; nevertheless they maintain themselves strong in the hope that the Lord will soon open a way to demonstrate their zeal to collaborate with you and all the saints in the proclamation of the message that the Lord has ordained to be proclaimed throughout the world as a witness to all nations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">From our prison we follow with great interest all your efforts and those of all the faithful colaborers, rejoicing very much In the grand work that the Lord has given you by his grace to do throughout the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">We send our best wishes, and rich blessings; receive our best regards and much love from all the Italian brethren who love the Lord and who seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness. Please remember us in your prayers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">We thank you heartily for all the good that you bring forth to us with your splendid Interpretations of the Word of God, and for all the encouragement that you know how to give us.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark250"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark251"></a>JAMAICA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">The report that comes from the Society’s local manager in Jamaica, West Indies, will cheer the hearts of the brethren everywhere. The number there is small, but they have the zeal peculiar to the Lord’s house. This year they have placed in the hands of the people a total of 23,849 books and booklets. There are ten in the regular colporteur service, and ten others who are pioneers, and all the classes are engaged in the work. From the local manager’s report the following is taken:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">We thank God for the privilege of sending you our report of the work for another year. The year just closed has been one of active service and rich blessings to us in Jamaica. Which of us could have thought that there would be so much work In the Lord’s service for each and all of the Lord’s people at this time? Once we would look at the pilgrims and elders as being the only ones who had the privilege of giving forth the message of God’s kingdom; but today all whose hearts are burning with the desire to tell the people of earth of the rich blessings of the kingdom find wonderful opportunity for doing so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">All the classes In Jamaica are engaged In this honorable work, while the Kingston class Is an example to all. Every Sunday a large van takes out a party to various parts of the Island, where over hills and through vales these faithful ones seek out the homes of the people to leave with them some message of the kingdom. It would make your heart glad to see how some of these poor ones appreciate the message and love the books that contain the message. Many for the first time are able to appreciate our Lord’s words, ‘‘Thy kingdom come.&quot; Many express their longing desire for the kingdom and, when told that the kingdom is here and that the day of deliverance is at hand, express much joy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">That so many of the Lord’s children can participate la the work and partake of the joy of the kingdom, is a wonderful part of the divine program. The brethren In Jamaica are having a burning zeal to sing forth the honor of Jehovah's name, and, although a severe drought has caused some of the classes to be In dire need, on the whole the work La advancing; and It is very encouraging to note how the people buy and appreciate the books.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">We could not close without saying that we are stimulated to zeal and activity through the wonderful Interpretation of many scriptures which appear In the Year Book, the recent Issues of </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The ’Watch Tower,</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> etc.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark252"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark253"></a>JAPAN</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">The Lord is manifesting his favor and blessing upon the work in Japan. It would not be expected that there would be a very great amount of literature placed in Japan, yet it is quite evident that the Japanese are awakening to the fact that they need help that is far beyond human. A great interest has been manifested by the poorer class that have attended the meetings and by others during the year. The Japanese people have suffered many disasters during the year from floods, etc., and this has made it difficult for them to have the money with which to provide themselves with books. There has been a great amount of witnessing to them, however, at the expense of the Society, for which we are grateful to the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">From the brother’s report, who is the manager of the work in Japan, the following is taken:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Greeting In the name of Jehovah God and bls anointed King. Another year has gone with such wonderful blessing and great Joy from the Lord. And I am so happy to send this annual report to you from the Gentile country here. All work has progressed wonderfully, by his grace, during last year. The result of the activity in the name of the Lord in Japan, from September 25, 1927, to September 24, 1928, is as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Consecrations made &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;22</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark254"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark255"></a>JUGOSLAVIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">There is only a small number in Jugoslavia that are interested in the Lord’s work, but they are doing their best to obey God’s command in proclaiming the message. Brethren are few and are scattered throughout the country. At the Society’s local headquarters there is a small congregation of about fifty persons, who meet together regularly. At another place about twenty brethren meet regularly. All of these are beginning to do some witness work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During the year they have placed 311 books and a thousand booklets amongst the people, besides distributing a large number of tracts and copies of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age.</span><span class="font6"> The people are very poor. The truth has been witnessed to in only a portion of the country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The house-to-hause work is forbidden by law, and therefore the work is greatly hindered. The local brother reports: “As soldiers for Jehovah, we trust in him, and we depend upon his protection. He has led us and will continue to lead us that we may sing forth the honor of his name. During the next year we expect greater progress in order that this land of darkness and oppressed humanity may hear the message of deliverance.’’</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark256"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark257"></a>KOREA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">Not a great deal of work has been accomplished in Korea. In fact, the people are so poor and the interest so small that it is difficult to do very much. During the year 2,400 copies of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font6"> have been placed with the people, and a goodly number of free tracts have been distributed. There are seven brethren who go from house to house and talk to the people and put books in their hands. The books and booklets sold during the year have been very small in number.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark258"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark259"></a>LATVIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">In this benighted land the Lord’s work has made progress during the past year. There has been increased activity, and with good results. For a time the brethren who were sent there to do the work had difficulty in obtaining a vise to their passports. The authorities worried them with all kinds of formalities, with the manifest purpose of obtaining some ready cash. The books and booklets distributed during the year aggregated 47,402. The campaign for the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Freedem</span><span class="font6"> booklet is now just beginning and is not included in this report From the local manager’s report the following is taken:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">The opposition of the clergy does not grow any less. In Riga at the present time they have a German Lutheran clergyman who makes a specialty of giving lectures against us and offers his services to all who like to take advantage of them. I went to hear one lecture and he told the people that we received our money from the Jews and the Bolshevists. Only this last IBSA week I happened to call on the same man and he then admitted to me that what he told the people was untrue. Babylon Is Indeed the “cage of every unclean and hateful bird”. The opposition only spurs the brethren on to still further activities to witness to the kingdom and to the time of deliverance from all that oppresses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">The joy among the brethren Is great, especially as they take part in the work. Some who have quite recently come Into the truth say that It Is the best and happiest work that they have ever engaged in and that It brings a great joy to their hearts. Fifteen have been Immersed during the course of the year, and others are just waiting for a favorable opportunity. In June a convention was held and was attended by slxty-five brethren and interested ones. It was a sweet time of refreshing from the hand of the Lord and was a stimulus and encouragement to alL On the Sunday morning thirty-seven of us went forth to the work and sold 330 books and booklets In two hours.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Our prospects for next year are fine, and at the beginning of the year we have already ten whole-time colporteurs. We are all looking forward to the spreading of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Freedom </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">booklet, and It will be a fine witness to the people as to what we stand for.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark260"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark261"></a>LITHUANIA.</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">In Lithuania the military law has been in force during the year, which has hindered the work. In addition thereto the “beast” is energetically opposing the truth. It will be recalled that Lithuania stole a strip of German territory at Memelgebiet during the war. This has furnished a basis of operation, however. There are 150 German brethren in the Gebiet. At various times a number of these travel a long distance into Lithuania and spread the books and booklets to the dismay of the clergy. At one point during the year twenty-one brethren had put out 900 books on one Sunday morning, when the bishop of the Catholic system had them all arrested and imprisoned for the day. These brethren were fined. Notwithstanding this handicap, the German brethren put out in Lithuania 387 books and 4,663 booklets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Two or three Lithuanian brethren, with the assistance of some isolated ones, placed 1,019 books and 9,340 booklets in spite of the opposition. During the year a convention was held at Siauliai, and eighty-five Lithuanians attended, also twenty-five Germans who could speak Lithuanian to some extent. The convention was a great encouragement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In Memelgebiet the German brethren are very active. Spurred on by their imprisonment, they made fresh efforts in the Gebeit and put out 2,000 booklets in one day. Here they have placed in the hands of the people 1,788 books and 25,619 booklets. A convention was also held in Memel, attended by 100, and 500 books were put out on service day. The total books and booklets for Lithuania for the year were, books 3,194, and booklets 39,622.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark262"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark263"></a>NORWAY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">In Norway the witness work has progressed to the Lord’s glory during the year. An effort is now being put forth to provide a motor-boat to reach the isolated parts of Norway that can not otherwise be reached. From the report of the local brother in Norway the following is taken:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">It has been hard to work In Norway this year, specially because of the hard economic situation for the laborers in the whole country; and the rich people have not had so much trouble yet that they want to listen to the message of the kingdom. Furthermore, we have the long distances, with difficult communication and expensive travel. If we can now get your permission and money enough to buy a motor-boat, then we have two suitable brothers who are willing to go on. We must have such a boat, where the brothers can live in the winter also; then we can reach thousands of people who have never heard the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">This year we have sent out from the office a total of 132,432 books and booklets. It is 67,251 more than last year. We have sent out 58,434 </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Testimony</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> and other tracts and folders, 4,550 </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Bulletins</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> and 2,455 letters. One hundred sixty-four friends have been in the class-colporteur work. Average number of workers out each week, 59. Subscribers for </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower,</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> 508; decrease In number of subscribers, 138. Subscribers for </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Golden Age,</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> 5,024; Increase in number of subscribers, 3,257.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Brother T. Simonsen, our only traveling brother has still been the whole time in the pilgrim work, most of the time in encouraging the friends to go out in the work, and himself going with them. Still we are thankful for our dear Brother Dey, who is always inspiring us and helping us in the work. Miles traveled by pilgrims, 17,952.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark264"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark265"></a>POLAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">After many hardships and much tribulation the brethren in Poland are getting on better with the work during the year just closed than heretofore. The local manager writes, “At the conclusion of the year the friends m Poland have every reason fo be thankful to the Lord for his wonderful guidance, especially for the reason that this is the first year that the work in Poland is united, and working in full harmony with the brethren in other parts of the earth. Now the consecrated ones in Poland stand shoulder to shoulder together with their brethren elsewhere, in the battle against the organized enemy Satan.” Prior hereto it has been rather difficult to get the classes in Poland to see the advantage of organized class service work. In recent months they have awakened to this privilege. A general convention was held in Warsaw, and one day was set aside for service. It provided a day of great blessing to the brethren. Those returning from the field service work were greatly enthused, and since then the work has gone forward with more zeal and in ah orderly way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Last year there were only 76 class workers, and the year now ending there were 256. The following is quoted from the local manager’s report:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Heretofore the classes held meetings and most of them wished to sit down and listen to some brother talk, and the talking ones became heady and many of them left and drew others away with them. But now the classes are recognizing their privileges and are awakening to the fact that the Lord has called them to cooperate, and they are willingly meeting these opportunities. Until recently many of the friends were standing apart, but now the letters coming to the office show that they are rejoicing In their opportunity to make proclamation of the kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The books and booklets placed in the hands of the people in Poland by the friends during the fiscal year aggregated 186,705; and, in addition thereto, 90,000 copies of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower</span><span class="font6"> and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font6"> were put out. Approximately three thousand meetings were held, with a total attendance of 250,000. During the year 3,505 letters have been received, and 2,475 dispatched. One hundred fifty thousand free tracts have been distributed. Twenty-four classes have organized for service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Recently an arrangement was made whereby a large number of books were shipped to Poland and delivered to the colporteurs free, so that they can get into the field and make their expenses. This will encourage them to go on when they once get started. It is gratifying to report this progress in Poland.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark266"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark267"></a>PORTUGAL</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">In Portugal the truth has made very slow progress. The wealthy are given over to pleasure, while the poor are unable to buy; and as nearly all are steeped in Romanism, it is difficult to interest them in anything that pertains to God’s kingdom. The brethren who are there, however, are zealously working, doing their best to give the witness, that the nations may know that the kingdom of heaven is at hand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During the year they have distributed 50,500 copies of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower</span><span class="font6"> and 10,000 tracts. The sale of the books has been small, only 66 books and 340 booklets, or a total of 406, have been placed in the hands of the people. The branch office has received 610 letters and dispatched 524. It is difficult in such a benighted country to make much headway in witnessing to the truth.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark268"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark269"></a>SOUTH AFRICA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">The work in the Lord’s vineyard continues with increased interest in South Africa. Early in the year there was some falling away, some disturbance, and some hindrances. The Lord never lacks, however, in getting his work done. A brother stepped into the breach and the work is going on with increased zeal. When we call to mind that South Africa covers a large area, the population is small, and the number of friends very small, and only the manager and two assistants in the office, it is with real joy that the contents of the report from that country are noted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Society installed a printing press at the office at Cape Town, which has been giving good results.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The local manager in his report says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">It gives me pleasure to render a report of the activities of the Lord’s people in this land during the past twelve months. Early in the year the enemy sought to hinder the work and to discourage the workers. For reasons best known to themselves, two or three, who for a number of years had borne the heat and burden of the day, left the ranks. The Lord, however, true to his promise, has been caring for his people and his work, and not only have the vacant places been filled, but quite a number of others have been brought along, with the result that we now have more brethren in the full-time and auxiliary service than at any other time in the past. Those wholly devoted to the Lord, rejoicing in “the things prepared” for them, have gone forward in obedience to the Lord’s commands, moved by love for him. Many happy experiences have been our portion as we have sought to &quot;sing forth the honor of his name” and to give out the glad tidings of the kingdom. Recognizing that the work is the Lord’s and that he is supervising, we have at all times endeavored to closely follow the lead which comes to us from headquarters and to &quot;lift up the voice together” with our brethren in all ports of the world. The Lord’s blessing has accordingly been with us; and with the “meat in due season&quot; In the columns of </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> to strengthen us, with a clearer vision of what the Lord would have us do, and with a greater appreciation of the privilege of service, it Is not surprising that the past year has been &quot;the best yet” In the history of the work In this great sub-continent. Our Increased activities and the added blessing of the Lord are reflected In the facts and figures which follow:</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">These figures show a total Increase of 86,000 books and booklets over the previous year’s figures. If we omit the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Freedom</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> booklet, of which there have been approximately 74,000 copies distributed, there is still an Increase of 12,000 (5,000 bound volumes and 7,000 booklets). Again leaving out </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Freedom</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> from our calculations for a moment, it will be seen that 50% of the books distributed were bound volumes. The European population in the Union numbers approximately one and a half millions. That represents 300,000 homes. It follows that on an average a book or a booklet has been placed in almost every other home. When it is kept In mind that these homes are scattered over an area that exceeds the united areas of France, Germany, Switzerland and Portugal, and that our average of weekly workers over the year has been sixty, the zeal of the faithful ones in this land can be better appreciated. And the Union is only one-third of our parish. Some work has also been done in the vast but sparsely populated territories of South West Africa, the Rhodesias and Nyasaland. While by far the greater proportion of books which have gone out have been in the English language, a considerable number have been distributed in Afrikaans, Hollandish, Greek and German. The new book, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Creation,</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> and the new booklets. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Where Are the Dead? Prosperity Sure</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Last Days,</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> have been going like &quot;hot cakes” since we got them, while the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Freedom </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">booklet has been distributed throughout the country to the extent of 49,000 in English and 25,000 in Afrikaans. It was with a great deal of pleasure we gave out the message contained In the latter booklet, and you will be glad to know that many letters have come In from different parts of the country from those who formerly were &quot;prisoners”, telling us that they have now severed their connection with Babylon and have taken their stand unreservedly on the side of the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">BADI0</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">The Society does not yet have Its own radio station in this land, but by arrangement with the African Broadcasting Company, the sole broadcasting company in South Africa, we were permitted to give seven radio lectures during the year from the Company’s three studios situated at Cape Town, Johannesburg and Durban. The topics used were &quot;The Kingdom of Heaven Is at Hand”, “End of the World and After,” &quot;Where Are the Dead?” and &quot;Everlasting Life on Earth”. Many favorable reports have been received, not only from these towns but from remote country dorps. In the towns and in the lonely places some &quot;listened In” to the kingdom message for the first time. Following the lectures numerous sales were made by workers when they called on those whose interest had been aroused by this means. But while there were those who heard the message gladly, our enemies also &quot;listened in” and they have made strong representations to the Broadcasting Company to cut us out. The first application we have made for a lecture since the cancelation of the Canadian licenses, the report of which appeared in the press in this country, has been turned down. No satisfactory reason has been assigned, and we can only conclude that they have yielded to the pressure put on them by organized churchianlty. We are not at all discouraged at this, however. A good witness has been given and we are confident that in the Lord's own time the way will be opened up for us to use the air again.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">SERVICE WOBK</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Pride of place, of course, is given to the full-time colporteurs, that noble band of workers who in a very special and, in this country, literal sense bear the heat (and It does get hot at times) and burden of the day. There are now eleven brethren more or less continually in the work, and several others have intimated their Intention of getting Into tbe ranks shortly. In addition, nine brethren have commenced the auxiliary work, and their early experiences have been much blessed by the Lord. The full-time workers, of whom there has been a monthly average of seven, have made 29,699 calls and sold 31,968 books, of which 53% have been bound volumes. This represents an increase of practically 6,000 books on last year’s figures. The Devil’s earthly representatives, particularly the ecclesiastical section, have done what they could to oppose and persecute; but they are impotent, and every attack has resulted to their own discredit and has been In the Lord’s hands a means of furthering the interests of the kingdom work. The Dutch Reformed church system, which has the unenviable reputation of holding the most &quot;prisoners”, Is at present being shaken to its foundations by the fundamentalist-modernist controversy which has been going on In the older European churches for some years now. The enemy camp is divided. The hypocrisy of the unfaithful shepherds Is being brought to light; the crying of the prisoners can be distinctly heard, and how It rejoices our hearts to know that the time has come for their liberation! A number have already been freed, and it is manifest that the influence of the parsons and “predikants” over the people, even In places regarded hitherto as strongholds of the kingdom of darkness, is distinctly on the wane. In some places it is quite a common occurrence for the &quot;predikant” to have the bell-ringer as his entire audience at the Sunday morning service, although his faithful “ouderlinge” can still be relied upon to </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">go </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">around the “flock’’ with metaphorical shears and clip the best of the “wool” so that he “who loves to slumber” may continue to do so peacefully, when there are no Bible Students in the vicinity!!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">There are some twenty classes organized for service. Copies of the new &quot;Organization Method” came to hand a few months ago and suggestions contained therein have been put into operation in the larger classes. The smaller classes and Isolated brethren are carrying it out as far as possible, for all realize how necessary It Is that the Lord’s work should be carried forward In an orderly manner. During the year the reports show that 2,676 workers made 73,503 calls and distributed 63,229 books and booklets. This represents a weekly average of flfty-one workers and twentyeight calls a week by each worker. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Freedom</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> booklets have been sent by post to some of the more isolated places which have been Inaccessible to the workers. The greater portion of the expense in this connection has been borne by the office, although the friends have cooperated by paying for postage and in some Instances helping to pay for cost of booklets in addition. In the earlier part of the fiscal year, before the arrival of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Freedom</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> booklet, 66,000 copies of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Testimony</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> and 59,000 copies of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Message</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> of </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Hope </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">were also sent out by post.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">The two IBSA weeks have been very happy occasions. We put forth a special effort, and our labors were abundantly rewarded, not only in the knowledge that an effective witness had been given to the praise of Jehovah’s name, but by an increased measure of the joy of the Lord in our hearts. In the special week in May, 131 workers made 7,984 calls and sold 6,443 books. This is the greatest number of workers that have yet been in the field at one time in this land, and the greatest number of books sold in any one week. The reports for the week just ended are not yet all in, but it is already apparent that a good effort has been made by many of the brethren. Our tw’o &quot;crack” colporteurs, both of whom are sisters, have again done splendidly. We suggested the very high quota of 500 books for the week for each full-time worker, and these two workers, although battling against great odds, in adverse weather conditions, both exceeded the quota. Yon will note with appreciation the very high proportion of bound volumes Included</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">This does not mean, of course, that others did not make an effort equally good; they did, but not being just so efficient In the work, their results were not quite so good. Indeed much zeal has been manifested by those whose opportunities were not so numerous. Brethren living on Isolated farms, for Instance, have loaded their cars with books and got around neighboring farms; others who have worked the little dorps In which they live have time and again traveled hundreds of miles by car to territory farther afield; while still others, unable to travel perhaps, have watched for the farmers coming Into town and tackled them at their &quot;outspan”. In the bigger towns all meetings were put off during the week, and the brethren with business duties In the day were enabled to spend an hour or two canvassing each evening; all-day drives were also arranged. Many blessings were enjoyed In this way by all who participated with the sincere desire to honor the name of Jehovab-While the average number of weekly workers has Increased during the year, there is still much room for improvement, and we hope that in such towns where it is possible there there will be greater regularity In the service work. Fortunately we are not afflicted in this land with many “preachers”, those fellows who love to hear the sound of their own voice in the meeting-room but who can not be seen for dust when the service drive takes place. On the whole, the brethren are appreciating more fully than ever that windy talk in the classroom gets one nowhere, and that, on the other hand, the depth of one’s love and devotion is proved and tested in the field of action. Accordingly, those classes that have selected as elders only those who are ready to give a lead in the door-to-door work are united and in a healthy condition. The one or two exceptions are sickly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">PUBLIC WITNESS AND SEBVICE LECTURES</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">With radio lectures being given in the bigger towns, public witness meetings have been confined chiefly to the smaller places, and then frequently as an Introduction to the colporteur effort. Six brethren have participated In the public witness work. These have held 133 meetings. Handbills were distributed to the number of 50,000 to advertise these meetings. The total attendance was 8,093, and as a direct result of these lectures 1,941 books were sold.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Five trips were made by service lecturers, and the four brethren who participated in this phase of the work held 140 meetings, with a total attendance of 2,918. These visits are beneficial to both the visitor and the visited; for there is a mutual giving and getting which is for the good of all. Those in the lonely places particularly, and there are many of these in such a country as this, look forward to the coming of a fellow worker, and the opportunity is frequently seized to participate in the service together, which we now recognize to be real fellowship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">CONVENTIONS</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">In the course of the year, two conventions were held, one In Cape Town at the New Year and the other in Johannesburg at Easter. They were well attended, fully 100 being present on each occasion. The addresses were all along the lines of recent </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Watch Toner</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> articles. Service drives were arranged and taken advantage of, and the friends returned home strengthened and encouraged to continue In the good work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">There are now 314 subscribers for the English, Hollandlsh and German </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Watch Tower</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> and 215 subscribers for </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Golden Age.</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> Subscriptions for the former have increased by 43, and for the latter by 39, during the course of the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">With fewer public meetings there has not been the same demand for handbills, but we have printed what has been required in English, Afrikaans and Xosa. All together our little machine has turned out close to 100,000 pieces In handbills and office stationery during the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Increased activity In the field means increased work at the office. Letters to the number of 3,392 were received and 6,981 dispatched. Considerable night work has been necessary to keep the wheels going round, but this we have gladly done that the work In the field should not suffer. It was good of you to send Brother Seeman all the way from Brooklyn to assist in the work here. He arrived In this country after his long voyage from America about two and a half months ago and is at present up-country on a service lecturing trip. It is hoped that his coming will not only give an added impetus to the work but serve to bring headquarters a little nearer to us so that we down here may realize more fully the oneness of the Lord's organization. The brother in the store continues to work like a Trojan. He is a native African and is wholly devoted to the Lord. Whether it be packing books or &quot;feeding” the machine, John is never happier than when there’s plenty to do, and then some. Much valuable assistance has also been given by a sister who is an expert stenographer and typist and who, although she has household duties to attend to, has nevertheless found it possible to come in frequently for a few hours during the day to help out with the correspondence when we have been short-handed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Last month, supplies of the author’s edition of </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Reconciliation</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Government</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> were received. Our hearts overflow with gratitude to the Lord for this further provision from the storehouse, and to you also, for we know that much labor Is involved in getting out two such books. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Reconciliation</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> has already been lapped up and the reading has brought much refreshment to us. If the mustard-colored binding of </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Government</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> is an indication that it contains real “hot stuff”, we look forward with anticipation to the day when we shall get a few spare hours to lap It up also. What with the trouble in the church systems and an approaching general election, the prospects for the work in the coming year are good. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Government</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> particularly, should go well; for there is much political corruption, and the coming struggle will create much bitterness of feeling and arouse the desire in honest hearts for a righteous government and a governor who can rule justly and bless mankind with peace, life and happiness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">In conclusion, I would like to assure yon, dear Brother Rutherford, that your brethren in this land love you very dearly and esteem you highly for your work's sake. The desire to meet you is often expressed by many, and as the day will soon be here when London will be only six days from Cape Town, we live In hope. In the meantime, if you can pnt a program on the radio, at a time suitable for us here to pick up American signals, I am confident such an arrangement would be greatly appreciated. We shall be required to get up in the early hours of the morning to hear you, but this we shall gladly do. To hear you speak for even half an hour would be most thrilling, and I am sure it would be a great Incentive to the brethren. Be assured that we dally present you at the throne of grace, seeking for you the rich blessing and guidance of the Lord. We appreciate the fearless lead we receive from you and we shall continue by the Lord’s grace to follow where he may lead. We are ready for anything; and the stronger the message against the enemy, the better we shall like it and the greater will be our joy In giving it out The arrival of </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Messenger</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> containing the message for wide distribution in the coming year is eagerly awaited. While the Lord’s blessing has been manifest In the past year, and we have much cause for thanksgiving as we have watched the kingdom work make progress, we feel as Cecil Rhodes did at the close of his busy life: &quot;So much to do, so little done”; and we therefore look forward to still greater opportunities in the new year of declaring the doings of our God and making mention that his name is exalted.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark278"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark279"></a>SPAIN</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">Against great opposition from the clergy the Lord’s message continues to reach out to the people of Spain. There are now in Spain 1,362 subscribers for </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower,</span><span class="font6"> and outside of Spain who take the Spanish </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Watch Tower,</span><span class="font6"> 1,561 subscribers, making a total of 2,923 subscribers. The clergy have forced a number to cancel their subscriptions, but still the subscriptions continue to increase. Many express their joy at the food they get through </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower. </span><span class="font6">From the local manager’s report the following is taken:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">As time goes by and </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> Is penetrating Into the very heart of the mountain regions of the country, the alarm and consternation of the clergy Increase, causing them to preach and write In their local papers against us, and to warn the people to beware of us. One bishop lamented the fact that </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> not only Is being distributed but will surely continue to be so, unless the authorities take the matter in hand. He is doing his best to make them do so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">The truth is that the authorities In the cities and villages of Spain do not of their own accord ever interfere with us; it is only when the instigation of the influential clergy obliges them to. In some places the authorities pay no attention to these and we are permitted to work In spite of the open antagonism of the enemy. In other places, where the mayors and the clergy are of one mind, we can work only till they hear of us and then we are turned out. I shall never forget the experience In Arganda and Morata, where the people gathered after us begging us to explain our message to them, for hardly any of them could read; and we kept on like that for one whole day, always followed by them wherever we went. Many bought books just for the sake of keeping them. How much we need restitution!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Christian feeling has almost completely died out In this country; the people do not want religion, for they feel that Catholics and Protestants have deceived them. Most of the Protestant faithful are composed of those who receive material favors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">On one occasion a governor of a city wanted to put us In jail and keep us there. We were saved by presenting a copy of the conference given by you In the Princess theater, which was published In </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Informacwnes</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> with your photograph. When the governor saw It, he felt that if in Madrid we worked openly even In the press, we might do so in his city; but for fear of the priest he turned us out and placed mounted guards to see us safely off and to see where we were going.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">But In spite of all the difficulties, the output of literature has been considerably more this year than last; which shows that many more hearts are receiving the light of divine truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">We rejoice that so many more books and booklets are now being printed in the Spanish language, and we hope soon to make use of the press you sent us and print our own </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Watch Tower,</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> so that we may be able to make a wider distribution.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark280"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark281"></a>SWEDEN</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">It is with great joy that it can be reported that the work of the Lord’s cause in Sweden is in a better condition than at any time previous. In former years all the preaching was done by a few, and this often in such a manner that others were discouraged. For the fiscal year ending September 30, 1928, there has not been so much preaching from the platform but a great deal more preaching from house to house as the anointed ones carried the gospel in printed form and told the people about God’s kingdom. The output of books and booklets during the year aggregated 400,406. The Lord has manifested his blessing upon the house-to-house preaching of the gospel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">From the local manager’s report the following is taken:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">The colporteur work has disposed of 160,672 of the books, which is an Increase of 93,372 as compared with last year. The number of colporteurs in the field has risen from twenty-two each month last year to twenty-eight, and of auxiliary colporteurs from twenty to twenty-eight each month. We have also had the joy of putting in operation the motor car bought for that purpose, and by this means quite a vast territory of forest land has been covered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">The service work shows a slight decrease in the number of permit holders, but, on the other hand, the number out each week has gone up a bit, the total number of service workers (excluding colporteurs) being 471, of whom 182 have been out every week. The IBSA weeks were very much appreciated and then 504 took part in the service. During the August week we succeeded, by the Lord’s grace, to raise the sales figure from 30,346 of last year to 33,736, in spite of the fact that fewer brethren took part than last year and that a great many of the people had no cash during the closing days of the month. The total number of books and booklets placed by the service workers during the year amounts to 191,119. How a continued participating in the service keeps the workers, as well as the classes, in a healthy condition, is more and more clearly sees and appreciated, and we want to keep on keeping on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">The pilgrim work has been carried on by three brothers, devoting most of the time to class meetings and helping</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">In organizing the work and, as we have not yet succeeded In getting in over the radio, also delivering public lectures when such has been deemed helpful to the work of placing the literature among the public. Also a number of funeral services have been conducted by the brethren, since this was permitted by law, and a good witness has been given In this way also.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">The radio question, as already reported, has not yet been brought to a successful solution. However, when we can not get in over the radio proper, we have agreed to act, all of us, as loud speakers for the Lord; and thus we shall be able to place a loud speaker, telling of the wonderful kingdom, at the door steps of all the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Conventions have been held In various parts of the country to the number of 13. The main one was at Stockhqlm, In the spring, when we had the much appreciated privilege of getting your personal message, which cheered both the friends at the convention and those at home who got to hear about it. In this connection I take the opportunity to state, In behalf of all the Swedish friends, that we are eagerly looking forward to a visit from you, dear Brother Rutherford, if the Lord will permit, when next year, as we hope, you are going to visit Europe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">The main feature of the work during the year has been the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Freedom</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> campaign, which came in during a very opportune time for the people who were in special stress because of the strike in the labor market, already mentioned. Now we are making preparations for the drive with the Detroit message, and to use the language of one brother when he had read it in </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Messenger,</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> &quot;Ah, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">that</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> will be a message to put into their hands'” Certainly the King himself is going forth to the battle! We know of none who were able to get the message over the radio that time; but many people all over Sweden got to know about it, as we bad notices in most of the papers, some bringing the news in quite big types and under fat headings. Among these was the leading religious dally paper, where the headings read: &quot;Europe may hear sermon from U. S. A. Judge Rutherford on the air. All short wave listeners, attention I” and then followed the notice as we ourselves had formulated It, telling of the I. B. S. A, etc., much to our surprise, this being the second time that paper gave us some publicity, and that even after having refused our paid advertisements as late as last spring. This publicity proved a great help in canvassing for the books, as the mentioning of the article in the papers often furnished the opportunity to install our private &quot;loud speaker” in a home where otherwise they would not have listened to us at all. By and by we hope that the short-wave receivers will get more perfected and, above all, cheaper, so that more people may be able to use them and get the lectures sent by you from time to time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">We have been much benefited by the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Watch Tower</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> studies, and truly we marvel at the wondrous things now being revealed in the light of the flashes from the temple. Our earnest prayer is that we may be kept by the gracious Lord in such a condition that we may keep pace with the unfolding truth, making use of it to his glory in singing forth the honor of his name.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark282"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark283"></a>SWITZERLAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">The Society’s main office in Switzerland is at Berne. This office has local jurisdiction over Switzerland, France, Belgium, Saar Basin, Italy, Jugoslavia and Holland. The printing plant there continues to grind out the message of comfort and good cheer to the people. There are only thirty-one workers employed in the factory, and the machines are not as modern as in our other factories. The books and other literature printed in that factory were produced in seventeen different languages during the year. The following is the production report: Booklets, 1,669,163; books, 45,100; journals, 678,923; tracts, etc., 488.563, making a total of 2,881,749 pieces turned out by the factory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The number is small in Switzerland but they have the spirit of the Lord and are doing his work in a splendid way. The report is very gratifying, and our brethren everywhere will take pleasure in reading it. During the year, 950 brethren as class workers engaged in the service and they placed in the hands of the people 9,688 books and 266,360 booklets. Three regular colporteurs and ten auxiliary colporteurs in the field placed 5,580 books and 24,712 booklets. In the territory embraced in Switzerland and the other places under the direction of the Berne office, the distribution of the books and booklets is almost double what it was last year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">From the local manager’s report the following is quoted:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">It has been a year of great activity in this part of the field, and the results beyond our expectation prove that the anointed have entered into the joy of the Lord and that God reigns.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">The determination and zeal of the Lord's people in our part of the field was shown forth particularly at the Basel convention and during the two special service weeks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">The Basel convention lasted three days. On Saturday, the 15th of September, 700 to 900 friends hud gathered; on Sunday the number increased to 1,500. Many had to return home the next day and only about 800 could remain on Monday, which was service day. Of these 800, seven hundred participated in the house-to-house canvass, and these faithful workers distributed the Invitations to the public meeting in the evening and at the same time left nearly 10,000 booklets with the people in less than two hours. This average of workers in relation to the attendance was even better than the average at the Detroit convention. The public witness was given by Brother Balzerelt on the subject: “A Ruler for the Peoples.&quot; The lecture was attended by 1,700 people, and about 500 books were sold.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Our report proves that. In Switzerland, of 1,500 friends, about 1,000 (or two-thirds) engage regularly In the house-to-house service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">In France about one-half of the Bible Students participate regularly in the service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">In Holland, where proportionately the best results have been obtained, practically all the friends are active in the work. Many friends remarked at Basel that the organization of the convention was almost perfect and that they had never realized so thoroughly the fact that God has organized his people for the battle against the Devil's organization. The climax of the convention was Monday morning, when the friends gathered In fighting units and each one started out with a package of books. Brothers and sisters of the Basel class were captains, and every group marched In order and showed forth the joy and the glory of the King In their countenances. A false brother who came to cause trouble, when he saw such unity and action, turned back to the gate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">SEBVICE WEEK</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">During the first service week special effort was made to take the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Freedom</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> booklet Into most Isolated regions of mountainous Switzerland; but also the brethren In Alsace and the Sarr Basin and a few organized classes In France did what they could to sing forth the honor of Jehovah’s name, and everywhere the Lord blessed the effort of his people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">During the second international service week we concentrated our efforts upon the distribution of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Deliverance </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">book. It Is rather difficult to distribute books In Switzerland and In France; In Switzerland because a special license Is necessary and without it we can not ask a definite price but must use the method of receiving free-will offerings in the homes where we leave the books. Moreover, In France and In the Sarr Basm economic conditions are such that the people can hardly afford to buy a book. In spite of these conditions, during the second service week 2,000 books were distributed, in addition to 24,000 booklets; in the first service week 50,000 books and booklets were distributed. That means nearly 20,000 more than during last year’s service week. The total sum of literature distributed during both service weeks by 1,300 workers amounted to 75,379 books and booklets. This report pertains to the effort In Switzerland, France and Saar Basin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">BEBVICE XEPOBT</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">In our territory there are ninety organized classes and 1,470 class workers, seventeen regular colporteurs and twelve auxiliary colporteurs. Last year 291,883 books and booklets were distributed; and this year, with a double measure of his spirit, the result was almost doubled, In that 581,809 books and booklets were distributed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">At the Berne office, letters and cards received totaled 6,596; dispatched, 5,954.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Berne office has also produced 5,000 booklets in the Esperanto language, and considerable interest is being shown by those who use the language. Withal the report from the Central European Office is exceedingly gratifying.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark284"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark285"></a>SYRIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">Present truth has never taken any great hold in Syria, but the few brethren who are there are faithful in giving their testimony. They work under great handicap. During the fiscal year closing, 11 public meetings have been held, with an attendance of 490; 126 class meetings, with an attendance of 1,425. In addition thereto, the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Photo Drama</span><span class="font6"> has been shown amongst the Armenians, with an attendance of 2,292. The books sold during the year are as follows: Armenian, 646; English, 17; French, 4; Arabic, 19. In addition to this, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font6"> has had a goodly circulation amongst those who have not any great interest in the Truth.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark286"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark287"></a>TRINIDAD</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">The Society’s little branch office at Trinidad, Port of Spain, continues faithfully in getting forward with the work. During the year 2,347 class meetings were held, with a total attendance of 34,156; seventy-three public meetings were held, with an attendance of 7,739. The workers, 189 in number, made 47,505 calls. They placed with the people books to the number of 7,659, and booklets, 17,470. Four local conventions were held during the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">From the local manager’s report the following is taken:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">In working out the figures for the annual report, It gives us pleasure to find that more books were put out than during the previous year, and nearly twice as many booklets, besides 6,400 </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Freedom for the Peoples,</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> this last being now at a premium. Also, that many more public meetings were held, the total attendance showing an 80% Increase above last year's report. From these facts you will see that those of the ‘'remnant” here also (some of the friends are not workers) are active in the Interests of Jehovah’s kingdom, which is really the desire of all peoples; and with Joy they are singing forth the honor of his name!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">On six different days conventions were held, some in remote parts, and each day some of the time spent by nearly all of the brethren present In the house-to-house witness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Generally the message Is received gladly and respectfully, but a large majority of the people are poor (few of the others show interest) and mostly only one book or booklet is placed at a time, usually on credit, and often two, three, </span><span class="font6">or </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">more calls are necessary to collect</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark288"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark289"></a>WEST AFRICA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">From the far away country of West Africa, where all the friends are colored, comes a gratifying report, and, like other parts of the field, the work there has materially increased during the fiscal year. In the regular colporteur work three have engaged. Four classes have been organized for service, and the total number of the workers in the classes is twenty-six, with an average of twelve of these out each week. Three brethren have served in the pilgrim service and field work, holding thirty-nine public meetings, with an attendance of 8,500; class meetings sixty-five, with an attendance of 208. Letters received 276 and dispatched 258. The total number of books placed by the colporteurs and the workers during the year aggregated 20,883. In addition to this, other literature was distributed freely to the amount of 15,500 copies. Two conventions were held during the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The territory there embraces Nigeria, Gold Coast and Lagos. From the local manager’s report the following is quoted:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">The few colporteurs here have speeded up with the work; by the letters sent, you will see how active they are, also by the output of books by them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">The class workers asked me to convey their love and appreciation to you for providing them with such a wonderful service on Sundays. The house-to-house witness has been a great blessing to them, and daily, from reports we are hearing, the Lord is truly blessing the work. We look forward to the new books </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Reconciliation</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">To this I add my warm love and appreciation of your untiring zeal for the Lord s cause. We thank the Lord for you from the time you were elected president of the Lord's organization on earth. &quot;Ride prosperously” with him, dear brother, &quot;because of truth and meekness and righteousness.”</span></p><a name="caption2"></a>
<h1><a name="bookmark290"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark291"></a>CONCLUSION</span></h1>
<p><span class="font6">To prepare this report has been a real joy. The anointed reading it will receive much joy. Those who actually did the work have doubtless experienced the greatest joy. A careful examination of the report will show that there is now in the field a faithful, loyal army of workers, all of whom are preaching the gospel. They see eye to eye. They are walking shoulder to shoulder; together they are lifting up their voices. They are declaring that Jehovah is God, Christ is King, and the kingdom is here!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It will be observed that the total number of books and booklets placed in the hands of the people during the fiscal year of 1928 is, to wit, 20,412,192. A reasonable average would be five sermons to each book and booklet placed in the hands of the people, and is therefore equivalent to the preaching during the year of more than a hundred million discourses. Formerly a few men did all the preaching. Now all the anointed have a part therein to the Lord’s praise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Had we been required to buy all these books from some worldly producer it would have been impossible to get that number and put them in the hands of the people. The Lord has graciously provided the means whereby his people can produce the books themselves; and why should it not be that way? Why should his anointed have to go to any part of the enemy’s organization to prepare the message that goes out as a witness to the name of Jehovah? Let all the dear brethren throughout the earth take heart. Gird up the loins of your minds. Be of good courage and, with complete confidence in Jehovah, in his anointed King, and in the complete accomplishment of his purposes, continue to go on in the work and sing forth his praises. It seems manifest that there is much yet to be done. It seems equally clear from the Scriptures that this must be done </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">with haste.</span><span class="font6"> This is the time for work, and our work is graciously pointed out by our Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">With profound gratitude and thankfulness to our God and our Lord and Savior, and with great love for the brethren in Christ everywhere, this report is humbly submitted.</span></p><img src="yb1929_E_files/yb1929_E-2.png" alt="" style="width:100pt;height:37pt;">

<h2><a name="bookmark292"></a><span class="font10"><a name="bookmark293"></a>YEAR TEXT</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Z </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">will sing praise to my God.—Ps. 104:33.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">C I</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"> T </span><span class="font7">EHOVAH is our God.” So say all of his anointed. With real love they address </span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font7"> as Father. Being of Zion they are in the temple of God. Every one in that blessed condition speaks of God’s glory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The text implies that others have a different god. Such are the facts. Satan is the god of the world, causing many to worship him. Others, being deceived by him, worship images or anything that diverts the mind away from the true God. To know the true God and his beloved Son Christ Jesus, means that one is in the way of life. All others are in the way of death. Jehovah God is the saving strength of his anointed. (Ps. 28:8) He is the great Savior of all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There are many reasons for the anointed to sing the praises of Jehovah. Chief among these reasons is that now is his due time for the song of praise to sound forth in the earth. As God put his name upon the temple built by Solomon, so now He has put his name upon the temple</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">not made with hands. He has furnished his beloved Son the robe of righteousness with which to cover the members of his body yet on earth. That covering represents their approval. Because the Lord found them faithfully trying to safeguard the kingdom interests he brought them under the robe of righteousness. It is therefore due time. It is beneficial, pleasant and comely to sing the praises of him who provided, the robe. Those who have thus received the Lord’s approval have learned that God has visited them, taken them out from the world and made them his witnesses to bear his name. To be faithful to God these must now show forth his praises. His marvelous lightnings thrill the temple class. Seeing his great and excellent works, the anointed ones are eager to tell about them and to make known the name of their God in all the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The people must have an opportunity to know that Jehovah is God and that there is none other like unto him. Blindly following false gods, the people seek life, peace and happiness, but in that way find only disappointment and despair. Jehovah is the God who alone can satisfy their heart’s desire. He will now have his faithful witnesses tell the people of his purpose to destroy their oppressors, let them go free, and open their eyes of understanding that they may know the way to everlasting life and blessings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">Am</span><span class="font7"> I one of God’s anointed! If so, I must keep myself &quot;unspotted from the world”, which means to give no allegiance directly or indirectly to the god of this world. I must not touch “the unclean thing” of the enemy organization, but be wholly for my God. I must be the uncompromising foe of every part of the organization of the enemy. There must.be no mistake about where I stand, and my course of action must afford no room for doubt. God’s approval alone must I seek. The approval of creatures out of harmony with him I do not desire. Knowing that I am the ambassador of the Lord, surrounded by a perfect shield, I delight to sing forth the praises of my God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">How shall I sing forth Jehovah’s praises! Not by being idle. Not by merely singing in the presence of my brethren. His anointed are designated and commissioned to be his witnesses to </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">the peoples of the nations.</span><span class="font7"> The witness must be given in the way that God has provided for it to be given, and must be prompted by love. His way is to place before the people the message of good news, that they may feed their minds upon it. His blessing has been upon those who call from door to door and place the printed message in the hands of the people. That is proof that such is his way and is pleasing to him. The motive must be an unselfish desire to aid the people and above all to vindicate the name of Jehovah. All who have entered into the joy of the Lord will delight so to do.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Your Father which is in heaven is perfect.—Matt. 5:48.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The primary attributes of Jehovah God are power, justice, wisdom and love; and these always operate in perfect accord and for the ultimate benefit of all his creation. He is supreme, the Almighty God; which means that there is no limitation of his power. He is therefore the Most High, from whom proceeds all rightful authority. He deals justly, and his determinations are always right. Being absolutely just, he can do no wrong; in him is no partiality. He is the source of wisdom, and his wisdom is perfect. Jehovah God is love. Perfect unselfishness is expressed in all his actions. He is in the heavens, The Great Spirit invisible to human eyes. &quot;Be thou exalted, 0 God, above all heavens.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">They rest not day and night, saying, Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, which was, and is, and is to come.—Rev. 4:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">God’s organization praises him for what he is. He is the omnipotent God, and his power knows no limitation. He was the Almighty God of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and of the holy prophets. He is &quot;the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ”, &quot;the Father of mercies and the God of all comfort. ” He is holy; and when his indignation is expressed against the god of evil, nothing can or will successfully withstand him. He is the all-powerful God of hosts, which means that all opposition must fall before his advancing army. When he goes into action, even the head of the enemy organization and all parts thereof shall be broken. His greatness and his majesty are beyond comparison with any other.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">•Number of song, selected from &quot;Songs of Praise to Jehovah&quot; and in harmony with the day’s comment, follows to right of data</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Beek ye first the kingdom of God., and his righteousness.—Matt. 6:33.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Having delivered Jehovah’s laws to the children of Israel, Moses advised them saying: “It shall be our righteousness, if we observe to do all these commandments before the Lord our God, as he hath commanded us. ” But righteousness means more than merely keeping God’s law. True righteousness is in having the approval of Jehovah, which results to those who do the will of God out of a pure and devoted heart. The kingdom heir is not righteous merely because he has been brought into the family of God through Christ Jesus. He must prove his devotion to God and obey his commandments out of a sincere heart, and by so doing receive the Lord’s approval. Thus he will be seeking God’s righteousness and not his own.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">January 4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">(302)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed.—Gen. 3:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Since the seed of the woman is to bruise the head of the serpent, which is the Devil and his organized power, it follows that the seed of the woman is God's instrument; and therefore the woman symbolizes God's organization, which is sometimes called Zion. God is the Father or Life-giver; Zion is the mother, which gives birth to the government and to the individuals making up that government of righteousness. Zion gave birth to the new Nation in 1914; war in heaven followed and “that old serpent, called the Devil'', was east down. Now the dragon is wroth with the woman and has gone to make war against the remnant of her seed alive on the earth. The time for enmity between this seed and the serpent is here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Oh that thou wouldest rend the heavens, that thou wouldest come down, that the mountains might flow down at thy presence.—Isa. 64:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">These are words of earnest prayer unto Jehovah. These words, which now become the prayer of the “servant” class, are so definite that they show that the “servant” class know that the time has come for the overthrow of the evil one’s organization and for the establishment of God’s kingdom and the complete vindication of his name. They, the “remnant” class, therefore pray for a great demonstration of God’s power and majesty before all the nations of earth that all may realize that Jehovah is the only true God. They are the only ones that really pray for God’s kingdom to be set up and for his will to be done on earth. They are really anxious to see God’s government in operation for man’s betterment. They fully realize that Jehovah’s name has been pushed aside and that now the time has come for his name to be exalted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">January 6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(278)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Behold, a king shall reign in righteousness, and princes shall rule in judgment.—Isa. 32:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font6">prince is the son of a king. Princes are leaders or head men among the people. The ancient faithful men of Israel were called “fathers”, but will no longer have that title when they are brought forth from the dead. (Ps. 45:16) These men will become the children of Christ because they receive their blessings through Christ, and hence they will properly be called “princes”. In this capacity they will be the visible representatives of God’s government on earth and will constitute the head ones or leaders amongst the people to lead them in the way of righteousness. The people will recognize them as the visible rulers </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">or </span><span class="font6">deputies of the divine kingdom of righteousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">As the mountains are round about Jerusalem, so the Lord is round about his people from henceforth even for ever.—Ps. 125:2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The mountains round about Jerusalem furnish a natural protection for the people thereof; and even bo the Lord Jehovah is round about his people “from henceforth even for ever”. Undoubtedly the word &quot;henceforth” means that now has come God’s fixed time to have his name exalted, and that from this time forward and for evermore the anointed of the Lord shall have his protection while they are proclaiming his name. These faithful ones have entered into the secret place of the Most High; and there, abiding under the shadow of the Almighty, no enemy can do them injuiy. “Henceforth” marks the time when Zion, which is God’s organization, must take the field in offensive action against the enemy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">January 8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">(180)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">For </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands, . . . but into heaven itself, now to appear</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">in the presence of God for us.—Heb. 9:24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The perfect human life for mankind’s ransom was laid down on earth. The value of it must be presented in heaven. It must there be presented by some one who had access to heaven. Jehovah could have appointed some one else to present the value thereof as a sin-offering. It pleased him to give his Son the honor of thus presenting the value of that life, and to this end God raised up Jesus out of death to the divine nature. When Jesus ascended into heaven he appeared in Jehovah God’s presence and presented the value of his human life as a sin-offering; but at that time it was applied only for those who should be brought to God by faith during this period of sacrifice. It was for us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The dead praise not the Lord. . . . But we will bless the Lord from this time forth and for evermore. Praise the Lord.—Ps. 115:17,18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The name of Jehovah God is worthy of all praise. He is the complete expression of unselfishness. “We which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord” now have the privilege of blessing him “from this time forth” by showing forth his praises. His name will continue to be exalted. The creation invisible to man shall send forth his praises. All the visible governing factors of the new earth, and all creatures subject thereto, will praise his holy name. The mighty mountains will lift their hoary heads in songs of praise. The broad fields will declare the honor of God’s name. The trees of the wood, clothed in garments of verdure and beauty, will rejoice; and every creature that breathes and lives shall join in the grand hallelujah chorus and “praise the Lord”.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send, and who wiU go for us T—Isa. 6: 8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Isaiah had a vision and heard the voice of the Lord speaking to him. That picture foreshadowed God’s people at this time who make up the “faithful and wise servant” class. They respond to the Lord’s invitation, saying in effect: “Here am I; send me.” The truly consecrated ones are now able to see what God wants them to do on earth at this time. The issue is now clearly stated, to wit: Who is God! Who then is on the Lord’s side! Who will joyfully be a witness to the name of the Lord God! Let all who have answered, “I,” look well to the provision that God has made for the giving of the witness and then quickly avail themselves of such provision and participate in singing forth the honor of his name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end. . . . The zeal of the Lord of hosts will perform this.—Isa. 9: 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Lord of hosts is the great Jehovah who knew and formulated his purposes from the beginning. In perfect wisdom he made his plan, and there can be no successful hindrances to carrying out his purposes. One of his great purposes is to establish a government of righteousness on earth. After affording his creatures ample opportunity to feel the iron hand of the cruel oppressor and to observe the oft-repeated hypocritical plans of men for reform and relief, then he will reveal to all his government which shall dash to pieces all wickedness. In his government there shall be no vacillating or uncertain policies, nor any oppressors, fraudulent politicians or hypocritical teachers. His government must be righteous, equitable, and true, and will claim and have the absolute confidence of all honest creatures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">January 12 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">(62)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">God is faithful, by whom ye were called unto the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord.—lCor.1: 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The call of and by Jehovah is a summons to the one who has consecrated himself, to discharge a particular or specific duty. Fellowship, properly understood, means partnership. It means an association of one with another, a participating with another in a certain work. Jehovah summoned his beloved Son to discharge the duties of great High Priest, that is to say, to fill the office of executive unto God in the outworking of his plan. God then condescended to call others to participate with Christ Jesus in that work, that is, to have fellowship or partnership with him therein. God plainly defines the duties of such while on earth, and likewise has revealed some of the duties that will devolve upon these called ones in heaven. Such must do God’s will while on earth, and that joyfully.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">By myself have I sworn, saith the Lord; ... in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed.—Gen. 22:16-18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Why did Jehovah give his oath to Abraham in addition to his word I May it not be properly said that by his oath God expressed his pleasure in Abraham’s faith and obedience ? Jehovah said: “Because thou hast done this thing, ... I will bless thee, and . . . multiply thy seed.” This would indicate God’s pleasure and that more stimulus would be given to the performance of the covenant to produce a seed through which he will bless all the nations of the earth. But the Apostle Paul tells us that the oath of God was added for confirmation for the benefit of the Christians, that they might be assured of the unchangeableness of God’s counsel and thereby have their hope strengthened.—Heb. 6:17,18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">January 14 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">(158)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Lord answered me, and said, . . . The vision is yet for an appointed time, . . . though it tarry, wait for it.—Hab. 2:2,3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The vision here mentioned undoubtedly means the revelation of God to his church concerning his presence and his plan. Habakkuk pictures the faithful members of Christ’s body during the period of the church’s activities as represented by Elijah, within which period all the fundamental truths were restored. The great revelation was concerning God’s kingdom; it was made plain that he who understood it might run in the race-eourse. It was for a definitely appointed time. That “appointed time” ended in 1918. The setting up of the kingdom seemed to be delayed, but it was not delayed. The Lord came to his temple in 1918; and thereafter the “vision” or revelation was made clear even as it could not have been before that time, because it must “wait” for God’s due time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">She conceived again, and bare a son: and she said, Now will 1 praise the Lord: therefore she called his name Judah.—Gen. 29:35.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">For the birth of Judah Jacob’s wife Leah praised the Lord and named the child to his praise. According to God’s promise (Gen. 49:10) the descent of earth’s rightful Ruler must be through the line of this child Judah. The name Judah means </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">praise. </span><span class="font6">Jacob prophesied: “Judah, thou art he whom thy brethren shall praise.’’ The Mighty One whom Judah foreshadowed is called “the Lion of the tribe of Juda”. This shows that the Mighty One foretold would praise Jehovah God, and that he in turn would be praised for his faithfulness to God and his praise should arise from all creation in God’s due time. “In that day shall this song be sung in the land of Judah: . . . In the Lord Jehovah is everlasting strength.”— Isa. 26:1-4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">January 16 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">(138)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">That ye may with one mind and one mouth glorify God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Rom. 15:6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah God’s anointed ones have every reason for now singing forth his praises. Because of their filial relationship they will praise him. He has adopted them into his family and made them younger brethren of Christ Jesus. He has given to them his spirit, and upon condition of continued faithfulness under affliction he will make them joint-heirs with his beloved Son. There exists between Jehovah and his anointed ones that touching relationship of a loving father who always unselfishly cares for his own, and of a loving son whose privilege and duty it is to be always obedient and faithful to his father. That confidence and love for the Father leads his anointed ones to proclaim always the praises of their great Benefactor and Life-giver.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Make a breastpiece for giving sentence. . . . And thou shalt set therein a setting of stones, four</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">rows of stones.—Ex. 28:15,17, Rotherham.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The suggestion that the high priest’s breastplate represented the law covenant with Israel is not consistent with the facts. The law covenant produced nothing beautiful. The breastplate symbolizes rather the covenant by sacrifice; its twelve gem stones picture the full number of the members of Christ's body, described as being selected in twelve divisions. Christ Jesus, the great High Priest, is Head over all these body members, and he is “altogether lovely”. To him is committed all judgment in heaven and in earth. His faithful body members will be associated with him in such judging work and giving of sentence. Jehovah’s will shall be revealed through The Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">January 18 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">(4)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father’s good pleasure to give you the kingdom.—Luke 12:32.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A more critical version renders the above: “the dear little flock” These indeed are dear to Jehovah because as his servants, following in the footsteps of the Master, their purpose is to honor the name of God both by their living and by their service. Because of their faithful devotion to the Lord God unto the end the promise is that they shall have the highest place in his favor open to his creatures. That place of favor is to be with Christ Jesus in his throne and to enjoy eternal life on the divine plane. These are to be given the kingdom with Christ Jesus the Head. They do not merely enjoy the blessings of the kingdom but they are to be joint-heirs with Christ and to reign with </span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font6"> in his kingdom. If faithful, they need never fear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The sum of thy word is truth, and age-abiding is every one of thy righteous regulations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Ps. 119:160, Rotherham.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah’s Word is his will expressed. He has caused a record thereof to be made for the instruction and learning of those who follow in the footsteps of his beloved Son. By a study of his Word God’s will is ascertained. By giving heed to that Word and obeying its instructions one walks in the right way. The Word of the Lord is always a safe guide; whereas the word of man, unsupported by the Word of God, is a delusion and a snare. Such is worldly wisdom and is foolishness in Jehovah’s sight. The divine Word sets forth God’s judgments and his righteous regulations for the government of his orga</span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">niza</span><span class="font6">tion, Zion. In obedience thereto there is wisdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">January 20 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">(152)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">And the spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him. . . . And righteousness shall be the girdle of his loins, and faithfulness the girdle of his reins.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Isa. 11:2,5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah will manage public affairs through the righteous government. That of itself is an absolute guarantee that the result to the people will be for the best. His administration will be actively carried on by his King, the One anointed with his spirit, who is ‘Priest of the Most High God after the order of Melchizedek’. The administration of this government now proceeds The next act of Jehovah is his judgment upon the nations. Before this judgment falls it is his purpose to give the people a chance to know about it. Hence it is written: ‘ ‘ The Lord is in his holy temple: let all the earth keep silence before him. ’ ’—Hab. 2: 20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Open </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">thou inine eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of thy law.—Ps. 119:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">Am</span><span class="font6">ong the blessings the “remnant” now enjoys is to be permitted to see that there is but one Jehovah God and that they are his children by adoption into the body of Christ; that his Word is their reliable guide; that he has put his Word in their mouths and covered them with the shadow of his hand and will not permit them to be deceived by the enemy or any of his schemes; that they have been brought into “the secret place of the Most High” and, if faithful, shall abide there; that “the Lord is in his holy temple” and has appointed them as his witnesses and has commanded them to sing forth his praises while he goes into action against the enemy organization. As soldiers in his organization they must keep his law and perform their assigned duties.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">January 22 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">(35)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">He coiled you by our gospel, to the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.—2 Thess. 2:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The new creature in Christ must give all diligence to making his calling and election sure. He must be diligent in performing his part of the covenant. The body of flesh, being a part of the new creature, must serve God. To make his calling and election sure means that he must make it firm, stable and certain; and this is done by the joyful performance of the will of God in harmony with the terms of his covenant, Thus only shall he obtain the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ. Hence, serving the Lord with mind, will, heart and body is essential to the well-being of the new creature. In no other way can one grow into the likeness of the Head, Christ Jesus, and praise Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah is my strength and my song; he also is become my salvation.—Isa. 12:2,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is Jehovah who saves. No matter how faithful another might be, no matter what good may or may not be said of a brother, the truly anointed will not be influenced thereby but will realize that their strength is in the Lord and that he is the one that gives salvation. Trusting implicitly in him they declare his praises and exalt his name. Such are really joyful in the Lord because they are strong in him and in the power of his might. God has made known his power to them. He supplies the garments of salvation by which they identify themselves as his and that they are saved and in the condition of salvation. Trusting in him they sing: “Behold, God is my salvation; I will trust, and not be afraid.' ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">January 24 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">(74)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Lord thy God, he is God, the faithful God, which keepeth covenant and mercy with them that love him and keep his commandments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Deut. 7:9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah always keeps his covenants inviolate. He is repeatedly referred to as a covenant-keeping God. When the other party in the covenant becomes unfaithful to God and breaks his promise, then Jehovah is not obligated to fulfil any part thereof to such covenant-breaker. He does not restrict himself, however, from showing mercy to those who have broken their covenant by reason of weakness or by being overreached. Where a man’s heart remains true to God, God shows mercy unto that one. Jehovah unselfishly binds himself to the performance of his covenant, not for his own good or profit, however. If the covenanting one is faithful, God knows that the outcome will be for that one’s good; hence he encourages the covenanter to be faithful.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace.—Horn. 11:5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is the faithful remnant that delight to obey God’s commands in proclaiming the good news. If any one anointed by the Lord fails to be of the remnant class it is his own fault and is due to pride, indifference or negligence. It might ordinarily be expected that the greatest event in man’s history, to wit, the coming in of the government of righteousness, would be hailed by the multitudes. Not so! It has pleased God to make announcement by those wholly devoted to him and who trust in him regardless of all opposition. These he uses to do his great and marvelous work. Small in number they are, and without reputation and influence amongst the leaders of the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">January 26 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">(15)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">I the Lord have called thee in righteousness, ... to bring out the prisoners from the prison, and them that sit in darkness out of the prison house.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Isa. 42: 6, 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah indicates in Psalm 102:16-20 that he will loosen these prisoners, and states that it will be when he builds up Zion. That means when the Lord comes to the temple, gathers to himself the faithful ones and covers them with the robe of righteousness. But how will he loose Babylon’s prisoners? In the above words Jehovah addresses the “servant” class as the one whom he has called to that work and of which class the glorified Jesus is the Head. This class now have the consolation of informing their brethren in the Lord, whom the clergy hold as “prisoners”, that the time has come for them to come to the light and take their stand on the Lord's side and to his glory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">I will give them one heart, and I will put a new spirit within you; . . . and they shall be my people, and I will be their God.—Ezek. 11:19,20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The new covenant will be faultless because of the perfection of its Mediator, Christ, and because of his unlimited ability to aid all who desire to be blessed. Hence it will result beneficially to all mankind who obey its law. Its purpose is reconciliation of man to God, and it will successfully result in such. Its effects will be to make kind the heart of man. Those making progress on the King’s highway will be doing good to one another and giving glory to God. While they are thus striving to obey the law as included in the new covenant, Jehovah through Christ will be writing his law in their minds and hearts. They will devote themselves to him as their God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">January 28 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">(337)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Ye are my brethren, ye are my bones and my flesh: wherefore then are ye the last to bring back the kingf—2 Sam. 19:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">David, typical of Christ Jesus, sent his priests to the elders of Judah, reminding them that they were his brethren, by reason of which an obligation rested upon them. For, as leaders, it was their duty to be the first to welcome back Israel’s king, that their influence might be used for good. All the anointed ones now on earth are Christ’s brethren; and the obligation rests specially upon the elders, wbo have been made leaders amongst his people on earth, to welcome back the King and to declare this fact with joy. Any failing to do this place their influence on the opposite side and against God’s anointed King.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">And the Lord shall smite Egypt; he shall smite and heal it: and they shall return even to the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Isa. 19:22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When Moses and Aaron went down into Egypt as Jehovah’s representatives, they served notice upon Pharaoh of God’s purpose. Failing to heed such notice and warning, Pharaoh and all Egypt were brought into great trouble. Notice must similarly be served on the world today. Also, the people must be told that Jehovah is the only true God and that their blessings come from him through The Christ. This is the comforting news that must be carried to the people as a witness before God dashes to pieces Satan’s organization. Following the giving of this witness and following Armageddon in which God will smite the world (Egypt), he will heal the people of earth and will bring to them the blessings they have so long desired.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">January 30 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">(109)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">I will praise thee; for I am fearfully and wonderfully made.—Ps. 139:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We need only to look at man to see how marvelously he is made. Of all intricate electrical systems man has devised, none can begin to compare with the wonderful nervous system of the human body. In the head is the brain, wherein is the seat of the will and mind. To the sober-thinking man it is apparent that nothing short of the Infinite One could have formed man. Marveling at the vast knowledge displayed in the creation of man, God’s prophet exclaimed: &quot;Such knowledge is too wonderful for me; it is high, I cannot attain unto it.” More wonderfully made will be The Christ complete, which in its unity and close cooperation of members is pictured by the the human body. What praises it will render unto its Creator!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">When thou passest through the waters, I will be with thee; . . . when thou walkest through the fire, thou shalt not be burned; neither shall the flame kindle upon thee.—Isa. 43:2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Of natural Israel it is written: “We went through fire and water.’’ Of course there must be fiery experiences ahead for the anointed class; otherwise this promise would not be made. But those who love the Lord will not be thinking of what reputation they may or may not have amongst men. Being advised of “the secret place of the Most High’’, and having the witness of the holy spirit that they are dwelling there; having also the assurance that almighty power is exerted in their behalf and that Jehovah’s purpose toward them is to bring them through victorious, they must not hesitate to perform joyfully the commission that the Lord God has laid upon them. Conditions surrounding them may be such as to strike terror to natural hearts; but none of the remnant will fear, because the Lord of hosts is with them as their strength and shield.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Then shall the Son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all.—1 Cor. 15:28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The members of the body of Christ are reconciled </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font6">God at the moment of their justification, and this by reason of faith in Jesus’ blood, which faith they manifested by a full consecration, subjecting themselves to Jehovah’s will. The peoples of earth will receive reconciliation or justification at the end of the thousand-year judgment day, symbolized by reaching the extreme end of the King’s highway. With the reconciliation complete, with Satan and all other enemies destroyed, with all in heaven and in earth gathered together under Christ, then will Christ Jesus also be subject to Jehovah, the great Head of The Christ. Then God will be all in all, and all shall be to his glory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">We have a strong city; salvation will God appoint for walls and bulwarks.—Isa. 26:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah’s prophet declares that “in that day shall this [above] song be sung in the land of Judah”, the royal tribe. Having assured his royal heirs on earth that they have a “strong city”, or organization, in him and that he has appointed complete protection and defense for its salvation, Jehovah cries out: “Open ye the gates, that the righteous nation which keepeth the truth may enter in.” The earthly members of God’s “holy nation” are at the gates of the kingdom of his Christ. They march on in his service with God’s banner of love over them, knowing that victory is soon and certain, because henceforth and for evermore the great name of Jehovah shall be exalted. They are kept in complete peace, because they joyfully obey his commandments and trust in him through Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">February 3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">(68)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The temple of God was opened in heaven, . . . and there were lightnings, and voices, and thunderings, and an earthquake, and great hail.—Rev. 11:19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Since 1918 the Lord has been in his holy temple for the judgment of his righteous ones, and “the temple of God [has been] opened in heaven”. It was after the Lord came to the temple, to wit, about 1919, that the lightnings of God revealed to his people that a great witness work foreshadowed by Elisha must be done. The Lord’s lightnings have since been seen by his devoted remnant, enabling them to see more clearly the significance of “the testament”, the covenant by sacrifice, and thus more fully to understand their duties, obligations and privileges toward the Lord, Jehovah’s thundering voice has also been heard by these faithful ones, and they have joined their little voices thereto, singing forth the honor of his name. Probably the earthquake and hail are soon to follow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">TAe </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">law maketh men high priests which have infirmity; but the word of the oath, which was since the law, maketh the Son, who is consecrated for evermore.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Heb. 7:28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At the Jordan the covenant by sacrifice was made, and there Jehovah gave his oath that Christ Jesus should be for ever a priest of the Most High God after the order of Melchisedec, and from that there should never be a change. Jesus was a perfect man at Jordan, and there the sacrificial duties were added to his office as priest and he sacrificed himself. There he consecrated himself and now he is “perfected for evermore”. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">(R. V.) </span><span class="font6">By the word and oath of God he performs the office of priest for evermore, which includes the work of sacrifice. From that time forward all sacrifices offered to Jehovah must be offered by him, Jesus, the great High Priest. The body members of Christ are merely assistants to the Priest, Jesus, who is the acceptable sacrifice and who makes the offering for sin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">February 5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(325)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">For we are labourers together with God: ye are God’s husbandry, ye are God’s building.—1 Cor. 3:9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Workers together cooperate. All in the truth should cooperate with each other to the Lord’s praise. Remembering that The Christ is “God’s building” and that he sets the members in the body as it pleases him, each one should strive to do his part with full respect to and consideration of the other members of the body, because such is the Lord’s way. This is not a fear of man, but a fear to do contrary to the Lord’s appointed way. Cooperation in serving the Lord is true fellowship between Christians. All who are in the Lord are laborers together with God and partners with Christ Jesus; and all should colabor. This is the reason why the Lord’s people consist of those who are working together harmoniously to Jehovah's glory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Because thy lovingkindness is better than life, my lips shall praise thee.—Ps. 63:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">These were the words of David, whose name means “beloved” and who foreshadowed Jesus, the beloved Son of God. The covenant which God made with David is really made and applies between God and his beloved Son Christ Jesus. This covenant includes what are called “the sure mercies of David”. (Isa. 55:3) The Hebrew word for “mercies” here is the same as the word rendered “lovingkindness” above, and means the extraordinary goodness which Jehovah delights to show toward his Beloved, The Christ, including both Jesus the Head and those whom Jehovah justifies, brings forth and anoints with his spirit as members of Christ’s body. Because this loving-kindness is better than what natural h</span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">uman</span><span class="font6"> life embraces, these members “offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of [their] lips”.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Thou hast magnified thy word above all thy name. —Ps. 138:2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The term &quot;word” means utterance, declaration, oracle, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">promise.</span><span class="font6"> (Rotherham) Jehovah God has not pushed his name to the fore. During all the centuries he has kept his word of promise to the fore in this, that he has always had some one on the earth who has borne witness to his word of promise. When Jesus came he magnified the promise of his Father. The faithful Christians throughout this era have done the same thing. Now ‘the seed of promise’ is about completed and the time is at hand when the Lord will magnify his holy name before mankind. The issue will then be finally determined against Satan and in favor of Jehovah. His name will be exalted among all his creatures on a parity with his word of promise, and then all will know that his name is above all and worthy to be praised.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">If I whet my glittering sword, and mine hand take hold on judgment, I will render vengeance to mine enemies.—Deut. 32:41.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Christ Jesus is Jehovah’s Arm and his Sword. One of his titles is “The Word of God’’. When the due time arrives for God to go forth to the battle, he whets his Sword and sends his great Priest forth to lead the fight. The lightnings of God proceed from and through his Word, “the sword of the spirit.” Therefore at the time Jehovah whets his glittering Sword his lightnings flash, illuminating the minds of his anointed, making known God’s purposes concerning them, and exposing the position and the action of the enemy. The truth and light that Jehovah sheds upon his Word today are strong corroborative evidence that we are in “that day” when the forces are gathering for Armageddon. These truths encourage and strengthen the minds and hearts of the people of God. With joy they sing forth the honor of his name.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">So then because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spue thee out of my mouth.—Rev. 3:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">If, after the lukewarm ones have due notice, they refuse to be assimilated into the active working force of God’s organization and try to rest on their laurels and their past record and their own goodness, the Lord will vomit them out of his mouth as a disgusting and disapproved thing. Because the Lord loves those who have made a covenant to do God’s will and who yet are not zealous, he rebukes them that they may repent. Hence the inference must be indulged that if such repent and show the zeal peculiar to God’s house they will be fully reinstated in God's favor. But those who are given the opportunity and who yet do not arouse themselves and change their course of action, such will lose the anointing and will be relegated to the “great multitude” class or go into utter darkness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Now gather thyself in troops, 0 daughter of troops; he hath laid siege against us.—Mic. 5:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">God’s people have made an emphatic declaration against Satan and for Jehovah. That means a fight. &quot;Jehovah of hosts” is the mighty God of troops coming forth to war, and Christ Jesus, the ‘Ruler out of Bethlehem’, is the Field Marshal going forth in his name to make war. The remnant class must take its place in the battle array. Being faithful to the Lord, they must and do present a solid, compact body against the enemy and for the Lord. They pray for peace in their own ranks and put forth their best endeavors to see that their course of action is in harmony with “present truth”. Their part is to sing forth the honor of Jehovah’s name both during the preparations for the conflict and while the battle is being fought.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">February 11 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">(138)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">In Judah is God known; his name is great in Israel. —Ps. 76:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Since the Lord has gathered his people into the temple condition those of Zion in particular have known Jehovah God. His name is great to those who are really devoted to him and who are pictured by the royal tribe of Judah. But Jehovah is not known to the people outside of his organization. Hence the great issue now is: Who is God, and who shall rule the world f Hence, also, he is having his people of Zion, spiritual Israelites, tell the people of the world who Jehovah is, though few of them will hear, believe and take heed, as the Scriptures indicate. Therefore says the prophet: “Behold, the Lord cometh out of his place.” This indicates that up to a time certain Jehovah keeps himself secret, unrevealed, unknown and unrecognized; and that the time comes when he will “come down” from heaven in a manifestation of power and make himself known outside of his organization Zion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Behold, thou shalt call a nation that thou knowest not; and nations that knew not thee shall run unto thee, because of the Lord thy God.—Isa. 55:5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The above words are addressed to Zion, that &quot;holy nation” of which Christ Jesus is the Head and which calls the nations of earth over which Christ shall rule. These nations have not known Zion nor what Zion signifies. When the nations and peoples come to know that Zion is God’s organization, and that their blessings come from it, then, as Isaiah prophesies, &quot;the ransomed of the Lord shall return, and come to Zion with songs.” The nations will be seeking the way to come into harmony with God and will leam that it lies through Jesus, the Head of Zion. The people will leam that Jehovah has glorified those whom he has taken into his ‘everlasting covenant with David’, and that Zion is his instrument to bear blessings </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">to</span><span class="font6"> the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">February 13 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">(324)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Ye </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—1 Pet. 2:9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Out of darkness the Lord has called his people for a purpose and has put his name upon them. In advance of others of mankind he has given his faithful ones a vision of his gracious purposes. These faithful ones are now made his witnesses. Every one now holding fast and remaining faithful to the end shall see the complete triumph of Jehovah and the burning issue finally and for ever determined to his glory and honor. Their own reward will be an everlasting dwelling-place in the house of the Lord. It is their duty and blessed privilege to beseech their brethren and fellow workers in the field now to join them by participating in the service of Jehovah in showing forth his praises and virtues.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.—John 3:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It was the love of God that provided the sacrifice for man’s redemption. Adam had sinned and lost life; and now Jehovah would allow a sacrificial course to be taken by some one, that the sinner might have that sacred gift of life renewed. Jehovah required no one to take this sacrificial course; hence the sacrificial arrangement was the outgrowth of love. The sacrifice would be just as much on God’s part as on the part of the other party to the covenant by sacrifice, because God alone could provide and arrange for the sacrifice. The entire arrangement was of God’s own volition and by the willing agreement on the part of the other one to the covenant “Not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins. ’ ’—1 John 4:10.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Surely he shall deliver thee . . . from the noisome pestilence. Thou shalt not be afraid . . . for the pestilence that wdlketh in darkness.—Ps. 91:3,5,6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font6">pestilence is </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">destructive plague. The noisome pestilence from which Jehovah delivers his “hidden ones” is the destructive plague resulting from covetousness and ambition and a wicked desire to possess at any cost what belongs to another and to take control of that of which the Lord alone has control; this leads to gross wickedness. Fear of the enemy or his organization is likewise a pestilence, because it is destructive of faith, and faith is essential to the safety of the Christian. Where there is no vision, there is no light, and absence of faith results. (Prov. 29:18) Where faith grows weak, fear takes hold. The pestilence that walks in darkness is this fear that lays hold upon the Christian because of darkness. Only those who put their' trust in the Lord are safe therefrom.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Behold, God is my salvation. . . . Therefore with joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of salvation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Isa. 12:2,3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Water is a symbol of truth, but the knowledge of the truth alone does not bring salvation. It is the truth known and used according to God’s will which brings his approval and the salvation of the faithful. A well is a fountain or source of water. The truth comes from Jehovah, “the fountain of living waters.’’ Drawing water from the wells of salvation would therefore symbolize taking from the fountain of truth the great truths which God provides for his people and using these truths according to the commandments of the Lord. Since the Lord has come to his temple the waters of truth have been made much clearer to God’s faithful witnesses than ever before. The faithful are refreshed by the waters of truth which they continue to draw from the wells of salvation. This they do with joy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">February 17 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">035)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Who didst set signs and wonders in the land of Egypt, even unto this day, both in Israel and among other men; and modest thee a name, as at</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">this day.—J er. 32:20, A. R. V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This scripture has been erroneously applied to the pyramid of Gizeh. But the “signs and wonders in the land of Egypt’’, here mentioned, and that which Isaiah says “shall be for a sign and for a witness unto the Lord of hosts in the land of Egypt ... in that day”, both refer to that faithful company of Jesus’ followers today, who are called God’s “remnant”. They were foreshadowed by Isaiah and his sons, who said: “Behold, I and the children whom the Lord hath given me are for </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">signs</span><span class="font6"> and for </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">wonders</span><span class="font6"> in Israel from the Lord of hosts.” In this day when Jehovah makes a name for himself this “remnant” does what it can to exalt the name of Jehovah; this is the purpose for which God 'did set’ them in this world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">A sower went forth to sow: and when he sowed, some seeds . . . fell into good ground, and brought forth fruit, some an hundredfold, some sixtyfold, some thirtyfold.—Matt. 13:3,4,8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This parable seems to have a complete fulfilment at this end of the Christian era. The fruitage of the seeds in good ground was that which God desired to have for his purposes at the harvest time, which comes at the end of the world. At that time he not only brings his own to the condition of ripening, but he also causes the harvest of the earth to ripen and be gathered. At this time men have taken an independent attitude toward God and are defiant of him; but at this same time God brings forth his “people for his name’’, whom he has prepared for himself and for his purpose. According to the measure of their faithfulness (represented by the fold of fruitage yielded) they are used by him for his purposes.—Matt. 13: 23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">February 19 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(327)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">For he spake, and it was done; he commanded, and it stood fast.—Ps. 33:9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Scriptures show that the all-wise and all-powerful Jehovah has a perfect and complete organization to take care of all his universe. He delegates duties to the various members of this organization who go as his representatives. His beloved Son, Christ Jesus, is his Chief Executive Officer among them. They act and speak and treat for him and in his name and by his authority. By this arrangement it is the same in effect as if Jehovah himself went and were present and acted personally. It is in his name and by his power and under his direction that these heavenly representatives perform their duties. What more could be necessary than this to see that the thing that God willed is always done! God’s remnant now on earth are privileged to be part of this organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">February 20 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">(229)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Take away all iniquity, and receive us graciously: so will we render the calves [boldness, Rotherham] of our lips.—Hos. 14:2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Prophet Isaiah describes a seraph as taking a live coal from God’s altar and applying it to the mouth of God’s mouthpiece and saying: ‘‘Lo, this hath touched thy lips; and thine iniquity is taken away.” Realizing this picture as fulfilled toward them, Jehovah’s anointed ones may ask with confidence that God will graciously receive them, and such will render unto him the calves, the fruit, the boldness, of their lips. It is with the lips that we give praise; strength is in the calves of the lips. Therefore the calves of the lips represent the strength of the lips. This means that the anointed ones give the strength of their song of praise unto Jehovah. ‘' This also shall please the Lord better than an ox or bullock that hath horns and hoofs.”—Ps. 69: 30, 31.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">February 21 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">(148)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Let God arise, let his enemies be scattered.—Ps. 68:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">David foreshadowed the people of Zion today, and, marking the course of the great wicked organization of the enemy, put the above prayer into the mouth of God’s remnant in the earth. These words are in exact accord with the truth which the Prophet Isaiah records, saying: ‘‘Oh that thou wouldest rend the heavens, that thou wouldest come down, that the mountains might flow down at thy presence, ... to make thy name known to thine adversaries, that the nations may tremble at thy presence!” These words foreshadow the same class that pray unto God, as David does. The fact that God had these prayers kept in his record is proof that in his due time his course of action will be an answer to and in harmony with such prayers of his faithful ones, and such faithful ones will know it. Let Jehovah’s faithful witnesses today continue in such prayers, and take courage and press on in the work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Lord magnified Solomon exceedingly . . . and bestowed upon him such royal majesty, as had not been on any king before him in Israel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—1 Chron. 29:25.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Solomon’s name means “peaceful one”. His reign was marked by peace, wisdom, riches and glory; and “Judah and Israel dwelt safely, every man under his vine and under his fig tree, from Dan even to Beersheba, all the days of Solomon”. Thus, by bestowing great riches and wisdom upon Solomon and by making his reign one of peace and prosperity, Jehovah gave his implied promise that in due time he would establish a government on earth amongst men and that the ruler thereof, his anointed One, he would clothe With power and wisdom and riches and glory beyond that of any other. Jesus referred to himself as the “greater than Solomon”, thereby identifying himself as the One whom Solomon foreshadowed. If faithful unto death, we shall share his throne.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">February 23 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">(143)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Look unto -me, and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth; for I am God, and there is none else.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Isa. 45:22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">Am</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">ong </span><span class="font6">all the benefits that men will receive under the righteous government, the greatest will be to know God. He is the everlasting One, who created heaven and earth. No human eye will ever see God, but all human creatures will have the opportunity to discern him and his loving-kindness. Then they will understand why God at stated intervals made his name prominent before his creatures that they might learn to look unto him for their salvation. Man desires above all things else to have life in happiness. Since no creature can with propriety take away life without God’s consent, it follows that no creature could enjoy life eternal in happiness without God’s consent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Thou shalt guide me with thy counsel, and afterward receive me to glory.—Ps. 73:24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">God’s counsel is in his Word. There is no other way for the Christian to be guided than by that Word. It is food that is &quot;convenient” for the anointed, which means that his Word builds up the anointed into Christ. The building up into Christ means growing m the likeness of the Lord Jesus, that is, in a full and whole-souled devotion to Jehovah God. It is from the divine Word that the anointed learn from God and concerning him. They know that he is the Supreme One, the Creator of heaven and earth and the Giver of life to all, and that there is no other god like unto him. By faithfully following and conforming to his counsel unto the death, their progress toward and their being received into the divine glory promised are certain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">February 25 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">(335)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">I raised thee up, . . . that my name may be declared throughout all the earth.—Ex. 9:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">That which Jehovah did to Egypt to vindicate his name foreshadowed the manner in which he will vindicate his name in the minds of all men and before all creation before the final end of Satan’s organization. Jehovah's reputation has long been at stake. This has resulted from the opposition of Satan. This opposition has grown to such an extent that the masses of mankind know not God. His name must be brought before them because all life proceeds from him. His good name, fame and reputation must be set properly before the minds of his creatures. Hence the vindication of God’s name is not for a selfish purpose on his part but for the good of those who desire life. Now, surely, is the time for the anointed to bear witness to his name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">In that day I will call my servant Eliakim. . . . And the key of the house of David will I lay upon his shoulder.—Isa. 22:20,22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Lord’s coming to his temple indicated the time for ousting from stewardship the class represented by Shebna and for installing in that office those pictured by Eliakim. Eliakim means “whom God will raise up or ordain, establish and strengthen and help”. He therefore fitly illustrates the faithful “remnant” of Jehovah who constitute his servant and witness on the earth today. The prophecy shows that this class is clothed with the robe, which pictures approval; and is strengthened with a girdle, as marking an approved servant of the Lord; and the government is committed into its hands, indicating that the kingdom interests are placed in the hands of God’s servant class; and the key of David’s house is laid upon its shoulder. Great, therefore, are our present privileges and responsibilities toward the house of the true David, Jesus the King. Wonderful are our opportunities, and glorious will be the result to all who are faithful unto the end.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">February 27 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">(238)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">All the earth shall worship thee, and shall sing unto thee; they shall sing to thy name.—Ps. 66:4. </span><span class="font6">When the obedient ones of mankind have passed entirely over the King’s highway, and stand upon the earth at the far end of it, completely reconciled to God, then the knowledge of the glory of God will fill the whole earth as the waters cover the sea. Then all the people shall see the majesty and glory of the great Jehovah. Completely reconciled unto him, they will enjoy lasting peace and will fear neither sickness nor death. They will reflect God’s image and likeness and will appreciate that all their blessings have come to them from him through Christ. Feeling the warmth of Jehovah’s love and rejoicing therein, they will sing praises to his name and worship at his footstool.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the heathen through faith, preached before the gospel unto Abraham.—Gal 3:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Justification by faith is a prominent feature, therefore the first part, of the blessings of the Abrahamic covenant. The peoples and nations during Christ’s reign will not be justified by faith; their justification will come at the end of his reign because of full obedience. The Jews received the first blessings of the Abrahamic covenant, as Peter plainly stated to them, saying: &quot;Unto you first, God, having raised up his Son Jesus, sent him to bless you, in turning away every one of you from his iniquities.” Strictly speaking then, the &quot;seed” is the essential One, to wit, Jesus, through whom blessings must come to all. &quot;The heathen,” whom Paul mentions above, must refer then not to the various nations, but to the non-Jews who become members of The Christ, being justified during the Christian era by faith in the shed blood of Christ.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry.—1 Sam. 15:23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Witchcraft means going to the enemy for counsel, while rebellion means to take a course of action against the will of God. Any attempt, therefore, to make peace with the clergy, who are the sons of Satan, means to consort with the enemy and to practise witchcraft and rebellion That means unfaithfulness to our God Stubbornness in accepting Jehovah’s will is as reprehensible as idolatry, because it is a selfish holding out against God’s will. God is gracious to those who try to serve him. He is now making the way plain to those who desire to glorify his name. Such are not expecting or desiring the approval of any of God’s enemies. They have taken their stand on the Lord’s side, and they sing his praises.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Teach me thy way, 0 Lord; I will walk in thy truth: unite my heart to fear thy name.—Ps. 86:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Those who will share with Christ in the rulership of the world will necessarily be required to give orders or directions as to what shall be done. No creature could be capable of giving orders unless he first learns to obey orders that are given to him. This is one of the lessons that each true Christian must be taught It has been one of the hardest to learn. The true follower of Jesus only desires to know God's will, and then he is eager to do it regardless of whom the Lord uses to give the orders. Seeing that Jesus learned obedience by the things which he suffered, he knows that Jehovah will give like discipline to every one who becomes an associate with Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">March 3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(102)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">For since the beginning of the world men have not heard, nor perceived by the ear, neither hath the eye seen a God beside thee, which doeth so for him that waiteth for him.—Isa. 64:4, margin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Paul quotes the above words of Isaiah, and uses them to show that Jehovah “prepared” some special blessings for certain ones. Among the things prepared, these seem to stand out prominently, to wit: (a) a vision of Jehovah’s purposes, and (b) the privilege of intelligently and joyfully cooperating with Jehovah and with his beloved Son in God’s great work. In the light of the context and of facts well known to true Christians today it seems reasonable that Isaiah’s words apply to the “servant” or remnant class from and after 1918, when the Lord came to his temple, and that the fulfilment of the prophecy still progresses. Not all who are begotten of the holy spirit exercise the privilege of enjoying the things prepared. The expression is, “the things which God hath prepared for them that </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">love</span><span class="font6"> </span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font6">,” “for </span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font6"> that </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">waiteth</span><span class="font6"> for him.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Lord lifteth up the meek: he casteth the wicked down to the ground.—Ps. 147:6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">One who has been favored of the Lord and then becomes proud and haughty is wicked in God’s sight, and such God abases. Meekness is one of the qualifications of those who make progress toward the kingdom. When Jesus offered himself to Israel as king he came in meekness. He was not puffed up nor impressed with his great importance; he appreciated that he was Jehovah’s representative. To be meek means not to think more highly of oneself than one ought to think. He ever keeps in mind that whatsoever he has is not by reason of his own greatness but that everything worth while is a gracious gift from Jehovah, the Giver of every good and perfect gift. In meekness he advances God’s kingdom interests.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee the crown of life.—Rev. 2:10, R. V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jesus, as Jehovah’s personal representative, will give the crown of life to each faithful disciple. Our receiving the crown of life would ultimately depend upon holding fast what has been given to us from the Lord. The foolish virgin class does not hold fast to its first love and devotion to the service of the Lord, but the “wise virgins’’ both had the oil of joy in their earthen vessels and have gladly and actively served Jehovah and continue to serve him. When the Lord came to his temple in 1918 such “wise virgins’’ were the ones upon whom he laid the privilege and responsibility of thereafter representing him as God’s anointed King. The crown of life is obtainable for them if they hold fast and continue faithful unto death. The loss of the crown would be indicated on this side the vail by the taking away from one the kingdom interests of the Lord, and this at the time that the Lord is taking account with his servants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">If I forget thee, 0 Jerusalem, let my right hand forget her cunning. If I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Ps. 137:5,6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Babylonish systems try to hinder the Lord’s work in various ways. One way is to invite God’s people to be at peace with them and to sing their songs for them. Some also, who are apparently unfaithful to their anointing, speak to anointed ones who persist in singing God’s praises, saying: “Why not be more considerate with the clergy of Babylon? You might help them. Why not be at peace with them and sing your songs for them?’’ “No!” reply the faithfid remnant, ‘<sup>1</sup>1 will sing praise to my God alone. Otherwise let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth.” They lend not their hand in compromise with the enemy. With face of flint they are set on Jehovah’s side. Songs of contentment and of joy and praise to him unceasingly flow from their lips.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">March 7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">(323)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Pour out thy wrath upon the heathen that have not known thee, and upon the kingdoms that have not called upon thy name.—Ps. 79:6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">One reason why the “remnant” pray this prayer for God’s wrath upon the nations is that he might get himself a name in the minds of the people. This should not be misunderstood; God does not desire a name for vanity’s sake or his own benefit. The enemy has pushed Jehovah’s name into a comer to the serious detriment of the people; hence Jehovah overthrows Satan’s works and power to deliver mankind and to turn their minds to him that they may know his name. The reason therefor is that Jehovah is the source of life and he alone can grant life and blessings to mankind, and his name is involved; for to know him and his Christ, earth’s rightful King, means life eternal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the holy spirit and with power.—Acts 10:38.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At the time of the anointing of Jesus Jehovah conferred upon him the authority and power to be God’s Pnest and Prince. (Acts 5:31) He was there appointed to the office of Priest and Prince for ever after the order of Melchizedek. Let the fact be kept in mind that Melchizedek was a priest upon his throne. As a priest he was a servant of the Most High, and therefore the Most High’s special officer; as a prince he was a ruler or king acting by authority from the Most High. He was a type of the great Ruler who shall rule the world by divine right and authority. It was at the time of his baptism that the authority to be Ruler was conferred upon Jesus. He was clothed with power to destroy, in due time, Satan’s wicked organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">March 9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">(186)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Cast me not away from, thy presence; and take not thy holy spirit from me.—Ps. 51:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The beloved Son of God did always those things which were pleasing to the Father. Therefore the Father’s face was always turned approvingly toward his Son, and he gave not the spirit in limited measure to the Son. In the same way Jehovah looks approvingly upon those now who are covered with the robe of righteousness and the garments of salvation because of lovingly and joyfully fulfilling his commandments ; he has poured his spirit upon them in these “the last days’’. But the wicked, those who now turn from the Lord, lose sight of the presence of Jehovah and his Son, and Jehovah turns his back upon them. When any of the anointed temporarily takes a wrong course and repents, he prays the Lord not to cast him away from God's wondrous favor of today nor to remove his spirit or anointing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">My times are in thy hand: deliver me from the hand of mine enemies, and from them that perse</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">cute me.—Ps. 31:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">God’s prophet had recorded the above saying of Jesus. That was equivalent to Jesus’ saying: ‘I can do nothing save as my Father has planned, and that I will not do and can not do until his due time.’ Jesus therefore makes clear the divine rule, to wit, that the anointed of God can not run ahead of Jehovah and therefore can not accomplish Jehovah’s purposes until the due time, and that when God’s due time arrives his anointed must joyfully do that which Jehovah commands. No true child of God wishes to even appear to run ahead of the Lord; but his desire is always to be in accord with the Lord, always having implicit trust and confidence in God. We may leave to God the disposal of our enemies and persecutors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">March 11 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(38)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Thy word was unto me the joy and rejoicing of mine heart: for I am called by thy name, 0 Lord</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">God of hosts.—J er. 15:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As never before Jehovah’s Word is at this time the joy and rejoicing of the heart of God’s “remnant” class. They, as his witnesses, also have his Word in the form of a definite message which it is a joy and rejoicing unto them to deliver to the rulers and people of the world. By faithfully doing his work they are glorifying his name and are thereby proving that they are the “people for his name”. Jehovah arranged for Moses to be ready for service exactly on time. Just so surely he has arranged to have a people for his name amongst the Gentiles exactly at the time when the witness must be given on earth. They are the feet members of The Christ. They have a definite work, by the grace of the Lord, in helping to establish the kingdom of God on earth. It is the greatest of all works amongst men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">For he is our God, and we are the people of his pasture, and the sheep of his hand. Today, oh that</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">ye would hear his voice! Harden not your heart.—Ps. 95: 7, 8, R. V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Paul quoted from these words and applied them to the close of the Jewish age of God’s favor; and, according to the rule he laid down, they apply with more force to the end of this world when God is gathering his saints together unto him. As the great Shepherd he gathers them as his sheep into a green pasture, and feeds them at the hand of the “good Shepherd’’, Christ Jesus. Since coming to his temple he speaks to the temple class that they harden not their hearts but rather rejoice to hear his voice of command. Some, however, do harden their hearts and turn away and will not engage in the glad song announcing God’s kingdom. The Lord warns against this course.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">March 13 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">(229)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">I will declare thy name unto my brethren; in the midst of the church will I sing praise unto thee.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Heb. 2:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Paul applied these prophetic words unto Jesus. While on the earth the Lord Jesus was not bemoaning his lot and saying in substance that he wanted the toils and sorrows to end that he might get away from the world and go home to rest. Not only did he not say such a thing, but his course of action indicates that no such thought was in his mind. He came to work, which meant service. He came to perform service, and he was always diligently at it. At the conclusion of his ministry he said to his heavenly Father: “I have glorified thee on the earth’’; and referring to his disciples, his brethren, he added: “I have manifested thy name unto the men which thou gavest me out of the world.” He sang Jehovah’s praises throughout life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, ... to set them among princes, and to make them inherit the throne of glory.—1 Sam. 2:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jesus said: “Whosoever exalteth himself shall be abased.” The proud forget that Jesus did not come to earth to exalt himself; he was always lowly in heart. He never put forth an effort to receive honor and glory from men. He did not even seek glory for his faithfulness in the performance of his covenant. He asked God for only what he had previously enjoyed. (John 17:5) He came to earth to do his Father’s will, and that he did. Every one who will inherit the throne of glory with “the prince of the kings of the earth” must do the same thing. Jesus is the perfect pattern, and all who please God must follow the course that he took. Jehovah does the exalting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">March 15 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">(267)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Cry out and shout, thou inhabitant of Zion: for great is the Holy One of Israel in the midst of thee.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Isa. 12: 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Here is the positive command to the inhabitants of Zion to cry out and shout. Jehovah has made Zion his dwelling-place, and now he tells every one of Zion, his organization, to shout forth boldly and fearlessly that the name of Jehovah is exalted and that the time for his kingdom to be established is here and that Satan’s organization must fall. It is no time for temporizing with those who claim to be in the truth and yet oppose the proclamation of God’s message to the peoples of earth. It is no time for true Christians to apologize for being on the earth or to assume an apologetic air as they approach the people with the kingdom message. The command is to “cry out and shout”, for Jehovah, “the Holy One of Israel,” is with them. Therefore the anointed go to their duty with joy and with good courage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">I will offer to thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving, and will call upon the name of the Lord.—Ps. 116:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When one receives a good gift from another and is unthankful, there is something wrong in the heart of the one receiving. Gratitude is the first step in the exercise of true love. Where there is no gratitude on the part of the receiver of a gift toward the giver, selfishness has control over the receiver. The rules of action for the government of God *s intelligent creation never change, they are eternal. It is pleasing to Jehovah to offer thanksgiving unto him for all that one has received from the Lord. God’s apostle reminds Christians of their privilege of &quot;giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ’’. Gratitude should furnish us additional incentive to pay our consecration vows to God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">March 17 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">(86)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">I </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">will make an everlasting covenant with you, even the sure mercies of David.—Isa. 55:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">David means &quot;beloved one’’. The covenant which God made with David the king of Israel is really made and applies between God and his beloved Son Christ Jesus. That the above prophecy applies to Jesus Christ is made certain by the Apostle Paul, in Acts 13:34. The covenant applied at the time of the consecration of Jesus at the Jordan, when he was begotten and anointed and thus became &quot;the seed of David”. After Jesus was raised from the dead the covenant was confirmed unto him. It was at the institution of the memorial of his death that Jesus told his faithful disciples that they would be taken into this everlasting covenant. It was due to God’s extraordinary goodness, his &quot;sure mercies”, and due to Jesus’ unselfishness, that this arrangement was made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God.—Rev. 20:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">From Abel to John the Baptist God sent forth his prophets to be his witnesses. Then he sent to earth his beloved Son, the greatest witness that ever trod the earth. Then he sent forth his faithful apostles who had been with Jesus and who bore testimony concerning him and God’s Word of salvation. All down through the age since then Jehovah has had some faithful followers of Christ Jesus who have stood forth for God’s holy name. Now the crisis is reached and soon Jehovah himself will come forth to give the mightiest witness of all. What the Christian should now see is that, though it means to be beheaded for the witness of Jesus and for God's Word, yet the greatest privilege ever given is to be in this class of witnesses for Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">March 19 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">(127)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">At the place which the Lord thy God shall choose to place his name in, there thou shalt sacrifice the passover.—Deut. 16:6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Evidently Jehovah commanded Israel to keep the Passover as a memorial each year that they might not forget that Jehovah is the Almighty God, their friend and benefactor, and the only source of life. Hence, in enjoining upon his disciples to keep the memorial of his death Jesus followed the course that his heavenly Father took. He knew that the safety of his followers depends upon faithfulness to Jehovah and to himself. The reason why he, the Lamb of God, had died was that they might be delivered from Satan and live; hence Jesus knew that if they would constantly keep this in mind, then they would be better enabled to resist the Devil and stand uncompromisingly for Jehovah and his cause. Zion is the organization where Jehovah has chosen to place his name, and the real purpose of the memorial of Jesus’ death is the safety and welfare of those in Zion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Ye </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.—1 Pet. 2:5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Israel’s tabernacle in the wilderness pictured things spiritual or heavenly, Jehovah ordered a priesthood to be selected, anointed and installed in connection therewith. A priest is an official servant of Jehovah God, performing the duties which the Lord assigns unto him. The consecration and institution of this priesthood of Israel foreshadowed that the &quot;royal priesthood&quot;, Christ Jesus and his church, must enter into a covenant with Jehovah, be wholly and unreservedly devoted to him, and serve him in obedience to his commands. The members of this priesthood are offered up by the High Priest Jesus as part of his own sacrifice, and &quot;by him [they] offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually”,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">March 21 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">(320)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">I covenant for you, even as my Father has covenanted for me, a kingdom.—Luke 22:29, Diaglott.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jesus’ words could mean only this: 'My Father has made a covenant with me for a kingdom and now I covenant with you that you shall be taken into the covenant and share the kingdom with me. ’ Only those who suffer with Jesus and who die with him can be brought into the &quot;everlasting covenant, even the sure mercies of David”. God’s extraordinary goodness is conferred upon those who delight to bear the sufferings and reproaches that are left behind for the benefit of Christ’s body. Every one who has made a covenant to do God’s will should remember that those who have part in the everlasting covenant and the sure mercies of David must die the sacrificial death even as Jesus died and must also suffer the reproaches that fell on him for righteousness’ sake.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Ye </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">shall drink indeed of my cup, and</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> be </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with.—Matt. 20:23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Lord laid down the rule that no man could become a member of the church and enjoy eternal life and immortality with him except that man be first justified by faith in the blood of Jesus and baptized into his death and be faithful unto death. To drink his blood means to share in his sacrifice, and after having entered into the covenant, to be faithful to the end; and that means to be faithful to God and to Christ and refuse to be associated with any part of Satan’s organization. To those who make it their business to be faithful the Lord promises that they shall have the full privilege of sharing his sufferings and death that they may share his cup of joy and his exaltation in the kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">March 23 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">(127)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;For even our paschal Lamb, Christ, was sacrificed. Therefore, let us keep the festival.—1 Cor. 5:7,8, Diaglott.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The paschal lamb was slain and its blood placed over the door; and when God saw that the Israelites had shown faith in him and obedience to him, he passed by that house. Christ is the paschal Lamb for the church. His blood has been shed, and has been presented in heaven itself in behalf of those who believe in him and obey. We are now under his blood. If we are to be spared and passed by we must be faithful and true to the Lord, trusting always in the blood of Christ Jesus and being obedient to what it represents. By keeping the memorial we do show forth the death of Christ Jesus. We also thus testify that by the grace of God we have been taken into the covenant by sacrifice and have agreed to die with him, “always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus. ” Let us therefore duly keep the memorial to the glory of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">March 24 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">(2)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink the cup, ye proclaim the Lord’s death till he come.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—1 Cor. 11:26, R. V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jesus’ invitation to his beloved disciples to drink of his blood meant that they would be taken into his covenant by sacrifice to suffer death with him. The drinking of the cup, therefore, pictures the communion of the body members with Christ Jesus in his blood. The breaking of the bread represents the communion of the body members of Christ in being broken with him ■ their eating of it pictures partaking of the benefits of his humanity laid down in sacrifice. Otherwise stated, these things mean that every one who will be of Jehovah’s royal family must pour out his soul in death as a part of Christ’s sacrifice and as such be offered up by him. Such an one is first partaker of the bread, and then becomes a part of the “one loaf’’, to wit, Christ, and is then broken with him. All such are put to death in a body of humiliation and raised a glorious body.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">March 25 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">(146)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Behold, my servant . . . his visage was so marred more than any man, and his form more than the sons of men.—Isa. 52:13,14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jesus was perfect, holy, harmless and without sin, and he did harm to no one. The fact that he was despised and persecuted is proof that Satan the evil one was causing the persecution, and this because Jesus was anointed to be the Ruler of the world. Jesus was Jehovah’s servant. He was “a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief’’; and one reason was that he saw men who claimed to represent his Father, but who were daily misrepresenting him and slandering his holy name, and were heaping ignominy upon Jesus because he came from God and represented him on earth. Those instruments of Satan hated Jesus without a just cause or excuse for so doing. We are not to be above our Master in this respect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">believe on him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead . . . for our justification^—Rom. 4:24,25.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">God raised Jesus out of death a spirit being (1) because he was faithful even unto death; (2) in order that Jesus might have access to heaven and there present the value of his human sacrifice as a sin-offering for the sins of man; and (3) that in God’s due time he might assume the high office of Ruler or Governor over all the nations of the earth. Jesus the beloved Son had been put to the test; he went to the death of ignominy with not even an unfaithful thought. God rewarded his faithfulness and thereby for ever established the rule that J ehovah will reward those who love him and who are faithful to him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">March 27 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">(227)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">But to us there is but one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we in him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—1 Cor. 8: 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The tendency amongst many has been to attribute all blessings to Christ Jesus, when in truth and in fact all blessings proceed from Jehovah God. Christ Jesus, his beloved Son and our Lord, is his chief executive officer in conveying these blessings. The blessing must always proceed from Jehovah, the only true and living God, and his beloved One Jesus is the channel of such blessing. To God’s faithful ones Jehovah only is God and is worshiped as such. Their undivided devotion to him is expressed by the words of the prophet: “For all people will wait every one in the name of his god, and we will walk in the name of the Lord [Jehovah] our God for ever and ever.” They honor Jesus as their Redeemer and as Jehovah’s foremost representative.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">So also is the resurrection of the'dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption.—1 Cor. 15: 42.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The entire number of the faithful make up the body of Christ; hence the entire Christ is spoken of as “it”. The members of the body of Christ are, like Jesus, begotten to a heavenly inheritance which is incorruptible ; and by being faithful unto death they will gain the reward of incorruptibility or immortality, over which the second death shall never have power. Jesus’ earthly body was human and would have corrupted after death except for the miracle God performed in preserving it. The flesh of all Christ’s body members does corrupt. These are indeed justified, begotten and anointed by Jehovah and are new creatures in Christ, but the present organism of each one remains human and therefore corruptible. The resurrection will witness the change to incorruption.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">March 29 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">(322)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">His foundation is in the holy mountains. The Lord loveth the gates of Zion.—Ps. 87:1,2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Lift your eyes unto the mountains. Their foundations are unshakable except by the power of Jehovah God alone, for he made them. Storms may rage, the fires of lightning flash and burn, and mountainous waves of the sea dash against them; yet they are unmoved and undisturbed. Serenely and majestically there they stand; thus they have stood since Jehovah made them and will stand eternally. Their lofty peaks picture the great government of Jehovah and his Christ, the “kingdom which cannot be moved”, Zion. All the storms and floods of opposition that now rage or that might come shall never disturb or shake it. God’s immovable foundation is there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">If thou he righteous, what givest thou him? or what receiveth he of thine hand?—Job 35:7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When the Lord returned with the kingdom and began taking account with his servants, he did not take any under the robe of righteousness because of profit that such an one had brought to God. No man can bring any profit unto the Lord, regardless of what he does. The reward is given to his servants only because of faithfulness. The Lord’s words make this clear: &quot;Well done, good and faithful servant; thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things.’’ The faithful and approved ones enter into the joy of the Lord while still on this earth, but this privilege is given to them merely because of their unselfish devotion to the Lord’s interests.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">March 31 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">(130)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The temple of God was opened in heaven, and there was seen in his temple the ark of his testament.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Rev. 11:19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Which testament or covenant is here meant? It seems to be the covenant by sacrifice which the remnant class see more clearly, thereby more fully understanding their duties, obligations and privileges toward the Lord. Hence they &quot;bind the sacrifice with cords, even unto the horns of the altar’’. (Ps. 118: 27) This “festive sacrifice”, as Leeser translates it, could not mean a dead sacrifice, because such needs no binding or tying. It must be a living sacrifice, therefore a sacrifice of joy, and refers to the temple class, the remnant, joyfully engaging in the Lord’s service because they see the flashes of light from the temple revealing to them the covenant by sacrifice which they more fully see and appreciate. That explains why they now so joyfully engage in God’s service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">He made a decree for the rain, and a way for the lightning of the thunder.—Job 28:26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">God provides his own way and means or channel for bringing the truth to his people. When God’s lightning flashes, then he speaks in thunder tones and there follows an abundance of refreshing truth for the reviving of those who love righteousness and who are seeking after the way of God. Jehovah asked Job the question: “Who hath cleft a channel for the waterflood, or a way for the lightning of the thunder ? ’ ’ </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">(R. V.)</span><span class="font6"> As Jehovah makes his lightnings, the thundering and the rain, so the truth is his and he makes it known unto his creatures in his own due time and good way. He provides the means or channel by and through which he brings his truth to his people, and any provision attempted contrary thereto is out of harmony with God. Hence any one attempting to conduct God’s work contrary to God’s way is a worker of iniquity.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">0 Lord God, to whom vengeance belongeth; 0 God, to whom vengeance belongeth, shine forth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Ps. 94:1, margin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Vengeance really means vindication. The time is come for Jehovah to show himself by a demonstration of his power for the vindication of his name. His vengeance is not expressed against individuals, but against Satan and his wicked organization by which he oppresses and blinds the people. Jehovah’s purpose is to destroy the works and organization of the evil one, and he lays upon his servants the obligation of declaring his purpose thus to do. For this reason he discloses to those of the temple class what constitutes the Devil’s organization. God’s servants now know that the time has come for God’s kingdom to be set up and for his name to be vindicated; hence they pray the above prophetic prayer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">April 3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(9)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">In the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion; ... he shall set me up upon a rock. ... I will sing, yea, I will sing praises unto the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Ps. 27: 5, 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This scripture shows that it must be fulfilled in a time of stress; that then the faithful are made secure in “the secret place of the Most High’’; that their understanding is upon a solid foundation • and that then, because of their faith and confidence in the Lord and knowing his great favor to them, they sing the praises of Jehovah by telling abroad his plan and his goodness. It is the time for the accomplishment of things which seem to the temple class impossible, yet they know that the Almighty is in charge. To them the name Almighty means that nothing is impossible to Jehovah, that “no weapon that is formed against [them] shall prosper”. Therefore they offer to him “sacrifices of joy” and sing.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">My righteous one shall live by faith: and if he shrink back, my soul hath no pleasure in him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Heb. 10:38, R. V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It has been since the Lord came to his temple that God by his spirit has revealed to the church many of the deep things that the members thereof could not understand prior to that time. Habakkuk 2: 3, 4 shows that there would be some in the church who would not see, who would be selfish, and who would fall away because they would be puffed up of their own importance; but the faithful would live. Paul quotes the above words from Habakkuk, but neither he nor the prophet uses the word “faith” in connection with justification that precedes spirit-begetting. The Hebrew word rendered “faith” is properly translated faithfulness or stability. Paul had in mind that very thing, viz., faithful continuance in serving the Lord, and that if, after the vision is made clear, any one draws back he would not win God’s final approval.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Do not I hate them, 0 Lord, that hate theef ... I hate them with perfect hatred.—Ps. 139:21,22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The prophet of the Lord asked: &quot;Shouldest thou help the wicked, and love them that hate the Lord?” ‘‘Ye that love the Lord, hate evil.” The Lord’s people have now gone on record in a Declaration against the Devil and for Jehovah. Now they must prove that what has been said is really meant; and this they must do by pointing out to the people the hideousness of Satan’s organization and directing them to God and his gracious kingdom as their way and means of relief and blessing. The faithful must be the uncompromising foes of Satan and everything that pertains to him, and they must also be wholly and enthusiastically devoted to Jehovah God. There is no middle ground, no compromise. At all times will they stand firmly for God the Lord, singing forth the glory of his name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">April 6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">(336)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The shield of his mighty men is made red, the valiant men are in scarlet: the chariots flash with steel in the day of his preparation.—Nah. 2:3, R. V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">‘‘The chariots of God are twenty thousand, even thousands upon thousands: the Lord is among them, as in Sinai, in the sanctuary.” (Ps. 68:17, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">R. V.) </span><span class="font6">This is the day of God’s preparation of his forces against Satan’s organization. Jehovah’s servant class therefore sees that at this time there is a definite work to be done. This work now consists of proclaiming the glad tidings to the nations of earth and declaring his vengeance against the Devil’s empire. The Lord has provided the machinery to print the message for wide circulation. He has provided the radio to send the message into the prison-houses. Having provided the ammunition and laid down the barrage, he calls upon his ‘‘mighty men” to go forward and press the battle to the gate. He will be their shield.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Te </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">shall flee to the valley of the mountains; . . . the light shall not be clear, nor dark: but ... at evening time it shall be light—Zech. 14:5-7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Out through the valley of blessings from east to west is built the King’s highway, the mighty causeway that Jehovah God has banked up, that the exiles might return to him. Toward the north there is a great mountain, and one also to the south; and between lies that wonderful valley. It has a gradual ascent, but to those walking circumspectly upon it the way is easy of travel. Light shines into that valley all the time, so that it is not clear and bright only in some places and dark in others; nor does that light grow dim and fade away at eventime. What is that light, so soft, gentle, peaceful and inviting? It is not from the sun, moon, or the stars; it is the glory of Jehovah God and of his beloved Son.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">April 8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">(27)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">the lightning cometh out of the east, and shineth even unto the west; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.—Matt. 24:27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The relative position of the glorified Jesus with regard to the church on earth is in the east. (Isa. 41: 2; 46:11) All light upon the divine plan originates with Jehovah, and when he reveals his light to his anointed church he does so through the Head of his organization, Christ Jesus. No human being is able to make Eghtning. Likewise no human being is able to point to the fact that Christ is at some local spot on earth. The lightning is not confined to a local place; it is seen by those who are watching. Just so Christ’s presence is revealed to those anointed ones who are looking for the manifestation of his presence. The Son of man’s coming, as mentioned above, specifically refers to his coming to the temple of God for judgment. Let none of the elect now be deceived; the judgment is on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">April 9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">(150)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Like the dew of Hermon, that cometh down upon the 'mountains of Zion: for there the Lord commanded the blessing, even life for evermore.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Ps. 133:3, R. V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">How good and how delightful it is for all the members of the remnant, who are God’s witnesses on the earth, now to dwell together in peace. That eternal stability and sweet serenity, pictured by the mountains of Zion, should be their daily portion. Such peace and unity in mind, heart and action, God’s prophet likens unto dew descending upon Zion with the copiousness with which it descends upon Mount Hermon. The snow, during the summer months, condenses the vaporous clouds that envelop Hermon, so that abundant dews descend, and this while the surrounding country may be parched. It is like the &quot;oil of joy’’, descending from Jehovah upon our glorified Head Christ Jesus and flowing down and refreshing his body members.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">April 10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">(229)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">He appointed singers unto the Lord, and that should praise the beauty of holiness, as they went out before the army, and to say, Praise the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—2 Chron. 20: 21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Thus Jehoshaphat appointed certain ones for a specific purpose. They were not to be sad of countenance, nor to cover themselves with sackcloth and ashes, nor to mourn, nor to have the spirit of heaviness. They were to sing praise to Jehovah, though they were face to face with a great host of enemies and were absolutely incapable of meeting these warriors on equal terms. When these singers began to sing Jehovah’s praises, the Lord gave them salvation from their enemies. From this picture we learn the lesson that the battle is the Lord’s; and while the battle is on between Jehovah and Satan, under the leadership of the &quot;Faithful and True”, God’s anointed ones are to sing praise to him as his witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">When the living creatures went, the wheels went by them.... And above the firmament that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne.—Ezek. 1:19,26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Viewed together, Ezekiel's vision of the cherubic creatures and the wheels gives the appearance of an immense chariot-like organization extending high into the heavens and over all of which Jehovah presides. Next to him is Christ Jesus, his great Executive Officer. With him in heaven, as a part of this organization, are the risen saints and the legions of glorious and faithful angels; and down on earth are the “feet of him”, those who are the members of Christ and yet on earth. The entire organization revolves within a circlet of divine wisdom, pictured by eyes, and is directed by “the wisdom that is from above”. Every part of the divine organization moves in exact harmony with the will of the great Jehovah God. The vision is fulfilled in this the day of God’s vengeance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">April 12 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">(17)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Having predestinated us ... to the praise of the glory of his grace, wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved.—Eph. 1:5,6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Long centuries ago Jehovah purposed to have a company taken from amongst men and to form it into the body of Christ. He then made the rule that such company should be “holy and without blame before him in love”. That rule requires not present perfection in our words, or acts, or even in our thoughts, but perfection in love, which means an unselfish and unalloyed devotion unto God. Being thus perfect, the new creature on earth is blameless before God. The present imperfections of the anointed ones are made up for by the Lord Jesus; they are covered. “Ye are complete in him. ’ ’ To the end that this favored company might be selected, God provided redemption through Christ’s blood. This is all to the praise of his glorious grace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">There was no day like that . , . that the Lord hearkened unto the voice of a man: for the Lord fought for Israel.—Josh. 10:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At the battle of the city of Gibeon the Israelites slew some of the enemy, but God slew by far the greater number with the hailstones which he cast down from heaven. The occasion was a manifestation of divine power. Scriptures indicate that the coming battle of Armageddon is foreshadowed by Joshua's experiences at this battle of Gibeon. Joshua wanted the sun and the moon to stand still that he might see to pursue the enemy and fight them. Joshua represents the Lord’s anointed. This suggests that it might not be amiss for the remnant to pray the Lord to continue to enlighten them by his lightnings and hold open the way for them to continue the fight until God’s due time to finish the enemy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">April 14 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">(255)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves . . . shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life.—John 5:28,29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">No one can be classed as good unless he has God’s approval. No one could have God’s approval without being reconciled to God. Those whom God justifies by reason of faith in the shed blood of Jesus have peace with God because they are reconciled to him. During the Christian era God has justified such in order that they might be brought into the covenant by sacrifice. Such are brought into Christ and become new creatures in Christ. Those who become real disciples of Christ and thereafter continue loyal and faithful in their devotion to Jehovah have his approval and are accounted as among those who do good. Being constant in this course even unto death, for them “the resurrection of life’’ will lead to glory, honor and immortality.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">April 15 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">(78)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Who then is a faithful and wise servant, whom his Lord hath made ruler over his household, to give them meat in due season?—Matt. 24:45.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The answer to this question is, Those found faithful since the Lord came to his temple in 1918. The goods of the Lord are all his interests. The Lord has made this “faithful and wise” class ruler over all his goods, or kingdom interests, on earth. Continued faithfulness unto death is required of each one who remains in this “faithful and wise servant” class. Therefore the obligation laid upon each one of that class, from this time forward, is faithfulness in performing his or her part of the eovenant with the Lord. To those who continue faithful he has promised to grant an abundant entrance into his everlasting kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">April 16 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">(312)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">He that hath the key of David, he that openeth, and no man shutteth; and shutteth, and no man openeth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Rev. 3:7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jesus Christ, having become the heir of God’s covenant with David for the kingdom, came into possession of “the key of David”. As Jehovah’s Representative he opened to the anointed ones the door of opportunity for proclaiming the kingdom message, and the same having been opened, none can now shut this door of opportunity. The reformation that preceded the Philadelphia state of the church had been overreached by the world’s wrongful influence; but in the Philadelphia state the present Lord has kept the door open that the message of the plan of salvation might be declared. No more should the fundamental truths be contaminated by the influence of false teachers and the false doctrines taught by them; but in that same period of time the Lord finally shut the door of opportunity to represent him upon the nominal church systems, and no more shall that door be opened to such systems. Let </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">us</span><span class="font6"> then appreciate and use our present privilege as God’s ambassadors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Let the children of Zion be joyful in their King. Let them praise his name in the dance.—Ps. 149: 2, 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jesus, “for the joy that was set before him’’ of vindicating his Father’s name, endured the cross and proved faithful. Now as Jehovah’s anointed King he has entered into that joy. Now also those who are children of Zion, true and faithful Christians, see that they enter into the joy of the Lord when they discern the great privilege of being witnesses for Jehovah while this wicked world is passing away. They see that now has come the time for the establishment of God’s kingdom; that soon the church will enter into complete glory; and that then the people will be released from bondage, the Devil bound, Jehovah’s name vindicated and magnified, and the people blessed. This thrills their hearts with joy. They employ their bodies in harmoniously praising Jehovah’s name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">April 18 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">(98)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">In the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me; he shall set me up upon a rock.—Ps. 27: 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Since the great dragon has gone forth to make war against the remnant of the seed of the woman who keep the commandments of God and have the testimony of Jesus Christ, Jehovah has hidden them in the “secret place of the Most High’’. While in their hiding-place will the remnant be idle ? Not by any means. No one can remain idle and remain in the remnant class. Hiding in the secret of God’s tabernacle does not mean that they will be out of view of the enemy or be fearful that the enemy might see their movements. On the contrary, they will be very active, and their cup of joy will be overflowing Concerning this it is written: “Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over. ’ ’ They have an active part in God’s organization in this time of the expression of his righteous indignation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Light is sown for the righteous, and gladness for the upright in heart. Be glad in Jehovah, ye righteous; and give thanks to his holy memorial name.—Ps. 97:11,12, A. R. V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The *‘servant” class is righteous by reason of the faet that the members thereof are in Christ; and therefore God declares sueh righteous or right with him. It is this class that he instructs and leads in the right way. (Ps. 25:9; Prov. 3:5,6) ‘Jehovah covers himself with light as with a garment.' (Ps. 104:2) His due time is here to draw his ‘ ‘servant&quot; class more clearly into his light. He has sent his beloved Son to his temple. He has provided the Bridegroom with the robe of righteousness for the members of the &quot;servant” class cm earth. He has given to these the garments of salvation. They are identified as his. The temple of God has been opened in heaven, and the lightnings flash therefrom. It is Jehovah’s due time for his righteous ones to have a better understanding of his purposes and to be glad.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">April 20 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">(1W</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The kingdom of God shall be .. . given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof.—Matt. 21: 43. </span><span class="font6">Fruit is the effect of a consistent course of action that one takes. By sueh a course of action a person may be identified as being for or against. A child of God who without hesitation says, ‘‘I am a Christian,” who is indifferent to the approval of men, who </span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">mani</span><span class="font6">fests a zeal and enthusiasm for God and his righteous government, who refuses to compromise with any part of Satan’s organization, who holds himself aloof therefrom, who seeks always to glorify God and his anointed King Christ Jesus, who is zealous in availing himself of opportunities to witness for Jehovah’s name and his kingdom, that person belongs to that &quot;nation” bringing forth the fruits of the kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">But the Lord, . . . him shall ye fear, and him shall ye worship, and to him shall ye do sacrifice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—2 Ki. 17:36.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah God is the source of life, and none can have life everlasting who oppose him. Satan the enemy would turn all men against God; and that would result in man’s destruction, with no hope of life. God has repeatedly magnified his Word and kept the great truths thereof before the minds of truth seekers that they might learn the way to life everlasting. Therefore he announced his law to the Israelites for their good and for the good of all mankind. All his laws are consistent with, and based upon, the great truth that Jehovah is the only true God. The issue, “Who is God?” must be decided in favor of Jehovah, and all who ever get life must take their stand on his side.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">April 22 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">(77):</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">When he uttereth his voice, there is a multitude of waters in the heavens, and he causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth.—J er. 10:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“The voice of thy thunder was in the heaven.” (Ps. 77=18) When Jehovah utters his voice in thunder tones, there follows an abundance of refreshing truth like waters from the heavens. Vapor or the dew may arise from the earth and bring refreshment to the earth and its vegetation. Frequently preceding a copious rain the dew or vapor in the early morning covers the ground and refreshes the things of earth. So it was that in the early dawn of Christ’s presence about 1875 refreshing truths began to be brought to God’s people as he had promised. Those truths refreshed them in a land made dry and thirsty by the enemy’s agents. God has continued to bear his refreshing truths to his people even to the very ends of the earth and has gathered them together away from Babylon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">In that day the Lord, with his sore and great and strong sword, shall punish leviathan the piercing serpent, even leviathan that crooked serpent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Isa. 27:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The leviathan is a monster in the sea and pictures the earthly part of Satan’s organization. Jesus called the clergy a “generation of vipers” or serpents, thus showing that these are the seed of Satan and a part of his elusive organization. These have glided about amongst the unsuspecting peoples of earth, who are represented by the sea. One moment they appear to represent God, and the next they openly advocate the enemy’s work. They are the chief instruments used in persecuting Christ’s faithful followers. Well are they illustrated by the sea-monster that rises to the surface and quickly disappears. Great numbers of people have been held in Babylon’s “prison-house” by reason of the clergy’s iniquity and seductive and elusive methods. “That day” is here when Jehovah will destroy this leviathan by his great and strong Sword, Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">April 24 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">(90)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">And they sung as it were a new song before the throne, <sub>a</sub> . . and no man could learn that song but the hundred and forty and four thousand.—Rev. 14:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There are those who complain against their brethren, and insist that there is nothing more to be done but to await the time when they shall be taken to the kingdom. These complainers can not understand this song because they refuse to participate in it. It is “as it were a new song” in view of the fact that God’s kingdom has come and well-known prophecies now take on </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">new</span><span class="font6"> significance because of being fulfilled. Those who have already passed into glory to be for ever with the Lord engage in singing the new song. Also the “remnant” still on earth participate in singing the song, the rapturous music of the new government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus.—1 Tim. 2:5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Christ Jesus is the Mediator between man and God to bring back man into reconciliation with God. The reconciliation of those who become Christians, however, is not through the terms of the new covenant, but because of faith and obedience. A mediator is not required in the covenant by sacrifice for any one who is brought into the covenant as a member of Christ’s body; for no one is brought in until he is justified and therefore stands righteous before Jehovah. The Christian is not under, nor the offspring of, any covenant that is mediated by Christ Jesus. The faithful Christian is made a part of the sacrificial body of Christ Jesus and is sacrificed by him. He will officiate with Jesus in mediating the new covenant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">April 26 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">(71)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Intimacy [Strong; friendship, A. R. V.; secret counsel, Leeser] with Jehovah have they who revere him, his covenant also he letteth them know.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Ps. 25:14, Rotherham.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">No creature of heaven or earth could originate the covenant by sacrifice; only Jehovah could do that. That covenant and the purpose to make it were secret unto all until God’s due time to reveal it; “which things the angels desire to look into.” Doubtless this included the Logos, the chief of all angels. The Scriptures support the conclusion that the covenant by sacrifice was not known to any creature in the universe until the time for making it at Jesus’ immersion in Jordan. Immediately following his consecration there, Jesus was led by God’s spirit into the wilderness where Jehovah took Jesus into special intimacy with himself, and there Jesus undoubtedly learned the full meaning and importance of his covenant with his Father.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Thou wilt perform the truth to Jacob, and the mercy to Abraham, which thou hast sworn unto our fathers from the days of old.—Mic. 7:20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This is an assurance that Abraham shall return from the tomb when the time is due for him to receive his personal blessings according to the promises of the covenant. In the covenant God made with Abraham he said: “In blessing I will bless thee.” It follows then that Abraham himself must receive a blessing, and that in relation to the covenant he is purely a figure representing God, who is the real source of all blessing. Abraham’s being a type of the ever-living God also suggests that the patriarch shall live again and never die any more. As a guarantee of this, Jesus said: “Many shall come from the east and west, and shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven.” Abraham will have a position in Messiah’s kingdom as an earthly representative thereof.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">April 28 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">(05)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">For mine own sake will I do it; for how should my name be profaned? and my glory will I not give to another.—Isa. 48:11, R. V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There is nothing that man has done or can do that is worthy of glory. Let no Christian glory in his own wisdom, nor deceive himself nor be deceived by glorying in some other man’s wisdom or greatness. No truly great men have ever lived on earth since Jesus’ day. It is unsafe to magnify the names of men. It is the policy of the Devil to induce others to worship some creature, in order that their minds may be turned away from Jehovah God. Honor the Creator and not the creature<sup>1</sup> The proper study of mankind is the Creator and his works. God's anointed “servant” class must set an example in this; they will magnify and sing praise to Jehovah’s name and not give glory to created things.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">I will feed my flock, and I will cause them to lie down, saith the Lord God.—Ezek. 34:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">He “that is to be ruler in Israel’’ has now come out of Bethlehem, and through him Jehovah feeds his flock and makes them to lie down in blessed security. (Mic. 5: 2,4) This little flock have entered into “the secret place of the Most High’’, because the Lord has brought them into his temple and under the robe of righteousness. There they abide, looking to Jehovah for food and strength by and through his beloved Son, “the good Shepherd.” They do not browse about like unruly animals looking for food in various places. They know their food comes from the Lord. The “remnant” well know that they get their food from Jehovah’s table through his appointed way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">April 30 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">(159)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Christ.—Titus 2:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">These words seem to apply to the time when Jehovah and the Lord Jesus would appear to the temple class as more glorious than ever before. Even so, the World War suddenly broke forth, and there came contemporaneously with it increased light to the anointed ones on earth. The Lord Jesus was present; and the sudden increased light of his presence is conveyed in the Greek word </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">epiphaneia,</span><span class="font6"> above translated ‘ ‘ appearing ’ ’. This epiphaneia took place, even though at the same time the darkness increased toward others, Jehovah’s enemies. In support of this the prophet said: “When the Lord [Jehovah] shall build up Zion, he shall appear in his glory.” It is the time when Jehovah provides the robe of righteousness under which Jesus brings the members of the temple class still on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Now tunto the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise God, be honour and glory for ever and ever. Amen.—1 Tim. 1:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Immortality resides in Jehovah alone, the </span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">Kin</span><span class="font6">g of the ages. He is from everlasting to everlasting, the great One ever unseen to man. Besides him there is no god; none may be honored above him, and he will never give his glory unto any other who would be a god. His Word proves that it is his will to give immortality and incorruptibility only to those who have undergone a severe trial and proven their supreme loyalty and faithfulness to him even unto death. Jesus declared it was the Father’s promise to give him such inherent life. The same exceeding great and precious promise of the divine nature is given to all the faithful in Christ who now give honor and glory unto Jehovah.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The spirit of the Lord spake by me, and his word was in my tongue.—2 Sam. 23:2.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark302"></a><span class="font6">The spirit of God means the power of God. It is holy because it is complete and is exercised by the Holy One. It is invisible to man; yet the result of the operation thereof is observed by man, and especially by God’s remnant now on earth. God can exercise his invisible power upon the mind of any creature whom he may desire to use. In times of old he put his holy spirit upon David and other prophets, or seers; and they spoke the words which God willed them to utter. They were wholly devoted to God, and spoke as they were moved by the spirit of God. Therefore the ambassadors for Christ, who are now advertising the King and the kingdom, may be sure that the statements of these holy prophets concerning the incoming government of righteousness are statements from Jehovah himself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">He maketh the barren woman to keep house, and to be a joyful mother of children.—Ps. 113:9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Lord came to his temple in 1918, and thereafter the proclamation of Jehovah’s name and glory by the temple class began. Prior to that time Zion was represented as barren, but from that time forward Zion brings forth her children and rejoices, as it is written: “Rejoice, thou barren that bearest not.” Jehovah’s faithful ones are the children of the once barren Zion. No longer is she barren. The faithful ones, her children, are represented as keeping house, the house of the Lord, in this, that they show forth the praises of the Lord and rejoice in their mother, which is Zion, or God’s organization. They continue to say: “Blessed be the name of the Lord, from this time forth and for evermore.’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">May 4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(118)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Z </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">counsel thee to . . . anoint thine eyes with eyesalve, that thou mayest see.—Rev. 3:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Anoint” and “salve” suggest an oil ingredient, which is symbolic of the spirit of the Lord; the fruit thereof is supreme love and joy. Unselfish devotion to Jehovah induces one to keep his commandments. Not merely the knowing of the commandments is that which is required, but the keeping of them also; and the keeping thereof results in further </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">ill</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">umin</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">ation, </span><span class="font6">“The commandment of the Lord is pure, enlightening the eyes.” (Ps. 19:8) All those who have a sincere desire to keep in harmony with the Lord and to “see eye to eye” with his watchmen will pray: “Open thou mine eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of thy law.” (Ps. 119:18) The Lord has made promise that those who thus obey and anoint their eyes and joyfully do his will shall see precious things, even “whatsoever things God prepared for them that love him ’ ’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">God is gone up with a shout, the Lord with the sound of a trumpet.—Ps. 47: 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The word &quot;shout” as here used means a battle-cry. When the general of an army, with full confidence in his ability, begins an assault with the determination to win, there is a shout or ery of battle indicating the purpose to be victorious. When the armies of Israel were marching around Jericho they manifested their confidence that victory would result by shouting. It was the priests that blew the trumpets, foreshadowing Jehovah’s anointed ones proclaiming the glory of his name. Even so now, Jehovah has taken the reins of the world and goes forth to dash to pieces the enemy; and he does so with a shout and the sound of the trumpet, giving assurance to his faithful witnesses that victory is soon to follow. The remnant class, seeing that Jehovah, by and through his great Priest and King Jesus, is moving to the point of destroying Saltan’s organization, cries out in ecstasy: &quot;Sing praises to God, sing praises; sing praises unto our King, sing praises.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Thine eyes shall see the king in his beauty.—Isa. 33:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It will not be man’s privilege to see with the </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">h</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">uman </span><span class="font6">eyes their glorious Ruler; but men will see the representatives of the heavenly government on earth and will observe the righteous operation of that government. Men will know the effects of that government and will be blessed under it. The governing power will be in heaven, where God’s will shall be done; and the operation of the government will be on earth, where God’s will shall likewise be done. That government is a reality which will fully and completely establish righteousness amongst men. God’s faithful </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">re</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">mnan</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">t </span><span class="font6">will share in that government and will see the King face to face; even now by faith their eyes behold </span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font6"> enthroned in beauty on Zion’s hill.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Whereas they speak against you as evil doers, they may by your good works, which they shall behold, glorify God in the day of visitation.—1 Pet. 2:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Since all things are from the Father and by the Son, a visit may be spoken of as </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">God’s</span><span class="font6"> visitation even though Jesus is the active agency. The visit of God when Jesus came to his temple is for the purpose of inspection, judgment and blessing. The day of God’s visitation upon Christendom having begun shortly after 1918 and still continuing with increased severity, who then shall glorify God in this day of visitation? Not every one, of course; but the Scriptures indicate that there will be many who will do so. Because of the &quot;good works” of witnessing by God’s ambassadors many are hearing the truth now who formerly spoke evil against faithful Christians. Though not consecrating to God, they are manifesting kindness to all showing the Lord's spirit.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">I will sing of mercy and judgment: unto thee, 0 Lord, will I sing.—Ps. 101:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">These words were written for the guidance of the church. All men, including the members of the church, need mercy at the hands of the great Judge, Jehovah. The mercy and judgment of Jehovah are causes for praise to him. His children now see his judgment against those who have organized in opposition to his will and arrangement. They see also his judgment against those who repudiate his name after such have once been enlightened. They also experience the mercy that Jehovah has shown to his anointed ones. They see that he will show mercy unto the ignorantly wicked and to the oppressed. Conscious of his greatness and of his loving-kindness toward all, Jehovah’s temple class joyfully sing forth his praises.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God’s electf It is God that justifieth.—Rom. 8:33.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">God’s act of justifying here referred to does not mean that justification which one receives at the time of consecration. The apostle is referring to God’s elect, to those who in the past received that justification prior to their begetting as new creatures in Christ Jesus. Hence justification in the above text must mean God’s approval of those who are now members of the new creation. It is God who determines whether or not one of his servants shall be approved or disapproved, and it is not the prerogative of any one else to attempt such a thing. Hence no thoroughly devoted child of God will permit the onslaughts of the slanderer and evil-speaker to disturb his peace and equilibrium. Such an one knows that the servant must stand or fall to his own master and not to any one else.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Fear ye not, neither be afraid: have not I told thee from that time, and have declared it? ye are even my witnesses.—Isa. 44:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">These words indicate a special work now for the temple class to do. They are called upon to explain the meaning of the great name of God, not only to one another, but to all who have an ear to hear. The “servant” class must now declare unto the people the doings of the Lord. No one can proclaim the name of Jehovah and tell of his great work who is not up to date in the truth. To be up to date means to know and appreciate the light that God gives to his people at this time. Experience proves that none will witness to his doings and his great name save those who have entered into the joy of the Lord. It seems quite certain that the witnesses will grow fewer; but the zeal of the true temple class will increase, and they will exalt the name of Jehovah.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">For lo! Jehovah is coming forth out of his place, . . . therefore shall the earth unveil her shed-blood, and throw a covering no longer over her</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">slain.—Isa. 26:21, Rotherham.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">‘ ‘ The earth, ’ ’ as here used, refers more particularly to the governing factors of the nations. Isaiah explains why Jehovah comes out of his place to take action against the evil organization, saying: “The earth also is defiled under the inhabitants thereof, because they have . . . broken the everlasting covenant. Therefore hath the curse devoured the earth.” For centuries earth’s rulers, supported by the clergy and also by many of the people, have shed the blood of “innocents” and have covered up their evil deeds under a covering of false patriotism. Among those whose life-blood has saturated the ground are the men and women who were slain because of their faithfulness in testifying to the name and goodness of the Almighty God. But the time comes when Jehovah tears off this covering and unveils all the wickedness that has been done by men at the Devil’s instigation.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">thy name.—Ps. 86:9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When the kingdom blessings are poured out the people will realize that of all the benefits received the crowning one is to know Jehovah God. They will know that Jehovah redeemed man and set up a righteous government for man. They will have full confidence that their general welfare will be safeguarded by the great King. They will enjoy truth and health and strength and life and prosperity. They will stand upon the earth in the image and likeness of their great Creator, and their prayers of thanksgiving will ever ascend unto him. They will delight themselves in the Lord God and express loving heart sentiments to him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">He shdR cry unto me, Thou art my father, my God, and the rock of my salvation.—Ps. 89:26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Those who are in the bonds of Jehovah’s everlasting covenant with David, the Beloved One, well know that in this day they are in constant danger of the enemy and without the protection furnished they could not stand. They fully realize that the agents of the enemy Satan seek the destruction of God’s anointed sons. With confidence they look up to their Father and say: &quot;But thou, O Lord, art a shield for me; my glory, and the lifter up of mine head.” (Ps. 3:3) They realize that to those who give their unqualified allegiance to Jehovah he is complete and absolute security and is a sanctuary for those whom he has taken into a covenant with him. Being unselfishly devoted to him, their God, they can not refrain from lauding him.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Even now are there many antichrists; whereby we know that it is the last time.—1 John 2:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Christ” means the “anointed” of God; it more particularly refers to him as King or Ruler of the world, that is, it has more specific reference to rulership. Since the anointing therefore applies to Jesus as King, “antichrist” must specifically refer to that organization which is opposed to God’s kingdom by and through his Christ. It must include all creatures who are active members or supporters of that organization. All who are not affirmatively for Christ Jesus and his kingdom are against him and against his kingdom, and are either directly or indirectly supporting the enemy organization. (Matt. 12:30) Those who serve and support the organization of Satan the enemy would therefore be of the antichrist. There are many such among professed Christians today; hence we know that this is “the last time”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">And they sing the song of Moses the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying, Great and marvellous are thy works, Lord God Almighty.—Rev. 15:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This song could not have been sung to God’s praise and by this company prior to 1918. The resurrection of the sleeping saints took place in 1918. The “remnant” today is under the robe of righteousness and has the garments of salvation. Those who continue faithful to the end will be finally of the “remnant” triumphant. Before their change and before the battle of Armageddon the nations of the earth must have a witness. Blessed is the man who has a part therein. Let every one who loves the Lord put everything else in the background, press on in the fight, and joyfully sing that sweet and blessed song which God provided should be understood and sung only by those specially redeemed from the earth and brought into his holy temple.—Bev. 14: 3.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">It shall come to pass in the last days, saith God, I will pour out of my spirit upon all flesh:... and they shall prophesy.—Acts 2:17,18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah pours out his spirit on no one unless that one is willingly in heart harmony with him. Prior to 1919, during the Elijah work of the church, the elders did most of the preaching of the gospel, that is, prophesying. But the time came when those who had more recently been brought into Zion became active in proclaiming the message of God’s kingdom. The young men and young women, whether such in years or such in the vigor of their devotion to God, entered into the field of service; class organizations were arranged and systematic prophesying, or preaching of the gospel of the kingdom, was carried on by going personally from house to house, with greater zeal than ever before. Such is the manifestation of the spirit’s being poured out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchantman, seeking goodly pearls.—Matt. 13: 45.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The privilege of being part of God’s kingdom is greater than any other that man could possibly have, because it means to be for ever associated with Jesus in his great work. It is more than a pearl of priceless value. If the merchant would sell all he had to buy such a pearl, with stronger reasoning should a man be willing to give everything he possesses to have a part in the Lord’s kingdom. Having taken the step then toward the kingdom, he permits nothing to stand in the way of his absolute and complete devotion to Jehovah; such is his zeal for the Lord, and so enhanced in his mind and heart is his joy at having a share in that blessed kingdom.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Do unto them as unto the Midianites ; . . . that men may know that thou . . . art the Most High over all the earth.—Ps. 83:9,18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">God has whetted his “glittering sword’’, symbolizing Jesus, and orders him to the great conflict. As Gideon represented the Lord Jesus, so his army of three hundred represented God’s remnant on earth today. As Gideon’s little band sounded the trumpet before attacking the Midianites, so now the remnant must blow the trumpet of the Lord God, and do so with joy. We are now in the time of the fuller revelation of God’s will, which is represented by the moon, and it is therefore a time of special rejoicing for God’s people. (Ps. 81:1, 3) Hence, as the light flashed from the torches of Gideon’s three companies and the members thereof shouted victory, even so now, when Jehovah’s lightnings flash, exposing the enemies’ position and revealing their confusion, the faithful remnant shout with joy: ‘The sword of Jehovah and of his Anointed.’ They do their part, and Jehovah does his part unto the antitypical Midianites.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed—1 Cor. 15:52.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Previous to the time that the Lord Jesus arrived at God’s temple, all Christians who were faithful and died in faith must wait in hell. The resurrection of these faithful ones, or the calling of them forth from hell, and the bringing of the faithful ones still alive on earth into the temple condition took place approximately at the time of the Lord’s coming to the true temple. From that time forward the resurrection of the good and faithful Christians has been instantaneous ; that is to say, at the moment of death the change from human to spirit beings takes place. From that time forward, therefore, the words of Jesus apply: “Write, Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth.’’</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">To the spirits of just men made perfect. God having provided . . . that they . . . should . . . be made perfect.—Heb. 12:23; 11:40.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Paul gives us a brief record of the men who believed God and who were faithful to him as his witnesses. The heart of each of them was right and their life was entirely devoted to God. They had full faith in the coming of the great Messiah and his reconciliation work. They had faith in the resurrection and had promise of a better resurrection. Being full of faith and having hearts devoted solely to Jehovah, they were counted by him as righteous. They were therefore “just men”. God’s purpose is to make these men perfect. Until the atonement is made by the blood of Jesus Christ these men could not have the spirit of life perfected in them; but in the resurrection they shall be perfected as human representatives of the righteous government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">He shall stand, and shall feed his flock in the strength of Jehovah, in the majesty of the name of</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah his God.—Mic. 5:4, A. R. V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The &quot;Ruler”, having come out of Bethlehem Ephratah (the house of bread and place of fruitfulness), girded himself and caused his faithful ones to sit down, that is to say, to rest in peace, while they receive the gracious provisions made for them. (Luke 12:37) As &quot;chief Shepherd” he stands up and feeds the members who compose the faithful servant class, feeding them upon that food which is &quot;convenient” for them. That means that they are fed on that which builds them up. Clothed with all power and authority, the Ruler out of Bethlehem stands forth in the majesty of Jehovah’s name and feeds the flock with food which Jehovah has provided for them. He feeds those who need to be fed and who rejoice at receiving &quot;meat in due season”.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Sing forth the honour of his name; make his praise glorious.—Ps. 66:2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is due the Lord that his name be honored above all. It is due time to sing forth the honor of his name. The anointed ones are the only true representatives of God on earth and they are greatly honored by having the privilege of representing him. The above text is a call by each member of the temple class to the other members of the temple class. It is impossible to sing forth the honor of the Lord’s name now unless we avail ourselves of opportunities for serving him, because this means that God has provided for the witness to his name to be given. Amidst great opposition the little company of anointed ones now delight to encourage one another and together to engage in making melody to the honor of the name of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">I will stir up thy sons, 0 Zion, against thy sons, 0 Greece, and will make thee as the sword of a mighty man.—Zech. 9:13, R. V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Daily the loyal members of Zion see the evidences that their faithfulness in testifying to Jehovah’s name is sore and grievous upon the members of Satan’s organization, of which ancient Greece was once a world power. Yet the sons of Zion go forth today fearlessly singing the honor of Jehovah’s name. What is the effect? Paul says (and we see it to be true): “Your fearlessness is unto the enemy a sure token of impending destruction.” God’s prophet Isaiah also states: “In that day the Lord with his sore and great and strong sword shall punish leviathan.” Christ Jesus is Jehovah’s great and strong Sword, and the remnant class is as a ‘sore sword’ because sore and grievous to the enemy. Nothing galls the clergy, tainted with ancient Grecian philosophy, and their allies more than the faithfulness of God’s remnant today in giving testimony to his name and to his kingdom.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">My son, be wise, and make my heart glad, that J may answer him that reproacheth me.—Prov. 27:11. </span><span class="font6">The wise son of God will diligently seek to know Jehovah’s will concerning his anointed ones. Ascertaining it, he will do God’s will to the best of his ability regardless of what others might say or even think, and thus he will be wise and make glad the heart of his heavenly Father. It is the wise son that will see the way of the Lord and understand his loving-kindness : “Whoso is wise, and will observe these things, even they shall understand the loving-kindness of the Lord. ’ ’ The wise not only will see the truth as God’s lightnings now flash, but will delight to do as he is directed by that truth and, by showing forth God’s praises, will seek to offset the reproaches cast against Jehovah.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The kingdom of God is not in word, but in power. —1 Cor. 4:20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The effect of the coming of God’s kingdom upon his anointed remnant upon earth is noteworthy. Power, real power, has come to them. This is in the form of an authorization or empowering of them as God’s witnesses to preach the gospel of the established kingdom in all the world for a witness. In giving this witness they are &quot;strong in the Lord and in the power of his might&quot; as never before. They speak with authority before all, whether before the ruling factors or before the ruled masses. No longer is God’s service mere words, pious phrases and mouthings for them, but work, real and active physical and mental work in behalf of the kingdom interests. The power making them equal to all this has come with the coming of God’s kingdom and accounts for the world-wide work by printed message and radio.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The voice of thy thunder was in the heaven [whirlwind, R.</span><span class="font6"> P.]</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">: the lightnings lightened the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Ps. 77:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Thunder symbolizes the voice of Jehovah. “Hast thou an arm like God? or canst thou thunder with a voice like him?” (Job 40: 9) In 1914 Jehovah placed his King upon his holy hill of Zion. At that time the great World War began. The voice of Jehovah was heard above the din of war, and his lightnings exposed the duplicity of the fraudulent organization which had taken the name of his beloved Son. Jehovah’s thundering voice has been heard by his faithful witnesses, and they have mingled their own little voices therewith. With thunder there comes rain in abundance. (Job 38: 34) Rain is a symbol of refreshing truth, the truth that has refreshed and made glad the heart of the people of God. &quot;Thou, O God, didst send a plentiful rain, whereby thou didst confirm thine inheritance, when it was weary.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Thou shall beat in pieces many peoples: and thou shall devote their gain unto the Lord, and their substance unto the Lord of the whole earth.—Mic. 4:13, R. V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Since 1922 the Lord’s little army of colporteurs and workers in the class organizations have gone forth with books and put them in the hands of many order-loving people, and have thereby beaten down much opposition which the clergy by arousing prejudice have caused. Hence they have ‘beaten in pieces many peoples’, and now the people are forsaking the ecclesiastical systems as never heretofore. The Lord’s witnesses have received some monetary “gain” in going from door to door with the books; but this little gain from the distribution of millions of books has been used to make more books or been otherwise used by God’s zealous remnant to carry on the Lord’s work. It has been devoted to the Lord.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">We all, with open face, beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the spirit of the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—2 Cor. 3:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">God’s “able ministers of the new testament” have a mental vision of Christ. Having his spirit, and their hearts being set upon the Lord, they see, not their own selfishness reflected, but Christ reflected, as though they were looking into a mirror. Thereby they are changed into the likeness of the Lord gradually, that is, they become more unselfishly devoted to God and to the ministry which Jehovah has committed unto the new creation. They unselfishly give attention to the interests of the kingdom committed to them. More clearly they see that Jehovah has given the holy spirit to them that they might represent the Lord’s interests.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Exalt ye the Lord our God, and worship at his footstool; for he is holy.—Ps. 99:5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There is no other god save the only true and Almighty God, Jehovah, the Most High. Now every creature has his god, but only a few men on earth know the true God and worship him. The only true worship is the worship of Jehovah God and of his beloved Son, Christ Jesus. All other worship is devilish. Jehovah is worthy of praise to be sung by every thing that has intelligence. The time will come when everything will joyfully praise his name and exalt him. None others will enjoy everlasting existence. Jesus emphasized the fact that Jehovah in his due time would set up a righteous government among men and would destroy the rule of Satan and all false gods. And now “the Lord [Jehovah] reigneth’’. Let his remnant exalt and worship him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">May 30 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(147)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, . . . and hath committed unto us the word</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">of reconciliation.—2 Cor. 5:19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah God is the Savior of men. To save men from perishing he exercised himself in behalf of man and in strict harmony with justice. He took the initiative looking to man’s reconciliation, and he did so because he is love. It is his plan of salvation and reconciliation that is being worked out for mankind’s benefit, and his beloved Son Jesus is the great instrument God is using to accomplish his purpose. The knowledge of this truth must in due time be given to all men. Be it known that now is the time when God is beginning to open the gates of truth for the benefit of the human family; and to the remnant he has given the word, the message, of reconciliation to proclaim unto them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth Over.—Ps. 23:5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah anointed the Head of The Christ with the &quot;oil of joy”. The cup, though being a symbol of participating in the death of Christ, is also a symbol of entering into the joy of the Lord. The Lord has come to his temple, and all the temple class must be tested and proven. Those approved he invites to enter into his joy now. The time has come for Christ Jesus, as the great High Priest, to vindicate the great and holy name of his Father, Jehovah. This affords him great joy. He invites his followers to share in that joy and to devote themselves entirely to the Lord God and his service. To be joyful in the Lord all selfishness must be put aside. Let the anointed ones thus do and show forth the praises of Jehovah, who has done everything for us.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">So let all thine enemies perish, 0 Lord: hut let them that love him be as the sun when he goeth forth in his might.—Judg. 5:31.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Psalm 19:5 describes the sun &quot;as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber, and rejoiceth as a strong man to run a race”. Jesus is the &quot;Sun of righteousness”. Jehovah raised him out of death and exalted him above all others in heaven. Yet there was something that Jesus longed to see accomplished, and that was the destruction of the enemy and his organization and his Father’s name placed in the proper position before all his creatures. Hence when the Gentile times ended, he rejoiced to go forth in his might at the Father’s command and begin the battle against the enemy. The joy of the Lord is the vindication of his Father’s name. He has begun that work as Jehovah’s Chief Officer; he will finish it gloriously and to the glory of his Father. The faithful remnant that truly love Jehovah now share the Lord’s joy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman. —John 15:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This tells that Jehovah planted Jesus as the true vine. The fruitage which he sought was not souls for heaven ■ not character development; but the fruitage was and is a people to do his work on earth at the time he intended it to be done. So particular was Jehovah about this that he did not appoint another as husbandman to attend to the vine. Jehovah himself has looked after his vineyard. Jehovah has produced his desired fruit, to wit, a people to do his service; and at that time when he requires the work to be done he has a people for the honor of his name. The anointed ones on earth, therefore, now see their privileges and responsibilities before them. Their work is now set before them just as Jesus ’ work was set before him.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">He shall call to the heavens from above, and to the earth, that he may judge his people.—Ps. 50: 4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The judging of all those who profess to be &quot;his people’’ is by no means an unimportant feature. God gives it precedence over the judgment of the peoples: &quot;judgment must </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">begin</span><span class="font6"> at the house of God.” The judgment throne is now set in the temple in heaven, with Christ Jesus upon the judgment seat. (Isa. 6: 1-5) Those in the covenant by sacrifice who have died faithful must be awakened at the Lord’s coming to his temple and stand before the judgment seat. The holy angels of heaven evidently have some part in the judgment work: ‘ ‘ For the Son of man shall eome in the glory of his Father with his angels; and then he shall reward every man according to his works.” All in harmony with God are assembled that they may have some part in or be witnesses of the judgment; and now all who profess God’s name are having the opportunity to take their stand either for or against him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Being justified by his grace, we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.—Titus 3:7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Justification of man by Jehovah is only for the purpose of taking the justified one in as a part of the sacrifice of Jesus. The justified one must be baptized with the same baptism of death wherewith Jesus was baptized. He is called to follow the same course that Jesus the perfect man took. Being justified, he is thereafter begotten and anointed and thereby adopted into the body of Christ, from which time forward he is a new creature in Christ and an heir of God. The promise to such is that he shall be a joint-heir with Christ Jesus in glory provided he is faithful to his consecration and suffers with him and dies with him in the likeness of his death.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Him that overcometh ... I will write upon him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, which is New Jerusalem.—Bev. 3:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This promise serves as a token to indicate that the members of the temple class belong to Jehovah and represent him and are members of his organization. It denotes that such have confidence in Jehovah and also have the confidence of Jehovah, and that as fixed and faithful members of his organization they will bear witness to his name. It further denotes that those who bear the name of Jesus’ God have his backing and support, and have an understanding not only of his purposes but also of the purposes for which his name Jehovah stands. To have Jesus write upon them the name of the city of hie God, which is New Jerusalem, means that they are members of his kingdom or government, and that they actually engage in faithfully representing his government. Upon them the glorified Jesus writes his own new name, identifying them as members of the royal priesthood of which he is the illustrious Head.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Lord doth build up Jerusalem; he gathereth together the outcasts of Israel.—Ps. 147:2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Zion” has reference to God’s remnant, while “Jerusalem” refers more particularly to all the consecrated, including the'' great multitude ’ During the period of the Elijah work Jehovah was restoring the foundation truths of the divine plan to his devoted people and was thus building up those who had made a covenant with him. For many years, and specially during the World War, such because of their faithfulness to God were “outcasts” so far as Christendom is concerned. (Matt. 24:9) Then the due time came to gather together his faithful ones into the temple condition and to make such a part of his organization Zion. Sometime thereafter he showed his temple class that it was his will and his due time to have his message carried to the “great multitude&quot;, who also are part of Jerusalem, and thus to build them up. Hence the outcasts of spiritual Israel are gathered together and the building up of Jerusalem proceeds.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Now . . . might be known, by the church, the manifold wisdom of God, according to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Eph. 3:10,11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The evidence is overwhelming that Jehovah has a purpose, a plan. We may be absolutely certain also that the God of manifold wisdom has one way of carrying his plan into action. It would be inconsistent for him to have divers ways. Satan’s policy has been to induce men to believe that they have a sufficient amount of initiative and wisdom to make their own arrangement and to carry it out without regard to God’s Word and law. Those following such a course, outside or inside of God’s church, come to grief. But “great peace have they which love thy law: and nothing shall offend them ’<sup>5</sup>; nor shall they be turned away from Jehovah’s organization and his plan of action.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">He covereth his hands with the lightning, and giveth it a charge that it strike the mark.—Job 36:32, R. V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah’s lightnings are not aimless. There is a well-preconceived purpose in bringing forth at this time certain truths. His hand is a symbol of his power, and he covers his hands with the lightnings and strikes squarely home. His people are cheered thereby, and the enemy organization trembles. His thundering voice tells concerning his purpose, and he serves notice upon the small and the great. He uses his faithful servants to serve notice, that those of the people who might desire to know may know of his purposes. The work of thus serving notice, or giving the witness to the name of Jehovah, is but the prelude to the great battle of Armageddon. Those who love him can not refrain from singing forth his praises that his name may now be exalted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">June 9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;( 269)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">If ye be reproached for the name of Christ, happy are ye; ... on their part he is evil spoken of, but on your part he is glorified.—1 Pet. 4:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Fleshly Israel by its wrongful course brought rer proach upon Jehovah’s name. They were punished by Jehovah, who used the heathen nations as his instruments. This caused the heathen to boast against Jehovah and to speak evil of his name because they had triumphed over his people. Exactly the same thing occurs concerning many who have professed the name of Jesus Christ as their Redeemer and Jehovah as their God. Because of disregarding their covenant, they have justly merited and received the condemnation of order-loving people of the nations of earth; but the effect of this has also been to turn millions of people away from God and Christ and to cause the Lord to be evil spoken of. Such things are no cause for rejoicing; but those who because of seeking to glorify the Lord suffer reproach for his name, happy may they be.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Lord shall cut off all flattering lips, and the tongue that speaketh proud things.—Ps. 12:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Elihu said: “Let me not, I pray you, accept any man’s person, neither let me give flattering titles unto man.” It is also written: “A flattering mouth work-eth ruin” and “a man that flattereth his neighbour spreadeth a net for his feet”. (Prov. 26:28; 29:5) Flattery is a tool of the Devil. He uses it, even employing members of the church as his instruments to administer flattery for the very purpose of wrecking those who are prominent. The statement tainted with flattery is of Satan, but words of encouragement in harmony with God’s Word are proper. An anointed child of God may expect the subtle attacks of flattery emanating from the adversary and should guard against them. He should spurn flattery as a deadly poison. He should also refrain from flattering those who occupy a conspicuous or prominent position of service in the Lord’s arrangement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">June 11 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">(325)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">In that day shall there be an altar to the Lord in the midst of the land of Egypt, and a pillar at the border thereof to the Lord.—Isa. 19:19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Altar” means a slaughter-place or place of sacrifice. The text, therefore, refers to those who are in relationship to God by reason of the covenant by Sacrifice. They are in the midst of Egypt (the world) but are no part of it. They are daily offering up in righteousness the sacrifice of praise and devotion unto Jehovah, and by so doing are bearing the reproaches of Christ. They are also as a pillar, that is, as a memorial column that stands as a witness giving testimony. As such they are at the very border-line between the Devil’s kingdom and God’s kingdom. They have journeyed down to the time when they are about to pass over the border into the glorious kingdom of God of which they bear witness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">We give thanks, for thy name is near: men tell of thy wondrous works.—Ps. 75:1, R. V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah’s works in the earth today, being seen by his anointed ones, are evidences to them that God himself is near and is taking a hand in earth’s affairs. Some works he must do by forces other than his people on earth. </span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">Alm</span><span class="font6">ost, all the work done on earth by his anointed ones is to declare his wondrous works. Opportunities which they now have to serve him by thus making known his name are proof to them that God is using them, and that therefore they have his approval. Such is also proof that now is God’s due time to have his name exalted in the earth. With clearer vision of God’s purposes toward them, the anointed go on in his work with full confidence. They are not so much concerned about how long they must continue to work on earth, nor how great the danger of attack from the enemy; but their concern is faithfulness to their covenant. Hence as they serve they call upon his name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">June 13 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">(307)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Wherefore putting away lying, speak every man truth with his neighbour: for we are members one of another.—Eph. 4:25.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Lying lips are abomination to the Lord.” (Prov. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">12:22)</span><span class="font6"> God hates a liar and a murderer and puts both of them in the same class. (Prov. 6:16-19) Those who claim to be members of Christ should take heed to these plain statements of the divine rule of action. Talebearers, gossipers and backbiters who indulge their wilfulness to others’ injury should beware. If any one claims to be a child of God but busies himself in bearing tales of slander about another, we should avoid hearing and refuse to converse with that one, because that would be displeasing to God, being contrary to his law. He who slanders his brother, by so doing brands himself as a child of Satan, no matter what his claims may be.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">And Samson called unto the Lord, and said, 0 Lord God, remember me, I pray thee, and strengthen me.—Judg. 16:28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is the Word of the Lord that brings strength to those who are weak like the “great multitude” in the prison-houses of Babylon and who are typified by Samson. The food from God’s Word must, without doubt, be brought to them from the Lord in his own good way through those who are his witnesses, his “servant” class. (Isa. 42: 6, 7) Samson saw that the Philistines must die; similarly the “great multitude” of Christians, as they feed upon “present truth”, will see the situation and will take a positive stand on the Lord’s side, though it mean to pull down the wrath of Satan’s organization upon them. God will strengthen them to die thus as his witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">June 15 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">(324)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">For the Lord God giveth them light: and they shall reign for ever and ever.—Rev. 22:5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">After the Apostle John had received the message of Revelation he would have worshiped the messenger revealing it but was told not to do so but to worship Jehovah God. Here then is the announced divine rule. The creature is to worship the Creator and Giver of every good and perfect gift, from whom all revelation and truth emanate. All “lightnings” proceed from him and are evidences of the presence of Jehovah and of his Christ. They are given to God’s anointed remnant through their Head, Christ Jesus, thereby to afford the remnant a better understanding of God’s purpose and plan than they previously had. At the precise time the Lord suddenly came to God’s temple. After that time, as would well be expected, those who had been blessed by being made a part of the temple class would have more light upon divine truth. Such, abiding in the light and faithfully serving Jehovah to the end, shall see his face and reign with Christ Jesus for aye.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Go through, go through the gates; prepare ye the way of the people; . , . lift up a standard for</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">the people.—Isa. 62:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A “gate” as here used is a symbol of an entrance into the kingdom. God’s remnant, being now in the temple, are therefore entering the kingdom’s gates. As God’s witnesses they are ordered to prepare the way for the people by pointing them to his righteous government. They must remove the stumbling stones, the false doctrines by which the people have been blinded. They must lift up a standard, which means to point mankind to the fact that God’s kingdom is the only standard of government to which they must rally. Only those who are unselfishly devoted to Jehovah are participating in these activities as commanded.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">June 17 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">(35)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Every scribe which is instructed unto the kingdom of heaven, is like unto ... an householder, which bring-eth forth out of his treasure things new and old.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Matt. 13:52.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The householder produces from his treasury old things as well as new. Similarly those who are made disciples unto the kingdom of heaven need to be reminded of relatively “old” things and to have cumulative proof thereof as well as to receive new treasures from God’s Word. The evidence in support of the truth which God has already revealed is cumulative; that is, when God reveals a great truth he proves it by many testimonies from his Word, which testimonies gradually gather into a heap of evidence. Cumulative evidence in proof of the outworkings of God’s plan increases faith and makes the child of God strong in the Lord. Jehovah knows the importance of feeding the mind on that which holds one in the faith; and it certainly must be his will that we should frequently call each other’s attention to the “old” truths and accumulating evidence thereof.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">0 Lord, the hope of Israel, all that forsake thee shall be ashamed, . . . because they have forsaken the Lord, the fountain of living waters.—J er. 17:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Those who do not receive the truth and hold it in the love of the truth and obey the commands thereof, forsake the Lord’s arrangements and do not draw water from the wells of salvation that he has provided. They draw from their own wells, as the prophet has said: “They have forsaken me, the fountain of living waters, and hewed them out cisterns, broken cisterns, that can hold no water.’’ They shall be ashamed. They have forsaken the source of truth as God provided it for them, and have used what knowledge of truth they had in a selfish manner and according to their own wisdom, and have fallen away from the Lord. They make cisterns of their own, losing sight of the fact that the waters of truth and salvation come from the Lord and that no one can run ahead of the Lord. But the faithful draw water from God’s “wells of salvation’’.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Make mention that his name is exalted.—Isa. 12:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The name of Jehovah is now exalted in heaven because Satan is expelled therefrom; it is exalted in Zion because all who are of the Lord’s temple do show forth “his glory”. God has commanded that now his anointed must be his witnesses and sing forth his praises and tell the peoples of his doings that the peoples may know that Jehovah is God and the time for their deliverance has come. The song of praise has begun and the power thereof will increase, and the witness to his name and to his purposes will be accomplished in the earth even as Jehovah has commanded. Henceforth each one of the Lord’s anointed shall live by his faithfulness. If any anointed child of God draws back, he will lose God’s favor. God will preserve the faithful and give to such a glorious reward.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">do his work, his strange work.—Isa. 28:21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Now the day of Jehovah is at hand. It is to be a fierce and terrible day. Before peace settles down for ever on the earth and righteousness has full sway, there is a “strange work” to be made manifest which is not yet disclosed. It must be something that God did not reveal to his prophets. Manifestly it is God’.&quot; work, and therefore from heaven, and is not a work that man will do. It seems to be foreshadowed by what came to pass at Mount Perazim and at the valley of Gibeon, because the prophet refers thereto. “His strange work” therefore seems to be some mighty and phenomenal exhibition of divine power in the destruction of the enemy in the battle of Armageddon. The remnant must and will sing God’s praise while Jehovah brings this to pass.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Lord shall utter his voice before his army; for his camp is very great.—Joel 2:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Thus the Prophet Joel makes mention of God’s mighty organization which he describes as “his army”. Christ Jesus is the great Executive Officer heading this organization and is described in Revelation thus: “And I saw heaven opened; and behold a white horse; and he that sat thereon called Faithful and True.” Joel’s description shows God’s mighty organization moving into action, and the effect thereof is to cause the earth, the visible part of Satan’s organization, to quake, and the heavens, the invisible part thereof, to tremble. The entire organization works in exact harmony, and this is proof that all that are not in full harmony with Jehovah are no part of his organization. Joel shows that Jehovah is over and above his organization, “his army,” giving his victorious command to his forces, because he is at the right hand of his beloved Son, the active Field Marshal.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">God’s anointed ones, now occupying such a favored and exalted position in his arrangement as his witnesses and as ambassadors for the King, must needs continually guard against the onslaughts of pride. To discern the manner of the subtle temptation to which they are subjected we have but to look back to Lucifer’s experiences. As a cherub anointed of Jehovah he became greatly impressed with his own importance; he grew proud of his personality and power. That was really the cause of his fall. Later, as the Devil, he presented the same temptation to pride of life unto Jesus immediately following Jesus’ baptism and anointing. Thus the rule is established that the most subtle temptations to which God’s anointed ones are subjected are those of pride, ambition and self-importance.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Jesus was true to his Father. He was sent into the world to give testimony concerning his Father and the truth about him. The truth which he magnified above all others was and is that Jehovah is alone the true God, the Author and Finisher of all creation. Jesus declared himself to be sent of Jehovah who created him. He refused to receive honor from men or from the DeviL His title Amen signifies his faithfulness and trustworthiness toward Jehovah. He gave to Jehovah God all honor and claimed none for himself. He never failed to bear witness to the wondrousness, the power, and also the kingdom of his Father; and of him it is written: “Christ Jesus before Pontius Pilate witnessed a good confession.” He is the Head of Jehovah’s remnant of witnesses now on earth during this Laodicean period.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Where there is no vision, the people perish; but he that keepeth the law, happy is he.—Prov. 29:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Prosperously settled in the land flowing with milk and honey, the Israelites let their understanding and vision as to God’s purpose in calling and selecting them fade away. They did not even put forth their best endeavors to keep Jehovah’s law. Their selfishness led them into the wrong course. They sought their own comfort and glory rather than to perform their obligations to magnify Jehovah’s name and thus receive his approval. Having lost the vision, they headed for a fall. It is just as certain with the consecrated Christian as it was with fleshly Israel that if he loses his vision of God’s purposes he shall fall and suffer unhappy consequences.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">When I bring a cloud over the earth, . . . the bow shall be seen in the cloud: and I will remember my covenant.—Gen. 9:14,15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">If God remembers his covenant when his bow appears, then also man when looking upon the rainbow should call to mind that life proceeds from Jehovah and is a sacred thing and is not to be taken with impunity. This arrangement stands for an everlasting covenant because God calls it such and because it must stand for ever. God will never change his expressed rule regarding sanctity of life. He has not tried to regulate the affairs of earth’s rulers, but he holds them responsible in proportion to their knowledge or their opportunity to acquire knowledge of the terms of his law. God’s covenant with Noah included all the living creatures on earth, and was official because it announced his law. The breaking of it time and again by rulers and their subjects has resulted in defiling the earth. Therefore Isaiah 24: 5, 6 assigns the violating of this everlasting covenant as one of the reasons for God’s wrath against the organizations of men upon the earth.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Blessed are they that dwell in thy house: they will be still praising thee.—Ps. 84: 4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Savior Christ Jesus has proven, his complete loyalty to Jehovah, and he is happy for evermore. ‘ ‘ Thou hast made him most blessed for ever: thou hast made him exceeding glad with thy countenance.” Happiness is a condition of blessedness. Jesus declared that to know and to do God’s will brings happiness, saying: ‘‘If ye know these things, happy are ye if ye do them.” Disobedience to God’s law and a departure from the path of righteousness was the cause of all unhappiness. Those whom the Lord approves since coming to his temple continue to dwell in his house by reason of their constant devotion and faithfulness to him. They have entered into the Lord’s joy. They are blessed. They are the happiest people on earth today. They can not refrain from showing forth Jehovah’s praises.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: , . . what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? for ye are the temple of the living God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—2 Cor. 6:14,16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Satan and his organization are not only out of harmony with Jehovah but also oppose him, and especially now when Armageddon is impending. There can therefore be no partnership or fellowship between members thereof and members of the temple class. No one can devote part of himself to Jehovah God and the remainder to Satan’s organization and thus be acceptable to God. God’s temple may not be defiled; the members thereof must be holy. To be holy requires them not only, as far as possible, to live up to the highest standard of purity and righteousness, but also to be dedicated to the Lord, absolutely using their faculties to Jehovah’s glory and refusing to make any compromise with the organization which is hostile to God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The arms of the wicked shall be broken: but the Lord upholdeth the righteous. They shall not be ashamed in the evil time.—Ps. 37:17,19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The term “wicked” includes many in the denominational systems and also those who have been instructed in. “the present truth” after making a consecration to do God’s will. Having received a measure of enlightenment upon God’s Word and plan, they use it selfishly and wrongfully and despise God's further instructions as his lightnings reveal them. The Lord will break their power in his due time. Therefore no faithful child of God will use time in considering their false charges and seeking to defend himself. The Lord knows them that are his, and his strength and approval uphold them. The approval of no one else is worth while. Hence they set their fades like flint in God’s service and are not ashamed.— Isa. 50:7.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Therefore will he give them up, until the time that she which travaileth hath brought forth; then the remnant of his brethren shall return unto the children of Israel.—Mic. 5:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It was a long period from the days of the remnant of “Israel after the flesh” until the time that Zion travailed and brought forth. The year 1914 marked the time of the birth of The Nation and the bringing forth of the King or “Ruler”, for then God placed his anointed One upon his throne. Then followed the war in heaven, resulting in the ousting of Satan. After that Zion brought forth her children, “for as soon as Zion travailed, she brought forth her children.” The remnant of fleshly Israel foreshadowed the remnant of the new creation; and now, after the birth of The Nation and the Lord’s coming to his temple, this latter remnant is brought unto God and into the temple condition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">June 30 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">(296)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The words of the Lord are pure words; as silver tried in a furnace of earth, purified seven times. And he shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Ps. 12:6; Mal. 3:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Of course the Lord comes to his temple for a purpose, and one of the works done by him is to give to the approved ones a clearer vision of the truth than previously enjoyed by them. In this capacity he sits as a refiner of silver, silver symbolizing the truth, which being purified on earth gleams with greater luster. In harmony with this circumstance is the prophecy: “When the Lord shall build up Zion, he shall appear in his glory.” The Lord’s glorious appearing here mentioned must of necessity be unto the favored remnant class, the children brought forth by Zion and who are brought into the temple condition. The glory of this appearing unto them must be by and through a brighter shining of the truth. Hence that glory would not appear to the worldj nor even to those consecrated ones outside of the temple class, but would appear to the remnant, for whom these things were prepared.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">God hath become king over the nations, God hath taken his seat upon his holy throne.—Ps. 47:8, Rotherham.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The people of Israel organized by Jehovah constituted typical Zion. That government, as long as the people remained in harmony with God, was a theocracy. God withdrew his favor from typical Zion in 606 B. C. His prophets foretold the time when God would set up real Zion and represented him as thus returning to Zion. (Zeeh. 8: 2, 3) This undoubtedly took place at the time Jehovah placed his anointed Son upon the throne in 1914. The great theocracy has come. It is true Zion, God’s organization, exercising power and authority over man for his good. When seen and appreciated by the people it will be the iov of the whole earth.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Grieve not the holy spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption.—Eph. 4:30.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Lord Jesus warned against sinful action against Jehovah’s holy spirit. To sin against that spirit means to go deliberately contrary to the light of truth. The holy spirit is the invisible power of God which illuminates the human mind; hence to sin against it means a wilful and intentional course, contrary to knowledge of what is right and wrong. One' who thus sins is possessed of a malicious heart; which means that he has no regard for the law of God, and no consideration for the rights of others, but is fatally bent on doing evil in order to accomplish a selfish purpose, and that knowingly. The day of the church’s deliverance (redemption) is here, which makes it a critical time for those sealed by God’s holy spirit. The light of divine truth shines as never before; and unswerving devotion and prompt obedience must now be shown by the anointed, lest any of them grieve or sin against God’s holy spirit.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">To the only wise God our Saviour, be glory and majesty, dominion and power, both now and ever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Amen.—Jude 25.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is written: “Salvation belongeth unto the Lord: thy blessing is upon thy people.’’ (Ps. 3:8) Salvation is from Jehovah, and reconciliation of man to God is by and through the blood of his Son. Thus Jehovah is the Savior of man because he is the Author of his plan of salvation and all things are from him. Jesus Christ is also the Savior of man because he is the active agent used by the Father to save men, and all things are done by him in the Father’s name and by the Father’s authority. Jehovah now rules in majesty through his reigning Son, to whom earth’s dominion and all power in heaven and earth have been given. The time is now here to give to Jehovah the glory due unto his name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The things which God hath prepared for them that love him. . . . God hath revealed . , . unto us by his spirit.—1 Cor. 2:9,10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Those who are selfish and who are not wholly and unreservedly devoted to Jehovah will surely not be the recipients of the blessings that “God hath prepared for them that </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">love</span><span class="font6"> him’’. Those who love God will be faithful to obey his commandments. The 'things prepared’ are specially for the benefit of God’s remnant. The Lord came to his temple in 1918, and then only those who had been faithful were invited to enter and did enter into the joy of the Lord. Being now in the temple they are privileged to see the light of truth as God reveals it to his anointed and they delight to walk in the light. God has prepared this great day, and he has prepared the things in this day for those that love him. To them he gives a clear vision of the outworking of his plan and opens to them an opportunity to cooperate with him now.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">In the land shall be his [the prince’s] possession in Israel: and my princes shall no more oppress my people.—Ezek. 45:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Let us visualize the time described by the prophet. To Jehovah’s faithful witnesses, “of whom the world was not worthy,” is given the privilege to instruct the people. Because of faithfulness unto God and because of reconciliation now through Jesus’ blood, these men stand perfect. They are now princes; no longer are they called “fathers” in Israel. They have been advanced to a higher station. As the ransomed people enter upon the King’s highway, these princes will be explaining to them God’s law, whieh is the law of the new covenant. The law of God will be published by Christ, the Head of Zion, and by and through his appointed agencies, these “princes in all the earth”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">These are they which follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth.—Rev. 14:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah God made Jesus the Head and Chief One of the spiritual “Israel of God’’. All who are of this new creation and who would prove true to God must follow in Jesus' steps. The course of action which he pursued is the only right one; for “Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps’’. The Scriptures prove that every one who would stand with the Lamb of God upon Mount Zion and receive Jehovah’s approval must take exactly the same course that Jesus took on earth. By calling Jesus the “Faithful and True Witness” God has indicated that all whom he approves among his children must likewise be witnesses to his great name.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">He delighteth not in the strength of the horse; he tak-eth not pleasure in the legs of a man.—Ps. 147:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah gave the horse his strength (Job 39:19), yet he caused it to be written: “The horse is prepared against the day of battle; but safety is of the Lord.” (Prov. 21:31) The man on horseback feels his importance and prides himself both in his hoise and in his legs which he uses to control the horse. So men of the world, like the Egyptians, trust not in the Lord but in human power, and take pride therein. But Jehovah delights not in human pride or strength, nor in them that trust therein. This is a warning to all who are devoted to the Lord that they can not trust in the strength or ability of man, even though the man in whom they trust be unusually wise, faithful, swift, and strong, as pictured by the man on horseback. It is not pleasing to the Lord for a child of his to magnify the name of a human creature or to take pride in human strength. “The Lord taketh pleasure in them that fear him.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Ye </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">have condemned, ye have killed the righteous one; he doth not resist you.—Jas. 5:6, R. V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Shall we stop work which God has given us to do in order to fight with our slanderers? Did Jesus go into the courts and defend his good name and reputation? No; he &quot;made himself of no reputation”, which must mean that he was indifferent as to his reputation among creatures. Why then should a child of God let Satan draw him into a controversy and thus occupy his time and take him away from a proper service of Jehovah? Also, when slanderous charges are laid against those who are actively serving the Lord, and these charges go unnoticed by the one charged, should we become disturbed and wonder whether the charges are true ? No; judge not before the slandered one is proven guilty upon a proper hearing and beyond a reasonable doubt.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">And beside this, giving all diligence, add . . . to brotherly kindness charity [love].—2 Pet. 1:5,7. </span><span class="font6">Love is the sum total of all that must be done in the performance of one’s covenant. God is love, and in him is the complete expression thereof. Everything he does or has done is marked by unselfishness. The Christian, in the performance of his covenant, will love Jehovah supremely. Now the time is here for him to prove his love for God by keeping God’s commandments and by boldness, outspokenness, in declaring God’s message to the nations. The Christian must be perfect in love. His heart devotion must be to Jehovah and his righteous cause. He will not fear what man may say about him, but with a burning zeal for the Lord’s cause he will be eager to obey his commandments. The worst that any enemy can do against him is to take his earthly life, and that only by God’s permission; and if this occurs while he is faithfully performing his duty, it means his perfection in heavenly glory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">I will not reprove thee for thy sacrifices . . . continually before me. Offer unto God thanksgiving; and pay thy vows unto the Most High.—Ps. 50:8,14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Many continue merely to meditate on the Lord and assume to offer the “sacrifice of praise” by meeting with each other, but they do nothing to carry out God’s commandments in giving witness concerning Jehovah’s name and his kingdom or in declaring his vengeance against Satan’s world system. Many such render some service as though God needed what they have to give, and they feel quite important in what they do. They insist on trying to serve him in their own way, and think God needs them in heaven to help run his universe. Let us, however, remember that at most we are “unprofitable servants” as regards Jehovah’s enrichment. Having entered into a covenant with him to do his will, we have sworn a vow to be obedient to his commandments and must henceforth serve him with thanksgiving and a joyful heart.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">July 11 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(328)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">[Thou] hast lifted up thyself against the Lord of heaven; . . . God hath numbered thy king</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">dom, and finished it.—Ban. 5:23, 26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah numbered Babylon’s days; and he also numbered the days of Gentile supremacy in the earth, that is, “the times of the Gentiles.” The non-Jewish governments of earth have therefore never been governments representing the Lord God, nor have any of these governments or their rulers ruled by divine right. They have ruled by sufferance on Jehovah’s part. But during all that time God has had his witnesses, like Daniel, in the world to testify concerning his goodness. God has awaited his own good time to bring forth his loyal Son whose right it is to rule. That Son is now the King and is the first to rule the earth by divine right. Why then hesitate to advertise him and his kingdom?</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Thou shall love the Lord thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Deut. 6:5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">God’s dignity would preclude him from commanding any creature to worship him for his (God’s) own good. He owes the human race nothing. Strictly adhering to justice Jehovah could have wiped the human race completely out of existence; but his love led him to make a plan for man’s deliverance, and having made it he will carry it out. Knowing Satan’s insatiable desire for worship and that if his chosen people followed after Satan they would be led into wickedness and must die, the love of God provided the commandment that the Israelites should have no other god, but should love Jehovah supremely. Jesus confirmed God’s rule that only those who love Jehovah with all their heart and soul shall inherit life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">July 13 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">(109)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Behold who hath created these things, that bringeth out their host by number: he calleth them all by names, by the greatness of his might.—Isa. 40:26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">These words, testifying to the great Creator’s unlimited wisdom and power, may be subject to a symbolical understanding. The Hebrew word for &quot;star” may figuratively mean &quot;prince”, and the Scriptures plainly use the word to apply to the sons of God. (Job 38:7; Num. 24:17) The literal stars shine by night and reflect the glory of the greater light of day. The period of sacrifice from the cross to the kingdom has been a long dark night; during it God’s anointed ones have been &quot;sons of light”. (1 Thess. 5:5) Now that Jehovah is gathering these sons into the temple condition, he causes greater light to shine upon them. To be sure Jehovah knows the number of those in the temple state: ‘ ‘ the Lord knoweth them that are his”; and it is certain that he has given to each of them a name, which in due time each one faithful to the end will know.—Rev. 2:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Yea, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">he shall be holden up: for God is able to make him stand.—Rom. 14:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Let us bear in mind that as servants of the Lord none of us are within ourselves competent to measure up to and perform the duties which the Lord has laid upon us. We are competent only when humbly and unselfishly we do what the Lord directs us to do. Let us give him credit for being able to know when his servants are doing right or wrong. Let us give him credit for being able to use any one in his organization. God is able to direct his work today through any man who is devoted to him, whether that individual is handsome and eloquent or otherwise. God is able to make him stand and bear up under the requirements and burdens of the work. Since Jehovah has “set the members in the body as it hath pleased him’’, we may know that he will see to it that the work is carried out to his glory and according to his will.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah is God and hath shed on us light,—bind ye the festal sacrifice with cords, up to the horns of the altar.—Ps. 118:27, Rotherham.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Since the Lord’s coming to his temple Jehovah has shed on us more light with respect to the covenant by sacrifice. How then does the new creature bind this festal or joyful sacrifice to the altar? It is manifest that a dead victim would require no binding. The Hebrew for “bind” also means to order, make ready, prepare, and suggests the thought of our standing ready to serve Jehovah, presenting our bodies as living sacrifices. The covenanter has the liberty of withdrawing from the sacrificial arrangement and taking the consequences or of remaining firm and true to his covenant. It is by the new creature’s loving devotion to the performance of his covenant to Jehovah’s honor that he thus binds the sacrifice that the Lord Jesus as High Priest may offer it up to Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Blessed be ye poor: for yours is the kingdom of God. —Luke 6:20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Participation in the heavenly kingdom must be a wonderful and unspeakable favor and honor, for Jesus, God’s anointed King, declared those “blessed” who are heirs thereof. They will be blessed beyond measure when they are actually exalted and “shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father”; but they are also wondrously blessed now while still on earth, because the King has returned and in 1914 took his power to reign, and the kingdom has come. Their days of waiting for it have ended; and now the King has come to the Lord’s temple and ushered the “good and faithful servant” class into his joy, and they are handling such interests of the kingdom as the Lord has committed unto them. He has covered them with the robe of righteousness; it is a time for rejoicing greatly.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Lord is good, a strong hold in the day of trouble. —Nah. 1:7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The “remnant” must now be God’s faithful witnesses because he has commanded such. All of the temple class will now show forth his glory, because it is written: “In his temple doth every one speak of his glory.” As they go forward in this the day of trouble, giving testimony to Jehovah’s name, for them it is a time for peace and songs of joy: peace, because their confidence in Jehovah is complete; joy, because they have a part with Jesus in vindicating Jehovah’s name. Only the weak in faith and the fearful draw back, as such did in Gideon’s day. Jehovah has brought this faithful remnant into his “secret place”, and to them he is a refuge and stronghold. There he hides them from the destructive arrows of the enemy, that they may finish the earthly work he has given them to do to his praise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">For this is the will of God, even your sanctification, that ye should abstain from fomication.-l Thess. 4:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">As</span><span class="font6"> far as the true church itself is concerned, it is as sure to be selected, elected, crowned and fully sanctified, as it is that our Lord Jesus has already fulfilled his part of the covenant by sacrifice and has been seated at the right hand of Jehovah’s throne. As to the individuals composing the church, that is a conditional matter. The complete sanctification of each individual will depend upon his effort “to possess his vessel in sanctification and honour” (v. 4), that is, upon his own loyalty and devotion to the will of God and his carrying out even to the death the covenant entered into with Jehovah through Jesus. He must abstain from fornication with the adversary’s organization, for such is Jehovah’s will toward him. ‘ ‘ Neither fornicators, nor idolaters, . , , shall inherit the kingdom of God.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">July 19 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">(148)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Il ehold, the name of the Lord cometh from far, burning with his anger. . . . And the Lord shall cause his glorious voice to be heard.—Isa. 30:27,30.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is written (Ps. 50:3): ‘‘Our God shall come, and shall not keep silence: a fire shall devour before him, and it shall be very tempestuous round about him.” This indicates the manifestation of God’s presence in a time of judgment. He consumes his enemies: “Our God is a consuming fire. ’ ’ He also makes his messengers a flaming fire against the enemy organization: he “maketh his angels spirits; his ministers a flaming fire”. Now is the time when God comes forth to judge, and his judgment will consume everything that is opposed to him. During this period of judgment Jehovah does not keep silence but manifests his power and also causes his glorious message to be sung to his praise by his anointed remnant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">They shall ask the way to Zion with their faces thitherward, saying, Come, and let us join ourselves to the Lord</span><span class="font6"> in </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">a perpetual covenant.—J er. 50:5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">They must come to Zion to join themselves in covenant with Jehovah. They can not of themselves make a covenant with the Lord. Zion is God's organization. Christ Jesus being the chief One of Zion, the name applies to him individually and specifically. The houses of Israel and Judah are at enmity with God and are not competent to enter into a covenant with Jehovah. The same is true with reference to all men. Israel must therefore have some one who is competent to act for and in its behalf and to assume the responsibility of the covenant and to treat directly with Jehovah God. That one is he who has redeemed the Jew from the curse of the law covenant and who by his death became rightful owner of that nation and of all mankind.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death; . . . for before his translation he had this testimony, that he pleased God.—Heb. 11:5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Enoch, because of faith in God, was an outstanding figure amongst all the men of earth. He was a witness on earth for God. Surely he was known amongst the other men, and known by the fact that he believed on God and served him while all others were against the Lord. Such faith under adverse conditions was pleasing to God, and God rewarded that faith and faithfulness by translating Enoch; that is to say, while Enoch was still in the vigor of youth according to antediluvian age-lengths and while he walked with God and joyfully conformed to God’s righteous law the Lord manifested his pleasure by taking Enoch suddenly away from earth’s wicked scenes. His faith is set forth for an example unto God's remnant today.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Yet am I with you in the spirit, joying and 'beholding your order, and the stedfastness of your faith in</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Christ.—Col. 2: 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">If Paul rejoiced, surely Jehovah rejoices when he beholds order being observed among the congregations of his anointed ones. Everything in God’s great arrangement is orderly so far as he is concerned. Those in full harmony with him desire to be orderly and to do everything in order. We should have faith in Christ and in God that if any part of the Lord’s organization goes wrong, he will correct it. Being a God of order, he must, logically, have a visible, orderly organization on earth and must use some one therein to formulate plans of operation. Since nothing in his organization escapes his oversight, it follows that if any one in authority gives an improper command the Lord will make that manifest in due time. Rebellion against his organized way, or otherwise refusing to work in harmony with his organized people, would be decidedly out of order and against &quot;faith in Christ’’. It savors of antichrist.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">We are ambassadors therefore on behalf of Christ, as though God were entreating by us.-2 Cor. 5:20, A.R.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The faithful remnant of Christ’s followers on earth are ambassadors of God and of his King. As ambassadors they are sent to the nations </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">while hostilities exist.</span><span class="font6"> Jesus was God’s Ambassador to bring reconciliation between the people and God because they were under a hostile government; so now the members of Christ’s body participate as ambassadors in the ministry of reconciliation because the people are &quot;alienated, and enemies in mind by wicked works’’. (Col. 1: 21) The Lord’s ambassadors are in the world but neither of it nor at peace with it, and hence are authorized to declare God’s denunciations, as contained in his Word, against Satan’s evil system. When their work is done, God will take his ambassadors away.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">TAe </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that heareth say, Come. And . . . take the water of life freely.—Rev. 22:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah, the Great Spirit, has now commanded a tremendous witness to be given on earth. Christ Jesus is his right-hand executive officer therein. The bride, viz., Christ’s body, includes those now on earth who are of Zion and who remain faithful and true. Causing the witness to be given, Jehovah says to those who hear his commandments: “Come,” that is, take your stand against Satan and on the side of the only true God, and thus come to “the fountain of living waters”. The remnant rejoice at this message. They know it must go to the “great multitude” also. Being of the bride class they say, in obedience to The Spirit’s command, “Come.” Those of the consecrated ones who have taken no part in giving the witness, but who now hear the invitation and understand it and come to see their privilege of sharing in the witness work, to such the Lord says: “Let him that heareth [also take his stand on Jehovah’s side and] say, Come.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">I have found David the son of Jesse, a man after mine own heart, which shall fulfil all my will.—Acts 13:22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Why was David a man after God's own heart ? The Devil was never able to seduce David to worship idols; David was always faithful and true to Jehovah. He did not at any time compromise the Lord’s righteous cause with that of Satan’s organization. David, be it noted, in this respect pictures that class of creatures who will find approval with Jehovah. No one will ever have God’s approval and be accepted as a member of his kingdom who either directly or indirectly turns away from worshiping the true God, or who lends aid, counsel, comfort, or support to any part of the Devil’s system. He who would maintain the Lord’s approval must be absolutely faithful to the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">His enemies will I clothe with shame; hut upon himself shall his crown flourish.—Ps. 132:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The everlasting covenant, “even the sure mercies of David, ’ ’ is really between Jehovah and his beloved Son Christ Jesus and includes those who become his associates. God took away the diadem and the crown from Israel’s king at Zedekiah’s overthrow, and stated that he would not give it to another “until he comes whose right it is”. That crown, when placed upon the head of the One whose right it is to wear it, would be represented by pure gold, for the reason that gold is symbolic of things divine; and since the right proceeds from Jehovah, The Divine One, he placed that crown upon the head of him who is anointed to things divine, namely, Jesus. There it shall for ever flourish.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">July 27 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">(55)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Be thou an ensample to them that believe, in word, in manner of life, in love, in faith, in purity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—1 Tim. 4:12, R. V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Ensample” means a pattern or model for imitation. All the anointed should seek to be ensamples, not thereby to call attention to oneself for self-glorification and favorable comment, but unselfishly for the promotion of the Lord’s work and for the welfare of the brethren. Since the Scriptures clearly set forth that it is now God’s time and will for the witness to be given to the people as Paul did it, “from house to house,” how can any one, especially an elder, be a model for imitation if he fails or refuses to take part in such witness work as opportunity is afforded himl The question of the number of books he succeeds in placing with the people is not the vital point; but it is his own faithfulness and the ensample he is able to set by his word of witness, his zealous conduct, his love in keeping God’s commandments, his faith in God’s arrangements, and his purity from Satan’s organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world.—Matt. 28:20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In what way could Jeaus be with his church on earth and yet be in heaven ? Could he look down from heaven upon them? “Jehovah looketh from heaven; he beholdeth all the sons of men.” Why is this not true also of the divine Jesus? Jehovah sends his angels to minister unto the needs of his servants. (Heb. 1:14) Consistent with this, Jesus could be with his faithful ones in a representative capacity by his duly constituted deputies, safeguarding the interests of the faithful. He had said to his disciples: “For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them.” Thus the faithful have the Lord’s protection by and through his duly constituted representatives, the angels; they also have the Lord’s spirit whereby they are comforted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">July 29 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">(217)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Lord is a man of war: the Lord is his name. Pharaoh’s chariots and his host hath he cast into the sea—Ex. 15:3,4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The demonstration of Jehovah’s power in the overthrow of the Egyptians, and his miraculous preservation of the Israelites, were for the purpose of keeping before the minds of that people that Jehovah is the only true Deity, and that from him alone can blessings and salvation proceed. These things occurred and were recorded, not for fleshly Israel alone, but God intended that his people now should receive comfort and encouragement by getting a mental vision of this picture, the reality of which is about to be performed completely. In connection therewith God has appointed a work for his saints to do, and that work is not to use carnal weapons but to “sing the song of Moses . . . and the song of the Lamb”. Meantime Jehovah will show himself as a “man of war” and will completely vindicate his name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">7 </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">will make her that halted a remnant, and her that was cast far off a strong nation; and the Lord shall reign over them in mount Zion from henceforth, even for ever.—Micah 4: 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">For a long time Zion has been the one that halted and was pushed aside. Now Zion, which is God’s organization, is brought into prominence. The members thereof on earth are now but a remnant, but the time has come for this remnant to be strong in the Lord and to triumph in his name. They must now press the battle at the gate and never falter nor turn back. Jehovah God has now put his protection around Zion and over the people thereof, and by and through his beloved Son, Jesus, he shall reign for evermore. He is all powerful; and having placed his King upon the throne, he is moving forward majestically to absolute and certain victory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">July 31 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">(43)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The invisible things of him since the creation of the world are clearly seen, being perceived through the things that are made, even his everlasting power and divinity.—Rom. 1:20, R. V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The issue, Who is God? should never have been raised. There never was a just cause or excuse to call in question the divinity and supremacy of Jehovah. His works give conclusive testimony that he is the Most High. But now it is God’s expressed purpose that his intelligent creation shall have no excuse to deny him, and for that reason all shall receive notice in due time. For this reason there has at all times been some on earth whom Jehovah has used to bear witness for him. But his written Word shows that now the time has come when he will have his faithful anointed ones to give special witness, and that the time must come shortly when he will conclude the testimony by his own great witness, that all may inexcusably know that he is God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">He is Lord of lords, and King of kings: and they that are with him are called, and chosen, and faithful.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Rev. 17:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">God never called any one for the purpose of giving him a chance to “develop a beautiful character”. He has not chosen the called ones for such an unreasonable and impossible task. His call to the kingdom of God is, first of all, only after one has made a full consecration to do the will of God. That call, therefore, is Jehovah’s summons to the consecrated one to discharge a particular or specific duty, which duty is outlined in his Word of instruction. Proving his devotion and faithfulness while on earth, the consecrated one shall enter upon the weighty duties of a Christian’s heavenly mission. He will be found on the side of the King of kings now and will sit down with him in his heavenly throne then.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">This is love, that we walk after his commandments. —2 John 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Satan, by fraud, deceit, enticement and coercion, induces men to obey him. Jehovah God does not employ coercion to induce those belonging to his organization to obey him. It is written: “If ye endure chastening, God dealeth with you as with sons; for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not?” However, chastening is not coercion, but is the expression of Jehovah’s love and of his interest in his child’s attaining the prize set before him. God is love, and his plan is to teach that love is the only proper motive for action. He who loves God will obey him. The anointed one who is prompted by loving devotion toward God to walk and who does obediently walk in the way that Jehovah has appointed, will ultimately receive “the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">August 3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">(168)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The mountains shall bring peace to the people, and the little hills, by righteousness.—Ps. 72:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The lofty mountain speaks peace to the heart of man. God uses it as a symbol of peace, and how fittingly! As the reverential man lifts his eyes to the mountain’s peaks, seemingly the mountain smiles upon him and says: ‘My peace is eternal because my Creator made me so. My peace pictures the peace that his glorious government shall bring to those who lift up their heads and turn their hearts to God.’ The mountain stands as an eternal sentinel and never sleeps, picturing God’s kingdom ever watching over those who love and obey him. Knowing that his kingdom will bring peace to the people, God’s remnant may even now rest in the peace of that kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">August 4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">(144)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Because thou hast hept the word of my patience, I also will keep thee from the hour of temptation, which shall come upon all the world.—Bev. 3:10.-</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In 1914 Jehovah placed his King Christ Jesus upon his throne. The great battle in heaven followed, resulting in Satan’s being cast out of heaven and into the earth. Then, that is, in the year 1918, the great “hour of temptation” upon “them that dwell upon the earth” began. It is the time of the test upon the visible part of Satan’s organization, and this test comes upon those of earth who have claimed to be Christian. The “remnant” find themselves in the earth among such, even as Jesus was in the world but not part of it. The primary issue now is, Who is God? God’s message of truth now being declared has placed the issue before the peoples of earth. In the midst of this temptation the Lord keeps the “remnant” by closely observing them and by a watchful care over their highest interest. He covers them with the robe of righteousness and the garments of salvation. This he does because of their devotion and faithfulness to him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Who provideth for the raven his foodt when his young ones cry unto God, they wander for lack of meat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Job 38:41.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Ravens were used to feed Elijah. The raven being designated as unclean (Lev. 11:13,15), this provision for Elijah indicates that sometimes Jehovah uses imperfect things and creatures to his glory. Thus the ravens may well picture those men who brought some food to God’s anointed ones during the period of darkness and drought, which food has been a real help in studying the Bible. The young ravens are unable to feed themselves, much less to bring food; in crying to God for food they may well represent unjustified ones on earth hungrily desiring to be fed on that which is divine truth, and which will show them the way to life everlasting. God now provides food for such by using his anointed ones as his instruments to hand out the truth from door to door, as it were at the very nests in which the young ravens cry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">August 6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(34)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Wherefore wait for me, urgeth Jehovah, until the day when I rise up as witness, for my decision is to gather nations, to assemble kingdoms, to pour out on them mine indignation.—Zeph. 3:8, Rotherham.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">All the witnessing that God’s &quot;remnant” might do for centuries could not destroy Satan’s organization nor bind that evil one. Then what shall the remnant do? Cease witnessing and wait idly for the Lord? No! Although they realize their powerlessness to overthrow the forces of evil, they know that that is not their work. They know that they must be faithful and true witnesses of Jehovah God because now the great climax of giving witness over a period of sixty centuries has been reached. In due time Jehovah will seal their testimony by himself coming forth to give the final witness that will for ever clear his name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">August 7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">(77)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">He that loveth not, knoweth not God; for God is love. —1 John 4:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The divine record truthfully states that &quot;God is love”. That does not mean merely that God is kind, compassionate and merciful to the erring one. Love is synonymous with complete unselfishness. This means that everything that Jehovah has done or does is totally free from selfishness. He does nothing for his intelligent creation with the expectation of receiving something in return for his benefit. It is impossible for the creature to bring any benefit to the Creator Jehovah. He possesses everything that is good. What he does for his creatures is for their good. Therefore everything that God does is done unselfishly, and he is moved to do so by love.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">August 8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">(71)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">If any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Rev. 22:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Clearly this warning applies to a class of persons who have been favored with at least some knowledge of the divine plan as set forth in God’s Word. &quot;In this book” (Rev. 20:11-15) is described the judgment trial of the peoples of earth after the downfall of Satan’s organization. It is plainly stated that those who fail in that trial, and whose names are therefore not written in the &quot;book of life”, shall be destroyed. However, there are those of recent times who have had a knowledge of the divine plan and who still claim to have developed a beautiful character but who now insist that God is so very loving that he will save every creature, including Judas and the Devil himself. Hence they take the Devil’s side in spite of the direct statements of God’s Word that the wicked shall be destroyed in the second death. Thus without any excuse they &quot;add” to God’s revealed plan. The elect will not permit themselves to be deceived into this error.—Prov. 30; 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">I have written unto you, young men, because ye are strong, and the word of God dbideth in you, and ye have overcome the wicked one.—1 John 2:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Through the Prophet Joel Jehovah had given his promise that in these the last days the “young men shall see visions”. A “vision” means a clearer understanding of the Lord’s truth; while “young men” refers to the vigorous ones (whether old in years or actually young) who are engaged actively in the Lord’s service. God’s Word abides in such, for, true to prophecy, those that have come to a knowledge of the truth in this latter period of time were quicker to grasp an understanding of the truth, to receive a clear vision of God’s purposes and of their own relationship to his work, and to engage joyfully in that work. It is written: “They overcame him [the wicked one] by the blood of the Lamb </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">and</span><span class="font6"> by the word of their testimony.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">August 10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">(254)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Fret not thyself because of evil doers. . . . Rest m the Lord, and wait patiently' for him.—Ps. 37:1,7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Since the Lord’s coming to his temple and taking account with his servants, the “evil servant” class has been manifested. This class not only refuses to participate in declaring God’s message, but goes further than that in severely criticizing the members of the “remnant” who are diligently and faithfully serving God; they even take pleasure in seeing this “remnant” persecuted by those of Satan’s organization which is defaming Jehovah’s name, and thus they make themselves a part of antichrist. Those devoted to the Lord’s service should not fret or be disturbed and discouraged by vile, slanderous accusations or other activities of this evil class against them. The Lord promises to give due attention to the workers of iniquity and to vindicate his own glorious name and to vindicate all who faithfully represent him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">If thine eye offend thee, pluck it out: it is better for thee to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Mark 9:47.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is infinitely better not to yield to “the lust of the eyes” or “the lust of the flesh” and “the pride of life” than to miss the kingdom of God. Jesus attached the highest importance to attaining a place in the kingdom. His parables magnified membership in the kingdom as a prize worthy of utmost striving after. He strongly advised his followers to seek it first. He taught them to pray for it. He declared we are blessed in being permitted to know its mysteries and secrets. As Jehovah’s anointed King he commissions us to preach it and to witness for it. This we must do if we would prove eligible to reign with him. We must serve as ambassadors for Christ Jesus, the King, and especially now that the kingdom has come.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">August 12 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">(130)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">G eh old, I have given him for a witness to the people, a leader and commander to the people.—Isa. 55:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In addition to being the Redeemer Jesus must also be a witness for God to the people, “a leader and commander” to turn them back to God. Jesus’ own words prove conclusively that he came to earth to “bear witness unto the truth” and that his followers must likewise be witnesses to the truth. Just as surely as Jesus was and is the Leader of the people, even so those who share the kingdom with him must act with him to lead the people unto God by magnifying the name of Jehovah God. They must now tell the people that Jehovah is God and declare the day of his vengeance against Satan’s organization, and thus give witness to lead the people to God, that some may hear and understand before the battle of Armageddon begins.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">In that day will I make a covenant for them with the beasts of the field, and with the fowls of heaven, . . . and will make them to lie down safely.—Hos. 2:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The animals of the mountains and of the forest are now at enmity with man. In their wild state they try to kill man, and man in turn kills them. During the administration of the new covenant it seems quite evident from the Scriptures that the beasts of the field and the fowls of the air and the creeping things will no longer show fear of man, nor will man need to be afraid of them. God, of course, knows the language of the animals and of the fowls of the air, and he will speak to them in their own language and quiet their fear of man. Thus peace will be for ever established between the wild beasts and man. &quot;And they shall dwell safely in the wilderness, and sleep in the woods.&quot;—Ezek. 34: 25.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">August 14 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">(316)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">We have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—2 Cor. 4:7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah has committed to the new creation a ministry, that is, a commission to do certain things; and this commission is a wonderful treasure, a valuable thing, and indeed the most important thing that the creature could have now. The new creature yet on earth has an earthly organism; therefore this treasure, namely, this commission or ministry of reconciliation, is given to him while in this earthen vessel. Paul tells us why &quot;we have this treasure in earthen vessels”; he says: &quot;That the exceeding greatness of the power may be of God, and not from ourselves.” Jehovah has thus ordained it, to the end that no man in Christ may properly boast, but that the new creature might use this ministry to glorify the name of Jehovah, by telling the people that the all-excelling agencies for bringing life to the people are from God.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">He treadeth the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God.—Rev. 19:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the overthrow of Satan’s organization, pictured by treading the winepress, what part is performed therein by Jesus’ faithful followers on earth? The Scriptures make it clear that the part of such is merely as servers of notice; as God’s witnesses they merely declare to the people his purposes. They take no part in using physical force against existent worldly systems. God does not need physical help, and any such exercise of violence by Christians would be contrary to his will. Seeing the beginning of God’s righteous government, they delight to announce that it is at hand and that Jehovah will save the people and give them their heart’s desire through his anointed King.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">August 16 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">(32)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">He will fulfil the desire of them that fear him. —Ps. 145:19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The more fully a person is convinced that his course of action is right, that is, m harmony with the Lord’s Word and will, the more determined he is to continue in that right course of action that his desire and purpose may be fully accomplished. The purpose and desire of the Christian is to have the final approval of Jehovah; to be faithful and true to him and to bring glory to his name; to see him face to face and to enjoy endless blessings of life and companionship with Christ Jesus the anointed King. The Christian gradually comes to realize that Jehovah has anointed him for this very purpose and that fulfilling the divine commission is the condition precedent to entering Jehovah’s presence and being made in Jesus’ likeness. Hence he goes forth determined to fulfil that commission and to keep on in that course with songs of praise on his lips. As he so does, Jehovah continues to give him more light and a better understanding of the Word for his encouragement, strengthening and guidance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Hearken, 0 earth, and all that therein is: and let the Lord God be witness against you, the Lord from his holy temple.—Mie. 1:2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When Jehovah’s testimony is given from his holy temple his voice shall roar in thunder tones, the earth shall quake and the governments thereof shall melt before him. But the Lord’s announced purpose is that now the people, both the rulers and the ruled, shall receive notice of his determination and intention. What method is he employing thereto ? Chiefly books and other literature, by means of which he is delivering the witness to the people of so-called Christendom. He is also using the radio to open the way into many homes by calling the attention of the people and awakening their interest. Then he sends forth his faithful ones from door to door to put the printed message in the hands of the people.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection.—Rev. 20:6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jesus’ course of action has always been in harmony with Jehovah; therefore he has always been God’s “holy One’’. As the Logos, and also when on earth, he was perfect, harmless and without blemish. His holiness, however, consisted of more than perfection of organism, mind, heart and will. Regardless of his perfection of nature he could not have been holy without being always fully given over to and in accord with his Father. He was completely and wholly dedicated to the performance of the obligations laid upon him by his Father. His stedfast course of righteousness on earth led to a most shameful death, but Jehovah has resurrected him: ‘ ‘ thou hast made him most blessed for ever. ’' The members of his body are called to share his death and also “the likeness of his resurrection ’ ’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Behold the man whose name is The Branch: . . . even he shall build the temple of the Lord; and he shall bear the glory.—Zech. 6:12,13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Christ Jesus, the beloved Son of Jehovah, is The Branch, because he is the direct creation of God. He bears the glory, because he is next to Jehovah and is “the brightness of his glory”. (Heb. 1; 3) He builds the true temple of Jehovah, because he is “the chief corner stone, in whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord”; and as Jehovah's Messenger he raises up the sleeping members thereof and comes to the temple class on earth for judgment. He is now the King whom God has set upon his “holy hill of Zion”; and he is the reigning Priest of the Most High God, because he is Jehovah’s chief executive officer. “Behold [by faith] The Branch.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">August 20 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">(189)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Whom God hath set forth . . . to declare, I say, at this time, his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Rom. 3:25,26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The enemy has misrepresented Jehovah by claiming that God is so cruel that he must have the blood of Jesus to appease his wrath, after which he is willing to forgive the sinner. This is untrue. God is just. The execution of his law in harmony with justice can not be ignored. God’s love provided a way for the requirements of justice to be fully met, and this was done by the willing obedience of Jesus unto death. The pouring out of his life-blood as a substitute for Adam forms the basis of man’s reconciliation to God; and then, because of man’s repentance, his faith in God and in the shed blood of Jesus and his obedience, he is justified.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">None saith, Where is God my Maker, who giveth songs in the night f—Job 35:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah caused songs to be composed by his inspired servants, and the faithful in Israel sang them. Though written long ago, these songs were meant for the benefit of spiritual Israel, who form God’s visible organization now. These songs of praise are expressions of joy and are sung to the praise of God, the Maker and Benefactor of those who sing them; they are expressions of gratitude by such. The church has passed through a long and dark valley, a dreary night. It has been beset with many temptations. It is now emerging into the greater light. Beholding the light along the pathway growing brighter, the faithful ones begin the glad songs. Seeing that deliverance draws nigh, and knowing that this blessed condition proceeds from Jehovah through his beloved Son, the anointed King, they break forth with songs of joy to the honor of Jehovah’s name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">August 22 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">(294)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, Christ Jesus.—Heb. 3:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This means that Christ’s body members while on earth are to give attentive heed to the things that Jesus did, and then to go and do likewise. He was anointed by Jehovah as Christ Jesus. He was sent forth by Jehovah to represent him. Thereby he became the Apostle of God, charged with the ministry of his Word. While on the earth he served under the direction and supervision of Jehovah. He devoted his time to testifying to the truth. He magnified the name of Jehovah God, and told the people, those who would hear, of the loving provision which God had made for their salvation. He performed the sacrificial part of his office and provided the ransom sacrifice. He was faithful to him that sent him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The spirit of the Lord God is upon me ... to proclaim . . . the opening of the prison to them that are bound—Isa. 61:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We are now at the end of the age. God’s remnant, otherwise designated as the “servant” class, more and more recognize from the Word that there is in the ecclesiastical systems a “great multitude” of consecrated ones who love the Lord and have faith in Jesus’ blood ; that these are bound in the prison-houses of the religious systems, where they sit in blindness and in darkness. Those who appreciate their anointing and the scope of God’s commission to them realize it to be now their duty and privilege to convey the message of the kingdom and of deliverance to these prisoners, that these bound ones might endure the “great tribulation” coming upon them and thus wear the robe of God’s approval.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">August 24 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">(270)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">fle maketh lightnings for the ram, and bringeth forth the wind out of his treasuries.—J er. 10:13, R. V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Lightning is the discharge of atmospheric electricity, usually accompanied by a vivid flash of light. Lightnings and the accompanying manifestations of power symbolize the operation of God’s power toward his people in particular. All lightnings proceed from Jehovah and are a demonstration of his power. This is proven by Jehovah’s words to Job: “Canst thou send lightnings, that they may go, and say unto thee, Behold us?” Manifestly these words mean that God sends his lightnings and that man has no such power. When there is lightning and thunder there is usually an accompanying downpour of rain. There are no refreshing Tains except those sent by Jehovah God. Likewise there is no blessing of truths that refresh and make glad the heart of God’s people except that which proceeds from Jehovah God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Now all these things happened unto them for ensam-ples: and they are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come.—1 Cor. 10:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Surely God intended his consecrated ones to profit by the lessons exemplified in his dealings with fleshly Israel; hence he had the account thereof written down and preserved. Since Israel suffered complete defeat due to unfaithfulness through failing to be God’s true witnesses, we may know now that the same result must come to all those in the covenant by sacrifice who fail to be witnesses to Jehovah’s name. For Jehovah’s will, his rule, is implied by his course of action in dealing with his covenant people. The rule is therefore fixed that he who covenants to be God’s witness can not with impunity ignore that covenant obligation ; he must either be a witness for the true God or else ally </span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">hims</span><span class="font6">elf either directly or indirectly with the evil one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">August 26 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">( 285)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The stone that smote the image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth.—Dan. 2:35.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Daniel described a stone cut out of the mountain without hands. Manifestly that stone represents God’s anointed King, who was born out of God’s organization. In 1914 the new Nation was born, and God set his anointed King upon his throne. Satan’s ousting from heaven followed. Daniel’s description shows that the stone smites the feet and that then the entire image together at one and the same time is ground to pieces and becomes like the chaff of the summer threshing-floors. Undoubtedly this is a brief description of the battle of Armageddon, in which God through Christ will grind these world powers into a powder and destroy them for ever. Hence the time has come for the complete passing of all world powers, that God’s government of righteousness may be given full sway in the whole earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">I must preach the kingdom of God to other cities also: for therefore am I sent.—Luke 4:43.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">As</span><span class="font6"> far as Jesus’ earthly activities were concerned he came from heaven to act as Jehovah’s witness and to preach God’s message. He faithfully carried out this mission, for of him it is written: “He went throughout every city and village, preaching and shewing the glad tidings of the kingdom of God.” (Luke 8:1) His activities thus were as near those of a modem </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">pioneer colporteur</span><span class="font6"> as book-publishing and people’s reading ability of those days allowed. He kept his mission in mind down to the last, because when cross-examined by Pontius Pilate he said: “To this end was I bom, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth.” Here was Jehovah’s royal heir, preaching God’s righteous government and thus setting an example for all his joint-heirs now on earth to imitate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">August 28 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">(261)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">All the ends of the world shall remember and turn unto the Lord; and all the kindreds of the na^-tions shall worship before thee.—Ps. 22:27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The people must come to a knowledge of the fact that God is love; that is, he is so unselfish, and his desire to bless man was so great, that he gave his beloved Son to die and raised him out of death that man might get life. Men will be brought to know that God has allowed Satan to buffet them that they might experience the baneful effects of evil; and that in his due time God has removed Satan and set up a righteous government for man. Then appreciation of God will begin and increase. As the peoples progress under the Lord’s kingdom their knowledge of the loving-kindness and glory of Jehovah will grow and will impel them to worship him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">He healeth the broken in heart, and bindeth up their wounds.—Ps. 147:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">As</span><span class="font6"> the fiery trials reached a climax in 1918 many of the Lord’s people were very much distressed. It appeared that the enemy would crush out all efforts to give a witness to the Lord’s plan, and hence many of the consecrated were at the point of experiencing a broken heart. But when after the Lord’s coming to his temple Jehovah revealed to them that he was building up his organization and bringing his people into a condition of security, then the sore and brokenhearted ones were healed and their wounds bound up. Those faithful to the covenant by sacrifice were drawn together, became united, and began to see eye to eye concerning Jehovah’s purposes; and their grief came to an end. The knowledge that they have entered into the joy of the Lord now causes them to sing forth the praises of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">August 30 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">(27)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">And thou, 0 tower of the flock, the strong hold of the daughter of Zion, unto thee shall it come, even the first dominion.—Mic. 4:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jesus Christ is the great “strong hold” of the flock of God. He is the “Lion of the tribe of Juda”. He is the “tower of the flock”. He came into possession and control of all things when God placed him upon the throne and sent him forth out of Zion to rule. The members of his body, embraced in the expression “daughter of Zion”, are now brought into his temple and begin to share his kingdom with him, thus beginning their inheritance as his joint-heirs. Jesus is given the dominion of greatest importance, typified by the “former dominion” of David’s royal house. Those of the remnant class who continue faithful until their change into his complete likeness will share fully with him in that glorious dominion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations.—2 Pet. 2:9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">God early made manifest his rule, from which he will never deviate, that those who have faith in him and who walk with him in the way of righteousness and obedience to his command, shall be rewarded by being delivered from the enemy and being given the blessings of life. Enoch lived amid great temptation in the days of Enos when Satan began his scheme of reproaching Jehovah by mockery and religious hypocrisy. Hypocrisy, the fruit of wickedness, is from the Devil, faith is a gift from God and, when exercised, it is pleasing to God. Enoch manifested reverence for God and faith in him, and was delivered. The goodness and mercy of the Lord endureth for ever. His loving-kindness is marked by his every act.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Now therefore be ye not scoffers, lest your bonds be made strong; for a decree of destruction have I heard from the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, upon the whole earth.—Isa. 28:22, A. R. V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah’s exhibition of divine power against the enemy at Armageddon will seem a “strange act’’ to all on earth except those in harmony with him; hence, as the remnant puts forth its utmost effort to give the witness to God’s enemies, many may and will scoff and call them foolish. Many of the scoffers may include those who claim to be God’s children. But the true and faithful children of God will hear and heed and stand firm on Jehovah’s side. Never would it be possible for the anointed ones on earth to bind Satan and overthrow his organization; Jehovah God must and will do that. But the remnant will sing to the Lord’s glory, and will do so joyfully, while Jehovah fulfils his “decree of destruction’’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Blessed is he that watcheth, and keepeth his garments, lest he walk naked, and they seehisshame.-Rev. 16:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah’s law prohibited nakedness amongst those who approached his altar and served in his temple. (Ex. 20: 26; 28:42) In the Laodicean church period he rebukes some for being naked. (Rev. 3:17,18) The members of the temple class must therefore keep on the wedding garments which the Lord has provided by doing his service in his approved way. It is a time of great peril. All must now be on the alert and ever watchful. They must stand firmly on the Lord’s side, taking advantage of every opportunity to serve Jehovah by showing forth his praises. With gladness and joy they will declare his doings amongst the people. Herein lies the safety of God’s remnant today.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">September 3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">(92)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Walk worthily of the calling with which you were called, using diligence to preserve the unity of the spirit by the uniting bond of peace.—Eph. 4:1,3, Diaglott.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">If friction occurs in the Lord's organization, something is out of order. If each one were willing in the interests of unity to sink his own individuality, his good name, fame and reputation, and his high selfrespect, and to exalt the name and cause of Jehovah above everything else, he would joyfully perform the part assigned to him, and all would be kept in the uniting bond of peace. God’s organization is a unity; he himself is not divided, and his work is not divided. In giving counsel, therefore, one who would be a good counselor will not stir up division with a view to his own self-interest, but will look to the interest of God's anointed ones. God commands his service to be done in this day, and manifestly any one opposing service work is not walking in a manner worthy of the anointed's calling and the Lord will duly gather him out of the kingdom class.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God; and he shall go no more out.-Rev. 3:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A pillar suggests a support, a fixity, or that which is permanently placed. The temple is now become God’s fixed and permanent organization, and those who overcome and receive God’s approval are fixed as a part of that organization; they support and uphold that organization by being faithful representatives of it. Thus continuing to do, they “shall go no more out’’. God’s Word identifies such, saying: “In his temple doth every one speak of his glory.” As pillars in his temple, they shall abide there, because “they that trust in the Lord shall be as mount Zion, which cannot be removed, but abideth for ever”. God’s organization is now established, and he will protect it and from henceforth will not permit Zion to suffer injury. Thus preserved, all of the temple class continue to say: “Blessed [praised] be the name of the Lord, from this time forth and for evermore.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">September 5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">(282)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Why dost thou judge thy brother f . . . for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Rom. 14:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Let us remember that the Lord’s servant is not accountable to man, but is accountable to his own Master. If we see our brother in Christ serving the Lord and having the Lord’s manifest blessing, then let us bear in mind that it is not our prerogative to judge our brother. The Lord has assured us that those faithful to Jehovah will be the targets for the darts of the enemy. The fact that a Christian patiently continues to serve God and to receive God’s favor is the best evidence that the charges against him are false and are laid against him by the adversary. Who may properly lay anything to the charge of God’s elect? “It is God that justifieth.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The glory which thou gavest me I have given them; that they may be one, even as weareone.-Johnl7:22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jesus had committed to his faithful followers a work to do relating to the preparation for the new government of righteousness, which work was a glorious privilege and for Jehovah’s glory. God had anointed Jesus to be the world’s invisible Ruler, and Jesus’ words indicate that he desired his faithful disciples to be associated with him in that rulership. The 'oneness’ that Jesus mentioned means that Jehovah God is the great “King of eternity”, that Jesus Christ is the King to rule in Jehovah’s name, and that those who would be made one with him and his Father would have some part in that government of righteousness and thus be one with God and with Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">September 7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">(331)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Gather yourselves unto me—ye my men of loving-kindness, who have solemnised my covenant over sacrifice.—Ps. 50:5, Rotherham.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This gathering began after the Lord’s coming to his temple in 1918. These saints are God’s “men of lovingkindness ” because, being devoted to him, they are objects of his loving-kindness. They have something to do with assembling themselves together. They gather themselves out from those constituting the “great multitude” and from “the wicked” or evil servant class, and gather themselves unto Zion, God’s organization. God does not arbitrarily bring them into the place of special favor. The called ones must meet his requirements for them and hence must be “workers together with God”. Appreciating their covenant with the Lord by sacrifice, they are willing volunteers, joyfully offering themselves to the Lord for his service.—Ps. 110: 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">September 8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">(81)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Let the unjust one act unjustly still. For he who acts unjustly will receive back for the injustice he committed ; and without any partiality.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Rev. 22:11; Col. 3:25, Diaglott.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The word above rendered “unjust one” means a wrong-doer, an offender against right, or one who has become wicked and who is therefore the very opposite of righteous. None could be of that class unless at one time he had been made righteous through the blood of Jesus. Later he offends and becomes offended and walks in iniquity. Jesus told of such a class of persons who had been accepted in the Lord and were in line for a place in the kingdom, but who at the end of the period of sacrifice are gathered out of the kingdom class. He also described a “wicked servant” class who smite their fellow servants and who are assigned to the place occupied by the hypocrites. On coming to his temple Christ Jesus takes account with his servants, and finding such unfaithful and unprofitable ones he disapproves them and casts them into outer darkness. His judgment is impartial and final.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">September 9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">(295)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">There is no power but of God.—Rom. 13:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah God is supreme. From him proceeds all rightful authority. He is the great spirit Being, not visible to human eyes. The supreme power of control of earth will therefore always be invisible to man. While the Lord God is above all, and in him dwell all rightful power and authority, yet from time to time he delegates powet and authority to his creatures. Sueh delegated power, to be properly used and exercised for the glory of God and for the good of the user and all others concerned, must be exercised in harmony with the will of Jehovah God. He is “the head of Christ”, the new creation, and is therefore the One who has “set the members every one of them in the body, as it hath pleased him”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">In an acceptable time have I heard thee, and</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> tn </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">a day of salvation have I helped thee.—Isa. 49: 8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Paul quotes this prophetic utterance and applies it to the church. (2 Cor. 6:2) This is proof that the body members of Christ are a part of The Servant and they, together with Christ Jesus the Head, are given &quot;for a covenant of the people, to establish the earth”. It also proves that the body members will participate with the Head Jesus in the administration of the new covenant. The apostle also shows that the prophecy has an application to the body members during the time of the selection and development of the church. In that time they are members of The Servant and are ambassadors for Christ to preach the message of reconciliation. Therefore they should see to it that they “receive not the grace of God [this great favor from God] in vain”, says the apostle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">September 11 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">(24)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">It is a good thing to give thanks unto the Lord, and to sing praises unto thy name, 0 Most High.-Ps. 92:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">These words are part of a psalm written expressly for the sabbath day; they therefore show Jehovah’s approval of publicly proclaiming his praises on the day which his professed people have set aside for the worship of God. But any day &quot;it is good to sing praises unto our God”. Those who sing unto other gods can not say such a thing, because &quot;good” means that which is of lasting benefit and good things proceed only from Jehovah, the Most High. &quot;For it is pleasant; and praise is comely.” (Ps. 147:1) This means that the singers have much cause, not only to be happy, but also to be joyful in the Lord; and to them it is delightfully sweet to sing. Appreciating the favor of God and that it is fitting, beautiful and beneficial to sing praise to Jehovah, they give thanks and are not able to keep back songs of praise to his name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Keep that which is committed to thy trust, avoiding profane and vain babblings, and oppositions of science falsely so called.—1 Tim. 6:20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">God has committed his truth to the trust of his righteous, faithful ones. He reveals his truth in a progressive way like “the light of dawn’’. By following its progression the trustful Christian walks in the light. He is admonished to be ever ready to give a reason for his hope. That reason must be based upon God’s Word, and not upon science and philosophy so called. God’s children must walk by faith, and faith results from hearing and understanding God’s Word and then confidently relying on that Word. There is no room left to quibble about whence the truth must come. Jesus said, “Thy word is truth,” and that by that truth the consecrated ones must be sanctified.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">September 13 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">(98)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Behold, a whirlwind came out of the north. . . . Also out of the midst thereof came the likeness of four living creatures.—Ezek. 1:4,5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The whirlwind which Ezekiel saw in vision pictures the divine indignation expressed against Satan’s organization. The four living creatures which emerged from the symbols of destruction seem clearly to picture the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">living</span><span class="font6"> factors of God’s complete organization. The four wheels seen correspond to the ancient fourwheeled chariot. High above the four wheels and the cherubim’s heads was a firmament, and above it was the likeness of a throne on which a glorious person sat. Taken together, the living creatures and the inanimate instruments give the appearance of an enormous living chariot-like organization; it pictures Jehovah’s mighty organization moving into action just prior to the great battle of Armageddon, and upon which God rides and over which he presides. God’s “remnant” is a part of this divine organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">And the Spirit and the bride say, Come. . . . </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">And let </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">him that is athirst come. And . . . take the water of life freely.—Rev. 22:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">&quot;God is a spirit.” &quot;With [him] is the fountain of life.” He has now commanded a great witness to be given that he is God and Christ Jesus is his anointed King. To his invitation, &quot;Whom shall I send, and who will go for us?” the remnant joyfully respond. But within the confines of organized Christianity is a &quot;great multitude” of prisoners who thirst for the truth because there is no divine truth within their prison walls. By radio and by calling at the prisoners’ doors, the remnant of the bride class bear to them God’s gracious message. They hear and come and their thirst is quenched and they are made glad. They in turn tell their neighbors to come if they will and drink of the water of divine truth and take their stand on the side of Jehovah God. Such a course leads to everlasting life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">September 15 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">(187)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Lord shall judge his people. It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.-Heb. 10:30,31.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The faithful have nothing to do whatsoever with the judgment and punishment of the wicked. That belongs to God, who does it through his great Priest who is now in his temple. But the faithful see the judgments of the Lord and rejoice because they are right. &quot;Only with thine eyes shalt thou behold, and see the reward of the wicked.” The course of those described by the apostle is wicked because they repudiate the Lord and the redemptive blood whereby man is purchased and do despite to the light that came to them by the truth and through the holy spirit. However, those in “the secret place” can have and do have a vision or understanding of these things, and they have nothing more. Their safety is made certain because they abide in Christ Jesus their Advocate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies.—Ps. 23:5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The enemy organization now makes war against the remnant of the seed of the woman Zion. The anointed must now learn and take heed that to understand and appreciate the unfolding of the truth one must walk in meekness and humility before God. He must recognize that the truth is the Lord’s and not man's, and that God is not pleased with those who attempt to exalt themselves or to give glory to the name of men. Long centuries ago God prepared some precious things to be revealed “in that day’’ to those who love him. We are now in that day, and therefore his anointed recognize that day and rejoice in it. Those who love God and who prove it by their works will eat at his table and will now rejoice in the great privilege of cooperating in the work he is doing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">September 17 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">(41)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">All that has been begotten by God overcomes the world; and this is that victory which overcomes the world,—our faith.—1 John 5:4, Diaglott.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is not an easy matter to overcome the world. A child “begotten by God’’ must take a firm stand for the Lord and refuse to be influenced to compromise the Lord’s Word and his cause with the world. To resist Satan and the influence of his emissaries requires a course of vigilance and constant fighting. In so doing the Christian suffers much tribulation. The fact stands that Jesus had to overcome the world and did so; and it follows that all who will share the government with him must likewise overcome. Only those who have faith, constancy, fidelity, and continue faithful unto God can overcome the world. They will be bom in Zion, God’s official royal family.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Let the saints be joyful in glory: let them sing aloud upon their beds.—Ps. 149:5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Lord has been glorified as King, and this honor attaches to the remnant of God’s saints on earth because they are ambassadors of the new King; and therefore they are now in glory. In view of the fact that the kingdom was set up in 1914 they “sing unto the Lord a new song’’. They sing upon their beds instead of going to sleep, as some have done. They are active in showing forth the praises of Jehovah day and night, and will continue until earthly sleep overtakes them. This harmonizes with the words of the prophet (Isa. 62:6,7), wherein the Lord says that the watchmen of his organization, Jerusalem, shall not be silent day nor night but shall continue to make mention of Jehovah’s name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">September 19 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">(196)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Blessed are they that do his commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city.—Rev. 22:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">One’s being brought into God’s temple and “under the shadow of the </span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">Almi</span><span class="font6">ghty ” is no guarantee that he shall continue there. To remain there he must prove faithful by keeping God’s commands. The specific command given to God’s “faithful and wise servant’’ class is to preach “this gospel of the kingdom’’ as a witness, and to this class also Jehovah plainly says: “Ye are my witnesses, that I am God.’’ To continue in the Lord's favor and to enter finally into the kingdom and receive the right to the tree of life, they must keep on fulfilling God’s commandments and thus prove their love for him. Blessed are they if they so do and thereby meet the test placed upon God’s temple class. It is to such overcomera that the privilege is to be given “to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the paradise of God”.—Rev. 2:7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Let them bring forth their witnesses, that they may be justified: ... Ye are my witnesses, saith</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">the Lord.—Isa. 43:9,10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah has been long-suffering with his enemies. Now the time approaches for the great issue to be for ever settled. Jehovah himself will settle the controversy and settle it righteously. The Devil and all his henchmen shall be judged, and all slanderers and liars against God and his people shall be put to shame. Jehovah now flings his challenge to the enemy, demanding them to bring forth their testimony to prove their claims or else to admit their defeat. At the same time he says to those of his “servant” class: “Ye are my witnesses, that I am God.” In this crisis, therefore, God has a few who must take an unequivocal and uncompromising stand on his side and offer testimony to his name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">September 21 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">(58)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">ye go, preach, saying, The kingdom of heaven is at hand.—Matt. 10:7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Opportunities to give the witness from the public platform and over the radio should properly be utilized ■ but to preach does not mean to don an ecclesiastical gown, mount a pulpit and lecture to an audience assembled in an auditorium. When dispatching the twelve apostles and also the seventy auxiliaries Jesus did not prearrange public speaking appointments for them, or see that public halls were hired or engaged in advance for them. This suggests that actual and effective preaching of the kingdom means to take the message to the people’s homes rather than to advertise oneself and have the people assemble in a hall and hear a prolonged discourse. Paul did most of his preaching in this direct way to the people, teaching “from house to house” as well as publicly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Who being the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person, . . . sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high.—Heb. 1:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Being the “express image” of Jehovah God and acting in complete harmony with him, in Jesus therefore is found the complete expression of justice, wisdom, power and love. Such is a guarantee that, as majestic Ruler over all the peoples, all his power and authority shall be exercised unselfishly for the people’s benefit. His leadership and rule over mankind will be in exact accord with Jehovah’s will, for it is written: ‘The anointed King’s heart is in the hand of the Lord Jehovah, as the rivers of water; Jehovah tumeth the King’s heart whithersoever he will.’— Prov. 21:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">September 23 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(57)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Write, Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth: ~Sea, saith the Spirit, . . . their</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">works do follow them.—Rev. 14:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Truly from this time forward the above words may be properly said. Surely this is the most blessed time that the church in the flesh has had. The anointed members thereof enjoy the unspeakable privilege of being workers together with God and his Christ. Through Christ Jehovah is causing notice to be served of his purpose to destroy Satan’s organization and to grant full relief to the oppressed of humankind. The Most High, speaking through his beloved Son, says, “Come.” The faithful remnant class join in the gracious invitation and say, “Come.” Thus the message is being proclaimed to those who have a desire for righteousness and truth. It must now be proclaimed; and the remnant class, serving Jehovah in his temple, see that it is their blessed privilege now to represent him and to lay down their lives in his sendee. Abiding in his service and in his secret place till death, they shall have an immediate entrance into the heavenly kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth anything, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Gal. 6:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The new creature is made of willing earthly material in the hands of Jehovah God; that is to say, the exercise of the man’s will power leads him to completely and fully surrender himself to do God’s wilL Thereafter his mind is transformed as God's spirit operates upon it. During this transformation process the human org</span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">anism</span><span class="font6"> in which the new creature functions is counted righteous by Jehovah through the blood of Jesus presented in heaven in the new creation’s behalf. Circumcision, uneircumcision, or one’s general physical condition, or the kind of elothes one wears, counts for nothing; but the body of the new creature must be used to God's glory and will be so used in proportion to the measure of the Lord’s spirit possessed by the creature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">September 25 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">(257)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">It shall be said in that day, Lo, this is our God; . . . we have waited for him, we will be glad and rejoice in his salvation.—Isa. 25:9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">With the power of the enemy broken at Armageddon, the shackles will fall away from the billions of earth’s oppressed, and they will go free and have an opportunity to hear and obey the true God. They will then become aware of the truth that Jehovah is God and that his righteous government, with Christ upon the throne, is that for which they have so long waited. The anointed of God on earth see by faith these blessed things which must shortly occur. They know it is their God and Father who will accomplish this grand work. They see the stigma for ever removed from his holy name, and their hearts respond with gladness and in song unto him. They ean not keep back their songs of praise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the holy spirit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Rom. 14:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The coming of God’s kingdom in 1914 has not brought material or earthly enrichment to his saints; but it has surely brought to them the spiritual bounties above named, and that as never before. The robe of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">righteousness</span><span class="font6"> enwraps in its royal folds all God’s approved ones. Having on the garments of salvation and dwelling under the Almighty’s shadow imparts to them </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">peace</span><span class="font6"> and freedom from fear of man and devils. As members of the “servant” class carrying out the Elisha picture they have received what corre-ponds to a “double portion” of Elijah’s </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">spirit</span><span class="font6">; and the honor and privilege of being God’s witnesses for the vindication of his name fills them with the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">joy</span><span class="font6"> of the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">September 27 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">(68)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Ask ye of Jehovah rain in the time of the latter rain, even of Jehovah that maketh lightnings; and he shall give them showers of rain.—Zech. 10:1, A. R. V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The faithful until 1918 continued to hurl the hard-cutting truth against the bulwarks of the enemy. In that year Satan, through his agents, retarded the witness work. Did the revelation of truth stop there f Have God’s lightnings no more flashed since then! True, that was a time of discouragement, but the faithful waited upon the Lord and prayed to him for refreshment like “the latter rain”. The Lord heard the cry of his people and granted unto them their hearts’ desire, giving them greater light. God alone who makes lightnings is responsible for the rain which symbolizes his truth. Thus Jehovah rewardeth the prayers of his faithful ones, and none others obtain and hold the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Arise, and thresh, 0 daughter of Zion :f or I will make thine horn iron, and I will make thy hoofs brass; and thou shalt beat in pieces many people.—Mic. 4:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah did not leave his people without instruments with which to thresh the enemy. He has brought into action the radio, by which means the message can reach the &quot;prisoners” in the Babylonish systems as well as the ears of the clergy who sit behind closed doors. By proclamations and resolutions and by the publishing and wide distribution of booklets and books many of the enemy’s organization have suffered punishment. God has caused his message to be put in such form that it can be used with direct effect. He has furnished his people with iron horns to push against the enemy; he has shod them with brass hoofs; for the message, although one of peace and good will, has also served to beat in pieces the influence of ecclesiasticism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">September 29 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">(231)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Who covereth the heaven with clouds, who prepareth rain for the earth, who maketh grass to grow upon the mountains.—Ps. 147: 8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">God literally does the above things. However, this scripture seems to have a symbolical meaning and fulfilment as well. Figuratively, clouds represent the presence of Jehovah and his Christ, in this, that both God and Christ Jesus are now giving special consideration to the anointed ones on earth and are also shaping earth’s affairs for the final overthrow of the evil world. As rain refreshes the earth, causing it to rejoice, so rain symbolizes the downpour of truth which Jehovah now showers upon those faithfully serving him. This message of truth being carried to the people enables them to see that there is hope for everlasting life on earth for them, and on this message of hope they feed, this, then, is symbolized particularly by the growing of grass upon the mountains and the flocks and herds feeding thereon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">And fire crime doivn from God out of heaven, and devoured them. And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone.—Rev. 20:9,10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Manifestly for the purpose of permitting restored mankind to be tested and of demonstrating the ultimate reward of the perversely wicked, God releases Satan from the abyss for a little season. The issue is then put squarely to every one: Whom will you choose to obey, Jehovah or Satan 1 Some whose hearts have not been wholly devoted to the Lord will ally themselves with the Devil. God permits them to have their choice. Thus they prove their disloyalty. Then manifesting his power from heaven, Jehovah by a flame of fire annihilates all who prefer to side with Satan and destroys Satan also in the second death. In the execution of this judgment, Christ Jesus, Jehovah’s High Priest, is the executor.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark307"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">October 1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">(13)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Christ cometh of the seed of David, and out of the town of Bethlehem, where David was.—John 7:42.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">David, whose name means “beloved”, was a type, foreshadowing Jesus, the beloved Son of Jehovah. David was born at Bethlehem. Jesus was born at the same city. Bethlehem means “the house of bread”. Jesus said concerning himself: “I am the bread of life that came down from heaven.” Upon that bread all must feed who will get life. David brought the people of Israel up to a state of prosperity. He not only had the desire to feed the people, but he possessed the ability, and did so. (2 Sam. 6:19) Jesus Christ is now clothed with all power and authority, is wholly devoted to his Father, and is carrying out his Father’s purposes to bring all obedient ones of mankind into a state of prosperity. David was the hope of Israel. Jesus became the hope of Israel according to the spirit, and through his “house” he is the hope of all the nations of earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">My lips shall greatly rejoice when I sing unto thee; and my soul, which thou hast redeemed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Ps. 71:23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Those who rejoice in the joy of the Lord are wholly and completely on his side. He is their God, and their lips sing unto him and to none other. They refuse to sing any song that would pleasingly entertain the enemy or any part of Babylon’s organization. An example of this was set by the Jews when captive in Babylon. Asking the Israelites to sing a song of Zion, the Babylonians said in effect to them: ‘Forget your past; come and be one of us and let us be at peace. Sing your songs for us. ’ But the Israelites preferred to be smitten with muteness and paralyzed in hand rather than compromise with the enemy organization. So today, God’s faithful remnant know no such thing as compromise with the enemy, but on all occasions they sing and bear witness to Jehovah’s holy name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">October 3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">(315)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make straight in the desert a highway for our God.—Isa. 40:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In his due time the great loving God sent Jesus, his only Son, and by and through his sacrificial death opened the way that leads to immortality. That is a 'narrow way’, because it is a way by sacrifice. The sacrificing is about done, and within a short time that narrow way will for ever close. The closing of the narrow way means, however, the opening of a wonderful way for the return of man to reconciliation with God, which way may be termed the King’s highway. It is that wonderfid way provided for the benefit of man. Long centuries ago the great Jehovah God made provision for that highroad, and therefore its rightful name, The King’s Highway. Amid the desertlike condition of the world today God’s remnant are now pointing the neople to that road.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might be rich.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—2 Cor. 8:9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Because of sin the human race was plunged into the greatest depths of poverty, with no right or hope of ever enjoying the riches of life. Jesus the beloved Son of God enjoyed all the riches of life in glory with his Father in heaven. He looked down upon the poverty of humankind, well knowing that the wicked rebellion of Lucifer had brought such destructive poverty on man. He knew of God’s loving heart and of his purpose to reconcile man to himself. Jesus was willing to become poor that mankind might be made rich in life and happiness and brought into full reconciliation with God. Knowing this grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, we should declare it abroad to Jehovah’s praise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">October 5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">(306)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Seal not [make no secret of—20th Cent. N.</span><span class="font6"> T.] </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">the sayings of the prophecy of this book: for the time is at hand.—Rev. 22:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Now is the due time for the people to see and understand the truth; and particularly to see that all the warfare amongst themselves, the conflicts between religious systems, and the crimes and wickedness that stalk about in the earth, all these unrighteous things originated in Satan, “the prince of the power of the air,’’ who has used the clergy and other agencies to turn the people’s minds away from God. The time is here for the people to see that Jehovah is their friend and benefactor. The truth must be set forth as against the evil one and his wicked course, that men may know that Jehovah is God and his beloved Son Jesus is now on the throne as earth’s rightful Buler.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">W/tere/ore </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses, . . . let us run with patience the race that is set before us.—Heb. 12:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">These witnesses, although faithful unto death, can not be members of God’s government, because they all died before the presentation of the value of Jesus' perfect sacrifice as a sin-offering in heaven. But all these heroes of faith believed that in due time Jehovah would set up a righteous government. Having such faith some of them even left their own fatherland and went into a foreign land to be witnesses for Jehovah, doing this voluntarily. Seeing that God has made present to our attention the record of these faithful witnesses of God, we, who are called to official positions in the righteous government they foresaw, should be stimulated to press on in constancy, looking unto our King.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">October 7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">(59)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">We are not under the law, but under grace.—Rom. 6:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">A</span><span class="font6"> clear distinction must be made between the law of God and his law covenant which he made with Israel and which is referred to in the above text. The law of God is his expressed will. It is the rule of action which he provides and which commands obedience to that which is right and punishment for that which is wrong. Abraham kept God’s law, namely, his expressed will, as far as God revealed it, but he was not under the law covenant; neither was Isaac his son under it. God’s promise to Abraham, which was confirmed to Isaac and to Jacob, was of God’s grace and was not dependent upon any works of the law covenant. Since Isaac was not under the law covenant, he pictured The Christ which also is not under the law covenant but which is led by God’s spirit in its obedience to Jehovah’s will.—Gal. 5:18,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Out with the dogs, and sorcerers, and whoremongers, and murderers, and idolaters, and whosoever loveth and mdketh a lie!—Rev. 22:15, Var. Bible, margin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There are a great number of persons outside of Jehovah ’s organization, Zion, and who onee entered into a covenant with the Lord by sacrifice but who finally use the name of the Lord for selfish reasons. Such are classed as “dogs”, that is, “dumb dogs,” “greedy dogs, which can never have enough”; “they all look to their own way, every one for his gain” (Isa. 56: 10, 11) ; “sorcerers,” or those who mix false doctrines with the truth in order to deceive; “whoremongers,” or those who, in the name of Christ, run after and indulge in illicit union with Satan’s organization; ‘ ‘murderers” guilty of hating and persecuting true followers of Jesus; “idolaters,” or those who worship either human systems or men or covetousness or other objects claiming the Lord’s name; and framers and lovers of lies against God. Such make up the Devil’s organization on earth. To such the Lord, now in his temple, says: “Begone, . . . every one of you.”— </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Moffatt’s translation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">October 9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(42)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Lord alone shall be exalted in that day.—Isa. 2:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“That day” is the Lord’s day, the beginning of which is marked by Jehovah’s placing his anointed One upon his throne in Zion and directing him to go forth and rule amongst his enemies. “In that day” Jehovah has duties to be performed by every one of his faithful saints. “In that day” every one of the temple class must speak of the glory of Jehovah. No creature is to be exalted in that day; no matter how prominent a person has been in the church, he is not to be exalted or praised, because Jehovah alone is to be exalted. Hence “in that day” the faithful ones hear and delight to obey the commandments of God, among whieh is this: “In that day shall ye say, Praise the Lord,... make mention that his name is exalted. ” </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them.—Eph. 2:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Serving the Lord does not mean to meditate idly upon getting away from the earth and going to a place of rest. Service means work. Jehovah God is the great Master Workman. The new creation is “his work, having been formed in Christ Jesus for good works, for which God before prepared us, that we might walk in them”. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">(Diaglott)</span><span class="font6"> Such are engaged in a good work and must be perfected while faithfully continuing therein. Jehovah’s commission to them requires that they show forth his praises by now declaring that he is God and that the day is at hand when he will vindicate his holy name. Those of the new creation, who trust implicitly in the Lord, will do this work; they will take real delight in it.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">For I spake not . . . concerning burnt offerings or sacrifices: but this thing commanded I them, saying, Obey my voice, and I will be your God.-Jer. 7:22,23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Sacrifice is simply an outward confession of inward devotion to God. It is not the sacrifice itself that is pleasing unto him. Sacrifice unaccompanied by obedience and a true and sincere devotion to the Lord, is a mockery. He who keeps the Lord’s commandments with a joyful heart, not complaining about such as being a burden, is the one that is pleasing to God. So it is not sufficient that we enter the covenant with the Lord by sacrifice. We must thereafter obey and prove our faithfulness by serving God and we must be found faithful upon his examination of us. We must perform our “reasonable service” toward him, being always prompted to obedience by love.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Do not I hate them, 0 Lord, that hate theet ... I count them mine enemies.—Ps. 139:21,22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Some claiming consecration to the Lord reproach their brethren for speaking in strong terms against the hypocritical clergy. God’s Word makes it clear that such clergy are the children of the Devil, God’s enemy. Hence the clergy are God’s enemies, because they bring reproach upon his name. God’s enemies must be made the enemies of his children. The true child of God regards his Father’s enemy as his own enemy; being wholly on the Lord’s side he hates iniquity and the workers thereof and those that rise up against God. Any reproach upon our Father’s name is a dart of poison against us. Wherefore we could not consistently sing the praises of our God and at the same time show, even passively, favor or honor to God’s enemy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">October 13 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">(296)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Ye shall receive power, after that the holy spirit is come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto me . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">unto the uttermost part of the earth.</span><span class="font6">—Acts </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">1:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In order that the work of Jehovah, in these latter days of trouble and darkness upon the world, may be done, God has given his people a special measure of his holy spirit both of desire and zeal and of power. It is as a fire which consumes the bones: a zeal for the Lord which provides the fire to consume the sacrifice. (Jer. 20: 9) The spirit of the Lord gives boldness in the witness against Satan’s organization. Jehovah is calling upon his people, whom he has raised up for the honor of his name, to witness for him and against the enemy and his organization. To do this his people must set their faces as adamant, for only the love of God will enable them to withstand the attacks the enemy makes upon them</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken: but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.—Matt. 21:44.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When Jesus was presented as King at his coming to the temple he became a “stone of stumbling” to many, including so-called organized Christianity as a whole and many who claimed to be fully consecrated and devoted to the Lord. Some of these stumbled at this Stone and fell; upon other resisting ones the Stone fell and ground them as it were to powder. It is this Stone, to wit, God's anointed King, that smites Satan's organization, dashes it to pieces, and sets up God's government of righteousness amongst men. Those who make the Lord their sanctuary stand the test and welcome and hail the Stone, the King, “with shoutings, crying, Grace, grace unto it.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">October 15 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font6">(16)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne.—Rev. 3:21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jesus overcame the world, and his associates must now do likewise. Overcoming can be done only by an unselfish devotion of oneself unto God and his King and by joyfully bearing the reproaches which the enemy casts upon him because of his faithfulness to Jehovah, and by completely cleansing one’s hands of everything that pertains to the Devil's organization. To those who thus overcome Satan’s organization and its subtle and sinister influence belongs the above promise. The greatest privilege ever granted to creatures comes in this period of time. Jehovah has placed his Son as King upon the throne, and it is the faithful ones who overcome that will be permitted to occupy the throne with that victorious One in the kingdom which will bestow blessings upon all families of earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Praise thy God, 0 Zion. For he hath strengthened the bars of thy gates; he hath blessed thy children within thee.—Ps. 147:12,13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Zion’s children, which includes those who are keeping the covenant by sacrifice and who have been brought into “the secret place of the Most High”, now see their vantage point and thus see great cause for rejoicing and praising their God. They are within Zion, which is Jehovah’s organization, and are protected by what is represented by the gates and bars which stand between them and the enemy and which have been strengthened now that Satan, cast out of heaven, makes war upon God’s remnant. God keeps his hand over them while they are in full view of the foe. So long as any one is of Zion, and therefore of the temple class, he is on the safe side of the gates and bars which shield him from the darts of the evil one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">October 17 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">(138)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God hath shined.—Ps. 50:2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Being Jehovah’s organization and his workmanship, Zion is “the perfection of beauty”. Since Zion is God’s official family or organization, Jehovah’s shining out of Zion must take place when that organization is functioning to the glory of God. “When the Lord shall build up Zion, he shall appear in his glory.” The building of Zion was from and after 1914, when Jehovah placed Jesus, the Head or chief one of Zion, upon the throne on his holy hill of Zion. God’s shining would necessarily mean the shedding of greater light upon his Word for the benefit of his organization; hence those of Zion now have increased light. The light proceeds from Jehovah and shines to his people by and through his beloved Son, the Head of Zion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">the days of Noe were, so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.—Matt. 24:37.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The flood of Noah’s time was typical of a far greater trouble shortly to come upon this world, by which Jehovah will destroy it and will teach all his intelligent creatures that in him resides all power, which operates in precise harmony with wisdom, justice and love, and that the oppressed human race will find complete deliverance only through the mighty plan which he has provided for the eternal blessing of his obedient creatures. In Noah's day only a few were witnesses for God. Now only those who truly love and serve Jehovah God with pure hearts are really on his side. It is to the faithful remnant that Jehovah now says: “Ye are my witnesses, that I am God.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">October 19 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">(208)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">And the Spirit and the bride say, Come. . . . And whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Rev. 22:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Millions of people of good will throughout the land are in distress, longing to see a better day but not knowing which way to turn for relief. To them the world is as a parched desert where there is neither food nor water. The remnant bring to them the glad message of today, telling them that they may now take their stand against Satan and for Jehovah and receive God’s blessing. Such a class of people, now seeking meekness and righteousness, may be hid in the day of Jehovah’s expressed wrath, be carried beyond the battle of Armageddon, and live for ever and not die. Those who would finally be part of Christ’s bride must notify the people that soon the great highway to life will be opened. This must be done in order that all who will may take the water of life freely by siding with the Lord and responding to the requirements of God’s kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son.—Rom. 8:29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">God foreknew the new creation, and predetermined that the members of it must be like the Head thereof. To be conformed to his image does not mean to be like him in the style of one’s hair or clothing or the tone of voice or the carriage of the body. Jesus was supremely devoted to his Father’s cause, and each member of the new creation must, like him, be absolutely devoted to Jehovah and his cause. Each Christian knows that he can not act, speak, or even think perfectly; but he does know that he can be completely dedicated to God and refuse to be on any terms with the Devil. In this respect his likeness is that of Jesus, and this is the likeness that was predestinated and is now required.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">October 21 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">(285)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Therefore I will shake the heavens, and the earth shall remove out of her place, in the wrath of the Lord of hosts, and in the day of his fierce anger.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Isa. 13:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Already Jehovah has shaken the heavens and ousted Satan, the false god, therefrom. His forces are gathering for the great and final shaking of the earth. When he thus exercises his irresistible power, nothing shall stand before him, for no god is like unto him. The Scriptures show that some will take the side of Jehovah amidst great opposition while Satan the mimic god assembles his own unto </span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">hims</span><span class="font6">elf for the final decision. Already the company of God’s anointed has made its decision; publicly and in convention assembled it has thrown down the gauntlet to the Devil and to his adherents by declaring against Satan and for Jehovah. It is a declaration of war from which God’s anointed remnant will not retreat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">And the very God of peace sanctify you- Wholly. —1 Thess. 5:23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah is holy, because all his ways are right. Christ Jesus is holy, because of being always in harmony with Jehovah in doing his will. The members of Christ's body must be made holy, or sanctified, like unto their Head. They must be wholly devoted to God, and Jehovah supplies all their needs to that end. Being adopted into the Lord’s royal family, they are set aside for Jehovah’s service. Now they must be wholly dedicated to God. In the new creation, The Christ, Jehovah will have a nation and people unalloyed in their devotion to him and who will refuse to sympathize with even any part of the Devil's system. The end of their sanctification will be their crowning as kings with Christ Jesus in his throne.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">October 23 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">(86)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Lo, a great multitude . . . stood before the throne, and before the Lamb, . . . and cried with aloud voice, saying, Salvation to our God which sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb.—Rev. 7:9,10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The “great multitude” of Christians, as they feed upon God’s Word and grow stronger and learn that “the harvest is past” and that they can not be of the kingdom class, will take a determined stand on the Lord’s side, though to do so means to pull down Satan’s structure on their own heads. But they will resolve to die as witnesses for the Lord. In the very final and crucial test they prove their faith in God and suffer martyrdom. They die in the great time of tribulation. Raised to heavenly life, they will ascribe their salvation unto Jehovah God and unto the Lamb of God. Let every child of God who is really devoted to him and his cause proceed in this crucial time to carry the message of deliverance to those now held in “prison-houses”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Yea, he ladeth the thick cloud with moisture; he spreadeth abroad the cloud of his lightning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Job 37:11, R. V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The &quot;cloud” in this text does not represent trouble, but the presence of Jehovah. This text shows that God illuminates the cloud with his lightnings, thereby meaning that his presence is accompanied with light to those who seek to know him. Lightning brightens and reveals that which was previously in the dark or obscured. Symbolically, God’s lightnings illuini-nate his Word for those who wait upon him, and reveal and expose that which is opposed to God and his organization. Therefore it will be observed that the text tells of God’s lightnings flashing at a time when Jehovah manifests his presence to his people, giving them greater light upon his Word, revealing his purposes toward them, and also exposing their enemies. Jehovah is the source of the lightnings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">October 25 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">(326)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Behold, the judge standeth before the door.—Jas 5:9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Lord is not standing and knocking at the door of each individual. This warning has reference to his coming to his temple, that is to say, to his own house. He knocks to see if his servants are awake and diligent. He comes to judge his own house and to take account with his servants. Some servants he finds watching; they quickly respond to his knock. Others are indifferent. Those who are so blind that they can not see that the Lord has come to his temple are also so deaf that they can not hear his knock. They can not enter into his service unless they are aroused and get their eyes open. It seems certain that the Lord uses those who are awake and zealous to call the attention of the others to their privileges today.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">I have made a covenant with my chosen, I have sworn unto David my Servant.—Ps. 89:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The everlasting covenant between Jehovah and hia chosen One is that Jesus should have life, immortality, a throne, a crown and a government. David being a type of God’s beloved One, this covenant could not be applicable to Jesus until at his anointing at Jordan he became &quot;the seed of David”, within the Scriptural meaning. Thenceforth all the prophecies of the everlasting covenant enured to Christ Jesus. At Jesus* resurrection that covenant was confirmed to him. He is the One in whom this great covenant is fulfilled; and in his unselfishness toward his faithful followers he covenants and agrees to take them into the kingdom with him. Devotion and obedience unto death is required of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">October 27 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">(163)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">For the time is at hand. . . . He which is filthy, let him be filthy still.—Rev. 22:10,11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is well known that there are those who were in the Lord’s service, but who have neglected their obligations, repudiated the Lord and his truth, and returned &quot;to the weak and beggarly elements [rudiments]” of the world and joined Satan’s organization. At the time when they came to the Lord they left the Devil’s system and were then transferred from darkness into the kingdom of light. But later through selfishness their understanding became darkened and they turned themselves to lasciviousness and uncleanness, like &quot;the sow that was washed to her wallowing in the mire”. Jude describes the same class, who &quot;what they know naturally, as brute beasts, in those things they corrupt themselves”. It is at the time of coming to his temple for judgment, when his reward is with him &quot;to give every man according as his work shall be”, that the Lord expresses the above judicial decree against such as have repudiated him and have become filthy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Thy testimonies are wonderful: therefore doth my soul keep them.</span><span class="font6">—Ps. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">119:129.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Lord has placed his testimonies in the hands of his anointed ones. That is a privilege conferred which can not be overstressed. Satan has erected monuments as a testimony to the deeds of merit performed by his servants, but these monuments shall perish for ever. The Lord’s testimonies are righteous and founded for ever. (Ps. 119:144,152) They are the most wonderful of all, and blessed is he who has them and keeps them and who has part in declaring them. Those who are approved as faithful witnesses will be received by Jehovah. They will stand in his temple for ever as pillars or monuments of testimony unto him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">October 29 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">(256)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Him that called us by his own glory and virtue. Tea, and for this very cause adding on your part all diligence, in your faith supply virtue-2 Pet. 1:3,5, R. V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The one who is called of God must </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">do</span><span class="font6"> something more than merely have faith. He must use diligence in furnishing, in supplying the things the apostle mentions, the first thing mentioned being virtue. The word here translated “virtue” means manliness in Christ Jesus, valor or fortitude. The Christian, having engaged to become Jesus’ follower, takes his stand on God's side; and there he must stand firmly, with valor fighting for the cause of righteousness and refusing to compromise in any manner with Satan or any part of his organization. There must be no wavering now; having taken his position on Jehovah’s side, he should remain stedfast unto the end. He </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">must</span><span class="font6"> do this thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Lord God is my strength, . . . and he will make me to walk upon mine high places.—Hab. 3:19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">To have a part in joyfully proclaiming the kingdom, tidings as Jehovah’s representative means to engage in the greatest campaign ever held under the sun. At this time the peoples of earth are groaning under the oppression of their governments. There is no government that is satisfactory to any nation or people. Man is at his wits’ end. It is therefore the time of God’s opportunity to have his anointed make proclamation to the people that the time of their deliverance through God’s glorious kingdom has come. He who fails or refuses to avail himself of this opportunity is not walking on &quot;high places” but is missing the grandest privilege ever offered to man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">October 31 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">(126)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire. —Rev. 3:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Lord warns the lukewarm to buy of him. How can spirit-begotten ones buy from the Lord ? Evidently by paying to the Lord the price that the Lord requires, to wit, by joyfully keeping the commandments that specifically apply at the time when the Lord is at his temple. Some will wait until too late to do their buying. Buying gold tried in the fire surely must mean obtaining that which comes through fiery trials. The rule is definitely fixed, viz., &quot;we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God.” Undoubtedly the Lord’s words mean to buy divine approval by following in his steps, serving as he served, and receiving the reproach that he received by reason of faithfulness. A good name with the Lord is gained by a whole-hearted devotion to the kingdom interests committed to his servants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Deliver me not over unto the will of mine enemies; for false witnesses are risen up against me.—Ps. 27:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">David, &quot;the sweet psalmist of Israel,’’foreshadowed Christ Jesus and the members of his body. Hence the above words, which he wrote as God’s prophet, apply to The Christ. Satan induced false witnesses to appear against Jesus. Jesus’ disciples may expect the same thing because the servant is not above his master. Other scriptures also warn true Christians that they may expect false witnesses to rise against them, even from amongst those who claim to be their brethren. It is not strange, therefore, that false witnesses should arise in this day and condemn those who are putting forth their best efforts to bear witness to Jehovah’s name. But even though such enemies should kill God’s faithful mouthpieces, the Lord’s testimony will go on just the same.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The remnant of Jacob shall be in the midst of many people, as a dew from the Lord, as the showers upon the grass.—Mic. 5:7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In this description the &quot;remnant”, who strive for the heavenly birthright, are shown in the midst of the people as dew from the Lord and as showers upon the grass. These words indicate comfort and blessings to the people, and may be taken to indicate that some of the present “remnant” will be on earth even after Armageddon is fought and will then have some more work to do in the name and to the praise and glory of Jehovah. The people having passed through the terrible trouble will no longer look to men for help nor watch for the sons of men to offer aid and comfort, but will turn to Jehovah and gladly hear his Word. Some servants of the Lord will be privileged as his agents to bear the message of life and peace to the people.—Deut. 32: 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">He loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins.—1 John 4:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">His beloved Son was the great delight of Jehovah. But God is entirely unselfish, which means that God is love. He would forego himself the delight and daily communion with his beloved Son in his immediate presence, that he might recover man and at the same time prepare his beloved Son for the loftiest position of rulership. Hence, to execute his purposes and because of his love for humanity, God sent Jesus to earth to die in behalf of the sinful race. Thus God would first save the race from destruction and then establish over it a theocratic government that mankind might be fully recovered to human perfection and fully enjoy that perfect government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">November 4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">(10)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">For, behold, the Lord will come with fire, and with his chariots like a whirlwind, to render his anger with fury, and his rebuke with flames of fire.—Isa. 66:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The great battle of God Almighty is approaching. In it and by it Jehovah will demonstrate to all that he is supreme as God, and he will make his presence relative to earth keenly perceptible to alt He will make known that he is taking a hand in human affairs for the glory of his name and for the liberation of mankind, by and through his mighty Son, his great Priest after the order of Melchizedek. “So shall the Lord of hosts come down to fight for mount Zion.” (Isa. 31: 4) The chariots of his war organization shall then speed into action, and Satan’s evil system shall then be consumed. Therefore the prophet says: “Hold thy peace at the presence of the Lord God; for the day of the Lord is at hand.”—Zeph. 1: 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;When the king came in to see the guests, he saw there a man which had not on a wedding garment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Matt. 22:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When Jehovah, as represented by his beloved Son, his anointed </span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">Kin</span><span class="font6">g, came to his temple to inspect those invited to the high calling, he found some who were disorderly, and these he clears out of his temple. Order is one of the hardest lessons for creatures to learn. A deflection from God’s way is displeasing to him. A wilful and deliberate going contrary to the Lord’s appointed way is treason. Humility means to be submissive to God and to follow his appointed ways. Humility is the very opposite of pride. He who humbles himself under God’s mighty arrangement and joyfully conforms to the way of God proves his love for Jehovah, the great “King of eternity”. He retains his wedding garment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">November 6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">(224)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">If any man minister, let him do it as of the ability which God giveth: that God in all things may be glorified through Jesus Christ.—1 Pet. 4:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jesus said he came to minister. A minister is one who is clothed with power and authority to represent a higher power or authority and who attends to the duties of his office and renders service. He is the representative of a government or power, an ambassador performing service in his official capacity. His authority is limited by the commission received from the one appointing him. Paul said: “I am made a minister, according to the stewardship of God which is given to me for you, fully to declare the Word of God.” (margin and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Diaglott)</span><span class="font6"> The true minister of God ministers not in his own strength but in that of the Lord, and he seeks to represent Jehovah faithfully and to glorify him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves . . . perfecting holiness in the fear of God.—3 Cor. 7:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Lord God is building an official habitation for himself, which is Zion; and those of Zion may therefore have no fellowship or friendship with the enemy organization. The exceeding great and precious promises given to such were made with a definite purpose in view, namely, “holiness unto the Lord.” The adversary has made many Christians believe that all that is required is to clean up oneself from bodily and mental filthiness. But the apostle goes further and points out that something is additional to such cleansing, namely, “perfecting holiness in the fear of God.” This means an utter separation of oneself from everything that has to do with Satan’s system, and an unqualified espousal of Jehovah’s will and cause.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">They overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives unto the death.—Rev. 12:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The faithful remnant, trusting in Jesus’ blood, anointed by Jehovah’s spirit, and counting not their lives dear unto them, are joyfully giving the testimony, and by the Lord’s grace they will overcome the enemy. They fear no evil because they are “under the shadow of the Almighty”. Perfect love has no fear of man or Devil, but he who has perfect love and absolute confidence in God boldly proclaims the truth as a witness in the name of the Lord. Jehovah will take into his government and make official members thereof only those who prove that they love him and his King more than their own lives.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">To the others he said in mine hearing, Go ye after him through the city, and smite; let not your eye spare, neither have ye pity.—Ezek. 9:5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This commission to the six men with slaughter weapons, who represent the incomplete anointed class on earth, became applicable when the Lord came to his temple. God’s remnant must -f</span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">ulfil</span><span class="font6"> this commission, not with carnal weapons, but by the use of the spirit of God in declaring the day of his vengeance. In so doing they must not imitate King Saul when he was sent to slaughter the Amalekites utterly. They dare not say: “The mean and contemptible things of Satan’s organization we will denounce; but the respected things of Christendom we will spare, because this will result beneficially to us and we will not become obnoxious to the many respectable people of the world.” The remnant must spare no part of the enemy system but must obey God’s orders completely.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">November 10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">(265)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">In the ages to come he might shew the exceeding riches of his grace, in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus.—Eph. 2:</span><span class="font6">7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The honor and glory to be enjoyed by the saints in the resurrection is not essential to God’s plan, but it is a great favor conferred upon them and is an acknowledgement of their faithfulness. Manifestly Jehovah’s purpose has been to afford to those willingly obedient to his Word an opportunity to prove themselves as his faithful representatives in the world and thus not leave himself without living witness in the earth. Though not of the world, they are in the world to bear testimony to the name of the true God. To them Jehovah has offered the opportunity to be made conformable to Christ’s death that they may partake of his glorious resurrection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">In burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin thou hast had no pleasure. Then said I, Lo, I come ... to do thy will, 0 God-—Heb. 10: 6, 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Why then were animals ever sacrificed! It was as an expression of Jehovah’s loving-kindness for man, teaching him how God would duly open the way for man’s complete reconciliation and that the basis for such reconciliation would be the sacrifice of life. God has proceeded gradually and gently to teach and lead men, knowing that when men come to know him and his good purposes toward them they will love and obey him. Hence the sacrifice of dumb animals merely foreshadowed the sacrifice of a life in man’s behalf but did not foreshadow the nature of the one who must be the real sacrifice. That one was “the man Christ Jesus’’. Animal sacrifices being unavailing, he came to fulfil the pictures they foreshadowed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">November 12 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">(279)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">And he that sat upon the throne said, Behold, I make all things new.—Bev. 21:5!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">That the people might hear and be assured in this time of stress, Jehovah caused John to write the above true and faithful words. Jehovah’s administration of the righteous government through his anointed King is certain to be a constructive one that will result in blessings to mankind. The reconstruction of the world will progress steadily, and the people will leani that their invisible Ruler is just, righteous, and true. They themselves must be made right and learn to do right, and Jehovah has provided the means for this to be accomplished. The stony heart will be removed, and they will be given hearts of flesh filled with love and praise to God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The truth of the Lord endureth for ever. Praise ye the Lord.—Ps. 117:2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">God has used human instruments at different times in making known his truth, hut the truth has always been and always will be Jehovah’s. The Bible is his Word of truth, given to guide those seeking God’s righteousness. The truth-seeker is not left to guesswork, nor obliged to rest his conclusions upon man’s opinions; but, having the Scriptures and knowing them to be God’s Word and therefore right and absolutely true, he can prove every doctrine that is offered. God has preserved his written Word of truth, the Bible, against every attempt of Satan and his agencies to destroy it. Now it is God’s time for the truth to be known, and nothing Satan can do or will do shall prevent God’s eternal truth from being known. The tide of truth will continue to rise until it fills the whole earth as the seas fill the deep. All this shall be to the glory and praise of Jehovah God.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">For whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, . . . for our profit, that we might be partakers of his holiness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Heb. 12:6,10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">God purposed to have a new creation which would be marked by “holiness unto the Lord’’ and be ever faithful to him. In no way could he prove this creation except by putting each member of it to the severest test. By suffering, Jesus was subjected to the test, and his faithfulness and obedience earned for him the title “Faithful and True”. To be exalted with Jesus the body members of The Christ must first meet the same test as he did. Their sufferings are not fou the purpose of providing a purchase price or a sin-offering, but are for their own profit, that they might partake of glory, honor and immortality with Christ Jesus. This is a loving provision for them on the heavenly Father’s part.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">And the gospel must first be published among all nations.—Mark 13:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The real meaning of these words of the Anointed One could not be understood until after he had come to his temple and this truth was flashed to God’s watching ones like lightning. By “the gospel’’ he meant the good news furnished by the fact that the world had ended and the time had come for Jehovah’s righteous government to be put in operation. Thus the Prince of Peace has given to his younger brethren a positive command that must be obeyed; and all who love him and love God will keep this commandment and, keeping it, will have God’s special favor. Keeping this commandment means to engage in the wonderful work which God is now doing in the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">November 16 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">(304)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to give every man according as his work shall be.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Rev. 22:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Manifestly God’s messenger here refers to the Lord’s coming to the temple, from which time forward the Lord has taken account with those who have made a covenant with Jehovah. It is during this time that he renders 'to each man according as his work is’. All those who confess the Lord’s name and to whom he has committed his goods or kingdom interests are under examination and being put to the test. This is why in the preceding verse the Lord says: “He that is unjust, let him be unjust still: and he which is filthy, let him be filthy still: and he that is righteous, let him be righteous still: and he that is holy [devoted wholly to the Lord and diligently earing for the kingdom interests], let him be holy still. ’ ’ All this shows that the time has arrived for the judicial decree to be rendered by the One authorized by Jehovah to judge, which One is Christ Jesus. We must all appear before his judgment seat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">For thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, The daughter of Babylon is like a threshingfloor, it is time to thresh her.—J er. 51:33.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Mystery, Babylon the great, the mother of harlots and abominations of the earth,” is that devilish and wicked org</span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">aniz</span><span class="font6">ation, symbolized by the evil “woman” or “great eity”, that has long ruled over the nations and kingdoms of the earth. (Rev. 17: 5,18) It gives birth to the wicked government, both visible and invisible, which rules the kingdoms of men. As the term Zion is properly applied to God’s organization as a whole and also to the members of the body of Christ, even so the name Babylon is properly applied to the Devil’s organization as a whole and also to the members of the official family of that wicked organization. It is now time for God’s anointed ones to declare his vengeance against Babylon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">November 18 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(155)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Be patient therefore, brethren, unto the coming of the Lord.—Jas. 5:7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">These words indicate that the brethren would be surrounded by darkness until the presence of the Lord, and then his presence would be manifest by the coming and increasing of the light. The physical facts show that the light began approximately in 1874 and increased from that time forward, marking that as the beginning of the time of the presence of the Lord. God was there turning his face to his saints ; and there Christ Jesus began giving special attention to gathering them out of Babylon preparatory to bringing them into the temple condition. This does not mean, however, that since the Lord’s coming to his temple Christ’s brethren have need no longer to exercise “patient continuance in well doing”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">I am an ambassador in bonds; that therein I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak.—Eph. 6:20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">AU the ambassadors of Christ on earth would now be in bonds except that God is shielding them until their ministry is done. An ambassador is one appointed by a higher authority to represent that higher authority in a foreign country. Jesus was such when he came to earth to do a work in his Father’s name. God was then and there speaking through Christ his message of reconciliation, telling the people how man can be reconciled. He spoke boldly as God's Ambassador, and for this he died. His death constitutes the ransom price, and this, presented as a sin-offering, constitutes the atonement for man’s sin. The truth of these great facts must be boldly declared to the people now by Jehovah’s ambassadors on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">November 20 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(85)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Praise thy God, 0 Zion. He maketh peace in thy borders, and filleth thee with the fat of wheat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Ps. 147:12,14, margin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Those faithful to the covenant by sacrifice and under the robe of righteousness are at peace with each other. They see eye to eye on the great truths revealed to them from God’s Word, and are watching carefully for the interests of God’s kingdom. Unitedly they carry forth the message of Jehovah and lift their hearts and voices to him in harmonious song. To give them strength thereunto Jehovah fills them with food, like the sweet and nourishing portion of the wheat. Not only does he give them the Word of God for food, but he graciously shows them the meaning thereof that it may be exceedingly nourishing and strengthening to them. Others who engage in quarrels and disputes feed upon the husks and do not understand the truth and can not rejoice in the precious truths now being revealed to God’s remnant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">November 21 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(180)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service.-Rom 12:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Present,” as here used, means “to stand alongside ; to be at hand ready to serve; to assist and bring before and yield up ’ The Lord's Word does not say, ‘Sacrifice your bodies,’ but, ‘Present your bodies as a sacrifice.’ Jesus, the High Priest, will do the sacrificing. Our reasonable service under the terms of the covenant by sacrifice is to use all the powers with which we are endowed in behalf of the Lord’s cause, and therefore to be at all times on the alert to obey his will. Our bodies are counted alive as the new creature’s organism, and hence we must see to it that the use to which they are put is in harmony with God’s will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">November 22 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(156)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">I Jesus have sent mine angel to testify unto you these things in the churches. I am . . . the bright and morning star.—Rev. 22:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Long before Jesus’ above words Jehovah caused the prophecy to be uttered: “There shall come a Star out of Jacob, and a Sceptre shall rise out of Israel.” (Num. 24:17) This prophecy refers to Jesus as earth’s rightful Governor and could not have its fulfilment until he was sent forth to rule amidst his enemies. Hence this prophecy synchronizes with our Lord’s words in the text above as to time of fulfilment. The morning star is a sure harbinger of a bright and glorious day. It appears in the east shortly before the dawn breaks, giving forth its soft and pleasing light and cheering those who watch for the new day. The early watchers see it and are glad. “Star” figuratively means prince. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">(Strong)</span><span class="font6"> Hence Christ Jesus, “the Prince of Peace,” is appropriately “the bright and morning star”; for on his shoulder the government of righteousness shall rest. He has already taken his power as King. Therefore he sends this testimony unto the churches.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity.—Matt. 13:41.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">These words show that the ones gathered out were for a time counted in as the anointed; otherwise they could not be brought out from the kingdom. They are gathered out because they become offensive to the Lord’s manner of carrying on his work. By refusing to do the Lord’s work as he commands, such “do iniquity”, become lawless. God’s present message points so clearly to what true Christians must now do as regards announcing the kingdom, that it offends the selfish and self-willed; thereby they are shaken out. Instead of trying to get men into heaven, Jehovah is shaking out all who can be shaken, that thus the approved ones might be made manifest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">November 24 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(93)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Blessed are ye, when men shall . ■ . reproach you, » . . for the Son of man’s sake. Rejoice ye in that day, and leap for joy.—Luke 6:22,23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Because of his zeal and loving devotion to the work which God had given him to do, Jesus was reproached by the Devil and his instruments, particularly the ecclesiastics. Likewise today reproaches are hurled at those who love and advocate God’s kingdom of righteousness, and this is done generally by the religious element. Suffering such reproaches is another means of identifying those who are prospective heirs of the kingdom. God permits these reproaches for the purpose of testing and preparing the kingdom heirs and also as a proof to them that they are his. Those thus suffering should greatly rejoice, for great is their reward in the heavenly government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">W/ten we werd </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son.—Rom. 5:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This is proof that man could not take the initiative toward reconciliation. Jehovah God alone must make the necessary provision, and unless God in the exercise of his loving-kindness toward men did make the necessary provision all men in time must perish. Therefore it is\written that God was so unselfishly disposed toward men that he sent his beloved Son into the world to die in their behalf. God’s remnant today, realizing the reconciliation already accomplished in their case, “joy in God, through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received the atonement [reconciliation, margin]. Much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by, his life.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">November 26 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(273)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">And the heavens shall declare his righteousness: for God is judge himself.—Ps. 50:6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Scriptures and physical facts prove that Satan and his angels have been cast out of heaven, and therefore all who are in heaven declare the righteousness of Jehovah in taking this action against the evil one and his host. A voice from heaven says: &quot;Therefore rejoice, ye heavens, and ye that dwell in them.” Now Jehovah’s righteous judgments are being made manifest in the earth. His judgment has already begun at the house of God: &quot;for the Lord shall judge his people.” All those professing God’s name come under this judgment; namely, those faithful to the covenant by sacrifice, the &quot;great multitude”, and the &quot;wicked” or “evil servant” class. Jehovah now whets his glittering sword and his hand takes hold on judgment, and shortly he will render vengeance on all his enemies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand.—John 3:35.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The love of God for his beloved Son Jesus could not be excelled. Jesus testified to the sweet relationship between his Father and himself. The Son was the dearest treasure of his Father’s heart. But without God’s exercise of love for mankind man could never be reconciled to God and live. The great God of the universe freely gave his beloved Son that man might live. The apostle, after having tasted of that love divine and the heavenly gift, with no way of compensating therefor and with no way of adequately expressing appreciation thereof, exclaimed: &quot;Thanks be unto God for his unspeakable gift.” It was an unspeakable gift because of Jehovah’s love for the One given.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">November 28 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(186)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">As </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">many as I love, I rebuke and chasten: be zealous therefore, and repent.—Rev. 3:19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It must be that the course of action taken by many of the consecrated ones in this Laodicean period is lacking in zeal for Jehovah, and for this reason God’s &quot;faithful and true witness” says the above words to them. Why should the Lord call upon any one except the sons of God to be zealous </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">1</span><span class="font6"> Why should he counsel any one to repent or change his course of action unless by so doing he could be brought into full harmony with him and into the favor of God </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">1</span><span class="font6"> Beyond a question of doubt the above message is addressed to those who have received a knowledge of present truth but who have failed to show a proper appreciation thereof. A test is therefore put upon them. It is the duty of each one of the anointed to manifest the zeal peculiar to God’s house of sons.—Ps. 69:9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">And this man shall be the peace, when the Assyrian shall come into our land.—Mie. 5:5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Undoubtedly “the Assyrian’’ is one of the names of Satan’s organization. The Assyrian, the Devil and his agencies, attempts to invade the citadel of the temple class and to destroy and break down the members thereof. (Rev. 12:17) While the enemy makes the assault upon God’s anointed ones, the great “Ruler” is the peace of the remnant. He is the “Prince of Peace”; he comes as Jehovah’s Executive Officer to establish peace. But first he must make war and overthrow the enemy. The remnant side with him and follow him because he is the Head of Zion and Jehovah’s great Priest. The remnant trust him and are at peace. He is their Redeemer and King, and they have complete confidence in him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">November 30 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(24)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through sanctification of the spirit, unto obedience.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—1 Pet. 1:2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">God sanctified his Son Jesus by the spirit to be the Head of the great government of righteousness which he would establish. Before he would exalt him to the high position of actual rulership God would prove his beloved Son by letting him be subjected to the most severe trials. The persecutions that were heaped upon him afforded the opportunity for him to learn obedience. By these experiences Jesus did learn obedience and proved his worthiness to be fully and for ever entrusted with the work before him. His course emphasized the lesson God would teach the new creation: that obedience is of the greatest importance if they would be exalted in the kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">He added and spaice a parable, . . . A certain nobleman went into a far country, to receive for himself</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">a kingdom, and to return.—Luke 19:11,12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This parable shows how the Lord measures all who have made a covenant to do God’s will and by that measurement determines who constitute the temple class or faithful members of Christ on earth. (Rev. 11:1) This work must be done by the Lord at the time of coming to his temple. Those whom he finds to be fully devoted to him, and who are making the kingdom interests paramount to eveiything else, he approves. All such collectively he designates that “faithful and wise servant”, and from that time forward the Lord commits to that “servant” all his goods, namely, all his kingdom interests on earth.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark309"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">December 2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(210)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">These sayings are faithful and true: and the Lord God of the holy prophets sent his angel to shew unto his servants the things which must shortly be done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Rev. 22:6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah now reveals his will faithfully and truly unto his anointed ones, and they see that a witness work is to be done and must be done amongst the peoples and that it must be done “shortly”, that is, speedily. There is now no time for delay. “In that day it shall be said ... to Zion, Let not thine hands be slack.” Jehovah now bids those having hearing ears to come and learn the way of life and to walk therein. Those who would continue to be of the servant class, and therefore of “the bride”, must now say, “Come!” Such will keep on inviting the people to take their stand on the side of Jehovah. Such now see that God’s anointed King is upon his throne and that “the Lord is in his holy temple”, and they enthusiastically say, “I will sing praise to my God while I have my being.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Zion shall be redeemed with judgment, and they that return of her with righteousness.—Isa. 1:27, margin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Malachi’s prophecy shows that the co</span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">min</span><span class="font6">g of Jehovah’s Messenger to his temple marks the beginning of the time of judgment. Then applies the scripture: “For the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God.” It follows that the remnant who gather themselves unto the Lord and who make up Zion must be the first ones judged. Jesus’ words (Matt. 25:23) show that these are first judged, and only after being found good and faithful servants are they made a part of the Lord’s temple and do they therefore form a part of Zion. For such Jehovah provided the sign of his approval, the robe of righteousness, and Christ Jesus brings the approved ones under it, thus beginning a time of rejoicing for them.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Praise thy God, 0 Zion. He giveth snow like wool: he scattereth the hoarfrost like ashes.—Ps. 147:12,16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Snow is pleasant and beautiful to the eye, but it is cold and cheerless; wool is warm and comforting and brings soft ease and peace of mind. To some the truth looks cold and uninteresting, but when understood it makes them warm of heart. As for the hoarfrost, it is bright, but it is hard frost that has become so by reason of age; it is very cold and cheerless. Some of the people to whom the truth is now being brought have been in contact with “Bible religion” for years and have found no joy therein, and at first the truth also seems to be cold and without cheer to them; but when the truth is examined and explained to them the situation changes and the frosty condition melts away just as ashes fly before the wind. For all this the children of Zion praise Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Alleluia; for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth. —Rev. 19:6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We must not infer that God has not always governed his obedient creatures. There is no record of the beginning of the exercise of Jehovah’s sovereign power. In fact, the Scriptures speak of the priest Melchizedek, “priest of the Most High God,” as picturing Jehovah's executive officer carrying out the divine will at all times; and of the beginning of his days there is no record. But the new and righteous government of earth has a definite beginning. Imperfect man will not make the laws for this new government, as is the custom with human governments. The new government is a pure theocracy; it is God's government by and through his beloved Son Christ Jesus. Through this government Jehovah, the Lord God omnipotent, reigns. Furthermore, “Jehovah shall reign for ever and ever.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater.—1 John 5: 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During the past sixty centuries testimony has been given for God by faithful men; but when Jehovah comes forth to give the final witness he will become the Chief Witness. When his testimony is given, all creation will know that Jehovah is the true and living God and that Satan and his minions are liars. Before Jehovah shall the wicked perish. Then in the eyes of every creature who loves righteousness Jehovah will stand as the greatest, the “true and faithful witness”. (Jer. 42: 5, A </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">R.</span><span class="font6"> V.) Already he has given his beloved Son that title; and those who shall be associated with Christ Jesus in his great work, sitting with him in his throne, must also be faithful and true witnesses to the name and majesty of Jehovah.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">The Lord’s remnant, the heirs of the heavenly birthright, will go on to triumph in the strength of Jehovah. “The righteous are bold as a lion.” (Prov. 28:1) The lion is a monarch among the beasts of the forest, and none can stand before him. A flock of sheep or herd of goats is without power against a strong, young lion amongst them. Thus the faithful remnant of God is described by the prophet Amidst the nations of many peoples these shall be strong and vigorous in the name of Jehovah, to assist those who want help and to point out God’s method of destroying those that resist his power and arrangement. God’s power will be exercised, and all enemies of his people shall be cut off.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">[Jesus] </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">was raised again for our justification. . . . He that is righteous, let him be righteous still.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Rom. 4:25; Rev. 22:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">No human being at present is righteous within himself. When one trusts in Jesus’ blood and makes a vow to do God’s will, and God receives and justifies him, only then is he counted as righteous. There is a great multitude of those who have consecrated to do God’s will and who, being justified, were brought forth as new creatures; but they hold the truth selfishly, looking to the time when they might receive profit thereby. They have sought to make themselves righteous and have overlooked and neglected keeping God’s commandments faithfully. If ever sueh are to live on any plane of existence, they must maintain that righteousness which is due to justification. They can maintain it only by holding to the faith in Christ Jesus. Concerning such less faithful ones, but who are still righteous, Christ Jesus on coming to his temple for judgment says: “Let him be righteous still.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins, which . . . went forth to meet the bridegroom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">And five of them were wise.—Matt. 25:1,2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The “wise” are those who apply their knowledge according to the divine standard and who apply themselves joyfully to the service of the kingdom interests committed to them. To them God’s kingdom is everything, and they make everything in life subservient to it and its interests. Though all Christians have had their Bibles, “their lamps,” and have studied them some, only the wise ones have understood and rejoiced in the prospects of the kingdom of God being established. These latter awakened to their privileges shortly after 1918. They rejoiced in the tribulations permitted by the Lord and, being delighted at the Bridegroom’s coming, they hasted to serve him with joy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">December 10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(205)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">For in that he himself hath suffered being tempted, he is able to succour them that are tempted.—Heb. 2:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">To be tempted means to be put to a test. Jehovah had anointed his Son Jesus to be Ruler, and before permitting him to reign God would prove his Son by a severe test. Jesus had always been true to his Father, but now he was anointed to be God’s great Prince and King to rule the world; hence God would prove his Son by actual experience. If Jesus would prove his faithfulness and devotion to God under trial, he would prove himself entirely worthy to be trusted with the great authority and power as Ruler of the world and with the possession of the divine nature, immortality. Therefore God permitted Satan to apply the test, and God saw to it that that test resulted to his own praise and glory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">I have set watchmen upon thy walls, 0 Jerusalem, which shall never hold their peace day nor night.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Isa. 62:6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">God’s anointed servant class is gathered into a oneness in order to tell harmoniously concerning his doings. There could not be several ways of proclaiming the message of truth. Those composing the watchmen upon Jerusalem’s walls “see eye to eye”; and each one, together with the others, lifts up the voice and sings. This does not mean merely telling to people the plan of God as it pertains to the past, present and future, but it means to tell what Jehovah is doing at the present time. Many marvelous things are now happening in the earth, and it is the duty and obligation of God’s servant class to tell the meaning thereof to every one who will hear. The people must be told that a knowledge of Jehovah and obedience to his will is the only way that leads to life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">December 12 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(337)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">And he said unto me, Thou must prophesy again before many peoples, and nations, and tongues, and kings.—Rev. 10:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Before overthrowing Egypt’s wicked government and delivering his chosen people therefrom, Jehovah caused notice to be served upon Egypt’s rulers. When about to cast off the Jews, he used Jesus and the apostles to serve notice, particularly upon their rulers. In each case he chose as his witnesses men who were devoted to him. And now, when God would complete his great work in establishing his righteous government which shall crush all of Satan’s organization, he causes notice to be served upon the peoples, nations, and kings. He chooses not the selfish and presumptuous to do this work; it is the “remnant” by the Lord’s grace that carries on the work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him.—Heb. 5:9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Logos in heaven was perfect. He became the man Jesus, and as such he was perfect. Yet Jesus was made perfect as Captain of our salvation, after his consecration and anointing at Jordan, which perfection was accomplished by the things which he suffered up to his death. All of Christ’s body members must be perfected in a like manner. They must completely forsake Satan’s system and become a part of God’s organization. The perfection of the new creature is gained by obeying “the author of [his] eternal salvation” in continual faithful and joyful devotion to Jehovah by declaring the message which God gave him to declare and doing that until his course is </span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">finish</span><span class="font6">ed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">December 14 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(48)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Even now many have become antichrists; . , . and you have an anointing from the Holy One; you aU know it,</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">—J </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">John 2:18,20, Diaglott.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The unfaithful who go out from under the Head Christ Jesus line themselves up on the side of the antichrist. The faithful, however, know that they have received the anointing through the Head of The Christ, and that he received it from Jehovah; that therefore an obligation is laid upon them to do and perform certain things; that the anointing constitutes their ordination or commission to preach; and that there is no other rightful ordination. In the performance of the divinely granted commission they must faithfully represent and declare Jehovah’s name, his anointed King and his kingdom. They keep themselves unspotted from the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">If any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part from the tree of life, and out of the holy city.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Rev. 22:19, margin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The time now makes manifest a selfish class who become dissatisfied with the spiritual food which the Lord provides for his devoted people and who take no pleasure in obeying his commandments. In effect they say: ‘There is no more truth to be revealed. We must now quietly wait until we are taken to heaven. We will have nothing to do with the service.’ They refuse to join with &quot;The Spirit and the bride” in saying, &quot;Come.” Thus they take away from God’s words his commandments that the witness must now be delivered and that by a faithful class whom Jehovah calls his &quot;remnant” and &quot;witnesses”. Having left their first love, and failing to overcome, they lose the promise of receiving any right to the tree of life. There must have been a time when these could have had a part in that tree; but now, whatever may be their final state, they can not be part of God’s holy city or his glorious kingdom.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">He shall speak peace unto the heathen; and his dominion shall be from sea even to sea.—Zech. 9:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">War engenders hatred. Love must be planted in the people's hearts in place of hatred. Love will make their hearts tender and gentle. Love is unselfishness made manifest. One of the great benefits the people will have under God’s righteous government is that he will stop all war through the One to whom he has given earth’s dominion, and will plant love in their hearts. That will mean to the peoples of earth universal and lasting peace. War’s horrors will be gone for ever and there will never be another carnal war. That benefit to the people can not be adequately described in words, but when the people know and understand this truth they will sing for joy.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Come, my people, enter thou into thy chambers, and shut thy doors about thee: hide thyself as it were for a little moment, until the indignation be overpast.—Isa. 26:20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is written: “When the wicked rise [since 1918], men [of the body of Christ] hide themselves.’’ The command to the saints to hide themselves in the inner chambers could not apply prior to the Lord’s coming to his temple. It is in “that day” of God’s indignation against his enemies that the place of safety is provided; and, since we are entering that great and terrible day, the place of safety must now be available. The inner chambers, or place of security, are provided for and made known to those who have received the robe of righteousness since the Lord came to his temple. Manifestly the “little moment” that they are to hide themselves therein is the “short time” that Satan knows that he has to prepare for and to fight the battle of Armageddon. Only those who discern God’s lightnings flashing since 1918 see that there is a place of safety and hide themselves therein.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">December 18 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(229)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Whoso offereth praise glorifieth me: and to him that disposeth his way will I shew the salvation of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Ps. 50:23, margin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is those who joyfully sing the praises of Jehovah God and who give glory to his name, doing it out of a pure heart unselfishly, that are pleasing unto him. Taking their stand unequivocally and firmly on Jehovah’s side and boldly bearing testimony to his name, they prepare the way by which Jehovah may show them his salvation. They see and know no God but the Most High. They are on his side, determined to stay there, and they delight to voice their praises unto him. Be it noted, therefore, that the ultimate salvation of the “remnant” now depends upon constant and faithful devotion to Jehovah God in performance of the covenant by sacrifice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Let them that suffer according to the will of God commit the keeping of their souls to him in well doing, as unto a faithful Creator.—1 Pet. 4:19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When a Christian sees that by suffering according to the will of God he has the opportunity to prove to Jehovah that he is faithful and true, he delights to have that opportunity, regardless of what causes the suffering. When he sees that the world is Satan’s organization and that from it comes the opposition, then he extracts joy from his sufferings. The sufferings do not deter him, hut he continues patiently in well-doing, serving his Creator, and commits to his Maker the responsibility of preserving him while so doing. He does not try to run ahead of the Lord by seeking a course which will relieve him of the sufferings, but persists in the Lord’s service until the Lord delivers him.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">And the angel . &gt;&nbsp;. gathered the vine of the earth, and cast it into the great winepress of the wrath of God.—Rev. 14:19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Having already ousted Satan from heaven and destroyed his rule there, we may know that God will destroy his rule and influence on earth. Such is one of the preliminary works of God’s righteous government. In that work of destruction Christ Jesus leads the assault. He alone is the wine-press that crushes the life of the vine of the earth, Satan’s evil organization. The part in this great work that the faithful disciples of Christ on earth perform is that of process servers. They serve warning by informing the rulers and peoples of earth concerning Jehovah’s intention through Christ Jesus to destroy the adversary’s world organization in the battle of Armageddon. Z </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">am made a minister, according to the dispensation [stewardship, margin] of God which is given to me.—Col. 1:25.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jesus on earth was charged with the ministry of God’s Word. He was God’s Apostle and Ambassador. He declared that God’s Word is the truth and that he must tell it to those who would hear. He was faithful to God who appointed him as his minister. The anointed ones are also God’s ministers; and all such faithful ones constitute the Servant of God, of which Jesus is the Head. Paul was anointed as a member of Christ’s body. Paul did not sing the praises of other men, nor did he seek to exalt himself in the eyes of men. The true minister or servant of God gives attentive heed to what Jesus did on earth, and, Like Jesus, he seeks always to faithfully represent God and to please him.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises; that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature.—2 Pet. 1:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The condition precedent to partaking of the divine nature is that the one in the covenant by sacrifice fulfil his part of the contract He can not fail if he does the things mentioned by the Apostle Peter. These things are faith, fortitude, knowledge, self-control and constancy in the performance of duty, and God-likeness or holiness, brotherly affection, and love. Demonstrating these things with diligence is the prime essential in the performance of the new creature’s part of the covenant. His organism, the body of flesh, must serve Jehovah. Thus carrying out his contract, he is certain to have an abundant entrance into the official part </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">of</span><span class="font6"> God’s righteous government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Christ Jesus . . . was faithful to him that appointed him, as also Moses was faithful in all his house.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Het). 3:1,2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jesus’ exaltation was higher than all others of God’s creation, and aside from Jehovah none other will ever be so high. That exaltation was not because of something Jesus had developed within himself, such as a character separate and distinct from himself; nor was it because of what he had done before he came to earth; but it was because of his fidelity, as a man on earth, to Jehovah in the faithful performance of his covenant and his duties and obligations laid upon him by his Father. It is from this viewpoint that Christ’s younger brethren who are called to share the same high exaltation are exhorted, to consider Jesus, Jehovah’s great Ambassador.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Be not conformed to this world [age]: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind.—Rom. 12:2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">For any Christian who would be faithful, now especially is no time to think that it is right and proper for him to participate in and pursue a course similar to that of the respectable part of the world. If he has been transformed at all and if his mind has been renewed by the lightnings of revelation and truth which have flashed since the Lord’s coming to his temple, he will discern the &quot;good, and acceptable, and perfect will of God”. He will refuse to sympathize with or conform himself to the way of the Devil’s organization. He will not divide his affections between Jehovah’s organization and something that is included in Satan’s worldly organization. He will be exclusively for Jehovah, first, last and all the time.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">I Jesus have sent mine angel to testify unto you these things in the churches. I am the root and the offspring of David.—Rev. 22:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">David, the son of Jesse (&quot;living one’’), was anointed to be ruler over natural Israel. He foreshadowed Christ the King. David was bom in Bethlehem; Jesus also was bom there, and concerning him it was written: &quot;But thou, Beth-lehem Ephratah, . . . out of thee shall he come forth unto me that is to be ruler in Israel.’’ Though this prophecy had a miniature fulfilment when Jesus as a man came out of the literal town of Bethlehem, its complete fulfilment was deferred &quot;until the time that she [Zion] which travail-eth hath brought forth”. The birth of the “man child”, representing the new government or new nation, seems to be the key to the matter. (Mic. 5:3) It was in 1914, therefore, that the prophecy was fulfilled by Christ’s coming to rule; and in 1918 he presented himself as King and Head of Zion. Then it was that Jesus became the rightful inheritor, as the &quot;root and offspring of David”, of the promise made to David concerning the everlasting throne.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">God loveth a cheerful giver.—2 Cor. 9:7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">He who receives from the Lord must give if he would grow. He who receives the truth and continues to hold it must serve it. If he receives it and makes use of it for selfish purposes he makes no progress and has no real joy. The faithful receive the truth with joy, and with greater joy they give it out to others. They delight thereby to honor the name of the great Giver. It was Jesus who said: &quot;It is more blessed to give than to receive.” To receive the truth brings gladness of heart; but to tell it out to the praise of Jehovah brings even greater joy. The sacrifice of the anointed ones is &quot;the sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of our lips, giving thanks to his name ’ ’. They cheerfully give forth such praise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him.—Rev. 3:20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Any spirit-begotten one opening the door and actively joining God’s “watchmen” and enthusiastically entering the service in whatsoever way the Lord opens to him will receive Jehovah’s favor. Each individual of God’s household of sons is responsible to take such action as quickly as he is aroused. Ope</span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">nin</span><span class="font6">g the door to the Lord is an act of service to the Lord in obedience to his commandments. The door is the opportunity, and the obedient ones grasp it quickly. The Lord compels no one to enter his service. He needs no one, but he gives the signal announcing that he is at his temple and that the time for service is here, and then lets each individual accept or reject the opportunity. The individual embraces it by unselfishly doing all he can to proclaim the Lord’s message. The Lord comes in and sups with such.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">He is near that justifieth me; who will contend with met . . . Behold, the Lord God will help me; who is he that shall condemn met—Isa. 50:8,9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The word &quot;justifieth” here used has no application to the justification received by one at the time of consecration. The word is here applied primarily to the Lord Jesus (v. 6; Matt. 27:26; 26: 67), but applies to all the new creation, and signifies approval. Jehovah alone will pronounce approval on those who are his; no one else has the right so to do. He will approve those who please him regardless of what man may think, and such he will help. Therefore let no true child of the Lord be disquieted by slanderous reports against his brethren and condemn these brethren. God will judge each one according to his perfect judgment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Put not your trust in princes, nor in the son of man. . . . Happy is he that hath the God of Jacob for his help.—Ps. 146:3,5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The true child of God will not look for help or strength from any ereature. He will not hold to some supposed truth merely because some men taught it. He fully appreciates that the truth is from Jehovah, “the God of truth,” and that God causes his light to shine upon the Word of truth in his own good time. On the other hand, the child of God is not disturbed by the strength of man exercised against him. He fully appreciates the force of the statement, “If God be for us, who can be against us?” He does not stop to look about amongst princes or men for help; but with full faith and hope in the Lord God he goes sted-fastly on with his duties in the service of the Lord.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">God hath not called us unto uncleanness, but unto holiness. . . . He that is holy, let him be holy still.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—1 Thess. 4:7; Rev. 22:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When the Lord came to his temple and began reckoning with his servants, he approved those who were diligently caring for the kingdom interests committed to them. These had shown an appreciation of the fact that they had been brought into the body of Christ and had been anointed to do a work in the name of the Lord. They received the truth and held it in the love of the truth and sought to glorify God. They devoted themselves wholly to the Lord. Such were covered with the robe of righteousness and brought into the temple condition. But this is no guarantee that any individual shall remain there. To abide in the temple condition and in the secret place of the Most High, one must prove his faithfulness by holily obeying God’s commandments. The Lord’s judicial decree concerning such is: “Let him be holy still. ’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">He sheweth his word unto Jacob, his statutes and his judgments unto Israel. He hath not dealt so with any nation. . . . Praise ye the Lord.—Ps. 147:19,20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">God’s people are here represented by Jacob and Israel. God shows his Word and his will to those who have pledged themselves to serve him, especially at the present time. For this reason he gives his temple class from time to time flashes of lightning illuminating their minds and disclosing what he wishes them to' do. They constitute the people or nation called for his purposes. Never before has he dealt with any people or nation as with them. Great and unequaled is the privilege that God’s &quot;holy nation” now enjoys. His statutes and commandments to engage in his present glorious work in the earth have never before been properly known, and no other nation aside from the &quot;holy nation” has ever been invited to participate in carrying them out. For this they greatly rejoice and together they say to one another: &quot;Praise ye the Lord. ’ ’</span></p>

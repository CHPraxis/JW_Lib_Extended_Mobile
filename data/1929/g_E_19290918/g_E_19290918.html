<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">We do not know how many million people listened to Judge Rutherford on Sunday, August 25. That is a secret the Lord has kept to Himself. But we present in later pages collateral evidence that the ninety-seven stations in the coast-to-coast hook-up received perfect service from WBBR, the key station, and with rare flaws delivered a perfect message to their thousands or millions of listeners.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">We admonish new readers that now is the time to subscribe for THE GOLDEN AGE. It carries one of Judge Rutherford’s lectures in each issue. His messages are, in our judgment, epochal in their importance. Besides, THE GOLDEN AGE contains other good things; and the price is next to nothing, only $1 a year. Come in; the water is fine.</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">T</span><span class="font9">RUE information concerning health and life is of paramount importance to the people. When mention is made of health we must take into consideration not merely the physical but also the mental and moral conditions of the people. An unhealthy mental state leads to immorality, lawlessness and death. A few days; ago the New York </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Journal</span><span class="font9"> editorially gave a brief sketch of a habitual criminal who has spent more than forty years in prison. Editorially it was there stated that the man was born a criminal and had followed crime all of his life, and then the questions are asked: Who is responsible ? How can the public be made safe from such monsters? Can such born criminals be reformed? The authoritative answers to these questions are found in the Bible, and during this speech I shall give those answers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The facts reveal a very unhealthy condition in Europe, where I have recently spent some time. During the World War millions of men were permanently crippled in body and in mind. You do not see these cripples and insane on the streets of European cities. I made inquiry concerning their absence. I was informed that the physical and mental cripples are kept behind prison walls that the other people may not see them. Those unfortunates long for relief, praying that it may come to them in some way, but they have little or no knowledge of how relief may come. It is authoritatively stated that conditions of crime and mental and moral derelictions are even worse in America. Almost every person has some ailment. No one enjoys real health and life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Expressing grave alarm concerning the unhappy and unrighteous conditions existing in America, the president of the United States has appointed a crime commission and authorized it to discover the cause and bring forth a remedy. In that movement the president is being heartily supported by the leading financiers of the nation. The clergy have come forward and proffered their assistance and pledged themselves and their churches to aid the other wings of the government in carrying out the president’s plan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">As the political leader of the nation, Mr. Hoover is to be highly commended for expressing his desire to bring about a better condition amongst the people. It is proper that the great commercial part of the nation should also use its power to aid the people. Men of good intention, however, often pursue an unwise course in an attempt to accomplish their good purposes. These two powerful factors of the nation have looked to the clergy for wholesome advice, but again the clergy have failed to give such advice. Instead, through their spokesman, from whom I quote, they say: “If now, Mr. President, you have any word or call or challenge, of guidance or warning, to say to us, be assured it will be received in a spirit of readiness to help and of eagerness to carry on a program which is essentially a phase of our immediate church duty.” Those words express a willingness to fall in with, and an eagerness to support and carry on, any worldly scheme that may be brought forth as a remedy for the unhappy existing conditions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Let all be assured that I have no quarrel with the clergy, as men. If political leaders take an unwise course they receive severe criticism at the hands of the people. If the commercial powers of the land act unwisely they also are criticized. When those who hold themselves out as the spiritual advisers not only fail to give wholesome advice but stand in the way of the people’s knowing the truth, then why should not their course be carefully scrutinized by the rulers and by the people, and they also be criticized? I insist that the clergy have missed a great opportunity to tell the people the real cause of the breaking down of the world’s institutions, and of the unhealthy mental, moral and physical conditions, and what is the real remedy therefor. I wish merely to submit the proof; and if the proof sustains the conclusion stated, then both the rulers<sup>-</sup> and the people should no longer regard the clergy as safe advisers concerning spiritual and moral matters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Crime</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It is authoritatively stated that the annual murder rate in America has increased 350 percent since 1900, and that other crimes have increased in like proportion. Mr. Hoover, in a public address, has said: “Life and property are relatively more unsafe in the United States than in any other civilized country in the world.” It may be of interest here to mention the fact that the United States is the only country in the world where the clergy have insisted on the enactment of a prohibition law, and succeeded in so doing, while the country was under the stress of war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">If the commission would discover the source of crime, why not examine the evidence as to the very fountainhead of crime? If the clergy would aid the president and his commission in ascertaining the truth concerning the cause of the abnormal conditions, why not advise them where the truth is to be found? The clergy pose as the representatives of God and of Christ Jesus. Then why not tell the rulers and the people what God and Christ have to say about these vital questions that involve the health and life of all the peoples of earth? If the clergy know and believe the Word of God they should tell the rulers and the people what it says. If they do not believe that the Bible is God’s Word, then they should plainly so state to the people and cease to hold themselves out as preachers and spiritual advisers. If it is important to obey the laws of the land, then with stronger reasoning it is important to obey God’s law, because every just law of the land is based upon God’s righteous law. A greater responsibility, therefore, rests upon those who claim to teach God’s law. If they are failing or refusing to teach God’s law upon these vital questions, then the people should be informed, in order that they may pursue the course that is for their best interests.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">What, then, does God’s Word say as to murder and other crimes? Jesus answered, in John 8: 4.4, that Satan the Devil was a murderer from the beginning, the father of lies, and that he abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. It is further written in God’s Word that Satan caused men to violate God’s law and brought sickness, suffering and death upon the entire human family. It is therefore of vital importance to the people that they know what is the source of crime and wickedness, sickness and death, and what adequate remedy there is for the same.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Who is Satan, and whence did he come? God’s Word, in Isaiah 14:14 and in Ezekiel 28:14-18, answers that question, stating that originally his name was Lucifer; that God made Lucifer the overseer of man in Eden; that rebellion and disobedience on the part of Lucifer led to the sickness, suffering and death of man, and that the entire human race has suffered because thereof; that God changed the name of Lucifer and since then he is called Satan the Devil. All disobedience to law, as shown by the Bible, finds its source in Satan. In what I am here saying I am not putting </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">my</span><span class="font9"> construction or interpretation upon the Bible; but I am stating the facts as they are set forth therein, which any one can read and understand. Concerning those facts therein stated Jesus declares, in John 17:17, that the Bible is the Truth. What the people, as</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">well as the rulers, need is the truth, and not mere theory or platitudes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Why has there been such an increase of crime on earth during the past ten years? Why so many calamities, suicides and untimely deaths? Does the Bible give answer to these questions? It does; and the answer is found in Revelation 12:12, which reads: “Woe to the inhabiters of the earth ... 1 for the devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short time.” Why has Satan now but a short time? The Scriptures answer that question. For centuries God has not interfered with Satan in his nefarious work of deceiving the people. God long ago made promise that the time would come when Satan's world would end, when his evil rule would be destroyed, and that then God would set up a righteous government through His beloved Son, which government will bring blessings to all the people of earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Asked when that time would arrive, Jesus answered, in Matthew 24:8-10, that the beginning of that time would be marked by a world war, in which nation would rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom, followed quickly by famine and pestilence and then by distress of nations with perplexity. The conference of the statesmen at The Hague is proof of such perplexity. He also said that not only would the nations be angry at that time but it would be the beginning of God’s wrath upon Satan’s wicked rule. (Rev. 11:18) These prophetic utterances have been fulfilled before the eyes of all persons since 1914. Why have not the clergy called the attention of the rulers and the people to these truths ? They must answer before God. The rulers and the people must now seek information for themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Continuing to explain the unhappy conditions on earth Jesus declared (Rev. 16:13-16) that following the world war Satan and his agencies would then hurriedly prepare for the great battle of Armageddon; and this is what is meant by Satan’s having only a short time. Satan’s real purpose is to destroy the human race, and the Scriptures show he is egotistical enough to think that he can defeat God in His purpose of blessing mankind. He now seeks to turn the attention of the people away from the Lord and His Word that they may not know of Jehovah’s remedy for their blessing. In doing this, as the Scriptures state, he is rushing the people and the nations into greater crime and is the real one responsible for the great increase of crime and the unhealthy moral and mental conditions of the peoples in the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The Scriptures frequently refer to Satan’s concluding days as “the last days”. Concerning this time it is written, in 2 Timothy 3:1-5: “This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come. For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good, traitors, heady, highmind-ed, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God; having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">This scripture describes exactly the condition that is so well known today, and shows wZ?,?/ there is now a great increase of crime. Let the people look well to this scripture and the facts, and they will be able to locate the class of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">men </span><span class="font9">who in this day claim to represent God and yet, as this scripture says, Rave a form of godliness but deny the power of His Word.’ If the professed preachers of God’s Word could know the cause of the increased unrighteousness amongst men, and could know of a complete remedy therefor, and then fail to tell the rulers and the people the cause and the remedy, their course of action proves that they are unsafe and unwise counselors. They should tell the president and his commission plainly what God’s &quot;Word says concerning the cause and remedy. Instead they close their mouths as to the Word of God and announce their purpose to follow in the way of some human scheme which is doomed to complete failure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Deceive the Nations</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">God, through Christ, declares His purpose to destroy Satan and his wicked rule in the earth. <sub>v</sub>Rev. 17:14; 16:19) What is His purpose in destroying Satan’s rule? Jesus answered, in Revelation 20: 3, that the purpose is that Satan may </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">deceive</span><span class="font9"> the nations no more during the reign of Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Has Satan been deceiving the nations up to this time? Such are the plain words of the Bible, and such the facts corroborate. Men have organized themselves into nations and sought to establish good governments and to make and enforce wholesome laws. Satan, though invisible to man, has exercised his powerful influence over men, turned them’away from Jehovah God, and caused men and nations to walk in the rvay of unrighteousness. The plain statement of Jesus, as set forth in John 12: 31 and 14: 30, is that Satan is the invisible ruler of the nations of the world. Corroborating this it is further V'ritten, in 2 Corinthians 4:4: ‘The god of this world hath blinded the minds of men, lest the light of the glorious good news of Christ should shine unto them.’ By fraud and deception and the exercise of his wicked influence Satan has deceived the nations and blinded the people of the world to the truth. Have the clergy told the rulers and the people that Satan has exercised his unholy influence over the nations and deceived them and blinded them? If they have not so done, then they have failed in their duty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Is Jehovah God, udth His beloved Son Christ, the ruler of this present evil world? Certainly not, because there is now no nation that is ruled by the law of God. Long ago God promised that in His due time He would establish His kingdom, with Christ as King; and referring to that, Jesus said: ‘My kingdom is not of this world . . . ; my kingdom is future.’ (John 18: 36) The first work of God’s King, Christ Jesus, is to destroy Satan’s rule and release the people therefrom, and that will be the very result of Armageddon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It is written in God’s Word (Rom. 12:2) that those who love God should not conform themselves to this world. Contrary to that instruction, the clergy, claiming to be followers of Christ, do conform themselves to this world and go to the rulers and say: If you have any word of guidance, we are ready to fall in with that and follow.’ They therefore show their lack of faith in God and that they have failed to truly and faithfully represent God, and have </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">not</span><span class="font9"> told the people or rulers the truth concerning His kingdom; and therefore the rulers and the people suffer for want of knowledge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Lord’s Witnesses</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Those who are the sincere followers in the footsteps of Jesus God commands to now be His witnesses in the earth. They are told to bear to the rulers and to the people the message of truth concerning the kingdom of God. Today a little army of humble Christians, in obedience to God’s commandments, are going from house to house to carry this message to the people. They are not engaged in a propaganda scheme. They do not ask you to become a member of anything or to join anything. They come to you as friends of the people solely for the purpose of bringing you God’s message of truth, that you may sit in your homes and learn what are the vital and important truths at this time. Judging from past experiences, not one clergyman in the United States today will support this little company of God’s witnesses. On the contrary, they have been going to the law enforcement officers and influencing them to invoke the blue laws of religious intolerance, long ago enacted and which no honest man today desires to see enforced. They attempt to have a false construction put upon these laws to prohibit faithful men and women from preaching the gospel and informing the people concerning the truth. Let the people judge as to who has influenced the clergymen to take this course in attempting to prevent them from having the truth. Jesus said to His true followers (John 15:18-20) that because ye are not of this world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hates you’. “In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer: I have overcome the world.” (John 16:33) Let the people judge as to whether the clergy today are a part of the world or are a part of God’s organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Because the United States has more money and more power than any other nation on earth, and because she has received greater enlightenment than any other nation on earth, she stands in a position of greater responsibility today than any other nation. Because the clergy of America have assumed to represent God, and have had the opportunity to receive the truth and to tell it to the rulers and to the people, they occupy a position of greater responsibility before God than any other class of men in the governments of this world. When the great time of trouble described as Armageddon, and which is just ahead, is on, America, because of her advantage and responsibility, will doubtless receive a greater degree of punishment at the hands of Jehovah than some other nations. Knowledge and responsibility go hand in hand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Remedy</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">I fully concur with the president and his committee that the mental, moral and physical condition of the people is grave. I am in full accord with the desire to ascertain the cause and to find an adequate remedy. I am unwilling, however, to accept the findings of the committee as to the cause or the remedy. Unlike the clergy, I am unwilling to follow the lead of the president or his committee, because the conclusions of both will be but the expression of human wisdom. The clergy have proven themselves unsafe advisers and physicians without value to the rulers or to the people. If the great Creator of heaven and earth discloses to man the cause of the deplorable conditions, and the real remedy, then all men should desire to know these truths. I therefore state the plain truth as set forth in the Word of God upon these vital questions, and call upon both rulers and the people to heed these truths because they come from Good’s Word; and I ask them to utterly ignore the clergy, who speak only the wisdom of this world, which is foolishness in the sight of God.—1 Cor. 1: 20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">First, what is the cause of the unhappy conditions? Repeating the question of the New York </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Journal,</span><span class="font9"> Why was the man born a criminal, and who is responsible? briefly, I answer: Because Satan caused the first man to fall into sin and crime; and because all men have inherited that condition of imperfection, sickness and death. In Psalm 51: 5 and in Romans 5 :12 it is written that all have inherited sin from Adam and therefore all have been born in sin and shapen in iniquity. The clergy have not told the rulers and the people that, because they do not believe God's Word. Since they do not believe the Bible, they should no longer mislead the people by claiming to represent God. Do the rulers and the people still think it advantageous to have such men as their spiritual advisers ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">No nation can by the enactment of laws or by the enforcement of laws eliminate mental and moral sickness, crime or death. The only remedy for the elimination of evil and the bringing of health and happiness and life to the people is God’s remedy. Long ago God made this promise, in Genesis 22:18: Tn thy seed all the peoples and nations shall be blessed.’ Then He defines in His Word (Gal. 3:16-19) that “the seed of promise is Christ”. More than 1800 years ago God sent Christ Jesus into the world and permitted Him to be crucified that by His death and resurrection He might pay for mankind the penalty of death which was caused by Satan’s wrong-doing. Jesus repeatedly stated when on earth that in due time God would set up His kingdom by and through which He will bring blessings to the people, and that such would follow at the end of Satan’s world. The end of the world, or of Satan’s rule, has. now been reached, and God has placed Christ upon His throne; and the next great act, as the Scriptures declare, is to destroy Satan’s power. Before this is done, however, God commands that a witness shall be given to the nations and rulers of the earth. (Matt. 24:14) Jesus declared that after this witness is finished there shall then be tribulation upon the nations such as the world has never known and that it will be the last. (Matt. 24:21,22) This will destroy Satan’s rule and power and clear the field for the complete establishment of righteousness among men. The administration of God’s government will bring mental, moral and physical health and life to all wdio obey. &quot;When God’s Word so plainly sets forth the cause of sickness, crime and death, and the remedy therefor, why should any one look to imperfect men for advice?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Righteousness '</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Ten years of strenuous effort to enforce prohibition not only has failed completely, but has been accompanied by great increase of crime. For more than 6,000 years honest men have put forth laborious efforts to stop the ravages of sickness and death. All of their efforts have failed. &quot;Why longer stand idly by and listen to the abortive remedies of men? The president and his committee, aided and supported by all the money in the universe, can not bring forth or even suggest an adequate remedy for the ills of humankind. Nothing short of divine power can give the people health, mental and moral righteousness, and life, with accompanying blessings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Now God has placed His King upon His throne. By the physical facts disclosed since the beginning of the World War God has made it clear to the seekers for truth that Satan’s rule in the earth must shortly end and that it will end in the greatest battle ever fought. His judgment upon the world has come. In the language of God’s prophet Habakkuk (2:20), ‘The Lord is in His holy temple; let all the peoples of earth be silent before Him’; that is to say, let all the people heed what God’s Word has to say to them and discard all the sophistries of men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Concerning the reigning of Christ it is written: “Behold, a king shall reign in righteousness, and princes shall rule in judgment.” (Isa. 32:1) And then says the Lord through His prophet (Isa. 26:9): “When thy judgments are in the earth, the inhabitants of the world will learn righteousness.” Furthermore says the Lord (Jer. 31:33): “I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts; and will be their God, and them shall be my people.” If all the rulers today knew that such is God’s remedy, and would then follow God’s way, it would not be necessary to appoint crime commissions. The people Vvould be turning themselves to the Lord and ascertaining His instruction and preparing for the kingdom which is now at hand. If the clergy were faithfully performing their duty they would tell the rulers and the people these truths.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The people are sick and worn and weary. They are burdened with excessive taxation, with oppression and injustice, and are weighed down with disease and sorrow. They are sick in mind and sick in body, and this is true because Satan rules and has brought about this condition. The people should know the truth. With God’s righteous government in full force all men will be brought to a knowledge of the truth. Just now He is having merely a witness given, the purpose of which is to disclose to the rulers and peoples His purposes, and that those who desire at this time to seek righteousness and meekness may do so and thereby have His special favor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Do the sick and afflicted desire health? To be sure; all desire health. Is there any man or body of men able to give them their desire? Certainly not! Under the righteous reign of Christ they will obtain the truth and health, as it is written in Jeremiah 33:6: “Behold, I will bring it health and cure, and I will cure them, and will reveal unto them the abundance of peace and truth.” And further says the prophet of God (Isa. 33: 24) : “And the inhabitant shall not say, I am sick; the people that dwell therein shall be forgiven their iniquity.” When the people have been restored to health and have healthy minds and know the truth they will dwell together without doing injury to one another. Unselfishness will control their action, and putting unselfishness into operation will be the complete fulfilment of all law, as it is written (Mic. 4:3,4): “And he shall judge among many people, and rebuke strong nations afar off; and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruninghooks: nation shall not lift up a sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more. But they shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig tree; and none shall make them afraid: for the mouth of the Lord of hosts hath spoken it.” Healthy minds and healthy bodies and righteous thoughts will eliminate crime and no one will have an occasion for fear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Life</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The things performed by Jesus when on the earth the Scriptures declare foreshadow similar things that He will do on a, greater scale during His righteous reign. lie opened the eyes of the blind and healed the sick amongst a lew people. During His reign He will do this for all who will heed His advice as the great Physician. Through His prophet God foretold the suffering of humankind, then the bringing of the knowledge of the truth to mankind and the revelation of His provisions for the healing of the people. In the prophecy recorded in Job 33: 23-26 it is written that the people shall learn that Jesus Christ is their Redeemer, the Messenger of God, and the great Physician of mankind. He will show them the right way; therefore says the prophet: “Then God is gracious unto him [man], and saith, Deliver him from going down to the pit, I have found a ransom. His flesh shall be fresher than a child’s; he re-turneth to the days of his youth. He prayeth unto God, and he is favorable unto him, so that he seeth his face with joy: and he restoreth unto man his righteousness.”-Job 33: 23-26, </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">R.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">For centuries men have searched for the fountain of eternal youth that they might enjoy life and endless happiness. That great secret has ever been in the keeping of Jehovah God. But Satan has blinded most of the people from seeing that truth. God’s time has now come to reveal the truth to all men who seek it; and when Satan’s power is destroyed and his influence removed, then all the people shall learn the way to life. Death has been the result of sin. The death of the perfect man Jesus opened the way to salvation of men. In John 17:3 it is written: “This is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.” As stated in 1 Timothy 2:3-6, God first provides salvation and in His due time He brings all men to a knowledge of the truth. He therefore emphasizes the great importance of teaching the people the truth and declares His purpose of granting life everlasting to all those who heed His instruction and follow in the way of righteousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Today no people or nation offers real encouragement to the unfortunate criminal to reform and do right. When he is released from prison, if he attempts an honest vocation he is shunned and ill-treated and thereby provoked to further wrong-doing. Human remedies of reformation have all failed. God’s remedy is certain and complete. He not only will encourage, but will aid, help and bless every one who tries to do right. In proof thereof it is written in Ezekiel 18: 27, 28: “When the wicked man turn-eth away from his wickedness that he hath committed, and doeth that which is lawful and right, he shall save his soul alive. Because he con-sidereth, and turneth away from all his transgressions that he hath committed, he shall surely live, he shall not die.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The unfortunates learning that they have a true and lasting friend in the Lord, and learning the truth concerning His purposes, they will be encouraged to reformation and obedience. To those who take this course Jesus stated, in John 8:51: “If any man keep my saying, he shall never see death.” Even those who have died in cr</span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">im</span><span class="font9">e shall be awakened out of death and given an opportunity, and to these Jesus says (John 11: 26): Tie that lives and believes in me shall never die.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">God’s government under Christ will cleanse the earth of all crime, disease and unrighteousness and death itself, as it is written in 1 Corinthians 15: 25, 26: “For he must reign, till he hath put all enemies under his feet. The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">God having made promise that He -would bless all the families of the earth, that promise He -will certainly keep; and that promised blessing is an opportunity for life everlasting on the earth. This will come through the reign of Christ, -which is now beginning. Concerning the blessings that w<sup>T</sup>ill result to the people therefrom, it is written (Rev. 21:4): “God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It is with deep regret to be noted that the clergy desire man’s commendation rather than God’s approval and have been negligent of their great privileges and are unsafe advisers both to the rulers and to the people. God has made provision, however, that the people shall have an opportunity to hear the truth. He has committed this privilege to a little army of the followers of Christ who go from door to door to carry the message of truth to the people. These men and women are humble messengers of the Lord bearing testimony that Jehovah is the only true God and that His kingdom is at hand and that He will relieve the people of crime, sickness and death and bring them health and life. Amidst all the opposition to their efforts God furnishes to His anointed the needed protection, and to them He says (Isa. 51:16; 43:12): “I have put my words in thy mouth, and I have covered thee in the shadow of mine hand, that I may plant the heavens, and lay the foundations of the earth”; “therefore ye are my witnesses . . . that I am God.” Today and in the days to follow there will come to your doormen and women bringing to you the message of life, as set forth in the Word of God. These are not engaged in propaganda, but are bringing you the truth which you desire. They bring to you the message of comfort and consolation that comes through the knowledge of the Word of God. Rely not upon the advice or expressed wisdom of any man, but follow the teachings of the Word of God, and you shall receive the blessings of health and life, because God’s due time is at hand to bring these blessings to the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Stratford Minister Gets Right Idea</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">A</span><span class="font9"> STRATFORD (Ontario) minister has finally caught the right idea. Tired of the worldliness of the flock, and convinced that the mission of his church -was useless, he gave up the ministry and got himself an honest job in a factory where he can make his living like any regular man. Exemplary, indeed, that action. Probably others will follow before it is too late.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-variant:small-caps;">J</span><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">~&quot;udge Ruthereoed has thousands of letters from parties who have written him in appreciation of his great address of August 25, which appears in this issue.

<p><span class="font9">OME idea of the fertility of the British Isles, and some idea of the depressed condition of trade there, may be gathered from the fact that this year cabbages are being burned or plowed in because it does not pay to send them to market, and there is an overplus of asparagus, peas, gooseberries and young onions, so that market gardeners find no way out. Some have suicided. The trouble seems to lie in the marketing end of the business. It is being noted in England that though wholesale wheat prices are down 40% yet there has been but a very slight reduction in the price of bread.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The Queensboro Gas and Electric Company </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">By F. Stuart Barnes</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">F</span><span class="font9">OR long a subscriber to your excellent magazine, I appreciate, among other good features, its stand for justice, justice for the people. Apropos, then, of your fearless denunciation of the big public utility steals, the following incident served to show me how moderate your words have been.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A young couple, with two children (and very little else), moved from Brooklyn to East Rockaway, Long island, mainly for the sake of one of the children, who was ailing (and has since died). They hoped that the fresh air from the sea, and the good open air on Long Island, ■would prove beneficial to the little one. A few days before moving, they wrote the local gas and light company (the Queensborough Gas and Electric Company), asking that the required meters be connected. Imagine the surprise and dismay of this young couple when they received a letter from this band of robbers demanding that $30 be deposited with them before the meters could be connected. After a delay of two days they managed to borrow the money from a friend. This meant no gas or light for Evo days. They were able later to repay the loan to their friend.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A few months after this, a family, related to the above, also moved to this locality. The same situation arose, and were it not for the assistance of their relatives, who already had had to put up $30 to show they were honest, this second family would have been in a difficulty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Imagine! These people have had to deposit $60 with these crooks, just for the privilege of being robbed by them (at the rate of ten cents a kilowatt-hour) every day of the week for the supply of one of life’s necessities, and all because the poor Queensborough Gas and Electric Company can not trust these folks and their relatives to discharge their debts honorably.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Or is it (unkind thought!) that this company, with its monopoly on the supply of one of life’s needs, has found in this method a nice little scheme for increasing their capital resources to further their nefarious plans in obtaining a stranglehold on the supply of gas and electricity? I have at my disposal ample proof that current could be supplied at less than half what is charged, and then at a substantial profit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">One almost wonders just how long hence it will be before we buy the air we breathe, at so much a cubic foot! I only hope I am not living in the Queensborough Gas and Electric Company’s territory then.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">However, I am glad to know that the new kingdom of Messiah, very soon to be established, will be one in which all are to have a chance, and ivhen the God-given blessings of the earth will no longer be controlled by these mighty bands of thieves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">&amp; #</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">No doubt the thieves above named are doing all their stealing legally, which makes the whole situation ten times worse. In comparison, a highwayman is a man of courage and honor, since he does, supposedly, give his victim at least a chance. These fellows give him none at all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We can previse this day of taxing the air wo breathe. First would be a series of “scientific” articles in the simian press, pointing out that the breathable air of the world is being rapidly exhausted. Then would come the announcement of the great discovery of a method of revivifying it. This would be the proper place for legislators to decide, at so much per, to give one of the great public utility companies the privilege of purifying the air over a certain district and making it legally breathable. The brethren in the ministry would then take up the refrain and descant upon how good their particular god has been to give them such great men. Then the doctors would set forth that without this new invention nobody could live. And the courts would decide that protection of property rights involved would make it necessary for each man to pay an atmospheric utility charge in proportion to the number of persons in his family. This would place the heaviest burdens upon the poor, which, of course, arguing from the instance above brought to our attention, would certainly bo good business.—</span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Editor.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">Mere About the Last Ice Age </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">By G. 8. Hynes</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">L</span><span class="font9"> AST night’s paper contained a news item concerning the finding of two human skulls (or parts of skulls) in a cave at Bishop Cap Peak, Neve Mexico, along with the claws and a vertebra of the extinct ground-sloth. The professor in charge of these relics estimates age of the skulls at 50,000 years (a very reasonable estimate from the geological standpoint). These are believed to be the most ancient human remains so far found, according to scientists, for the ground-sloth perished before the “last ice age”. The remains were located about 28 feet below the surface.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">I merely mention this find for the purpose of introducing what follows. You realize, of course, as every other reasonable person, that the facts of geology will agree with the Biblical account, if the Bible is in truth the Word of God. We believe that it is.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">As to the guesses of geologists relative to time, it is not necessary that any thinking person pay attention to this feature of their work. They differ too much among themselves for any credence to be placed therein.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Yow, first of all, let us look backward to the “last ice age”. The evidences of this great catastrophe cover the globe. In America we find that Long Island itself is the terminal moraine of a great ice river which once covered much of the New England states. All over this territory are evidences in the shape of huge, isolated, boulders scattered over the countryside by the melting of the ice sheet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">When the Pilgrim Fathers landed in New England they found the ground covered with rocks of varying sizes. In order to till the soil it was first necessary to remove these rocks, and since they came in handy for fences, the task was not so fruitless as at first appeared.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Since Agassiz brought forward the ice age theory, in 1840, indisputable evidences of its truth have been found everywhere, so that today we are positive of the fact that this old world is still emerging from 'he setback it received millenniums ago.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Authorities vary in their estimates as to when the last ice age occurred. Mills, in his “Romance of Geology”, makes a guess of one million.years. Parts of the old ice caps still remain in Greenland and over all the Antarctic continent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">But what caused the ice age? Professor Shaler, of Harvard, in his book’, “Nature and Man in America,” offers the two most generally favored hypotheses: (1) the elevation of mountain ranges coupled with changes in ocean currents and an increase in rainfall in regions affected; (2) that of Croll, which advocates as am explanation of glacial periods a great eccentricity of the earth’s orbit and a consequent change in the character of the seasons which occur when the orbit is thus eccentric. Both of these hypotheses fail to account for the facts which are now known concerning conditions just before the ice age. Let me quote from Mills, the “Romance of Geology”:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Apparently there was continuous land for thousands of miles north and south (of Nevada), and as various kinds of plants scattered over this area show like growths, and as they are without either </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">growth rings</span><span class="font7"> or </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">annual rings,,</span><span class="font7"> these fossils record that the earth in those times was without zones or seasons. . . . Since the days of Florissant (a fossil lake in Nevada buried beneath volcanic ashen showers just before the ice age) the climate has changed, and plants and animals have adjusted themselves to zones. The fossils show that there were luxuriant forests far north of the farthest present tree growth. Southern Europe was tropical and there were palms with appropriate animals and other life in northern Europe. . . . There were sequoia forests, during Florissant times over the greater part of the earth—in Canada and Alaska, Greenland and Spitzbcrgen. [And also the Antarctic continent.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In view of the above facts cited by one of the keenest geological observers in this country, where can we find any basis for either of the two hypotheses advanced by Professor Shaler? Instead of changes of seasons due to eccentricity of the earth’s orbit, we find no seasonal changes at all, but instead a mild, salubrious climate general over all the surface of the planet, even to the poles, unvarying to any noticeable extent tlie year around. And would it not be more reasonable to believe that the ice age itself was the cause of mountain elevation, changing of ocean currents and increased rainfall than that all these variations in conditions could take place without known cause? Why put the cart before the horse? The Bible gives us the following picture of conditions on earth before the Deluge:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9">1. Climate warm and moderately dry, as evidenced by the fact that our first parents, though probably living on a well-wooded and well-</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">watered plateau, were perfectly comfortable the year around without clothing.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9">2. No rain; a mist condensed at night and watered the ground. There was not enough moisture at that time for garden crops. This is plainly stated. (Gen. 2: 5, 6) Irrigation would have been necessary in order to grow grains and vegetables. The Garden, in the east of Eden, was a well-watered spot.—Gen. 2:10.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">3. No storms. Winds are due to different temperatures here and there near the surface of the earth. Such changes of temperature would produce wind and rain. There was no rain, as plainly stated in the record and also proven by the fact that no' rainbow was visible until after the Flood.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">4. Conditions were extremely favorable for life, both human and animal, as is shown by the ages attained by the antediluvians.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">The above facts fit in very well with Mills’ account of conditions in North America at the t</span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">im</span><span class="font9">e Lake Florissant was overwhelmed by volcanic ashen deposits. I quote:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">. Fossil reports show that the climate of the whole world grew cooler and dryer during the Miocene epoch.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">These conditions ceased with the Flood. Thereafter conditions approximating the present prevailed over all the earth. Many people seem to think that the Flood was a result of abnormal rainfall. Such would have been impossible. In the first place we had, prior to the Deluge, atmospheric conditions which evidently precluded rainfall. Secondly, it has been the experience of man for at least 4,000 years that the sun does not lift sufficient water vapor to cause such a world-wide catastrophe as the Flood, and if it did would not all this water have drained the seas, the rivers and the lakes to such an extent that they could very easily have reabsorbed it as fast as it fell? There is no theory which fits the case in all its aspects except that advanced by Professor Vail years ago (and promptly rejected by the Aviso ones of this world), to wit, the fall of a watery canopy, designated in Scripture as “the great deep”. This canopy had spread out over the heavens-during the sixth day of Creation and had equalized the climate over all the earth. Man was created toAvards the close of this sixth day, or as the geologists would say, betAveen the last two ice ages. The geological evidences of this fact are indisputable. Hence we are forced to the conclusion, all the scientists to the contrary notwithstanding, that the Deluge was the last ice age. And since the Bible record, as well as legends of nearly all races, note the Flood as having taken place within the history of mankind, we are likeAvise forced to conclude that the last ice age is very recent. It could not have occurred more than some 4,400 years ago.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Now let us go to Professor Mills again to find some further facts which tend to substantiate the Bible story of the flood and Noah’s connection therewith:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The varied and extensive remains of fossil animals that flourished on this continent (North America) before the last ice age shows that there occurred an extensive extinction of animals Avhich probably was caused by the conditions of the glacial period. Among the species which perished were two large specimens of the cat family; four species of bears; t\vo species of the sea-cow; six species of horse; the existing South American tapir; wild dogs; a species of llama; a camel; two species of bison; three species of sheep; tAVO species of elephants and tAvo of mastodons; a </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">large, sloth as large as a rhinoceros. The horses, camels and elephants which lived in North America before the Glacial Period were found afterwards only in the Old World.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Speaking of wild life which existed in America before the ice age, Mills says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Many kinds of animals which we noAv have in America were in existence here at that time, and numerous other kinds Avhich we do not noAv possess. Giant beaA<sup>r</sup>er fed on the bark of aspens and cotton-Avood. Horses, elephants and Avild cattle grazed; bears and lions prowled and groevled and roared. The American mastodon was abundant in the forested regions. The Siberian mammoth migrated by way of Alaska and was abundant all across the northern United States to the Atlantic coast. The Columbian elephant, which attained a height of 11 feet, and the huge Imperial elephant, more than 13 feet in height, roamed from the Pacific to the Mississippi. Tapirs were not uncommon in the forested regions as far north as Pennsylvania. Ground sloths migrated from South America and Avere very abundant in the forests east of the Mississippi. Birds were numerous, and hundreds of species then in existence arc Avith us today without noticeable change.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">From the geological records it is evident that many species of animals were not preserved by Noah and his sons. And it is not presumptuous in us to assume, therefore, that God in His wisdom decreed their destruction for the benefit of the human race.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Among those destroyed were monstrous birds, the mammoth, the ground-sloth, the sabre-’toothed tiger, the cave-bear, and many other ferocious beasts. I think it is clear that some strange power is evident in the preservation of those animals which remain on earth. Were they more fit to survive than those that perished? It would hardly seem reasonable to believe so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">And why should the Old World be the seat of both human and animal life since the Deluge? Is it reasonable to suppose that conditions were so much more unfavorable for animal life after the catastrophe that it was impossible for the horse, the camel, the elephant and other animals to exist in North and South America and yet have found it easy to survive in the Old World? The ice cap in the Americas did not extend farther south than the Ohio River in the east. West of the Mississippi it touched comparatively little United States territory. Geologists are undecided as to the correct answer to these questions. But if is certain that parts of both North and South America were habitable, not only for animals, but for man himself immediately after the ice age.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">If it be conceded that practically all the land surface of the globe was interconnected before the last ice age (and this is known to have been so), then the latest find of h</span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">um</span><span class="font9">an remains in New Mexico offers no puzzle to the Bible student.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Satisfied as we are that “the Flood” and “the great ice age” are synonymous terms for the great catastrophe which overwhelmed the “world that then was”, and with positive proof that the ground-sloth and other extinct animals existed prior to the Flood, we merely marvel at the courage and energy of the few thousands of human beings who inhabited the world in those days.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Some Facts About Scotland </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">By J. Nicholson, Colporteur</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">W</span><span class="font9">ITHIN 40 miles north and west of the city of Glasgow, and continuing northward to the Pentland Firth, a distance of over three hundred miles, lie the western highlands and islands of Scotland. This district is composed of wild mountainous country, broken up and penetrated by firths and lochs, similar to the fjords of Norway, and also a group of islands known as the Hebrides, which skirt the mainland like a huge breakwater.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The district is recognized as the most beautiful in the British Isles, and in fact many who have toured the whole world give it a place among earth’s leading beauty spots. To the casual tourist who may be fortunate enough to visit these parts, everything seems like a paradise; and indeed many are the songs of praise which have echoed amidst the lonely hills and valleys. Here there appears to be no struggle of the masses against the present selfish social order. Here, it appears, is ‘nothing to hurt or destroy’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">■What are the facts? Are things actually as they appear to be? The answering of these questions according to the facts as they exist reveals that conditions for the people here are certainly not what they appear to be; and not only so, but that conditions are even worse than that experienced by the industrial toilers in the great cities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A few dukes and lords own practically all the land. Most of the population are employed by the dukes, or are dependent on them for their living. The employees of these landowners work and toil in most cases for twelve hours a day, and are well paid if they receive one pound sterling a week. Of course it is such an honor (?) to serve nobility that wages do not enter into the question at all! These honored employees dare not even hold a political opinion that conflicts with that of their master. If the duke is a Tory, then his servants must also be Tories. Thus they are forced to support the very system’ that is the cause of their oppression.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The population is very sparse, and thousands are leaving for the cities, Canada, America, Australia, etc., every month. Why do not the people stay and cultivate the land, one may ask? They are not allowed to do so. Why? Because the dukes who own the land use it for rearing deer, etc., so that when the shooting season comes along, the castle and grounds may be let to some American millionaire or Indian maharajah who is willing to pay thousands of pounds for a little “sport”. There is one part of Scotland where a foreign millionaire owns the land from North Sea to Atlantic Ocean, and the only Scots who live there are estate workers. Thus the people who by right inherit the land are pushed off, to make way for men who have nothing to do but shoot at tame animals!</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">These landowners discourage tourist traffic because it affects their own selfish interests. They forbid estate workers to house holidaymakers. They are responsible for keeping the roads in such a condition that motorists who have any respect for their cars will not motor through the western highlands. They refuse to allow bridges to be built over the narrow parts of the lochs, so that a motorist must pay twelve shillings to take his car 25 yards by ferry to the other side or else motor 60 miles round the loch. One duke who never works is paid twelve shillings for every motorist who wishes to cross his (?) loch.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">These “noble” dukes are further responsible for the maintenance of a privately owned shipping company, which has the monoply for ail the western isles. This shipping company’s passenger fares are five times higher than the fares charged in any other part of the British Isles, and their passenger steamers would put a Clyde coal-boat to shame.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">These facts prove beyond a doubt that this part of “bonnie Scotland” is in a condition of absolute slavery and that a few ultraselfish men who are honored and respected by the rest of the people of Great Britain are the cause of such a condition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">At a time not very long ago western Scotland had a thriving population who lived by tilling the soil. Official figures show that the population has been reduced one-sixth in less than a hundred years. It would be of interest at this point to tell how the present reign of tyranny began, and how the respected “nobility” came by the land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">According to history the forefathers of these “noble families” of Scotland landed in Britain with William the Conqueror. Their power was great and their wish was as law. Seeing the possibilities before them of owning the land and ruling as kings without hindrance, they determined to rid the land of its original inhabitants. To accomplish this end they resorted to some of the most devilish and fiendish methods that fallen man has ever been capable of. In most instances they approached the people and gave them notice to clear from the land within a specified time. The people were warned that if they failed to clear out within the time specified, they would be burned out of their homes. Many of the crofters took this as an idle threat and remained in their homes as usual; but the fateful day dawned and it was clearly seen that the threat was not an idle one. Men in the employ of the dukes approached the crofts with blazing torches in hand and proceeded to set fire to the houses. Soon everything was ablaze. Old men and sick women were trapped and burned to death, while thousands of others perished through cold and hunger. This awful procedure was carried on for years all over western Scotland until but few of the population remained.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Recently the writer of this article visited an island among the Hebrides. On this island is a church with accommodation for a thousand people. The land has a population of only twenty-two souls. The clergyman on the isle was asked the reason for the erecting of so large a building when there were only twenty-two persons who could attend church. His reply was to the effect that at one time the island contained nine hundred persons. The burning-out process took place and the result was only five families were left.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">These are facts which never appear in the standard works of history, nor yet in the great newspapers, which are supposed to supply the people with the truth. We are glad that there exists such a paper as </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age,</span><span class="font9"> which without the fear of men can give the people truth, unbiased.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Exiled 142 Years</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">N</span><span class="font9">INE hundred Swedes whose forefathers were exiled to the southern part of Russia one hundred and forty-two years ago have now returned to the land of their fathers amidst great rejoicing not only on their own part but on the part of the Swedish people generally.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">They had maintained their own language and lived apart from the Russian people during the entire time of their stay. The trains bearing these colonists back to their own land attracted much attention as they passed through Europe en route home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Coffee Poisoning by Aluminum </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">By Chas. T. Betts</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">C</span><span class="font9">OFFEE as a beverage was used for over a hundred years before the installation of aluminum coffee-pots and percolators in the American kitchens. This beverage became the leading one of America and was universally used, similarly to tea. Shortly after the introduction of the metal aluminum in the making of coffee, it was noted that a vast number of persons were affected with stomach distress, after the drinking of the beverage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Coffee was commonly called a stimulant : it produced a rapid pulse and a certain disturbance of the gastric organs, often to such an extent that it was discontinued entirely in many thousands of homes. No one suspected that our beautiful shiny aluminum baskets in percolators and aluminum coffee-pots had anything to do with the cause of this condition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It was naturally suspected, owing to the fact that stomach distress usually occurred after drinking coffee, that the coffee &quot;was the offending agent which was producing the gastric disturbance or poisoning to the body. Various persons then became financially interested in the manufacture of substitutes made of grains or cereals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">During the recent twenty years, the manufacture and sale of the various substitutes for coffee has been so great that the coffee producers evidently became alarmed at the great loss in their business. In fact it was a matter of general interest why the American public was being poisoned by the drinking of coffee.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The National Coffee Roasters Association suspected that there might be some physiological action of the metal used in connection with the making of coffee. It seemed impossible that the prevalent poisoning could come from this new aluminum utensil, yet it was a possibility. They ordered a thorough examination made, to determine how to make a perfect cup of coffee, in other words, one that would not be poisonous.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A decision was reached to employ The Massachusetts Institute of Technology, at Cambridge, the highest scientific seat of learning in America, to make the examination and to determine the facts. The examination was conducted under the leadership of Prof. S. C. Prescott, the distinguished head of the Department of Biology and Public Health of this institution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">All types of cooking apparatus were used in the examination. A score of persons gave their opinions as to the taste, etc., of coffee made in various containers. Three years of time and $30,000 were used to complete the examination.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The results obtained, under the direction of Professor Prescott, were published in many of our leading newspapers, Sunday, January 20, 1929. The writer will quote the professor’s statements, given in the Chicago </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Herald Examiner .<a name="footnote1"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark52">1</a></sup> ■</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Aluminum coffee-pots are in general use, along with percolators containing the aluminum baskets, and can be found in almost every kitchen in America.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">During the three years of experimenting, careful attention was directed not only to the coffee but also to the water, heat and all varieties of coffee-pots. And thus Professor Prescott is able </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">to warn the public</span><span class="font7"> that </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">metal coffee pots</span><span class="font7"> in such common use throughout the kitchens of the world can never produce a perfect cup of coffee.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The writer well remembers that before aluminum coffee-pots were generally used, only 10c and 12c coffees were mostly available, which included such favorite brands as “Lion” and “Arbuckles”. Today a vast number of very expensive brands are available, yet with all the care in the preparation of making coffee, we often have a serious physiological action from dri</span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">nk</span><span class="font9">ing the beverage, regardless of the brand used.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Much of the blame for a bad cup of coffee usually has been attributed to “poor coffee”. Cooks and housewives are constantly changing from one brand of coffee to another. But Professor Prescott has discovered that almost any grade of coffee-bean, if treated correctly, can be made into a “good” cup of coffee. . . . And this discovery undoubtedly will be hailed with, joy by thousands of such unfortunates—volunteers from the ranks of those who love coffee but who for long have believed themselves unable to indulge themselves because coffee has not agreed with their systems, proved in scientific tests sponsored bj<sup>r</sup> Professor Prescott that fresh coffee, prepared properly, leaves no ill effects on such type of person, or, in fact, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">any</span><span class="font7"> type of individual.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Now what has the professor found to cause a condition, as mentioned above, that makes the coffee poisonous? No one can doubt that the most scientific tests were made by Professor</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Prescott and his assistants, who, with great care, determined the facts pertaining to the making of coffee. Following are the statements showing the principal cause of why coffee has physiological effects, quoted from the article named above.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Professor Prescott suspects that after making coffee in a metal container, there is a certain </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">corrosion</span><span class="font7"> remaining inside the pot which goes into the next brew, producing a form of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“metal-coffee poisoning”. . . . </span><span class="font7">For the ordinary coffee percolator Professor Prescott has nothing but scorn. The ordinary percolator, for one thing, is made of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">metal (aluminum),</span><span class="font7"> and for another, it is necessary that the water be boiled before it is conveyed upward to trickle down through the coffee. '</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Aluminum possesses a property known as high activity. Volumes of electrons are produced under heat from this metal, which permeate food substances prepared in or with the metal. This gives what is known as a </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">metallic </span><span class="font9">taste. The professor noted this action and makes special reference to it. In describing it, ho states that the taste is </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">metallic, bitter, disagreeable or puckery.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Chief faults of ordinary </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">metal-brewed</span><span class="font7"> coffee are that there inevitably is a </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">metallic</span><span class="font7"> taste, and the most delicate and valuable aromas and flavors are passed off as a result of the boiling. . . . Professor Prescott reveals further that coffee brewed in </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">metal</span><span class="font7"> vessels was described by his “subjects” as tasting “metallic”, “bitter,” “disagreeable” or “puckery”. On the contrary, coffee brewed in </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">glass</span><span class="font7"> utensils was declared to be rich and smooth and decidedly pleasant. . . . None of those who tasted and drank of the variously prepared cups of coffee knew what method of preparation had been used. They were requested to merely state their preference and give a reason not only for preferring one sample but for having distaste for another. ... In the experiments every known type of coffee-pot was used—enamel, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">aluminum,</span><span class="font7"> earthenware and glass—but the verdicts were all for the coffee brewed in glass, with earthenware running second. . . . Out of Professor Prescott’s long experiments two principal directions for the making of a “good cup of coffee” must, be drawn by the housewife. She first must use a </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">non-metallic</span><span class="font7"> coffeepot, and then she must draw the flavor and aroma of the coffee out of the freshly ground bean by passing’ through water just under the boiling point.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It has recently been stated by manufacturers of aluminum kitchenware, and also by the American Medical Association, </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Scientific American,</span><span class="font9"> and numerous lay publications, that there is no scientific evidence available to show that aluminum utensils are in any way the cause of the great prevalence of gastric disturbance among our people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In answer to the above, the writer submits this article as proof that aluminum is not a fit utensil to use for cooking purposes, especially the brewing of coffee. When men in high scientific station, as Professor Prescott, make an examination of these utensils, covering a period of three years, and give the scientific data above quoted, it is high time that various publishers, writers upon health topics, medical journals, and the lay press </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">give these truths</span><span class="font9"> to their constituents, instead of putting on a campaign to protect aluminum or to give it a clean bill of health.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Britain’s Stuffed Diplodocus</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">rpHE prehistoric Diplodocus was a mild-tem--<sup>6</sup>- pered pet eighty-four feet in length that made his living eating the tops off from trees. If one of them stepped on a person, he did not need the services of a doctor, nor a funeral director, nor even a grave-digger. The whole thing was finished at one time. ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Beaders will be surprised to know that Britain now has a Diplodocus that is partly alive. It has some life from the neck down, but above that is stuffed solid with antiques. It can still talk, the same as a phonograph, but everything above the ears has become solid marble.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It will be observed that this name might be pronounced Dip-low’-dough-cuss; and it may be inferred that any cuss that dips real low for his dough is entitled to the proud honor of the family name. In this instance the full name and title is the Bight Reverend John Harold Greig, bishop of Guilford, D—D-cuss.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The bishop has just delivered himself of a sermon at Epsom Domis. It was preached at the Derby race course. It was about horses and about the Derby, and it was preached on Sunday and at the race course itself. There was an altar, and more clergy and a large choir, and a good audience of race track touts and rich people who have no honest means of livelihood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The sermon came through all right. Many</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">of the race track bums were comforted to know that they w<sup>T</sup>ere in the right line of work, and the rich and idle hangers-on felt that they had made a good investment in having the bishop duly stuffed with poppycock at Oxford so that he could be a Diplodocus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Do We Peddle Religion?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">rpO BEGIN with, the average church member today looks upon religion in general and Christianity in particular as a luxury and not as a necessity. It doesn’t take any particular amount of brains or any extraordinary display of salesmanship for the grocery clerk to sell a loaf of bread or a bag of salt. The customer is convinced of the need of those articles, and he therefore comes to the store and purchases without persuasion. It is a far more difficult task for the peddler of religion to induce that same average individual to become convinced that he needs what the church ought to supply, and that therefore he ought to support the church and sign on the dotted line of a pledgecard for a year’s subscription.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Due to this attitude on the part of ths laity to discount religion as a luxury and to overemphasize the material as opposed to the spiritual, those in authority who sit as members of chief councils, conferences, synods, boards, and presbyteries have seen fit to inaugurate a program of expansion for the church. We have therefore the Forward Movement, the Nation Wide Campaign, and similar plans appearing in every denomination. These movements were evolved in the brains of eminent laymen who have attained financial success in the business world and are invariably to be found at the heads of general committees, councils, official boards, synods, conferences, and other major church bodies. It was in the minds of these commercial magnates that the idea was conceived to carry the methods and modus operand! of big business into the church. Financially the idea may or may not be sound, but spiritually it leaves much to be desired.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Now the gentlemen of the clergy have always been the minions and at the mercy of these “big guns” at the head of things. It behooves them so to be, whether “major” or “minor” prophets, for thereon doth hang the bread-ticket. So that it was -without much opposition on the part of the bishops, presiding elders, moderators, or</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">By Bev. W. Mervin Elliot </span><span class="font9">synod presidents that these plans carried and were put into effect. In consequence, organizations were effected, programs arranged, departments established, new offices created and appointments made to fill them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">By some curious quirk of circumstance or intentions, it was found advisable in creating this super-organization and in making the necessary appointments that they should not be made upon the basis of qualification or competency but that there should be introduced a system of political wire-pulling and intrigue. The man with the biggest pull got the softest job with the largest salary. Accordingly only those men were placed in appointment who had influence with those at the top and would naturally fit into the machine. This by way of building an efficient organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Now that the machine has been set up let us see how it functions. The man of big business at the head calls a meeting of the organization, and there he persuades the brethren at the heads of the various dioceses, classes, conferences, presbyteries, or synods that the real need of the church </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">is not greater spirituality but more money.</span><span class="font9"> So the brethren of the cloth agree (they have to, for remember thereon doth hang the bread-ticket), and promise to go back home and pass the word along to the “minor” prophets. So every one declares that he has had a rousing spiritual time, and the meeting adjourns by singing “The Church’s One Foundation,” or “Praise God from Whom All Blessings Flow.” The real and actual “foundation” or “blessing” has of course sole and particular reference to the good old E Pluribus Unum.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Well, the “major” prophets go back home, and shortly the “minor” prophets are the happy recipients of a form letter from the executive secretary or treasurer stating that the spirituality of the church is at low ebb and Christianity will presently go to the bow-wows unless a barrier of good honest shekels can be thrown into the breach to stem the tide of immorality</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">and general cussedness which threatens to overwhelm the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">An</span><span class="font9">d so the &quot;minor” prophets get to work pronto, are metamorphosed for the time being into clerici publicanii, and begin to collect tithes of “mint, anise, and cumin” while the weightier matters of spiritual guidance are forgotten.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The methods of these reverend gentlemen to attain their ends are sometimes very ridiculous and range in scope from genteel beggary to high-handed pickpocketing and even to the milder forms of blackmail. “Anything to get the money” thus becomes their motto. It’s either get the money or get a new job with them. And needless to say most of them get the money.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Congregations thus quite naturally are led to pick as their spiritual leaders those of the clergy who are specialists in the art of “painless exextraction.” That is to say, the old-fashioned preacher who combined oratorical ability with pastoral oversight of his flock is quite passe. The modern church in its onward march to Zion no longer has use for his doctrinal treatises on hell, angels, salvation, baptism, and the Lord’s Supper. What is wanted today is the “go-getter” whose talk of efficiency, organization and business methods and finance scintillates with witticisms conceived to put everybody in good humor and loosen the purse strings at collection time. Anything in the nature of an old-fashioned heart appeal calculated to convict of sin and convert to righteousness is strictly taboo.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Church members want to be bamboozled, and the pulpiteer who concocts the best anesthetic and does the job in the most painless, businesslike manner is the fellow who gets the soft job with the salary running well into five figures. </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The organization sees to that.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Over-organization and commercialism are slowly but nevertheless surely strangling religion.</span><span class="font9"> But try to tell this to those in the “ring” at the head. They’ll probably tell you to “tell it to the marines.” Yet, who is it, I ask you, that gets the soft job with the fat pickings? Is it the young man who enters the pulpit with zeal and enthusiasm to save the souls of his fellows by preaching the unvarnished, converting gospel of Repentance unto Salvation through the blood of Christ? No, sir. Not by a jugful! It’s the fellow who falls in with the ruling gang and becomes a willing instrument in the hands of an unscrupulous set of money-jugglers and shekel-grabbers who wear their collars buttoned behind. He is labeled as a bright star in the ecclesiastical firmament, while the other is forced to become either a clerical rolling stone or is given a small parish where his old-fashioned religion and antiquated ideas won’t matter much.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">To underpay the clergy, to “heckle” him for funds to “feed the kitty,” to threaten and browbeat him into becoming a partner in the colossal scheme of gathering dollars to satiate the bloody maw of this monstrous vampire of Commercialism during his useful years, and then when he is worn out and broken in spirit and health to make him dependent on the miserable pittance of his own sacrificed ideals and shattered convictions, is rather an elegant gesture worthy only of those who are at the head of the church and therefore in authority.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The result of this condition is a false standard which has </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font9"> two-fold aspect. </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">In the first place,</span><span class="font9"> the average church-member does not feel that he has need of what the church is offering to supply. The minister finds himself, therefore, much in the position of the blind man who comes to the back door peddling needles. The housewife buys the needles and pays twice the regular price, not because they are wmrth it nor yet because she particularly feels the need of them, but to help the poor fellow along.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">And </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">in the second place,</span><span class="font9"> the clergy are either such a parcel of dolts and dunderheads that they cannot perceive the state of affairs, or else they are wilful connivers in a scheme to palrn off on their congregations a commodity of no practical value, and of which they know their congregations feel not the slightest need. The majority of church members buy what the parsons are selling.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Peddling religion? Well, I guess! Just that and no more. What the clergy are really doing is selling the people a concentrated form of super-commercialism, with here and there a little religion smeared over the top. Just enough, so to speak, to camouflage the real sale.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">I have found that most churches today would have little or no trouble in supporting themselves locally and in laying aside considerable sums for the promotion of missionary impulses. It’s the drain of big organization that causes the trouble. The support the leeches suck from the body of religion constitutes the big item. Offices furnished in elegance, high-salaried nabobs, unnecessary clerks and stenographers, printing, postage, traveling expenses, dinners, useless conventions and meetings which the &quot;major” prophets attend and which are but gigantic jamborees where the clerics find nothing to do but court wealthy patrons, stomach trouble and gout.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Singing the Kingdom Song in Southwest Africa<a name="footnote2"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark53">2</a></sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Windhoek, S. W. Africa, July 18, 1929 Dear Judge Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">When I was asked by our office a few weeks ago to tell you some of my experiences here in S. W. A. I was reluctant to do so, for more reasons than one; but my recent experiences have made me change my mind (a woman’s prerogative!) and I feel constrained to do so, for two reasons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">First, as a testimony to the eternal honor and glory of the name of Jehovah. Words and time entirely fail me to express my gratitude to the Lord for His manifold and unfailing goodness and His constant and peculiar care over His people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">After more than nine years of privileged service as a colporteur I have come to the conclusion that if this is not the Lord’s work and His truth, then He is doing no work in the earth today and there is no truth either. If any of the brethren have any doubts on this score let them join the “volunteer corps” of the Lord, and especially the colporteur section of the army, and very soon as a result of their personal experiences and ever-increasing evidences they’ll say, ‘It is the Lord’s work, and it is marvelous in our eyes.’ In proof of this, and only as one instance in similar daily experiences when one waits upon the Lord, I want to relate the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A few days ago I had to decide about giving the witness in a village 150 miles away from here. I had no one to consult but the Lord, and the decision had to be made when I was feeling very tired, so much so that I was obliged to rest the greater part of the previous week. Under these circumstances I had practically decided that I was justified in leaving it out. But the idea worried me and I had a suspicion that I was studying the flesh. (It meant being in a post motor bus from.9: 30 a.m. until 10: 30 p.m. at least. On paved roads, traveling by this means is trying after a couple of hours, and how much more so a whole day on the S.W.A. roads.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Unconsciously almost, the cost of getting there, the fare alone being £4-10, was affecting my decision, as well as the fact of being hung up in a small village of about eighteen homes for more than a week on account of the infrequent postal service. However, after making it a matter of earnest prayer it became clear to me that I should go in spite of all the odds against my doing so, and leaving the arrangements and the responsibility to the Lord, this is how lie arranged it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">There were too many passengers for the bus; so three of us were taken in a six-cylinder Pontiac Sedan most comfortably upholstered and arrived at our destination at 6: 30 p.m., i.e., about four hours before schedule time. On the way I witnessed to my fellow passengers, a German lady taking </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Harp, Deliverance</span><span class="font9"> and </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Creation</span><span class="font9"> in German, the man an Afrikaans </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Harp</span><span class="font9"> and a </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Deliverance,:,</span><span class="font9"> and the driver and his brother jointly ten books.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The driver also volunteered to wait for me until the following afternoon. At 5: 30 p.m. he was waiting to tie up my boxes, the place was canvassed, and 157 books were left behind as a permanent witness of the incoming kingdom. At 11:30 that night I hopped off again at a small siding, the terminus of a new railway line in construction to this village. Although the postman had forgotten to put off my cartons of books, I had samples in my attache case and canvassed this place too’ the following morning, selling 55 books.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The same afternoon I caught a goods train with a coach attached back here. Instead of being away for a week, I was back on the third day, having traveled 300 miles, canvassed approximately 32 people, and sold 212 books to the value of £17-10-6, leaving me a balance in my favor of at least £3. What is more, I was less tired than when. I started out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Another instance: About a month ago, just before coming here to Windhoek, the capital of S.W.A., I was approached by the police for a license. Inwardly I was dead-scared, having visions of being hauled before court; but complete reliance and confidence in the Lord again carried the day. Outwardly I treated the matter with apparent contempt and indifference and, besides handing them a letter which I hold from the office authorizing me to sell their books, made no further explanation or any comments, but carried on as usual. (I have learned that while I mind the Lord’s business I can implicitly trust Him to mind mine.) The following day I met the head .of the police in the street and asked him please to return my letter, as I was leaving the next day. He promised to send it to my address, and also informed me that he had consulted the attorney-general here about my having a license but that he had had no reply yet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">On arriving here I at first thought of putting my case before the worthy gentleman myself, but on second thought decided to take no notice; if they want to know more about my doings they can make the first move and come to me. Instead, I took the bull by the horns and made the police station my first point of attack, starting with the major and ending up with the recruits. I had the most thrilling experience there that I’ve ever had in all my colporteuring experiences. The heads were most kind and helpful and gathered the men from far and near into one room. At times it almost seemed like violating Paul’s injunction that a woman should not speak publicly, but their eager faces showed that they were enjoying the kingdom message. I was delighted to tell it out, and the books were going out thick and fast, and so it was a mutually happy arrangement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">I may say that as a rule I’m rather cautious and feel my way as regards letting my prospective buyers know the attitude of the parsons toward the message, but on this occasion I slashed out right from the start with almost a unanimous chorus of assents and nodding approval all round me. By lunch time I had orders for 13 sets of 12 each, in all 221 books at the barracks alone. After lunch they sent a messenger with, brown paper to come and fetch the different parcels. A mutual friendly and helpful relationship was created between the police and myself, and I have heard no more about a license since.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In the afternoon I made about five more calls, bringing my total for the day up to 261 books, 16 complete sets and 30 booklets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Secondly, would I put this on record that your own joy may be increased. I know the burden of the work must weigh very heavily on you at times, dear brother, and in addition to this you have to contend with false accusations and suspicions hurled at you from false brethren. When I think of this I wish with all my heart you could feel and know our appreciation of you for your fearless exposure of the Devil’s organization, and your untiring effort to encourage the Lord’s people to fulfil their vows, and our gratitude for the unequaled peace and joy we experience in response to your appeal. Not only have you opened new avenues of joy and happiness to the people of God, but many hearts and homes of order-loving people have been illuminated with renewed hopes in the happy anticipation and participation in the kingdom blessings soon to come. Even in this remote land where no witness has been given yet, except the posting of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The. Peoples Friend</span><span class="font9"> to various addresses, I have been surprised to hear the many expressions of appreciation and the lighting up of faces when they hear of “Judge Rutherford’s books”. I find your lecture has been read by many and has undoubtedly prepared the ground for the almost abnormal sales I’ve had in some parts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Practically the only dissenting parties I came across were a Dutch Reformed parson (and we know his reasons why!) and a Britisher whose dignity and patriotism wouldn’t allow him to read anything again that you may ever have to write, after calling London the seat of the beast!! At Tsumeb, for instance, a distance of about 1,800 miles from Capetown, I sold 46 books and booklets to two persons in one office as a direct result of one of them having read the booklet; and so I could quote ad infinitum.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The time will come, and is not far distant now, when, like our Lord and Master, you and the faithful remnant will see ‘of the travail of their soul and be satisfied’. In conclusion, and just to give you an idea of the vastness of this country and its sparsely populated areas, I would like to tell you that since the 14th of April I have traveled close on 3,000 miles, visited 16 towns and villages and stations, made approximately 1,440 calls, worked 51 days, and sold 4,216 books and booklets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">We love you as a zealous and faithful servant of the Lord and pray that the Lord will guide your mind and keep your heart with all diligence, so that you may continue to extol the name of Jehovah in the earth, and also to feed and encourage His people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">With warm love in the Lord,</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Your colaborer in the Kingdom service, Lenie Theron.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Bible Question and Answer</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19290918_files/g_E_19290918-14.png" alt="" style="width:16pt;height:21pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">UESTION:</span><span class="font9"> Is there anything in the Bible that would give us an idea of how we are to live on the earth after restoration? Is there prophecy regarding how we are to live: by our work which we are now doing, or not?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Answer:</span><span class="font9"> The full restoration of all the faithful and obedient of mankind will be accomplished by the end of the thousand-year reign of Christ and His glorified church. (Bev. 5:10; 20: 4, 6) “The first man Adam” (1 Cor. 15:45) was created in God’s image and likeness, and to that image and likeness all submissive and loyal subjects of Christ’s kingdom will be restored.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">There will be no infants nor small children then, but all will have grown to full maturity as men and women, and the earth will be comfortably filled with perfect human beings. Christ Jesus personally stated that “the children of this world marry and are given in marriage: but they which shall be accounted worthy to obtain that [new] world, and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage”.—Luke 20: 34, 35.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Christ gave this information in answer to the question as to whose wife a woman would be who during this age or world had had seven husbands. Thus He shows that death ends the marriage contract, “so that [as the Apostle Paul adds] she is no adulteress, though she be married to another man.”—Rom. 7:1-3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Lienee present marriage relationships will duly cease, and eventually all restored men and women will live as brothers and sisters, because, as Jesus said, they are “the children of God, being the children of the resurrection”.— Luke 20:36.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The dead will be raised from the graves in gradual order, according as provision for their feeding, clothing, lodging, and employment can be made by those alive. And that the dead, at least infants and young children, will be restored to those who were their immediate family relatives in this age, Jeremiah’s prophecy strongly indicates; it states that the babes of Bethlehem who were slain by King Herod’s soldiers will be restored to their mothers, “to their own border.”—Jer. 31:15-17; Matt. 2: 16-18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Thus there may be for a time something of the present intimate family life of parents and children as long as the raising of the dead continues and until the children are reared to years of personal accountability.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Mankind, restored to human perfection, will not lead lives of idleness. The perfect Adam was not idle, but God “put him into the garden of Eden, to dress it, and to keep it”. (Gen. 2:15) Mankind, though brought to perfection by Christ, their Mediator and King, will not be immortal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Adam had to eat; even so perfected mankind will have to eat to live, that thus by eating the perfect fruit of their earthly paradise and by obedience to God they may have their youth renewed continually and enjoy everlasting life on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">But the present toilsome, slavish features of work will be lifted, because during Christ’s reign Satan the great slave-driver and oppressor will be bound; and when, at the end of his imprisonment, he is released and tries to undo Christ’s work, he will be put out of existence for ever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The present way of living and working which Satan, through selfish commercialism and misrule, has foisted on the people will also be destroyed by Christ Jesus, the righteous Ruler. —Ps. 72. '</span></p>

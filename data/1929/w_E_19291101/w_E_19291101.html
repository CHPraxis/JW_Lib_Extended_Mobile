<p><span class="font5">ITS SACRED MISSION</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">T</span><span class="font4">HIS journal ia published lor the purpose </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font4">aiding the people to understand the divine plan. It provides systematic Bible Study in which all its readers may regularly engage. It gives announcement of the visits made to Bible classes by traveling speakers, announces conventions, and gives reports thereof. It announces radio programs and publishes suitable </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Bible instruction for broadcasting'.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It adheres strictly to the Bible as God’s revealed Word of Truth. It stands firmly upon the great ransom sacrifice as the fundamental doctrine by which all doctrines are measured. It is free from parties, sects and creeds of men. It does not assume a dogmatic attitude, but confidently invites a careful examination of its utterances in the light of the infallible Word of God. It does not indulge in controversies, and its columns are not open to personalities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">TO US THE SCRIPTURES CLEARLY TEACH</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">THAT JEHOVAH is the only true God, the Maker of heaven and earth, and is from everlasting to everlasting; that the Logos was the beginning of his creation; that the Logos became a man; that he is now the Lord Jesus Christ in glory, clothed with all power in heaven and in earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">THAT GOD created the earth for man, created perfect man for the earth and placed him upon it; that man wilfully disobeyed God’s law and was sentenced to death; that by reason of Adam’s wrongful act all men are born sinners and without the right to Efe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">THAT JESUS was made a human being in order that he might become the Redeemer of man; that he gave his life a sacrifice for man and thereby produced the ransom price; that Jesus the divine was raised from the dead, ascended into heaven, and presented tho value of his human sacrifice as tho redemptive price for man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">THAT FOR MANY CENTURIES God, through Christ, has been selecting from amongst men the members of his church, which constitutes the body of Christ; that the mission of the church is to follow in the footsteps of her Lord Christ Jesus, grow in his likeness, give testimony to the name and plan of Jehovah God, and ultimately be glorified with Christ Jesus in his heavenly kingdom; that Christ, Head and body, constitutes the “seed of Abraham’’ through which all tho families of the earth shall be blessed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">THAT THE WORLD HAS ENDED; that the Lord Jesus has returned and is now present; that Jehovah has placed Christ Jesus upon his throne and now commands all nations and peoples to hear and obey him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">THAT THE HOPE OF THE PEOPLES of earth is restoration to human perfection during the reign of Christ; that the reign of Christ will afford opportunity to every man to have a fair trial for life, and those who obey will live on earth for ever in a state of happiness.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">SCRIPTURE STUDY SPECIAL</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Those who desire to find an excuse to oppose the Society’s work make the charge that we are not putting the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Studies in the Scriptures,</span><span class="font4"> written by Pastor Russell, in the hands of tho people. The Society has decided to designate the week beginning November 10 as a special drive week for the sale of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Studies in the Scriptures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Consignments are being shipped to the classes. The price of the full set of seven volumes of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Studies in the Scriptures,</span><span class="font4"> for that week, will be $1.25 in the United States and Canada, and a corresponding price in other countries. Let all the class workers, pioneers, and colporteurs prepare for this special drive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Immediately following this special drive week, canvassers will all return to the sale of the other volumes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">SERVICE CONVENTIONS</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Tn view of the fact that there will be no general convention during 1!)29. the Society is arranging a series of local com entions, to be held in conjunction with the regional service directors’ appointment to some of the larger classes. These conventions are for the convenience of the classes within a radius of from sixty to a hundred miles from the city where they are held. Communications should be directed to the secretary, whose name and address are given in each instance.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;The shield of his mighty men is made red, the valiant men are in scarlet: the chariots shall he with flaming</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">torches in the day of his preparation, and the</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">J</span><span class="font5">EHOVAH’S lightnings now make it plain that the periods of time mentioned in the Scriptures as &quot;the day of his preparation” and the time of “preparing the way before the Lord” are not the same. In his own due time God sends his beloved Messenger to prepare the way before him. (Mal. 3:1) That period of time began about 1878 and continued until 1918, and there ended. Thereafter the period of time designated “the day of his preparation”, as described by another prophet, began, and is still in progress. (Nah. 2:3) The latter prophecy has its fulfilment when ‘Michael the great prince stands up’. (Dan. 12:1) It is the same time when “he that dash-eth in pieces is come up before thy face”. (Nah. 2:1) The prophecy of Nahum is now in course of fulfilment and we are in the time of “the day of his preparation” described by that prophet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>2</sup> Jehovah is preparing for battle against the enemy. There is now no possibility of preventing that great battle. God foretold it by his prophets when he directed that ‘the cup of his fury’ should be handed to all the nations. Had the teachers of “organized Christianity” stood by God’s Word and caused the people to hear the truth, the great battle upon Christendom would have been avoided. But not now1 (Jcr. 23:21, 22) Prophetically God announced his decision when he directed his prophet to take the wine-cup of his fury and pass it to every nation. “For thus saith the Lord God of Israel unto me; Take the wine cup </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font5">this fury at my hand, and cause all the nations, to whom I send thee, to drink it. And they shall drink, and be moved, and be mad, because of the sword that </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font5">will send among them. And all the kings of the north, far and near, one with another, and all the kingdoms of the world, which are upon the face of the earth: and the king of Sheshach shall drink after them.”—Jcr. 25:15, 16, 26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>s</sup>The “wine cup” is a symbol of the potion which Jehovah has decreed shall be drunk by all the ruling powers of the earth. “Sheshach” is one of the names applied to Babylon, which means the Devil’s organization; and therefore the prophecy particularly applies to Christendom so called, or “organized Chris-</span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">fir trees shall be terribly shaken.”—Nah. 2:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">tianity”. It applies, of course, to all of the Devil’s religions, but greater responsibility is upon those who have had ample opportunity to know better. While God proceeds with this preparation he causes notice of his purpose to be delivered to the nations.—Malt. 24:14.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>4</sup> By his prophet Jehovah foretold the end of the Gentile times, the end of the world, and the beginning of the reign of Christ, and stated that it would be marked by the World War, quickly followed by famines, pestilences, distress of nations, the regathering of the Jews to Palestine, and the federation of the organizations of Christendom. The physical facts in fulfilment of this great prophecy began to come to pass in 1914. Between that date and 1918 Christ Jesus, the great executive officer of Jehovah, ousted Satan from heaven.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>6</sup> Next in order thereafter is the preparation for the final battle for the destruction of Satan’s organization. The evil organization that controls the nations of the earth must be destroyed before Christ Jesus, earth’s rightful King, inaugurates righteousness amongst the nations of the earth. Satan is now devoting his attention to the earth as the great Prophet foretold; and “because he knoweth that he hath but a short time”, Satan is preparing for the final battle. (Rev. 12:12; 16: 14) Just when that great battle will take place is not now revealed to man; but because the preparations are being made, the indications are that it will come to pass in the very near future.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>6</sup> The Prophet Nahum had a vision concerning Nineveh, the ruling city of Assyria, and he began his prophecy by saying, “The burden of Nineveh.” The word “burden” means “an utterance of doom”. His prophecy that follows relates to the day of God’s preparation for the expression of his vengeance against his enemy, and incidentally refers to Satan’s preparation also.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>7</sup> Assyria, as heretofore published in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower,</span><span class="font5"> pictured the Devil’s organization in which politics held sway, and at the same time the political element was ably supported by the commercial and religious elements. The fact that Nahum’s prophecy is directed against Nineveh, the capital city that ruled Assyria, is strongly significant that the day of preparation marks a period of time when, in the world organization, politics holds sway, and at the same time the political rulers are ably supported by Big Business and the religious elements.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>8</sup> Conditions existing at the present time exactly fit the description of the prophecy. Just now it is the political rulers who are making peace pacts and treaties, and forming leagues, and declaring that they are going to ‘make the world safe for democracy’ and a desirable place in which to live. In this they are ably supported by the commercial powers, which join in the cry of “Peace!” and at the same time are spending great sums of money to prepare for war. The claim is that the best way to prevent war is to prepare for war. In other words, the best way to prevent two men from killing each other is to arm each one of them with all the guns he can carry.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>0</sup> In the peace movements and war preparations the clergy and religious leaders are giving their unstinted support. These religious leaders occupy high seats at the councils held for the consideration of a world arrangement to prevent war. It is just at this time that the great political power restores temporal power to the head of the Church of Rome, and a large sum of money is handed to the pope in connection therewith, which evidently the financiers had something to do with providing. All the facts show the political rulers are in the saddle, Big Business and the preachers are in the chariot, and the entire combine moving on to the great climax. All the facts show that Nahum’s prophecy is now in course of fulfilment.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>10</sup> The vision of Nahum can now be understood and is understood by those who are devoted to the Lord, because its fulfilment has begun and is progressing. The name Nahum means ‘ ‘ comforter ’ ’, and his prophecy contains words of comfort to the people of God. The anointed are told that Jehovah is slow to anger and great in power; that he will not acquit the wicked, but that he will have his own way in the trouble, and that he has in mind those that trust him. (Nah. 1:1-7) These are words of comfort to those who are in “the secret place of the Most High”.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>11</sup> Then the Lord tells his own that he will make utter end of the wicked and that affliction shall not arise the second time. (Nah. 1:8, 9) The prophet tells how the elements of the enemy organization are folded together like thorns and drunk with ambition and their own schemes, but that God is preparing to destroy them like stubble. The Lord then informs his people that their day of affliction is about ended. “For now will I break his yoke from off thee, and will burst thy bonds in sunder.” For the further encouragement of his people, God then tells them that the Devil’s wicked system shall be destroyed, and adds: “I will make thy grave; for thou art vile.”— Nah. 1:10-1-1.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font5"><sup>12</sup> Jehovah calls his people Judah, because Judah means praise, and they praise his name; and in this connection, for the further encouragement and comfort of his own people, he says to them: “0 Judah, keep thy solemn feasts, perform thy vows [having been brought into the covenant by sacrifice, be faithful to it]: for the wicked shall no more pass through thee.” (Nah. 1:15) The faithful remnant has been cleansed that the members thereof might “offer unto the Lord an offering in righteousness”, which is the praise of their lips and their full heart devotion to him. (Mal. 3:1-3; Heb. 13:15) They appreciate the fact that they have been taken into the covenant by sacrifice, and joyfully perform their part. (Ps. 50: 5, 14; 24:4; Rom. 12:1) This is another proof that whatsoever is written in the Scriptures aforetime was written for the benefit and encouragement of those who devote themselves wholly to the Lord God and prove faithful to him in the last days.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>13</sup> Then the prophet shows Jehovah preparing for the siege of the enemy and his strongholds. The fact that God foretold through his prophet the day in which he would prepare for battle is proof that the battle will be fought. The physical facts which we now sec show the fulfilment of the prophecy, and are proof also that the great battle is in the very near future. Addressing those who are of Zion and who are watching the fulfilment of God’s prophecy, the prophet of the Lord says: “He that dasheth in pieces is come up before thy face.” That means that Christ Jesus, the great executive officer of Jehovah, is present and preparing the siege, which he does after casting Satan out of heaven.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>14</sup> Another of God’s prophets describes the mighty officer of Jehovah, Christ Jesus, as the maul or war club with which he beats to pieces the enemy organization, and specifically names Babylon as that enemy. (Jer. 51:20-24) Appropriate to this same time, the Lord’s prophet says concerning the compact of the League of Nations: “Gird yourselves, and ye shall be </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">broken in pieces.</span><span class="font5"> Take counsel together, and it shall come to nought. ’ ’—Isa. 8: 9, 10.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>15</sup> Further addressing God’s anointed concerning the preparation for the siege against the enemy, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Na</span><span class="font5">hum the prophet says: “Keep the munition, watch the way, make thy loins strong, fortify thy power mightily [pull yourselves together firmly]. For the Lord [Jehovah] hath turned away [restored, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Rotherham}</span><span class="font5"> the excellency of Jacob [his people].” (Nah. 2:1, 2) God announces that his time is at hand when he will show his favor in a special manner to his anointed, and he tells them to prepare for the siege and to be of good courage. Up to this time “plunderers have plundered” those of God’s anointed. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(Rotherham')</span><span class="font5"> They have emptied out God’s people and marred their vine branches; but now from henceforth and for ever God will protect them and keep them night and day.—Nah. 2: 2; Isa. 27: 2, 3; Ps. 1'25:1-3.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>16</sup> Then, says the Prophet Nahum: “The shield of his mighty men is made red, the valiant men are in scarlet: the chariots shall be with flaming torches </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">in the day of his preparation,</span><span class="font5"> and the fir trees shall be terribly shaken.” (Nah. 2:3) This and the subsequent verses of the prophecy have been heretofore understood and described to mean the “chariots” for rapid transportation in this day. While the words of the prophet do well describe the modern means of fast travel, yet the prophecy surely has a deeper meaning than that. That deeper meaning could not be understood until the coming of the Lord to his temple and the building up of Zion, and until God’s lightnings flash, illuminating the prophecy. Instead of criticizing any interpretation heretofore given this prophecy, rather should God’s people rejoice because of the greater illumination that the Lord puts upon it in his own due time.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>1T</sup> The words of the prophecy, now illuminated by the lightnings of Jehovah, show that they are descriptive of Almighty God’s preparation for war. It is Jehovah who lays siege to Nineveh, the Devil’s organization. Jehovah provides the shield for his mighty men. God then tells the enemy to get ready for the siege because he is going to destroy him. He says: “Draw thee waters for the siege, fortify thy strongholds. . . . There shall the fire devour thee; the sword shall cut thee off, it shall eat thee up like the cankerworm: make thyself many as the cankerworm, make thyself many as the locusts.”—Nah. 3:14, 15.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>18</sup> Jehovah’s ‘mighty man’ now commanding all of his forces is the great Christ Jesus. His other “mighty men” are those who are fully and completely devoted to God as members of the army of the Lord. To Christ Jesus, the great Field Marshal, Jehovah says: “Gird thy sword upon thy thigh, O most mighty, with thy glory and thy majesty. And in thy majesty ride prosperously because of truth and meekness and righteousness; and thy right hand shall teach thee terrible things. ’ Ps. 45 : 3, 4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>19</sup> Concerning all the members of Zion, Jehovah says: “I have commanded my consecrated ones, yea, I have called my </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">mighty</span><span class="font5"> men for mine anger, even my proudly exulting ones.” (Isa. 13:3, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">R.</span><span class="font5"> P.) See also Zechariah 10: 5.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>20</sup> A shield wards off or turns aside the blows of the enemy. Jehovah is the Shield to the members of Zion: “Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation.” (Ps. 18:35) Jehovah is the right-hand support of his mighty officer, Christ Jesus, in the battle. (Ps. 110: 5) Describing the faithful of the Lord who “finally” or at the end are equipped for the war, the apostle mentions the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">shield of faith</span><span class="font5"> which turns aside the fiery missiles of the enemy. (Eph. 6:16) The abiding </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">faith</span><span class="font5"> of the anointed in the shed blood of Christ and the faithful keeping of the covenant by sacrifice into which they have been graciously brought well represent the shield “made red”.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>21</sup> Again, another picture is given by the prophet. The mighty Christ Jesus is described as returning from the war, and the question is propounded to him: “Wherefore art thou </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">red</span><span class="font5"> in thine apparel?” He replies that he has stained his raiment with the blood of the enemy. (Isa. 63:1-3) “The valiant men are in scarlet,” says the Prophet Nahum; and these words show that the garments are made red, which identifies them with those who have the absolute and abiding faith in the shed blood of Christ Jesus as the Redeemer and Deliverer, and in whose footsteps they joyfully follow. The so-called “organized Christianity” has no faith in the shed blood of Jesus, because his blood is denied as a means of salvation. It is only those who valiantly stand for the Lord that are identified by their garments of scarlet. These are given the garments of salvation when the Lord builds up Zion. Isa. 61:10.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>22</sup> Again, God’s prophet speaks of these faithful followers and calls them volunteers who joyfully obey the commandments of the Lord “in that day”. (Ps. 110: 3) Those who are of Zion occupy the position of favor with the Lord, and concerning them it is written: “Through God we shall do </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">valiantly.”</span><span class="font5"> (Ps. 108:13) It is important to note that both of these prophecies are made to apply “in that day”, which is the day of God’s preparation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>23</sup> “The chariots shall be with flaming torches in the day of his preparation.” “Chariots” represents the divisions of Jehovah’s militant organization. (Ezek. 1:4-26) Bearing upon this point mention is here made of Elisha’s experience at Dothan. For the purpose of taking Elisha, his enemy the king sent “horses and chariots, and a great host, and they came by night and compassed the city about”. Elisha’s servant was terrified by the great power of the enemy, but Elisha was not at all disturbed. He held firmly to his shield of faith, the shield with which God had provided him, and then it was that the Lord disclosed that he had filled the mountains round about with horses and chariots of fire for the protection of Elisha.—2 Ki. 6:12-17.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>24</sup> That record was made for the benefit of God’s people. Now we are “in that day” when God is making ready for the war and when the enemy, the dragon organization, would take the remnant and destroy the members thereof because doing the work foretold by Elisha; and the Lord surrounds the remnant with his fiery chariots. ‘ ‘ The chariots of God are twenty thousand, even thousands of angels; the Lord is among them, as in Sinai, in the holy place.”— Ps. 68:17.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>25</sup> Throughout the earth today there are small militant groups of the remnant of God’s organization, who are active for the service of the Lord. These are divisions of God’s organization, and are represented as his chariots; and these flash with the light of fire from the “lightning” of Jehovah, which shines upon them by and through his present King, who is now in his temple. The words of the prophet do not convey the thought of </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font5">burning torch, as is well shown by other translations of the text which are .here given: “The chariots flash with steel in the day of his preparation.” (R. V.) “On fire are the chariot-steels.” </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(Rotherham)</span><span class="font5"> God’s chariots or divisions of his organization are </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">fired</span><span class="font5"> with a zeal peculiar to his house, and are illuminated by Jehovah’s lightnings and by the beams of light arising from “the Sun of righteousness” now present and in command of the forces </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font5">Jehovah.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>26</sup> It is “the day of his preparation”, because it is the day which God has made for the accomplishment of his great work. (Ps. 118: 24) The word “preparation”, used by the Prophet Nahum in this text, is from the Hebrew word </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">kun.</span><span class="font5"> It is interesting to note the manner in which this word is used in the prophecy. It means “to prepare, to perfect, to establish or be established”. “The path of the just is as a shining light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">[kun]</span><span class="font5"> day.” (Prov. 4:18) This would indicate that the day of Jehovah’s preparation is the beginning of “the perfect day”. Other texts in which the same Hebrew word is used are: “The house of the Lord shall be established [7cun] in the top of the mountains.” (Mic. 4:1) “God will establish [Auln] it for ever.”—Ps. 48:8; 87: 5.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>2T</sup> The conclusion is, therefore, that “the day of his preparation” must be the day in which Jehovah’s chariots (divisions of his organization) begin to receive the light of “the perfect day” because of the presence of the Head of Zion in his temple and because of the flashes of Jehovah’s lightnings. It is the time when the Lord lays “the Stone” before the members of the temple class and when the perfect light shines thereupon.—Zech. 3: 9.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>28</sup> To be sure, Jehovah is always fully equipped to engage his enemy in war; therefore “the day of his preparation” seems more particularly to refer to the fact that he is preparing by enlightening his own people, who are members of his organization, as to the time when the great conflict is approaching, and fortifying them to do their part which he has assigned to them. He sends the remnant forth to proclaim his praises and to advise the world of the approaching day of his vengeance, and while these faithful ones do so he enlightens them. He shields them and protects them, and puts them in proper order in his organization.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>29</sup> “And the fir trees shall be terribly shaken.” What could that mean in connection with God’s preparation? It appears that God’s consecrated people are likened unto fir trees. The prophet foretells the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">shaking</span><span class="font5"> of spiritual Israel and the protection of those who shall ‘dwell under the shadow of his wing’. These are represented as saying: “I am like a green fir tree: From me is thy fruit found.” Then adds the prophet: “Who is wise, and he shall understand these things? prudent, and he shall know them? for the ways of the Lord are right, and the just shall walk in them: but the transgressors shall fall therein.”— Hos. 14:7-9.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>80</sup> Following the coming of the Lord to his temple in 1918, judgment began at the house of God. (1 Pet. 4:17) From that time forward there was a great </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">shaking</span><span class="font5"> amongst the consecrated, and those who took the wise course God has blessed with an understanding of his Word, while others who claim consecration have been shaken down. This is in exact accord with what Paul declared would take place immediately preceding the destruction of Satan’s organization and the complete establishment of God’s kingdom on earth.—Heb. 12: 27, 28.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>81</sup> Other translators render these words thus: “The chariots shall flash with steel in the day of his preparation, and the cypress [or fir] spears are brandished.” (A.R.K.) “And the lances are put in motion.” </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(Rotherham)</span><span class="font5"> God’s anointed are likened unto polished shafts or spears. A spear made of a fir tree or cypress, polished, and brandished in the sunlight, flashes and reflects the light. It is written concerning the “servant” class by the prophet of the Lord: “He hath .. . made me [as] a polished shaft.”—Isa. 49: 2.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>S2</sup> With the coming of the Lord to his temple, and the judgment that followed, there was a great shaking among the consecrated. The approved ones, like polished spears, were put in motion by the great zeal manifested by them for the witness work in which they have participated and which is still in progress. This further suggests that God’s preparation is to fortify his people for “that great'and terrible day”; and before the battle he sends them forth to serve, upon the enemy and upon the people, notice of his intention to lay siege to the enemy organization and bring about its destruction. The prophet describes the great war and its preparation, and some of God’s instruments therein are mentioned as his “glittering spear”. (Hab. 3:11) Throughout the nations of the earth there are numerous groups, called eeclesias, who are consecrated and devoted to the Lord, and who therefore form parts of his organization; and they may properly be spoken of as divisions of God’s organization, a number of whom are polished, like a shaft, ready for the service of the King.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>83</sup> The war that is impending is not the battle merely of men. It is “the battle of that great day of God Almighty”. God has not kept it secret and is not now proceeding in secrecy. He causes his witnesses to proclaim the facts, that even his arch-enemy and all of his organization may have an opportunity to know of his purposes. Satan is aware of the fact that he is now facing the greatest conflict of his existence. Recently he engaged in a fight with Christ Jesus in heaven and was worsted in that fight and cast out of heaven down to the earth. The Devil now has “great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short time” to prepare.—Rev. 12:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">ENEMY’S PREPARATION</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">•<sup>4</sup> In keeping with his usual mode of procedure, Satan the enemy prepares for war, and he does so with great noise and boasting and at the same time keeps the peoples in ignorance of his purpose. Christ Jesus, God’s great Prophet, caused John to make a record of this prophecy: “And I saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet. For they are the spirits of devils, working miracles, which go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world, to gather them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty.”—Rev. 16:13, 14.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>35</sup> The three unclean spirits here mentioned are likened unto frogs. A frog swells up, is bombastic, and boasts of what he is going to do and makes much noise about it. The noise of a bullfrog strikes terror to the mind of one who does not know whence the noise emanates. The Devil has the whole world in fear and distress because his ‘bullfrogs’ are bellowing forth their noise. The “dragon” in the text represents the entire satanic organization, while the “beast” is symbolic of the visible part of that organization, and the “false prophet” particularly represents the fraudulent religions. With one accord all these elements of Satan’s organization boast and make much noise of what they are doing and are going to do.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>36</sup> In substance they say: ‘The earth is ours, and we are going to fix everything to our liking; and when we get through the people will like it.’ This is but voicing the sentiment of the Devil, who says: “My river [peoples] is mine own, and I have made it for myself.” (Ezek. 29: 3) The visible part of the organization makes peace pacts and boldly announces: ‘We have outlawed war and hence there will be no more war, and let the people be assured to that end.’</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>37</sup> When the Paris Peace Pact was pending before the United States Senate for ratification, its chief sponsor in America was prancing about like a well-groomed horse that wanted to show itself. Even moving pictures were made of his antics, and these were exhibited before the people throughout the land. At the same time the war organization was pushing both houses of the law-making body of the nation for ratification of the peace pact and also for more battleships. The political whip was brought to bear to carry out the purposes of those in power. “The noise of a whip, and the noise of the rattling of the wheels, and of the prancing horses, and of the jumping chariots.” —Nah. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">3: 2.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>38</sup> Within a few days after the United States Senate ratified the Paris Peace Pact by an almost unanimous vote, the law-making machinery provided for the building of a more powerful navy than has ever before been had, and provided for the expenditure of $275,000,000 for new war vessels, to say nothing about the great expenditure for other military preparations. Public press dispatches, dated February 13, 1929, announced that ‘the president today signed a bill to authorize the construction of fifteen modern warships’, and within a few minutes thereafter the building program was begun.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>39</sup> The clergy and the religious leaders loudly applaud the action of the political and commercial powers, and say to the people in substance: ‘There will be no more war, because we have outlawed war. At the same time we must prepare by building more ships.’ It is rather difficult for the common people to understand the consistency of such actions and declarations. The building of war machines proceeds upon a gigantic scale in every nation called Christendom. The political factors, in the saddle, make the legal provision; the commercial giants arrange for the money; and the clergy provide the sanctimonious smoke-screen which their “father” employs to blind the people to the truth. Just as the prophet says, all three are like bullfrogs making a frightful noise, but the loudest one, and the most sanctimonious among the three, is the “false prophet” religion.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>40</sup> The preparation goes on and Satan causes his agents, the rulers of the earth, to take counsel together against God and against his anointed, and to say in substance: “Let us break their bands asunder, and cast away their cords from us [and fix the world to suit ourselves]. He [Jehovah] that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh; the Lord shall have [hold] them in derision.”—Ps. 2:3, 4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>41</sup> Returning now to the consideration of Nahum’s prophecy relative to preparation, it is found to be exactly in accord with the prophecy of Revelation above quoted. Jehovah speaks through Nahum and says: ‘The chariots shall rage in the streets, they shall justle one against another in the broad ways: they shall seem like torches, they shall run like the lightnings.”—Nah. 2 : 4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>42</sup> The chariots mentioned in this last quoted prophecy are not the same chariots as those mentioned in verse three of the same chapter. The chariots first mentioned are </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">outside of</span><span class="font5"> the city [the Devil’s organization] and are preparing to lay siege to the Devil’s organization. The chariots mentioned in verse four are in the streets or roadways </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">inside</span><span class="font5"> of the city, and are therefore a part of and belong to the city which is the Devil’s organization. These chariots last mentioned are therefore the military organization and machinery of Satan. The Hebrew word used to translate the word “rage” in verse four of the prophecy is </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">halldl,</span><span class="font5"> and means “to praise self or to boast”, and is also rendered “to show oneself foolish”. (Young) Thus the “chariots” of Satan’s organization that “rage” in the streets means the military preparations that are vainglorious and carried on in a boastful manner; and those who are doing it swell up and bellow like bullfrogs making a great noise, while praising their own greatness, and thereby seek to impress the people by appearing in the streets and exhibiting themselves.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>43</sup> Why all the noise in the public press and upon the screens of the moving pictures concerning war preparations? Why the great military and naval display at every national function? Why the exhibition at every moving picture show of some politician or warrior, of war organizations and war lords, who are preparing for war? It is the raging of Satan’s agents in the streets and making themselves foolish. Why, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font5">all the war preparations, at the canteens, in the art galleries, in the public press and in the moving pictures, is the religious element made so prominent? It is always a part of the same bombastic campaign that Satan himself is engineering, and he is blinding the men who are really engaged in it and using them as his dupes. These fraudulently say: ‘We are Christian, and we therefore represent Christendom.’ But be it noted that they do not praise God nor his King, but they praise themselves. They are hurrying in their preparations and boast of their power and make themselves mad and foolish before the Lord. And the preparation goes on!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>44</sup> One translator renders the text thus: “They rush along in the broadway.” </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(Rotherham)</span><span class="font5"> Thus they do, because among the people they can make better speed by boasting of their power and claiming that they are making the world safe for democracy. Another translator renders the text: “They rush to and fro in the broad ways.” (A. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">R. V.)</span><span class="font5"> The thought of friction is absent. By means of diplomacy they avoid friction, and thereby keep the real meaning hid from the eyes of the people. Such is always Satan’s method. Then adds the prophet: “They shall seem like [have the appearance of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(R. V.</span><span class="font5">)] torches. ” The word “ torches ” </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font5">this verse is more frequently translated “lamp”, and suggests the view that Satan’s organization-units, or his foremost agencies, will claim or appear to be as lamps lighting the way of the people, or like torches of liberty lighting the way for freedom and progress in the government of the people. It is the clergy that use their pulpits and the radio to harangue the people and tell them of the great torches of liberty that the heroes are holding forth to light the people into a desirable condition. They are really blind guides and false prophets.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>45</sup> God foretold that exactly this condition would exist which does now exist. “For such are false apostles [preachers and teachers], deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ [claiming to represent Christ, and hence called “organized Christendom”, or “organized Christianity”]. And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light. Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers [the clergy] also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness; whose end shall be according to their works.” (2 Cor. 11:13-15) Then adds the prophet: “They shall run like the lightnings.” They are swift in the execution of their preparations, because Satan knows he has but a short time (Rev. 12:12), and the rulers are in distress and perplexity because of what they see approaching.—Luke 21: 25, 26.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>46</sup> God’s prophet proceeds: “He shall recount his worthies [margin, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">gallants]</span><span class="font5"> : they shall stumble in their walk; they shall make haste to the wall thereof, and the defence shall be prepared.” (Nah. 2:5) The word “worthies”, or “gallants”, in this text is in the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Revised Version</span><span class="font5"> rendered “nobles”. The same Hebrew word is rendered </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“principal</span><span class="font5"> of the flock” (Jcr. 25:34-36), and also “famous”. (Ps. 136:18) It is Satan’s nobles or principal ones of the flock of the religious organization who are here meant. He has them in mind and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">recounts</span><span class="font5"> them. He takes a census of his chief agencies, and measures the strength of his fighting force as well as his bellowing “frogs”. Those men are of Satan’s world; hence Satan gives consideration to them. (John 15:19) Those who carry out Satan’s purposes are his favored ones, hence called his worthies or nobles or famous ones.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>47</sup> This is one of his schemes to turn the people away from Jehovah God. Satan keeps before the people the great heroes of his organization. In the religious organizations, in the great political meetings, in the meetings of the financiers, in all of these the importance of the principal men, as examples and heroes worthy of praise, is held before the people. The metropolitan press, which is merely the tool and mouthpiece of Satan’s organization, publishes glowing accounts of the valor of the mighty officers of war, of the power and virtue of the financial giants, and of the greatness of the religious element and religious leaders. It is a mutual admiration society; and the press and the radio, the moving pictures and the artist, are all called into action to glorify the names of men, all of which keeps the minds of the people turned away from Jehovah God.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>48</sup> In his preparation for the great battle Satan summons his nobles and the principal of his flock, and these “noble” clergymen and principal of the flock, hypocritically claiming to be Christians, hurry to obey the summons of their master, Satan, even as the prophet of God says they would do; and, as they come, “they stumble in their march.” (R. P.) They stumble over “The Stone”, which is God’s anointed King, as the prophet foretold. They make haste to the defense of Satan’s world or organization; and in so doing they stumble and fall, even as Jesus the great Prophet foretold they would. (Matt. 21:44) “And many among them shall </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">stumble,</span><span class="font5"> and fall, and be broken, and be snared, and be taken.” (Isa. 8:14, 15) They hasten to aid in the preparation for the assault upon God’s anointed, but they fall. “When the wicked, even mine enemies and my foes, came upon me to eat up my flesh, they </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">stumbled</span><span class="font5"> and fell.”— Ps. 27:2.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>49</sup> The prophet says: “They shall make haste to the wall thereof.” The clergy and the principal of their flocks make haste to seek the instruments available for the persecution and punishment of those of God’s people who are known as the remnant, and who are diligent in spreading among the people the truth of Jehovah. They make haste to man the bulwarks of Satan’s organization, that the hated remnant may be destroyed. But while this preparation is going on, the clergy, or “nobles”, decline to appear in the open and defend their cause. Their policy is to never enter into an open discussion with those who represent God, because that would expose their duplicity to the people. They are “mighty men in Babylon” (the religious part of the organization), and they swagger about and content themselves with boasting words, and secretly bring to bear their influence upon the political factors to torment God’s witnesses until the day the great battle will be fought.—Jer. 51: 30.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>50</sup> Satan knows that shortly he must fight the Lord, and therefore he prepares for the conflict. His method of preparation, however, is that of darkness. By loud boasting, by exalting the virtues and achievements of men, and by putting the nations in fear of each other, he hastens the gathering of the people together for the great day of battle. He is really keeping the men of his visible organization in the dark. Satan hates the remnant of God with a deadly hatred, and he incites his nobles and the principal of the flock to attempt their destruction. Doubtless Satan is confident that he can destroy the insignificant and “pestilential” group in the coming battle, but he now attempts to torment and persecute them.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>61</sup> Satan would completely destroy the remnant now, were it not for the protection God furnishes his own. The prophet refers to Satan’s preparation and to his cohorts preparing for battle, and then says: </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“And the defence shall be prepared.”</span><span class="font5"> These latter words manifestly refer to the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">protection God furnishes to his remnant.</span><span class="font5"> The word rendered “defence” appears in the margin as “covering”, and is a covering or protection for those assaulting Satan’s organization. Rotherham renders the text: “Yet the storming covering is prepared.” Jehovah is the covering, and his protection for his-own is “in the secret place of the Most High, . . . under the shadow of the Almighty”. ‘He shall cover these with his feathers, and under his wings shall they trust.’—Ps. 91:1, 4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>52</sup> Jehovah sent Jonah to prophesy against the capital city of Assyria. The prophecy was given when Jonah had been delivered from the belly of the whale. The destruction of the city was deferred until the day of God’s preparation. Since Jesus Christ was raised from the dead, which was foretold by the delivery of Jonah (Matt. 12:40), there has been given a testimony to the nations of earth; and particularly has this testimony been given since the second coming of the Lord and the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">resurrection of the faithful body members of Christ.</span><span class="font5"> During that period of time there has been a partial repentance of those who claim to be followers of Christ. Now the testimony work is about complete. The day of God’s preparation is about done. War upon and destruction of Satan’s organization is now about due. As the gates of ancient Babylon were opened and the army entered and the city fell, so, as the prophet says, “The gates of the rivers shall be opened, and the palace shall be dissolved,” and Satan’s organization shall fall.— Nah. 2:6.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>63</sup> The day of battle draws nigh. The day for the judgment of the nations is at hand. The Lord is in his holy temple for judgment. “Hear, all ye people; hearken, 0 earth, and all that therein is; and let the Lord God be witness against you, the Lord from his holy temple. ”—Mie. 1: 2.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>64</sup> Notice must be given to the world, because God docs not take action in secret. Through his prophet Jehovah says: “Proclaim ye this among the Gentiles; Prepare war, wake up the mighty men, let all the men of war draw near; let them come up: beat your plowshares into swords, and your pruninghooks into spears: let the weak say, I am strong. Let the heathen be wakened, and come up to the valley of Jehoshaphat [the place and time for Jehovah to pronounce and execute judgment] : for there will I sit to judge all the heathen round about.”—Joel 3: 9, 10, 12.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>65</sup> Satan marches his great army into “the valley of decision” for war. With blaring bands of military music and flying banners his officers approach. In the van march the kings, the princes, the presidents, the governors, and the smaller political rulers; the judges and the attendants upon the great judicial systems; the parliaments, the congresses, and all others having to do with the political machinery of the world. More bands and banners, and on come the financial giants of the world, comparatively small in number, but great in power. More music, banners and floats, and then appear in the line of march the mighty ecclesiastical pontiffs, the bishops, the cardinals, the priests, the rabbis, the doctors of divinity, the right reverends and all the other clergy, each wearing an apparel that identifies him, and accompanied by lay leaders and those who serve and receive the collections. Proud, haughty, cold, calculating and severe, and with heavy dignity, each one of the three great governing factors of the visible part of the Devil’s organization takes his respective position in the line of march. Self-importance is written upon their countenances, and self-praise is upon all lips.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>68</sup> March! March! March! And on they come! In the line there are great magazine owners and publishers, who use their columns to extol the virtues of the mighty worldly organization. There are the owners and publishers of the great metropolitan newspapers that mold public opinion in favor of the ruling heroes. More bands of music, and on come the chariots and horses of war. These are no part of the ruling factors, but they are instruments employed by the ruling factors.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>57</sup> Tramp I Tramp! Tramp! Will they ever cease to tramp? All the nations must come, because they must assemble to drink of that cup of wrath which God has poured for them, and none can refuse.— Jcr. 25: 28.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>58</sup> There arc more than sixty nations that are putting forth their best endeavors to equip for war. Some idea of the number of poor souls that are prepared for the slaughter, and which form a military instrument of the Devil’s organization, may be gathered from the statement published </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">September 24, 1928,</span><span class="font5"> by the United States War Department.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>59</sup> It will be observed that the total military manpower set forth in that report is, to wit, 124,192,440 men. For all of these men there must be war equipment, such as guns, swords, knives, knapsacks, gun carriages, tanks, ammunition, bombs and all other instruments of destruction used by men of war.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>eo</sup> Then add to the above the tremendous navies of the countries, which are not here set forth, including torpedoes and numerous submarines. To this add the enormous aircraft that fly through the air and drop deadly missiles upon men. To this add poison gases, a comparatively small quantity of which can destroy a whole city in less than a day. These are all marching into “the valley of decision’’, and the mass of them are ignorant of why they are going there. There arc multitudes upon multitudes of people who are no part of this organization, but who are either indirectly or directly affected thereby. These include the drivers of motors, the hospital corps, those who supply and convey the food necessary to feed the armies, the doctors and the nurses. And then there are multitudes upon multitudes of people who are indirectly affected, because their necessities of life must be curtailed in order to supply the military organization. And then, over and above all this visible organization, unseen by all and known by a very few, rides the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Devil, its mighty god,</span><span class="font5"> flanked and supported by hordes of evil angels.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>C1</sup> In view of all this array of organized power, some who claim to be Christians scorn the thought of a Devil’s organization. It might here be asked, Whose organization is it that is above described ? Surely God does not need such; and while these come in the name of the Lord, they come hypocritically in his name, but in fact in the name of Satan the Devil.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>62</sup> The visible part of God’s organization is really small and insignificant, so small, in fact, as to hardly deserve notice. They are on the other side of the valley of decision, under the banner of the Lord. They bear no weapons of warfare; only their trumpets do they have with which to sound the praises of Jehovah God. The visible members of Satan’s organization look upon this small and insignificant company </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font5">trumpeters with contempt. They are the only visible foes of Satan, and they refuse to compromise with any part of his organization. They persist in singing forth Jehovah’s praise and in declaring the wonders of his works. Satan incites the clergy to destroy the little band of trumpeters, or singers, because the great ecclesiastics are annoyed by their singing.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>63</sup> To the little company of the remnant of God’s people there has been committed the testimony of Jesus Christ, which it must deliver. In obedience to God’s commandments this little company is giving that testimony. Not because of coercion, but because of love for God do the members thereof unitedly sing forth his praises.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>64</sup> Because these have completely separated themselves from the Devil’s organization and have taken their stand wholly on the side of Jehovah, and because they are the anointed witnesses of God, they stand with the Lord Jesus on Mount Zion and, having learned the song, they are singing as it were </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font5">new song. As they sing they march on to the battle and the Almighty God throws around them a cordon of complete protection and they are safe. Jehovah is the shield, the buckler, the high tower and the power of their salvation.</span></p></li></ul>

<h4><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark3"></a><a name="bookmark25"></a>MAN’S RETURN FROM THE ENEMY’S LAND</span></h4>
<p><span class="font2">[Fifteen-minute radio lecture]</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">N</span><span class="font5">O OTHER place is so dear as a homeland. Yet, at God’s call, the patriarch Abraham left his native country and went into a land wholly unknown to him, where at length he died. While he dwelt in Canaan, &quot;as in a strange country,” he never had the desire to return to his native land, although he ‘might have had opportunity to return’. Why not? Because it was the enemy’s country: although his homeland, it was in possession of the enemy. The Apostle Paul says that Abraham desired ‘‘a better country, that is, an heavenly”. (Heb. 11:15, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">16) </span><span class="font5">This does not mean that Abraham desired to get </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">off </span><span class="font5">this earth and go to heaven. Abraham had no promise, desire, or hope of ever getting to heaven, and there are no scriptures to show that he ever will get there. God promised to give Abraham, not heaven, but what is now called &quot;the holy land”. (Gen. 12: 7; 13: 14-17; 15: 7, 18-21) But he died without coming into possession of it. (Acts 7:5) However, Jesus said: &quot;Abraham rejoiced to see my day: and he saw it, and was glad.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Abraham did not have a glimpse of heaven, but as a prophet of God (Gen. 20: 7) he foresaw the day of Christ’s kingdom, when this earth should be made new and when &quot;new heavens”, that is, Christ Jesus and his church, as new heavenly rulers, should reign over man and God’s will should be done in earth as it is done in heaven. So Abraham desired &quot;a better country, that is, an heavenly”, in that he desired this earth to pass from under the great enemy’s control and the control of sinful and imperfect human kings and rulers over to the control of Christ, the heavenly King, who represents the great God of heaven, Jehovah. Abraham realized that he was dwelling in the enemy’s land. At his death he went still deeper into that land, and from that land he must some day return in order for God yet to make good the promise to give Abraham the land of Palestine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Patriotic people may joy in the fact that they dwell in the land of their birth, amid long-time friends, and under an earthly government that represents them; but for all that, they and all people, without an exception, have for more than six thousand years been pining away and dying in &quot;the land of the enemy”. At heart, they too, like Abraham, are really looking for a better land: no, not heaven, but for this earth to be under a righteous government and with heart-satisfying living conditions prevailing. Today they desire this &quot;better country” more than ever previously. As a picture of their present distressful condition, long ago Jehovah God, who knows the end of his arrangement for deliverance and salvation from its very beginning, staged a tremendous real-life drama on earth. The heroes in the drama were all Hebrews. It is written: &quot;Now all these things happened unto them for ensamples [or, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">types]</span><span class="font5"> : and they are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come.” (1 Cor. 10:11) For eighteen hundred and forty-five years Jehovah showed the Hebrews exclusive favor and used them to act out types or prophetic pictures for the instruction of true Christians and of all teachable people who should be living now at the end of the Christian era.—Amos 3: 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Over eighteen hundred years before Jesus came to earth the Hebrews had, under God’s providence, taken up residence in Egypt. Psalm 105:23-38 graphically tells what happened: “Israel also came into Egypt; and Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham. And [God] increased his people greatly; and made them stronger than their enemies. He turned their [enemies’] heart to hate his people, to deal subtilly with his servants. He sent Moses his servant, and Aaron whom he had chosen. They shewed his signs among them, and wonders in the land of Ham. . . . He smote also all the firstborn in their land, the chief of all their strength. He brought them forth also with silver and gold; and there was not one feeble person among their tribes. Egypt was glad when they departed; for the fear of them fell upon [the Egyptians].”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">By this deliverance of the Hebrews from Egypt the Lord God pictured how he will bring all mankind out “from the land of the enemy”. The Pharaoh who so cruelly oppressed God’s ancient people both served and pictured mankind’s great enemy. That enemy is God’s chief opposer, and his name is Satan, for the name “Satan” means enemy or opposcr. He had once been a highly-favored son of God named Lucifer, “the shining one,” and had been set in Eden, the garden of the Lord, as “the anointed cherub that covereth”, that is, as the guardian angel to look after the interests of Adam and Eve. (Ezek. 28:13-15) But Lucifer, having yielded to ambitious self-will, turned enemy to God, betrayed his God-given trust, and seduced Adam and Eve so as to bring them under his Satanic control. Hence, when Adam and Eve, now condemned to death as sinners, were driven out of the paradise garden, they went out into the enemy’s land; not that Lucifer (now Satan) owned the earth, but that God did not at that time depose Lucifer from being the invisible overlord of man. Thus in time Satan became what the Apostle Paul calls “the god of this world”, and the period of time, or age, in which Satan has thus deceived and oppressed our race the same apostle calls “this present evil world”. (2 Cor. 4:3, 4; Gal. 1:4) Thus the entire human family, which sprang from Adam, has been born into “the land of the enemy”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">What a miserable country it has been! A devilish invisible ruler not caring for man’s interests; selfish, greedy, militaristic, imperfect, unrighteous human governments; want, hard labor in the sweat of brow, wars, calamities, oppressions, sorrows, pain, sickness, sin, and finally the unavoidable necessity to face that “last enemy”, Death! “The land of the enemy” has become the burial ground of all our ancestors who have died; and today the human race groans under hard bondage, just as the Hebrews groaned under the truculent taskmasters of Pharaoh. Those of them who look to God for any aid cry out: “How long, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">0 </span><span class="font5">Lord?” ‘Not long now,’ the Word of Jehovah answers; for we have reached “the end of the world”, the end of the age of Satan’s overlordship and his wicked world-organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jesus’ prophecy, recorded in Matthew 24, fulfilled to the very letter since the year 1914, proves this. Deliverance from the great symbolic Egypt is at hand! Just as the passover lamb was slain in Egypt and its blood became the sign of deliverance to the Hebrews, so nineteen hundred years ago Christ Jesus, as “the Lamb of God”, submitted to death and his blood provided the price of man’s liberation from sin and death. God’s inspired Record says that Jesus died “that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil”. (Heb. 2:</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">14; </span><span class="font5">John 1: 29, 36) Not only did Jesus die, but Jehovah his Father raised him from the dead to be the great Prophet like unto Moses, to lead the human race out “from the land of the enemy” into the freedom and perfect life to be enjoyed on this earth under God’s kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The great Pharaoh of pharaohs, Satan, shall be despoiled of his power and be bound for the thousand years of Christ’s rule (Rev. 20:1-3), and the ransomed and redeemed race shall be returned to Paradise, “the land flowing with milk and honey,” here upon our mother earth. Thus under the controllership of their Friend and King, Christ Jesus, this earth will become the “better country”, man’s own homeland; for man is “of the earth, earthy”, and God ‘created the earth not in vain, but formed it to be inhabited’ for ever by man perfected.—Isa. 45: 12, 18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Like the Hebrews of old, millions of people now alive will march out from ‘spiritual Egypt’, that is, “this world” of which Satan is “prince” (Rev. 11: 8; John 12:31), into the promised land of Paradise restored to earth, without their having to go down into the grave. But God’s promise is also that all the dead shall be released from the enemy country; he has said: “I will ransom them from the power of the grave; I will redeem them from death: 0 death, I will be thy plagues; 0 grave, I will be thy destruction: repentance [that is, a change of purpose on my part] shall be hid from mine eyes.” (Hos. 13:14) Hence we know that this all-necessary deliverance shall surely come. Even the babes and innocent little children whom fond parents lost in death shall return to the broken family circle. These little ones are not in a friendly land, in heaven with Jesus, as many people think. They are in the enemy’s country, in death’s domain. They too have been redeemed from death and ransomed from the grave by the life which Christ so freely laid down for every man, woman, child, and babe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Long centuries ago Jeremiah prophesied of their return. Rachel, Jacob’s beloved wife, had died at “Ephrath, which is Bethlehem” (Gen. 35:16-19), near Ramah, hence the prophet used these appropriate names, saying: “ A voice was heard in Ramah, lamentation, and bitter weeping; Rachel weeping for her children refused to be comforted for her children, because they were not [hence were not in heaven, but dead in the grave]. Thus saith the Lord, Refrain thy voice from weeping, and thine eyes from tears: for thy work shall be rewarded, saith the Lord; and they shall come again from the land of the enemy. And there is hope in thine end, saith the Lord, that thy children shall come again to their own border.”— Jer. 31:15-17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The gospel-writer Matthew tells us that when King Herod had the babes of Bethlehem slaughtered, “then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet’’ about the lamentation and weeping over the slain children. But not yet has been fulfilled what the prophet also said about the return of these murdered babes “from the land of the enemy” to “come again to their own border” and to their grief-stricken parents. This part of the prophecy will be completely fulfilled during the thousand-year reign of Christ. Of Christ Jesus it is written: “He must reign, till he hath put all enemies under his feet. The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death.” (1 Cor. 15: 25, 26) Abraham also shall return from the land of death that he may inherit Palestine, the land God promised him. Under inspiration the Prophet Isaiah says: ‘ ‘ The earth shall cast out the dead.”—Isa. 26:19; Dan. 12: 1, 2; John 5:25, 28, 29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Only the incorrigible and rebellious among men will ever be returned to the dust again, but then in “everlasting destruction”. (2 Thess. 1:9) The remainder of the ransomed race shall receive the treatment of the great Physician and be cured of all of sin’s effects and of all traces of imperfection, sickness, and dying, and thus be completely ‘redeemed from death’. Thus “the last enemy” death shall receive its plagues, and then it shall be said: “ 0 death, where is thy sting? 0 grave, where is thy victory? The sting of death is sin ... . But thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.”—! Cor. 15:55-57.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark26"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark4"></a><a name="bookmark27"></a>THE TRUE CHURCH AND ITS BRANCHES</span></h4>
<p><span class="font2">[Fifteen-minute radio lecture]</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">W</span><span class="font5">HAT constitutes the true church and its branches? The usual answer to this question is that the true church consists of all the different denominations as a collective body, and that each denomination is a branch of the true church. This theory is instilled into the minds of children at an early age by their parents and religious instructors, and hence, in later life, they never question the theory, but accept it as a proven fact.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jesus said: “I am the vine, ye are the branches” (John 15:5); and these words of the Master are used to support the thought that the denominations or creeds of Christendom (of which there are approximately 160) are the branches of the true church.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Even a cursory reading of the fifteenth chapter of John will convince the most skeptical that Jesus did not have any reference to denominations when he uttered these words, but that he referred to individuals, to men and women who had become his followers. Let us read some of his statements, and note that they refer to individuals and not to denominations. In verse four we read: “As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye abide in me.” Most surely this does not refer to denominations. Verse six also reads: “If a </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">man </span><span class="font5">abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch”; and then (verse eight) Jesus adds: “Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; so shall ye be my disciples.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jesus w<sup>r</sup>as addressing </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">men, his disciples,</span><span class="font5"> when he spoke of the vine and branches. He wms illustrating the close relationship that exists between himself and his followers, and also the fact of their dependence on him. On another occasion, Paul referred to this same close relationship and dependence, but used the figure of a human body and its head. His words were: “God . . . gave him [Christ] to be the head over all things to the church, which is his body. ’ ’ Both of these illustrations mean the same thing. The branches are individuals, dependent on the vine </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">for </span><span class="font5">support and sustenance. The members of the body are individuals dependent on the head for instruction and direction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">That the denominations are not branches in the vine, and hence not branches of the true chureh, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">is </span><span class="font5">further proven by the fact that the denominations came into existence many centuries later. The Catholic church came into existence five hundred years after Jesus spoke these words; the Lutheran church about fifteen hundred years afterward. Later came the Episcopal, the Presbyterian, the Baptist, the Methodist, and others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">What, then, is the true church ? The answer is that it is an organization of men who accept Jesus as their Head and look to him for guidance and instruction. They also accept the Bible as the Word of God, and its teachings are their only creed. Speaking of the true church, Paul says: “There is one body, and one spirit, even as ye are called in one hope of your calling; one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and Father of all.” (Eph. 4:4-6) The true church has only one faith and only one baptism, while the denominations have about 160 faiths, represented by 160 different creeds, and also have several different baptisms.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Only the Lord himself knows who are members of the true church, and the membership roll is kept only in heaven. Jesus himself says that their names are written in the Lamb’s book of life; and Paul speaks of the “church of the firstborn, which are enrolled in heaven”.—Heb. 12:23, margin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The reason that the records are not kept on earth is that 'the world knoweth us not, even as it knew him not’. No human being can tell who is a member of the true ehureh; hence it would be folly to try to keep an earthly record. Jesus organized the true church. During his ministry he gathered together those who were looking for the Messiah, and before his crucifixion he told them to tarry at Jerusalem until they were endued with power from on high. Fifty days after his resurrection they were all gathered together in the upper room and the holy spirit came upon them all, and there the true church had its beginning. From that time on it is written: “And the Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">All the promises made and all the hopes set forth in the New Testament are exclusively for the church. As proof of this we note that all of Paul’s letters are addressed to the “church of God”, “those called to be saints,” “the sanctified in Christ Jesus,” “the elect,” etc. We note also that when Jesus prayed to his Father he did not pray for the world, but did pray specially for the saints. An instance is found in John 17:6-9. Jesus’ words are: “I have manifested thy name unto the men which thou gavest me out of the world: ... I pray for them: I pray not for the world.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jesus promised these </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“saints”</span><span class="font5"> that they, if faithful, would come up in the first resurrection. He told them that if they overcame the world they would sit down with him in his kingdom, and that they would live and reign with him a thousand years. (Rev. 20:6) The entire work of the past nearly nineteen hundred years has been to find and instruct and test and prove this church class. When this work of proving and testing is completed they will be the first ones to be raised from the dead, as Paul said: “The dead in Christ shall rise first. ’ ’—1 Thess. 4:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When the first resurrection shall bring this church together in the kingdom, as divine, immortal beings like the Lord, a united and unbroken company, that will be “the general assembly and church of the firstborn, which are enrolled in heaven”. (Heb. 12:23) John refers to this same completed church, united with her Lord and Head, saying as follows: “And I looked, and, lo, a Lamb stood on the mount Sion, and with him an hundred forty and four thousand, having his Father’s name written in their foreheads.” (Rev. 14:1) Only a foreordained 144,000 in the true church; but the denominations claim a membership of several hundred millions. Many who expect to go to heaven when they die will be disappointed, and that is why Jesus said: ‘Not every one that saith unto me Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom, but only he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven.' Only the faithful overcomers will be there: only those who have followed in Jesus’ footsteps. Jesus said of these, “Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father’s good pleasure to give you the kingdom.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The work of the true church has been to act as God’s representatives, his witnesses, his ambassadors, in the ministry of preaching the truth; to show forth the praises of him who has called them out of darkness into his marvelous light; and to defend the name of Jehovah God and the Bible against the slanders and misrepresentations of their enemies. For their faithfulness and loyalty in doing this work, Jesus said that they would be persecuted, reviled and reproached; but he gave to them a most precious and comforting promise in these words: “Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake. Rejoice, . . . for great is your reward in heaven [the kingdom].”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When the church is completed, and glorified together in the kingdom, they will be the great ‘seed of Abraham that will bless all the families of the earth’. It will then be their privilege and work to cooperate with Jesus in the work of resurrecting all the rest of the dead and of giving them peace, happiness, liberty and everlasting life right here on this earth, until God’s will shall be done on earth as it is in heaven.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">According to the Bible, the true church has no branches, and such a thought only reveals confusion on the part of the one expressing it. The true church is </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">one</span><span class="font5"> church, of 144,000 members. It is proper to speak of individuals as being </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">members</span><span class="font5"> of the true church, but it is improper to speak of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">members </span><span class="font5">as being </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">branches</span><span class="font5"> of the true church. Our Lord’s use of the figure of a vine and branches was to illustrate the necessity for the various members of the church to keep in close relationship to </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">him.</span><span class="font5"> These members would wither away and die except for the sustenance furnished by the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the days of the apostles the true church had no such things as synagogues or church buildings. They met in private homes and held little study classes. In writing to the church at Rome, Paul says, “Greet Priscilla and Aquila .... Likewise greet the church that is in their house.” (Rom. 16:3-5) In 1 Corinthians 16:19 the same expression regarding the church is found; and again, in Philemon 2, Paul greets the church which meets in the house of Philemon. Each little class was called “the church”; and when all the classes met together, it was still </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">the church,</span><span class="font5"> and not an assembly of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">various</span><span class="font5"> churches, as a united meeting of the various denominations would be called in our day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We read much about church </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“union”</span><span class="font5"> today. In the days of the apostles there was no necessity for church union, because there was no such thing as a divided church. There was not the spectacle of one church founded on Luther, another on Wesley, and others on Calvin, Knox, Campbell, and Miller. The one true church was founded on Jesus Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">On one occasion Jesus asked his disciples, “Whom say ye that I am?” Peter replied: “Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.” Jesus then said to Peter: “Upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.” (Matt. 16:16-18) What rock did Jesus have in mind in this statement? The answer is, the great fundamental truth uttered by Peter, namely, that Jesus is the Christ. The true church is built on this </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">rock</span><span class="font5"> foundation truth. No one can be a member of the true church except he acknowledge that Jesus is the great Messiah, the great Christ foretold by the prophets. This is the rock upon which the true church is built.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One can not be a member of the true church and be friendly with the world. The Apostle James says: “Know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world, is the enemy of God.” (Jas. 4:4) The reason for this is that the true church are all declaring the gospel of Jesus Christ, and this is diametrically opposed to the interests of the world. The Lord has commissioned them to be his witnesses in the world, and the message which they declare is a constant rebuke and reproof to the world; hence the world resents it and persecutes them for giving it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The true church follow in Jesus’ footsteps in this work of preaching the gospel of the coming kingdom. They preach it whether people hear or whether they forbear. The message which they give is a message of hope, comfort and blessing. It is a message of deliverance from all oppression, from sin, sickness and death, and from the power of Satan. In delivering this message they follow the example of Jesus and the apostles, and go from house to house and tell the people about the good times so soon to come to all the peoples of earth. In Acts 5:42 we read that the apostles “ceased not to teach and preach Jesus Christ” daily in every house. Also in Acts 20: 20 we read that they taught publicly and from house to house.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Thus we see that not only is the message of the true church different from that of the denominations, but its methods of putting forth that message are different also. The different message, the different methods of promulgating it, and the zeal and energy manifested by those putting it forth, bring scorn and reproach from the world; but the Lord, through the apostles, says of them that they are “a peculiar people, zealous of good works ’ ’.—Titus 2:14.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Loving greetings in the name of the Lord! As the days, the months, and the years go swiftly by, and we hear from tune to time of the determination expressed by ecclesias throughout the earth to support and follow you in the magnificent lead you have given to the Lord’s anointed remnant, wo feel con-stiained to add our quota from this, the principal city of Wales. We should like to express to you our complete approval of the course you are taking, and we are whole-heartedly with you, in your determination, to be the Lord’s witnesses in the earth.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">We are grateful that service is being emphasized so much, so that we get that necessary urge and inspiration without which we might become lukewarm and maybe fall completely away, as some have done.

<p><span class="font4">The </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watch Tower</span><span class="font4"> articles make wonderfully clear the meaning of Jehovah’s name; and how can we keep from singing!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">W’e would particularly mention, too, the great help received from the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Life</span><span class="font4"> book.

<p><span class="font4">Brother Toutjian’s visit here was a wonderful inspiration to faithfulness. We all feel more determined to ‘seek </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">first</span><span class="font4"> the kingdom of Jehovah’!</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark30"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark8"></a><a name="bookmark31"></a>FIELD SERVICE</span></h4>
<p><span class="font12">T</span><span class="font5">HE regional service directors report that they sometimes find in classes brethren who are old </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">and feeble </span><span class="font5">in body, who have been faithful to </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">the Lord </span><span class="font5">for a number of years, and </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">who </span><span class="font5">now believe that because they are physically unable to get out in the service and go from house to house the Lord disapproves them. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower</span><span class="font5"> desires to reassure these brethren and to encourage them. Jehovah does not expect any one to do more than his physical condition will permit. &quot;Where a brother is physically incapacitated to do house-to-house work, but his heart is devoted to the Lord and he takes occasion when he can to speak to the Lord’s glory, surely that is all that the Lord would expect or require of him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">None of such brethren should be discouraged. They should have in mind that those who are compelled to ‘stay behind with the stuff’ have the Lord’s blessing. Instead of being sorrowful because of their condition, let all such rejoice that the Lord permits them to see his purposes, and that they are still in harmony with him and his work. Merely going from house to house </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">is </span><span class="font5">not what the Lord requires. That which is pleasing to Jehovah is a full devotion to him, and then taking advantage of such opportunities as come to one to serve God and magnify his name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Those who are crippled, infirm, and bodily weak, let them not be discouraged but rejoice and take advantage of opportunities to speak the name of the Lord when any one comes to their home and on other occasions when they can. Where one is physically able </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ie participate in </span><span class="font5">the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">service </span><span class="font5">and refrains from so do</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ing because of self-esteem or pride, or because he </span><span class="font5">wants to find some excuse, that is entirely different. &quot;When the Scriptures speak of “old men’’, that does not mean old physically, but means those who wish to rest on their oars and mentally feed upon what they learned heretofore. A. person old in body may bo young in his heart devotion to the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">No one should attempt to drive another into the Lord’s service, because that would not be pleasing to the Lord and is therefore not right. It is the business of the regional service directors to encourage every one who is consecrated to the Lord to take advantage of opportunities to serve Him, but it is not the prerogative of any one, whether a service director or other, to attempt to force anybody into God’s service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is reported that sometimes a regional service director attempts to tell the class who shall or who shall not partake of the Memorial. No one has a right to do that. The regional service directors are sent out to encourage and comfort the brethren and to show them their privileges of now magnifying Jehovah’s name. If this policy is always pursued and love is always the moving cause, there will be a better cooperation and less friction. The greatest privilege any one can possibly have is to serve the Lord, but it is not the privilege of any one to try to compel another to serve the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There are no bosses in the earthly division of the Lord’s army. &quot;We are all coworkers. Let love be the prompting motive and each and every one try to help and encourage the other.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">T </span><span class="font4">N THAT BAY </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">shall ye say, Praise Jehovah, proclaim his name, dedare his doings among the people, make mention that his name is exalted. Sing unto Jehovah; for he hath done excellent things; this make Itnown in all the earth. Cry out and shout, thou inhabitant of Zion; for great is the Holy One of Israel in the midst of thee.</span><span class="font4"> ... Ye </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">that make mention of Jehovah, keep not silence.—Isaiah.</span></p>

It brings definitely into view at this time the much-discussed opportunity for all individuals and classes to unite their energies and reseurces in ‘lifting up the voice with strength’, clearly and in no uncertain tone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">lose effective </span><span class="font4">method of independent broadcasts over many smaller stations also is being discontinued by such •lasses, and all effort is concentrated upon the task of thoroughly and regularly advertising the Sunday chain program. We commend this action of the classes to the earnest consideration of all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Every one engaged in the house-to-house work in territory now served by this weekly broadcast is invited to make thorough preparation at once to share in the work of telling the people that this unique service is available to listeners.</span></p>

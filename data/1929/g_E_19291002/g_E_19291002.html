<p><span class="font13">Fossil Remains of Bygone Ages</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">M</span><span class="font9">OST of us are living in the here and now; a few are living for the far-flung future, and really living in it, because all their thoughts are centered there; while a handful spend most of their time thinking about things of the remote past, fossils.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Fossil remains are preserved for mankind in five ways: by the preservation of bones, shells or leaf parts; by the formation of molds; by the formation of casts; by petrification of the thing, atom by atom; and, finally, rarely, by the preservation of the animal itself, unchanged.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Occasionally there are combinations of these. A mollusk dies. Its soft parts are replaced by sediment w’hich eventually turns to stone, a cast. Later the shell is replaced by stone and becomes a mold. Here are two fossils in one. Some of the most interesting plant fossils are those of fungi preserved in petrified wood, another case of two fossils in one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Quiet waters, mud, sand, these are the conditions favorable to the manufacture of fossils, and the work is going on about us all the time. </span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">A</span><span class="font9"> leaf drops in fine mud. In due time all the plant tissue may have disappeared, or mineral matter may have taken its place, and yet the details of the leaf can be clearly seen. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Tree trunks, turned into stone, have been found standing in the soil in which they once grew. Indeed there are petrified forests in Arizona, Nevada, and Egypt that are well worth a visit, and are seen by thousands annually.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Valuable fossils have been recovered from deep waters where they have lain undisturbed for ages. Indeed most fossil remains are of the marine type, due to the fact that in water decay is retarded. All mastodon remains have been found in swamps, where they became mired. No traces of mastodons have been found on high ground.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Rarely is there a fossil that shows by its location just how it came to be one; but it sometimes happens. In one place, in western Kansas, there was found in one spot the skeletons of nine peccaries, or American -wild pigs. Their heads were all pointing in the same direction. They had apparently been killed and buried by a sand-storm.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">There is a locality in France that is noted for its fossils of leaves, fruits, seeds and flowers. The -waters are heavily loaded with lime, and fossilization occurs quickly after the article is dropped into them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The reason why teeth are among the most common of fossils is that they are so hard and hence are more apt to petrify than other parts of the animal. A fossil may be any part of a plant or an animal, or the leaf print, or footprint, or even the worm burrow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">How Fossils Are Recovered</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The derivation of the word “fossil” shows how these remains are recovered. The word means “dug out”. For generations this digging has been with pick and shovel; but newer methods are now in vogue. One of the greatest re-coverers of fossils is now the steam-shovel. Thrusting deeply into the earth and lifting tons of it at a time, the operators are apt at any time to pick up parts of a mastodon or some other extinct creature that once had a happy time on terra Anna but met with some accident and was buried before decay had wholly set in. The region west of Cleveland was thus made famous as a fossil-bearing district, great quantities of fossil fishes and sharks having been uncovered in a short time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">At Harbury, England, workmen excavating in a cement works uncovered a prehistoric monster thirty feet long and ten feet wide. The skeleton was in a state of perfect preservation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In the “Bad Lands” of South Dakota experienced fossil hunters can tell by the composition and coloring of the cliffs which ones will contain fossils, and after the spring rains they cl</span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">im</span><span class="font9">b along them until they find evidences of bone. From experience they can even tell what kinds of animals are likely to be represented.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In a coal mine near West Frankfort, Ill., tnere was found the fossilized trunk of a tree ten feet in circumference. The account of this tree says that “over the surface of the fossil are close-set pits, the scars left where the leaves grew. These ancient trees, the scientist says, had very few branches, and the leaves grew all over the trunk like the scales on a fish”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In the petrified forest located forty miles from Tonopah, Nevada, there is one tree fifty feet high and fifteen feet in circumference that stands petrified where it once grew. More than a hundred others of various sizes are also standing similarly. The ground about is strewn with the fossilized bones of animals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Once in a great while a human body is so acted upon by the elements as to be well preserved without any attempt being made to do so. Not long ago there w<sup>T</sup>as exhumed in Germany a perfectly preserved body buried 211 years ago; and at one time, in a Greek temple, there was found the body of a warrior buried 1,500 years ago, with his body in such a perfect state of preservation that the wounds which killed him were plainly visible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Localities Famous for Fossils</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">One of the localities famous for fossils is in the city of Los Angeles, where thousands of skeletons of creatures that perished in the sticky asphalt have been recovered. Among the skeletons there found were the remains of three thousand giant wolves, two thousand sabertoothed tigers, sixty giant ground-sloths, and of other creatures a plenty, short-faced bears, lions, camels, bisons, peccaries, horses, tapirs, mastodons and mammoths.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Another famous locality, where what is now fine lithograph stone was once fine mud, is in Bavaria. In it are found many skeletons of creatures that must have presented a strange appearance, as flying reptiles and birds with teeth. In some instances signs of the deathstruggles of the entrapped creatures can be plainly seen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In the marshes of Florida there have been recovered great quantities of bird bones. Most of these are of birds similar to those still flying</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Bkooklyn,</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> N. Y.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">over that state, but mingled with them are bones of mammoths, tapirs, ancient horses and giant armadillos which Florida has not seen for long.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In the little valley of Dura Den, Fifeshire, England, thousands of little fishes were buried alive under such circumstances that today the slabs of limestone in which they were entombed will sometimes show as many as a thousand of them on a single square yard. The black remains of the little fishes show<sup>T</sup> up like exquisite carvings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In the wind-blown stretches of the Argentine are to be found the skeletons of many queerlooking creatures, not found elsewhere. Among these are the skeletons of immense sloth-like creatures not capable of traveling far, and it is noted by the discoverer that these early animals all seem to have died within about the same period. No human remains were among these bones.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Two policemen working in their spare time at a mound five hundred feet high, at Bakersfield, California, have dug out 140 sharks’ teeth from a hole ten feet square and five feet deep. It is conjectured that the mound is composed almost entirely of fossilized remains of prehistoric sea creatures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In certain of the West Indian islands there are stretches of beach that have turned to limestone rock; but in the solid rock there are found shells that are still so fresh that the dried skin still clings to some of the shells.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Human Interest in Fossils</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It is natural that the bones of creatures no longer found on earth would be of human interest. They have led to some strange ideas. Some suggested that these were freaks of nature or models discarded by the Creator. The truth is that these were all creatures that were perfectly adapted to conditions as they existed in the earth at the time when they.lived.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The Chinese take these prehistoric monsters seriously and literally. They grind the bones to powder and fry them with oil in a skillet. Or the powder is stirred with sour 'wine and the mixture is drunk off fresh, or it is left to settle and the clear liquid is drunk. These medicines, well known in every Chinese drug store, are considered as valuable in China as similar concoctions are in the Western world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The Chinese guard their fossil beds with such care, handing them down from one generation to another, that it is hard for western scholars to get a chance to see the remains en situ; but the bones themselves can be had readily at the drug store. They are as helpful to westerners as they are to the Chinese!</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The principal value of fossils is to disclose the wisdom of the Creator and to establish the truth of the record which He has left for the guidance of mankind. The Diplodocus, eighty-four feet long; the Stegosaurus, large as an elephant, and with an enormous plate of armor, and other even larger creatures discovered in Tanganyika and elsewhere, were perfectly adapted to life on the earth before the advent of man. They were built to live in an atmosphere highly charged with carbon, and their systems could endure the shocks of falling mud and rocks. The fossil reptile in Tanganyika is estimated to be 160 feet long. Such reptiles would be out of place how.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Millions of the fossil remains now in the earth were caused by the flood of Noah’s day. In northern Siberia an antelope was found embedded in the ice. It had green grass in its stomach, which proved that its death occurred suddenly while it was feeding. Similarly, a mastodon was found imbedded in ice with food between its teeth. Parts of this mastodon were eaten by dogs and even by human beings, showing that it had kept perfectly during the four thousand years it was in cold storage. Eventually the students of fossil remains must recognize the Flood, and the Creator who sent it; but oh, how they hate to do it I</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">O</span><span class="font9">N PAGE 584, your issue of June 12, you say: “Every piece of labor-saving machinery put in operation is liable to cause a death by suicide. Human beings are slow to adapt themselves to changed conditions of employment.” There is no mystery about this. So long as we fix prices by a method that </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">puts a price on what is not human work,</span><span class="font9"> will not every increase in efficiency add to consumers’ costs without adding anything to the v<sup>r</sup>orkers’ pay? A monetary system that compels some to work to pay for what is not human work necessarily compels others to receive human work without working in return. In other words, putting a price on what is not human work enables some to </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">own </span><span class="font9">for an income while it compels others to </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">earn, </span><span class="font9">but not get, that income. That is the relation of suicide to unemployment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The following is the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Equitist</span><span class="font9"> solution of these problems:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Freedom must be either equal or unequal; unequal freedom gives privileges to some and oppression to others: where people are equally free, some cannot rule others; and, therefore, the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">sole political function </span><span class="font7">is to maintain equity. Equity is equal freedom— equality of opportunity to live free, natural lives.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We believe that this natural freedom can be most quickly and effectively attained by the maintenance of common ways—those portions of the earth that can not be held in the exclusive possession of some with-</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">Labor-saving Machinery and Suicide</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">(By W. E. Brokaw, Editor of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Equitist) </span><span class="font7">out infringing the equal freedom of others—at public</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">expense (international at international expense; national at national expense; local, at local expense) ; that this expense should be apportioned equally per capita to all the adult inhabitants, because maintaining equal freedom necessarily benefits all equally.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We believe that, since this expense consists solely of human work, all public expenses should be met by the issue of checks, on the basis of one monetary unit (dollar in the U. S. A., pound in the British Commonwealth, franc in France, mark in Germany, etc.) for each hour of adult human work, and signed by the proper administrators, in some such form as this:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Manager..............................Bank: Charge to the account</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">of (name of municipal or other administration) $...........</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">in favor of............................................................</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">(signed by the proper official) ................................</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">That all common ways should be free for the equally free use of all persons to operate their own vehicles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We believe that this will secure equal freedom in the use of the earth, provided the people adopt the same kind of checks in their private dealings, and, therefore, all other political arrangements be discarded.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Individuals should be free to meet their expenses by checks on their Mutual Banks, on the above named basis, in such form as:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Manager..............................Bank: Charge to my account</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">$..................in favor of.................................. (signed) ........................</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When equitable exchange is adopted, people will form small group banks, limiting the size to a number that proves most satisfactory and elect a manager, by concurrent voting. Each member will deposit with, the manager a pledge, agreeing to redeem all his checks in work on the hour-unit basis, and to honor the cheeks of the other members. Persons forming partnerships will deposit part of their security pledges as firm pledges and part as personal pledges, for convenience in drawing checks. Each member will draw checks on his own group bank, instead of issuing personal notes. There will be no bank-note or other currency. Every adult, on coming of age, will register and deposit his pledge in such a bank.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Every individual and every public administration being thus able to have a bank account, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font7"> exchanges would be by means of checks and bookkeeping. Postal and other money order systems will be unnecessary. Thus a </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">perfect credit system</span><span class="font7"> will entirely supersede the present semi-barter system.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When the system is adopted by more than one country an international clearing. house can be established through which international balances can be adjusted. Thus a worldwide hour-for-hour exchange system would be established.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Equitist Mutual Banking will be a simplification and purification of the present banking system, eliminating the predatory elements. It will be the death of usury.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The registry records of the Mutual Banks would furnish a complete and accurate, perpetual and inexpensive, census for apportionment of the expenses of the various political divisions, which would be according to the adult population. It would show the residence of each person from coming to age to death or emigration, and be a part of the regular expense of each Mutual Bank, which, of course, would be met by per capita apportionment among the members.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Equal freedom in the use of the earth will secure equal opportunity for all persons to “life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Getting a living, a competence, comforts and luxuries will then be as easy for one as for another: that is, it can be obtained by working the same length of time, thus permitting an equal amount of leisure time for each.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Acquiring these things will then become merely incidental to the attainment of intellectual satisfaction, and cease to be the aim and object of life. What is easily obtainable by everyone no one will struggle for. When all are free to use their own credit, through their own checking account, and to employ themselves as they choose, “money-getting” will cease, and excess possessions will have no attraction. Then those who are most worthy—who do the most for humanity or set the best examples of living—will be most esteemed, and greed will be unknown except in history.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">With the Merit Incentive thus established—having supplanted the money incentive—-the individual desire of each person will be sufficient restraint to prevent infringement of the equal freedom of others. Hence, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">no</span><span class="font7"> repressive or punitive legislation will bo needed. There will be no occasion for any coercion other than that of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">reason—</span><span class="font7">convincing by argument.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This means reducing political activities to a minimum. It means the end of human strife, and, consequently, of legislation. It puts politics with mathematics, as a completed science.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The consequence of this change from the dominance of the money (profit, or acquisitive) incentive to th® dominance of the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">merit</span><span class="font7"> incentive involves the abandonment of injurious customs and habits of thought and life, and the adoption of rational ones. To most people these are undreamed-of possibilities. The vast majority of the work of the world today is injurious or unnecessary to human welfare. That alone takes far more time than all the really necessary work of human life and happiness requires.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">What we propose,</span><span class="font7"> therefore, will, in brief:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Enable </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">everyone</span><span class="font7"> to obtain all the land he can put to its best use, without the payment of either purchase price or rent, or any other consideration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Enable </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">everyone</span><span class="font7"> to use all the credit each needs, without the payment of interest, or any other consideration :</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Fix the price</span><span class="font7"> of every product at the adult human </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">work cost of production</span><span class="font7"> (which includes distribution), thus displacing “supply and demand” from their present abnormal function of price-fixing and restoring them to their true function of determining when, where, how and by whom all producing shall be done:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Make all natural resources </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">free from price,</span><span class="font7"> and thus—•</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Distribute Nature’s bounties </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">equitably,</span><span class="font7"> distribute public expenses </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">equitably,</span><span class="font7"> and thereby do away with rent, interest, profit and taxes:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Securing equality of opportunity to all natural persons, making “getting a living” easy for </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">everyone, </span><span class="font7">and replacing the present “love of money” with the desire to gain the respect and esteem of others </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">by meriting it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In order to introduce this into the present political structure of any country the laws should be so changed as to provide that every monetary unit (fraction or multiple therefore) paid out by the Government shall be issued only for direct and embodied adult human work, at the rate of one unit for each hour of such work involved therein; and every unit received by the Government for the payment of its expenses shall be issued on the same basis; that all Government expenses shall be met by cheeks issued in some such form as outlined above and shall be apportioned among the people in proportion to the sane adult population, and that all conflicting laws be thereby repealed; and that all individuals and firms shall be permitted to conduct their affairs on the same basis.</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">F</span><span class="font9">IFTY-EIGHT million dollars annually for bribery is the nice little sum which the Power Trust has been spending to make itself solid with the American people. Of this, thirty millions were expended by the trust itself, and twenty-eight millions by the individual power companies. Debauchery of schools, of editors, and of the public mind generally, by propaganda against public ownership, together with intimidation and corruption of public servants in legislatures and elsewhere, now stands plainly revealed in all its hideousness, and the Power Trust is now in position where they can ask Tweed’s question, “What are you going to do about it?” The half of the rascality of this bunch has never been told.</span></p>

Those who have been accustomed to getting their beer at Cassidy’s speakeasy will now have to patronize some other of the 32,000 which remain open; that is, they will unless some of Cassidy’s friends finance the old place for the widow.

Dr. Ainslie goes on to say: “The United States Government pays the churches of this country more than $2,000,000,000 annually to check crime and set up moral standards. By this I mean that all church properties are exempt from taxation to that extent. It is a solemn covenant between the Government and the churches.

<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Legal Motor Speeds</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">TN RHODE ISLAND posters along the routes say, “If you can not make thirty-five miles an hour keep off the road.” In a western state a magistrate has just fined a motorist for running only fifteen miles an hour and thus impeding traffic. In Prague, Bohemia, it is against the law to run more than nine miles an hour. The law is obeyed and there are no casualties.

Any one of these employers would doubtless be quick to call upon the state for help if they thought there was any danger of their employees’ doing anything illegal against the firm. They seem to think the law works in only one direction, and often, indeed, it is only too true that such is the case.

<p><span class="font9">HD </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">HAT </span><span class="font9">was a brilliant idea of Bernarr Mac-Fadden’s when he sent a perfectly sound, physician-certified, healthy young man to twenty-six highly ethical licensed physicians of New York for a physical examination. The 100-per-cent healthy young man came back with the reports from those physicians that he was suffering from twenty-six different diseases, and </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">he </span><span class="font9">had in his possession twenty-six different prescriptions for the treatment of the imaginary diseases.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Pajamas Legal for Street Wear</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A COURAGEOUS North Carolina editor wore a suit of pale blue rayon pajamas on the street during the hottest part of dog days this season, and the chief of police arrested him. Probably the chief was jealous of the man, of his courage, and of his coolness. Anyway, the thing came up before the mayor, and that dignitary showed that he was made of the right mettle. He said that he had scoured the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of the State of North Carolina, and so far as he could discover there was nothing in either instrument that would prevent a man who had the courage from wearing his pajamas on the street in hot weather; and moreover (and this must have been discouraging to his chief of police) he declared that if he had the courage he would do so himself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Men Gradually Getting Sense</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">TT</span><span class="font9"> SEEMS hard to believe it, but the men, some of them, are gradually getting some sense as to how to dress. Dr. Gallardo, former trainer of New York police, during the hot w<sup>z</sup>eather this summer has worn BVD’s, socks, sandals, sport shirt, short canvas pants, a ventilated helmet, and nothing more. Dr. Darlington, famous physician, Tammanyite, has been going around dressed in BVD’s, socks, sandals, trousers with suspenders and a thin coat, but no shirt. One thing is certain: either the shirt or the coat must go; and the long pants must give way to short ones, with bare shins. Why not? Dr. Darlington, defending himself, says, “It formerly took the wool from four sheep to clothe a woman; it now takes one silkworm.” He probably stretched that a little, but it shows that the men are learning and that there is hope of real intelligence breaking in on them after a few years more of deep thought on this clothing proposition. Meantime the women are all laughing at us.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">H</span><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">enry Ford points out that now when the government wants a $30,000,000 public improvement it spends that amount for the improvement and $36,000,000 more in interest which it pays to somebody else. Ford wants to know why, when the government wants a $30,-000,000 improvement, it can not go ahead and print enough $20 bills and $10 bills to pay for* the job, then put the plant in operation and out of its earnings retire the entire $30,000,000 without paying a cent of interest to anybody. There is no answer to Henry’s question, but there are 36,000,000 reasons why it will not be adopted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Worth as Much as Decoy Ducks</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">I</span><span class="font9">T SEEM^l. that the real reason the United States is' to build fifteen tremendously expensive cruisers is not because the cruisers would be of any value to the people of the country for whom they are to be built, but because Big Business has billions tied up in shipyards and wishes to have a profit on the money. On this subject Hon. Gerald P. Nye said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Those forces which are engaged at this time in encouraging- us. to build a number of cruisers, are encouraging us to expenditures for things which, in time of war, would not be worth fifteen decoy ducks. If we will be fair with ourselves, the next war will make a cruiser or a battleship worth just as much as a decoy duck. But in the interests of the shipbuilders we must proceed with the shipbuilding program. .That seems to be the theory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Official Car Graft</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">TpOR more than a generation it has been ille-gal for railroads to haul the private cars of other railroads over their lines without requiring the full payment for the car and all in it, yet the practice has never been discontinued. The Interstate Commerce Commission has now denounced this once more. Multitudes of business men and pleasure-seekers have been taking advantage of their acquaintance with officers of railways to get around the country for nothing; panhandlers, bums, tramps, in fine clothing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">All the Boys Need Is Guidance</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A FIRE in the House of Refuge, where 490 boys 12 to 20 years of age are prisoners of our civilization, breaks out in the cupola of one of their prisons, eight stories above the ground. With alacrity, but in perfect order, these boys climb a narrow stairway, make proper hose connections and put out the fire twenty minutes before the fire companies arrive. Looks as if it might be a good investment to take some of the opportunities away from the Power Trust and invest American boys with them.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">&quot;D everend Wagner, a Methodist pastor in New York city, on learning that Russia and China were on the brink of war, made the declaration that war is murder. So it is. But during the World War the Methodist church was blatantly and openly for w<sup>T</sup>ar, and it was murder then as much as it is now. The point is, When did the Reverend AVagner find out the truth on this subject? If he was silent on the subject in 1917 he should be silent now. Nobody wants to listen to a man who confesses he was for murder in 1917 but is not for it now.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">O’&quot; INC Meta Arsenite, a new wood preserva-tive, penetrates the fibres of the wood, and yet can not be leached out by rain or other weather influences. It is destructive to all insects and organisms of decay, and wood treated with it can be painted as readily as if untreated. The economic value of this wood preservative can hardly be overestimated. If it will do what is claimed for it, it means the preservation of our forests and watersheds, because railroad ties and other timbers exposed to the weather can be preserved much longer than at present.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font10"><a name="bookmark19"></a>Items of Interest from Newfoundland </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">By Andrew Horwood</span></h3>
<p><span class="font14">N</span><span class="font9">EWFOUNDLAND experienced one of the mildest winters in its history. In St. John’s and vicinity motor traffic was still in full sway when midwinter was well past. The thermometer had not yet dropped to zero, and at noon, February 9, it stood 40 degrees above. This may surprise some of our nearby neighbors, who think we live in the land of perpetual frost and snow. Winters seem to have lost their sting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It is many years since the white blanket of snow was spread about the first week in December and lifted again some time in April by the returning sun and warm rain. Early in February we had a three days’ northeaster, and it did not bring either frost or snow. The question is continually being asked, in the press and out, “Is the climate changing?” Everybody knows it is; but why?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The late fall brought a complete change in. the personnel of the government, to the surprise of people who still credit old methods. The outgoing government had by far the greater part of the weight of the press, and no small share of the pulpit. With one or two exceptions the “business” community threw all its strength in their favor. They had unlimited “campaign funds” and, to use their own words, “a moral issue”; and, with all their advantages, they lost. The winners had scarcely sufficient campaign funds to pay for telegrams. They issued no written manifesto. Their candidates were men .whose combined wealth would not make one fortune ; but they caught the ear of the people, and the votes too.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The outstanding feature of the political campaign was the introduction of a new method of making people listen to propaganda. People who could not or would not read the papers, people who scorned to attend a political meeting, were induced to give ear to a phonographic record, which had been made for the purpose, a few well chosen words by the leader calculated to stir the people, and some free advertising by the hostile press, and nothing could stem the tide of the record.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The people are enjoying a measure of prosperity this year. Cod-fishing is the staple industry, and prices were for the first time in years such as would give the toiler a fair return for his labor. If fishing is good, trade is bright. If trade is bright, there is work to do, and so the whole country benefits by the producer’s being paid for his work. Wonder why everybody doesn’t know that?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">More and more the attention of capital is being attracted to this “poor little country” which happens to hold in its bosom vast stores of minerals, sufficient to make every individual within it a millionaire, provided, of course, that no one got any of the other fellow’s share.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Paper manufacturing, is going on at a great pace, and is a real boon to the country. The vast forests of spruce are being turned into newsprint at a marvelous rate. The International Paper Company is making the Humber river hum; while the Anglo-Newfoundland Development Company is exploiting the exploits. The new premier has promised to put a gang on the “Gander”, making paper before the end of his. term. If people quit reading the papers it will hit Newfoundland hard.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Before this is read the annual slaughter wall be taking place on the ice that the Arctic current brings with it in March. Each year from one hundred thousand to three hundred thousand seals are brought in. The men who slay them have had one-third of the fat for their share, while the ship owners and outfitters have had two-thirds of the fat and all the skin. Just now the man who jumps from one pan of ice to another on the ocean, in chase of a dog hood, thinks he ought to have part of the skin as well as one third of the fat, particularly when he is instructed to take all the young he can get, as the skin is more valuable on the young than on the old seals. However, the people in Newfoundland are “no strikers”, and it is not likely there will be any scarcity of hardy fishermen to don oilskins, rope and gaff, to reap the harvest of the frozen ocean.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It seems a pity that some radio broadcasting company does not take advantage of the geographical position of Newfoundland. There is one small station here that operates regularly; and that is controlled by a church organization. With any kind of a decent receiving set one can tune in on Europe or America at pleasure, with good results. During the war the British navy used St. John’s as a wireless center. It seems to us that soon this little island will have an important place in the radio world; and who knows but the Truth will be told over the air from Newfoundland that will awake both the Old and the New World.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font10"><a name="bookmark21"></a>Some Glimpses of Shanghai </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">By T. A. H. Claris</span></h3>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">A</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">LMOST </span><span class="font9">every morning (the Palace Hotel being near the waterfront) I am awakened by the song, “Heigh-ho; ho-ho; heigh-ho . . </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">A </span><span class="font9">which is the sort of chant of the coolie laborers. Whether they do it to keep step with each other, whether to warn passers-by, or whether to lighten their burdens, I have not found out. They carry a bamboo poljg which rests on the shoulders (as you will have seen from pictures), on which they carry loads. It seems to me an excellent way. In our countries the men just take a heavy case and roll it over and over on the ground, sometimes banging it about a good deal; whereas the Chinese just sling it on bamboo and transport it noiselessly. They seem to be able to transport almost anything by this method. And work! New York, with all its bluff and pretense, simply isn’t in it. These people work very hard, and seem to enjoy it. They get next to nothing by way of pay, but all the same they seem happy enough.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">I met a small boy in our building here the other day, a youngster of about seven. He was trudging along with a bamboo pole with a couple of small bags of sand, and he was singing “Heigh-ho; ho-ho ...” I suppose he thought he was what is called in vulgar parlance a “regular guy”! Even Mrs. Murphy’s baby has got the idea, and sings “Heigh-ho ...”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It is most interesting to stand on the bridge and watch the life on the junks passing by. Each one has its family; and they all take a turn on the big oar. They have a very ingenious method of wmrking it. The principal method of propulsion is with a bamboo pole (nothing is done here without bamboo) which is pushed down to the bottom of the water. The small kids on the junks and sampans know enough to say “Throw money”, or if they don’t they make a sign which means the same thing. It’s great fun to chuck ’em coppers. There are lots of beggars, of course; and one can do a tremendous lot of “charity” at a very small cost. There is “big” money and “small” money here. For instance, to pay a Mexican dollar with “small” money, one has to give six twenty-cent pieces and some coppers. The consequence is that one’s pockets soon get weighted down with a pound of copper. I usually give it away immediately to the next beggar I see; and he appreciates it, no matter how little it is. Twenty-six coppers (the size of a British penny) go to make up ten cents! I don’t know why copper is so depreciated. I remember one night running across a poor old shriveled-up woman sitting on the sidewalk. She did not see me coming, but I suddenly dropped about twenty coppers into her hand, and oh my! it must have been a golden rain for her, she was so delighted. And the whole lot cost me less than ten cents Mexican, i.e., less than five cents gold!! In the interior of China they have still smaller coinage (the cash); and so you can imagine how small their dealings are.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Some of the women here wear trousers, and some of them wear skirts; some of the men wear trousers, and some of them trousers with a sort of overall which gives the appearance of a skirt. In the cold weather they wear padded clothing, which makes them look very plump, something like a sort of walking upholstered armchair!</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The central streets have a serious traffic problem. The sidewalks are apparently about six inches and three-quarters wide (or so it seems); and what with ricksha coolies, autos, etc., one has to be very careful. When I go out into the “suburbs” I usually take a ricksha through the crowded part (mostly Chinese), and then walk. The Chinese districts, of course, are most picturesque, huge signs with Chinese lettering giving quite a grotesque appearance. The Chinese are like flies, all over the place; withal they are a very decent bunch, good-mannered and polite. Nevertheless, one likes to get away from them at times, but this is quite difficult. Shanghai is like a huge beehive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">On the night when our tender was accepted, I was invited to a dinner at the house of an important merchant here, all of our local associates, including the head of the most important British house (Sassoon &amp;&nbsp;Co.), being present, as well as the manager of Mitsui &amp;&nbsp;Co., the Japanese bankers who are in with us on the deal. The affair passed off very well, and I much enjoyed it. The wives of two Japanese were present, and I must say that I did admire them so much in their picturesque native costumes; I could hardly keep my eyes off them. They are certainly dainty little people. I was talking to the manager of the cable company the other day at lunch, and asked him (he having lived in Japan) if the Japanese ladies are as modest and demure as they look. He said they are. and</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">that they are taught that their mission is “to look after the men”, which seems quite all right to me. From what I saw of Japan (and. I hope to see it again), I fancy I would much rather live there than here. Shanghai is all right, but it’s very limited—limited to the international and French settlement boundaries; that is, there is not too much freedom. However, we took an automobile drive one Sunday afternoon right out into China proper, away outside the settlement boundaries. The country is very nice, and apparently well cultivated. Along the roadway one sees little hills which are tombs. Sometimes they are built of mud, like a sort of dog kennel. I should imagine they’re very comfortable, provided the rain does not come in through a leaky roof! We saw some Chinese churches, or whatever they call them. I am told that most of the people don’t know what they are, whether Buddhists, Shin-toists, or what, and that if they don’t get the right result from one god they chuck him and appeal to another, until they get what they want.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">I forgot to say that the coolie class, and others here, work seven days a week: Sunday makes no difference to them: it’s just one long, unending toil. Of course those in the foreign establishments do not. However, they make up for it at New Year (in February), when they take a solid two weeks off. The Nanking Government has been trying to put an end even to that. It seems to me that what these people want (I mean the poorer classes) is: First, better food (the stuff they eat is atrocious-looking stuff); second, a little more money to spend; and third, a little more time for rest. However, as I have said, in spite of it all, they seem very cheerful, and even happy. Certainly they are diligent and industrious. I should like to be allpowerful and give them those three things right away; and I am sure they would appreciate them, for, in spite of what some people say about them, I feel that they are human people, people one would like to help and raise up a bit. One sees women, and girls, pushing on the big oar on the junks; they never seem to idle. It might be said that it is cruel. I can’t see it, for it is not excessively hard work; and they must be strong in a way that would put the average city girl to shame. The Chinese is an excellent cook in preparing meals such as we like to have, but the stuff they themselves eat is appalling-looking muck. I fancy I could use a chopstick myself now, although I have never fried. Of course, for soup it would be impossible; but their diet is mostly rice, chopped meat and vegetables. They use little round bowls which they hold up to their mouths, and just shovel the stuff into their faces as fast as they can.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The other day, walking along, there suddenly presented himself before my pathway a small boy juggling ferocious-looking knives in a very expert manner. He had three of them which he managed to throw in the air and catch, all while he was walking backward. He certainly was an expert. A few coins soon sent him away smiling. However, he has turned up two or three times more, and is getting to be a nuisance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Shanghai is called 'the Paris of the East’. People from the Philippines and other places come here to “have a good time”, which seems to consist mostly in being up all night at parties and drinking cocktails without limit. In general, the Shanghai people are a pleasureloving lot.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">My observation in the hotel shows that one cocktail is hardly ever drunk; it is usually three oi’ four. Even the young girls take them regularly; and I think there’s hardly a woman in the hotel who does not smoke. Shanghai is a place that seems to be perfectly oblivious to the serious things of life; it devotes itself, when not at work, to a round of parties, theaters, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Out in the river are a score or so foreign warships, including the big U. S. S. “Pittsburgh”. A large British ship has just left. There are French, Italian, and Japanese boats. Sailors are all over the place; on shore, foreign troops are everywhere. One day I saw six “tanks” (French) passing through the streets. Another day, a whole British regiment marched past the hotel. I had not seen a British regiment march for a very long time, and it was certainly a most imposing sight. But behind it all, the phase that is not spoken of, is legalized and organized murder which has brought sorrow to millions! Shanghai, therefore, is pretty well guarded. It is the “plum” of cities in China, and no doubt the Chinese would like to see the foreigner out of it. However, the foreigner has made Shanghai and its trade what they are; and I don’t imagine the powers will surrender it without a struggle—certainly not until China gets a stable government, if it ever does. Away in the interior provinces of China, millions at this time are starving, and it looks as if a huge calamity were almost unavoidable; for it seems that as soon as the people get any money, the military leaders tax it out of them for their armies. It looks as though nothing effective could be done until the new kingdom is established in the earth, which will put militarists and other oppressors of the people where they belong and yill bring order out of chaos.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">On the boat I talked to an American lady coming out as doctor in a Chinese women’s hospital here. I invited her to dinner at the hotel, and in return she invited me to tea with the other lady doctors at the hospital. She has necessarily to learn Chinese, and tells me that she does not find it too difficult. On the other hand, I was talking to a young American lawyer who has been here some time, and he told me he W’ould never do it again, it was so difficult. It is unlike most languages, in that one has to learn not only the signs, or ideographs (the written language), and what they stand for, but also the spoken language, in addition to which there is the linking together of the written and spoken language, which has to be taught to one, as of course the signs themselves do not give any idea of pronunciation as do our Roman characters. It seems that the sign language is built around a “root” or “stem”, and that, in reading, one has to pick out the root and then add to or take from it according to the rest of the structure. In this it resembles, to an extent, our own languages. Take, for instance, Spanish, using the verb </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">“tener”</span><span class="font9"> (to have). The root here is </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">“ten&quot;,</span><span class="font9"> and the different parts of the verb are </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">“tengo, tengas, tenga; tengamos, tengais, ten-gan; tiene, tienen”,</span><span class="font9"> etc., etc., some being irregular. Chinese written language is read down the column instead of across. There are five “tones”, the same word having quite different meanings in each “tone”. It is entirely monosyllabic. A Chinese from Canton will not understand another from Peking. Most foreigners learn Mandarin, which is the official language. In names of persons, the surname usually comes first; e.g., “Li Ti Sing,” “Li” being the surname; in other words “Smith, George, John”. When a person or a firm starts dealing with the people here, it is necessary to acquire a Chinese name. This is a matter for some little study by a literary man, as, of course, an English name can not be translated into Chinese. An entirely new name has to be devised suited to the person or firm, their characteristics, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">I have not made any attempt to pick up any Chinese, as I am not likely to have any use for it, and it is a serious study. How<sup>T</sup>ever, I should much like to learn it, merely as a matter of interest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“To lose face” is quite an expression here, which means to lose prestige. We talk about “saving one’s face”; but if you “lose face”, you lose dignity or standing, as it -were; in other words you get a “dirty deal”, apply it whichever way it suits best. “Can do” and “No can do” are useful appendages of “pidgin English”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The following is a rather good description of Shanghai, which appeared in the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Montreal</span><span class="font9"> Gazette just before I left New York:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">SHANGHAI THE UNIQUE</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Shanghai, the great seaport of Kiangsu province, China, lies on the edge of a low, flat and intensively cultivated area traversed by water courses. The native quarter was made a city in 1360, and is surrounded by Avails three and a quarter miles in circumference, in which, there are six gates. The European quarter, commercial Shanghai, is north of the native city, and occupies over nine square miles. The American quarter is within the British municipality. At present, Shanghai is in a transition period following the recent Avar.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Shanghai of today is a breath-taking spectacle. NoAvhere else in the world can you sec two million people huddled together more closely, moving about more constantly, wasting money more lavishly, serving industry more slavishly, chasing pleasure more frantically. It is a city worthy of the study of economist, philosopher and psychologist: a happy hunting-ground for the theorists, a marvelous demonstration of the effects of the contact betAveen East and West.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The traffic problem alone is one that baffles experts. In the narrow streets, tramears thunder, with a constant clanging of warning bells, reinforced by the voice of the driver when conditions get very mixed. Great busses turn and squirm around impossible corners; motors dash along past standing tramcars, grazing the crowds who choose to walk in the gutters, bringing up with a screech of four-wheeled brakes as a ricksha coolie suddenly dashes across the road in front of them to pick up a ten-cent fare.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Rickshas trail around everywhere, the men searching the crowds anxiously for fares. Motor trucks of all sizes and descriptions roar through the croAvds. Through all this mixture of fast and slow traffic the barroAV men ply, with straining muscles and tense faces striving to balance and push their huge loads on their onc-Avheeled barrows. It takes either nerve or ignorance to trust oneself to a ricksha in all this excitement and muddle; one feels oneself at the mercy of a half-fed countryman with only the vaguest notion of traffic regulations and a perennially hopeful disposition, whose previous experience of fast traffic has probably been a water buffalo at a lumbering trot. And all this is complicated by tremendous crowds of pedestrians, who get pushed off the narrow footpaths into the road, and who amble contentedly across the streets looking neither way before crossing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The composition of the crowds in the streets is very interesting. There are obviously many Germans, their fair skins and hair very noticeable among the darkhaired Chinese. There are also many more Russians than formerly, especially women. There was a big influx of these from the North last year, when troops began to pour into Shanghai. British and Americans are for the most part in motor cars; they represent the prosperous and settled part of the foreign community. Plenty of Sikhs are in the streets, most of them employed as police or watchmen. A few Parsee women belonging to the small business Parsee group give a note of colour in their goldedged saris. Japanese men there are in plenty; but women are seen mostly in the Japanese quarter where they do their shopping, centred around the large Japanese school, where one may sometimes watch a hundred or so small boys being put through their drill, equipped with toy rifles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But the chief interest of Shanghai is its Chinese population. Shanghai is the gay city, the Paris of China, the setter of fashion, the shopping centre, the great silk market, the place of gorgeous theatres, grand restaurants, the most fascinating sing-song girls, the most numerous dance halls, the biggest greyhound courses, full of all sorts of Western and Chinese luxuries, and above all, the place of safety from bandits, taxation, wars, and other of China’s perennial worries. Everyone with money to spend comes to Shanghai. Government officials succumb to its lures and have to be coerced back to work. It is a glittering and feverish city with a genuine Lorelei attraction for young China. Its fashionable women must account for half the lipstick consumption of the world. A very potent cerise seems to be the correct shade at present. Well-applied rouge of every shade—the art of make-up is old in China—helps to hide the pallor that results from frequent all-night sessions at mahjong, which is more popular than ever, and played for enormous stakes. A new kind of male flapper has recently made its appearance in Shanghai. It wears a very bright blue suit, with gay tan shoes, carries </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font7">swagger cane, sports a large and curly-brimmed hat, and has what can be described as a dead face. Deadly pale, unanimated, with lack-lustre eyes and a dropped chin, these boys present a truly dreadful spectacle. They are literally worn out with dancing all night and working all day. Dancing is very new and intoxicating. Within the last eighteen months, dozens of dancing halls have opened all over the city where rows of young girls wait to be hired as partners. A dollars’ worth of tickets entitles the holder to six dances, and his partners certainly earn their small percentage. They dance from nine o ’clock to daylight with almost no intervals. Probably every one of these girls has </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font7">mother who never spoke to a man outside of her immediate family before her marriage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The underworld of Shanghai would provide </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">ma</span><span class="font7">terial for an unending number of sensational stories. All the crooks in China turn up here at one time </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">or </span><span class="font7">other. Super-bandits, small-fry, ex-politicians, gunrunners, opium smugglers, drug traffickers, kidnappers, ‘red light’ procurers, armed robbers, all combine to keep the police busy. Kidnapping is a favorite method to quick money just now, and many wealthy Chinese are educating their children at home rather than run the risk of sending them daily through the streets to school. One of the distressing features of this business is the way in which bystanders do nothing to help the victims. They are afraid that if they interfere, they may themselves be marked as the next to suffer. The sight of hundreds of well-dressed and well-behaved Chinese in the public parks recalls the long and bitter opposition to this concession, which ■was only granted last year. Although the oft-quoted sign, “Chinese and dogs not admitted,” was never posted outside the parks, it is a fact that some twenty years ago the notice board at the entrance had on it one section which read, “Chinese not admitted,” and lower down one reading, “Dogs not admitted.” Though the wording has long since been changed, the custom has prevailed till recently, although any disreputable member of any of the races, Japanese, Indian, Russian, European had free entrance. Now that the ban has been removed, it is a pleasure to see the enjoyment which Chinese families and strolling couples take in the open spaces. So far none of the dismal prophecies of the results of opening the parks to Chinese residents in the concessions have come true.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Greyhound racing is attracting enormous crowds here and in other countries, and the amount of money that changes hands at each race is phenomenal even for China, where gambling is an instinct, not merely a habit. So devastating is its effect that already soberer citizens are petitioning the authorities to prohibit it altogether. Mill worker and mill owner, coolie and professor, chauffeur and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Taipan</span><span class="font7"> [head of a foreign house], rub shoulders in the crowds that fill the grounds night after night. It is the most universal sport that has ever come to Shanghai. New movie palaces have gone up all over the city recently, and the type of picture shown there gives one furiously to think, for there is no censorship in China. It is alarming to think what impression of Western civilization these great audiences of China are getting from the riot of crime, horseplay and ostentation which goes to make up two-thirds of the pictures shown. Shanghai at present is displaying what we used to call “post war psychology”. The strain and tension of the past few years have eased up somewhat, and people have gone pleasure-mad, as we did in the West. Meanwhile, side-by side with all this, the great army of mill hands, over 300,000 strong, goes and comes from its 12-hour shifts, and unemployment spreads constantly. This is a curious and rather terrible city, without foundations or traditions,—a business growth, with a huge population all coming from elsewhere,</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">and with little or no chance of growing into a homogenous whole. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Sounds like a pretty terrible place, doesn’t it? Well, I find it very agreeable, although I take no “pleasure” in any shape or form. With me it’s just work, eat, and sleep at eleven p.m. But as I have said before, it is a “friendly” place, which New York is far from being. In the latter place, physical violence stands at every street corner, whereas here I feel perfectly safe. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font10"><a name="bookmark23"></a>Big Business Conspires Against the People </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">By M. P. Sargent</span></h3>
<p><span class="font14">I</span><span class="font9">T HAS recently been discovered that one of the largest and best deposits of limestone suitable for cement manufacture lies in a canyon in the Santa Monica mountains within the city limits of Los Angeles. It is on a tract of several thousand acres belonging to one man. He has been opening high-class residential subdivisions and building many miles of roads and other improvements, using high-priced cement for same.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">He made plans to crush this limestone by a dustless process under water, and to pipe the material in liquid form down the canyon to the ocean and there load barges at night and ship it to a convenient location in the industrial section for a cement mill.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">As soon as his plans became known a great cry was raised in the larger newspapers against the creating of a nuisance and turning a residential section into manufacturing and industry. It happens, however, that the cement deposit is three miles back from any residences and in </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">a </span><span class="font9">canyon unsuited to residences, and the owner is interested in protecting this section from a nuisance as much as any one else, as is evidenced by the process he intended to use.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Petitions were circulated against the project. Action by the city council was under way when the Los Angeles </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Daily News</span><span class="font9"> began publishing the facts of the case and went to considerable trouble to uncover the operations of a great cement trust that exists here. Their findings have been of unusual interest to Los Angeles taxpayers and, I believe, are a true picture of similar operations in other parts of the country, and should be of general interest to all. Their findings are summarized in the following facts:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">First: Some $20,000,000 of the taxpayers’ money is spent annually in Los Angeles for cement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Second: Much of the improvement work, such as opening and widening of streets, dams, sewers, and public buildings, is promoted and inspired by the people who sell cement. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Third: These interests have formed an airtight combine, the operations of which have been set forth in a series of bids of record in the engineers’ office. The bids of half a dozen companies were the same, identically, on each of numerous jobs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Fourth: This combine has been made possible by the passage of the Blockade Ordinance, which</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9">(a) Prohibits all from bidding who have not been selling cement to the city for two years.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">(b) Forbids all breaking of seals on sacks of cement received in Los Angeles, thereby violating the customs laws.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">(c) Requires all cement entering the port of Los Angeles to come in water-proof, paper-lined sacks—an impossible requirement. Much cement used to come here from Holland, but this last requirement has stopped that.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">These facts have been denied by friends of the combine; so today the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">News</span><span class="font9"> has come forward with a photostatic picture of a contract between four of our great cement-producing corporations, duly signed and sealed by authorized officers, to make bids at one price on the new San Gabriel dam that Los Angeles County . purposes to build.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">We rejoice to see the truth published on this, as on all lines, and believe it will help the people to see and appreciate the justice of the new kingdom when in operation.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font10"><a name="bookmark25"></a>“Over There”—-And Over Here! </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">By Will T. Fitch</span></h3>
<p><span class="font14">W</span><span class="font9">E TOUT ourselves as the richest nation in the world, we boast of our prosperity, we pat ourselves on the back as being charitable; and we allow the “boys”, whom the politicians and the clergy sent to make the world safe for investments, to starve on the streets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Are we just a “bunch” of selfish, hypocritical side-steppers? We are! Witness Dan Edwards, one of the two men who received both the “Congressional” and the “Distinguished Service” medals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Full of wounds, sick and jobless, on the “sidewalks of New York” he is stumbled upon by some kind-hearted person and sent to the Veterans’ Hospital.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">He was one of “our boys” in 1918, but he is only a jobless man about whom nobody cares a rap, in 1929!</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">What does the wealth he helped then to protect care about him now? The business men who cheered him then, where are they ? Are they saying, “We’re through with him. There will be plenty more young men when the next war breaks”?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The sad part of it is that they are thinking it, if they are not saying it. Dan, you were a hero then and you’re a hero now, to us, the “common people”. The business men, the politicians, the clergy, care nothing about you, or us. We’ll have to take our medicine as the commoner has always had to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">My reason for writing the above you will find in the following clipping from a local paper, sent from New York city by Universal Service:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Dan Edwards, America’s greatest war hero, is in Veterans’ Hospital, this city, suffering from a nervous breakdown, which, it is understood, was caused by inability to find employment and walking the streets until he almost dropped from exhaustion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Who’s Who in America” rates him among the most distinguished persons in the public eye. He was one of two soldiers in the Army during the late war to get both the Congressional Medal of Honor and the Distinguished Service Cross, Colonel William J. Donovan being the other recipient.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The records of the War Department show that Dan Edwards on May 28, 1918, received nine bayonet and machine gun wounds in his face, body and right leg, and that he remained three days and nights in an advanced position at Cantigny in the face of continual enemy fire, without food or water, and after all of his men were killed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Sent to the hospital for treatment, he escaped and rejoined his outfit, Company “C,” third machine gun battalion, and seven days later was again wounded at Soissons, his right arm being shot off and his left leg lost. With twenty body wounds, and minus an arm and a leg, Edwards killed four of the enemy and captured four, taking the latter with valuable information to his own lines alone.</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">T</span><span class="font9">HERE are at least two varieties of poison gas against which no mask is any protection. Cacodyl isocyanide is in the possession of all the great nations, a gas so frightful that military men admit to reporters that they do not see how they could bring themselves to use it. There are also irritating gases which cause the victim to tear off his mask and thus take a full breath of the poison gas which has previously been laid. Government purchasing agents can take their choice of bombs filled with deadly plague or bacilli, or with anthrax for the extermination of milk cows and horses. Meanwhile the “radium atomite,” just discovered, is a more powerful explosive than T. N. T.; and with a newly invented metal compound “a 400-horse-power aeroplane motor can be built so light that a man can easily pick it up and wmlk with it.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Say that war is declared. Nay, war is only threatened—for he who speaks first speaks last. In Bremen or Calais a thousand men climb into the cockpits of a thousand aircraft, and to each is given a bomb which the pressure of a finger will release, together with instructions as to where, precisely, and at what altitude, that pressure is to be applied. A starting signal, an hour or two of flight, a little veering, dropping, and dodging, as the defense planes rise, a casualty or two as the radium atomite of antiaircraft guns tries vainly to fill a space one hundred miles square and four miles deep, one muffled roar after another as the bombs are dropped per schedule, and so, to all intents and</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">GOLDEN AGE</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">purposes, the civilization founded by William the Conqueror, which gave Bacon, Newton, and Watt to the world, conies, in something like half an hour, to a close. Finished and done, London, Liverpool, Manchester, Bristol, Birmingham, Leeds—each has had its appointed place on the code of instructions, and each now vanishes from the list of habitable places on the planet. (Not even a rat, not even an ant, not even a roach, can survive.) Every power nerve has been cut with explosives; every living thing has ceased to breathe, by virtue of diphenyl chloroarsine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">There is at least one good thing to be said about the next war: it will not keep us long on edge. We shall not have to worry about finding the money for Liberty Bonds, nor wonder whether George is going to get his commission, whether Fred has been transferred to the front line, or Alice is really determined to have her war baby; we shall not have to search our hearts to uproot any vestiges of sympathy or sometime affection for alien enemies. The whole business will be over in a couple of hours. With lungs full of diphenyl chloroarsine, we shall not need to worry about anything ever again.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The United States and Russia, with their great areas, cannot be obliterated with the same praiseworthy dispatch as the other great powers. (England and Japan on their crow’ded islands will obviously be subject to the most efficient extinction.) But a swarm of planes setting out from Toronto could well finish Buffalo, Rochester, Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington, Pittsburgh, Cleveland, Detroit, and Chicago in a reasonably short time. Particularly complete would be the termination of New York. With her bridges and tunnels bombed, her many tall buildings crashing like tenpins, and with her super-congestion, citizens would hardly have time to seize their checkbooks before being summoned to the waiting rooms of the recording angel.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark26"></a><span class="font10"><a name="bookmark27"></a>Vegetable Manures and Stone Meal</span></h3>
<p><span class="font14">W</span><span class="font9">E NO longer get accustomed to one line of reasoning on a subject before somebody comes along and questions the entire line, introducing a completely new view. We would never have supposed that anybody would question the value of animal manures and artificial nitrates; but there are people who do, and tliey are also very definite in their statements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">They claim that animal manure is a soil poisoner, resulting in vermin-infested ground and crops, but that what the soil really wants is the dust of pulverized rocks mixed with leaves, grass, etc., “the eternal maintainer of soil fertility,” to use their own words. The pamphlet of the McCrillis Company, Boston, from wdrich we quote, says in part:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The digging in of leguminous matter enables the gardener to perpetuate fertility in a most natural manner. That is why pea and bean haulm should be cut off, so that the stubble and roots are left for digging into the soil which it enriches. No system of cropping is perfect that does not include the growing of legumes, or nitrogen-gathering crops, the provision of humus makers in the form of uneontaminated green manures, and of bland minerals in their natural state ground to a fine powder alone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Some great stories are told of bumper crops of apples and other fruits by the use of the plant foods above mentioned; and then the startling claim is made that the only kind of manures that are of any value are the vegetable manures, or what they call “green manures”. We quote again:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The chemists and agricultural experts, in their extravagant laudations of chemical extracts and forcing fertilizers, forget that humus is the dominating factor in fertility. Without humus good crops are impossible; and where humus is present, and clean culture minerals in their natural state finely ground alone are fed to the soil, bumper harvests result. When fair crops follow the use of fertilizers, they are not in any way due to the costly chemicals, but to the soil humus. By green manuring, land that once produced only fifteen bushels of grain after three years’ treatment produced over fifty bushels.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">All insect pests and fungoid affections are due to unhealthy, unclean conditions. So long as the latter are perpetuated, so long will the cultivators be plagued by insect pests, fungus, and huge swarms of creeping, crawling, sucking, gnawing, boring, burrowing depredators.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The healthy soil assures the healthy plant or tree, the healthy plant and tree assures the healthy grain and fruit, and the healthy grain and fruit assures the healthy cell, blood, tissue and nerve in the human organism.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark28"></a><span class="font10"><a name="bookmark29"></a>Man the Omnivorous Animal (II) </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">By 0. J. W., Jr.</span></h3>
<p><span class="font9">TT SEEMS that the recent article, “The Omnivorous Animal, </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Man,”</span><span class="font9"> which appeared in </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font9"> No. 251, raised a mild storm of criticism, some favorable and some unfavorable. I am therefore submitting a few additional thoughts at this time, particularly in view of the fact that the main objections raised seemed to be from tender-hearted souls that can not stand the thought of slaughterhouses in the Millennium.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Four out of five protestations which I have seen contained the text, ‘And there shall nothing hurt nor destroy in all my holy kingdom, saith the Lord.’ Even at the present time, animals killed for food are subjected to little or no pain in the process, so advanced have modern slaughtering methods become.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Surely meat that is used for human consumption is not “destroyed”, but </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">used;</span><span class="font9"> and even the waste parts and products of its digestion and assimilation are turned to use as fertilizer and other useful products. A slaughtered animal can not really be properly said to have been either hurt or destroyed, when the matter is reasoned out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">If Jesus Christ came to give Himself a ransom for all the cows, pigs, chickens, and sheep that have died as food for man, to say nothing of the rats, mice, cockroaches, snakes, beetles, worms, scorpions, and ants that have died as pests of man, it w<sup>T</sup>ere far better He had stayed in heaven.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">If the end of death for man means the end of death for the lower creatures, the entire land surface of the globe would be covered with guinea-pigs in three and a half years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">If every elephant, wolf, lion, bear, turtle, bird, dog, cat, and hippopotamus that has died since creation,- were to return to life, it wmuld take the land surface of Africa, piled a thousand feet deep, to hold them. [Maybe.—</span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Editor.}</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">And this does not include the creatures of the sea. A female herring lays very nearly a million eggs in a season, about seventy percent of which are fertile. If the young fry were not devoured by larger fish, and those that grew up caught and eaten by man, in a few years the vast oceans of the world would be choked with the bodies of herring, so that one could walk dry-shod over their backs from Seattle to Australia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">If Jehovah God had it in mind at the beginning of creation to resurrect </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">every</span><span class="font9"> living creature that has died, why did He make such bountiful provision for the reproduction and perpetuation of those creatures that live the shortest time and are killed in the greatest numbers, like rabbits, chickens, fish, and the like?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Wouldn’t the world be a nice place in the Millennium if every louse and bedbug that ever tormented humanity should be reinstated in its old haunts? What opportunity would mankind have then to practise Christianity and win everlasting life? Who would want to live for ever breathing clouds of mosquitoes, as would surely be the case if none ever died? Who could enjoy the fruits of his vine and fig-tree with an immortal tapeworm in his intestines?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Who might reasonably be considered as the most reliable authority on diet, Doctor This, That, or Those, or the Creator of the universe, Jehovah God? I quote the inspired words of Paul: “'Now the spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils; speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared with a hot iron; forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats, which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth. For every creature of God is good, and nothing to be refused, if it be received with thanksgiving: for it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">No Bible Student will deny that these are the “latter times” referred to by Paul in his letter to Timothy, and never in the world’s history, I presume, has there been so much printer’s ink devoted to espousing the cause of total vegetarianism as within the past decade.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Since the arguments against the theory of man’s omnivorousness have so far been weak, and the point is an interesting and important one, as throwing light on human food in the Millennium, and ever after, I shall view with extreme pleasure and gratitude any </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Biblical</span><span class="font9"> proof that man, genus Homo, will cease to use the flesh of clean beasts as his food for ever, and would like to see added to this such other texts as indicate that he will have nothing to do with milk, cream, cheese, eggs, leather, and other animal products thenceforth, for ever and for ever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">True, there are plenty of texts showing that God created herbs and fruit and grains for man (as well as the fish and fowl and beasts), but I shall take off my hat to whoever can produce one which says either that man will stop eating meat or that he will live on fruit exclusively, or both.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Cuts Down Your Appetite far Bleat</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">I</span><span class="font9">T CUTS down your appetite for meat when you read that in 1925 the Chicago health commissioner said to the American Medical Association that “the public is not generally aware that there is no systematic inspection of meats in slaughterhouses. Pickling and boiling can not be relied upon in the home to safeguard against moat parasite infection”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">On February 23, 1918, about the time that the patriots of the country were hounding the Bible Students to jail and prison and some of them to death because they could not see their way clear to participate in the World War, one of the representatives of Armour &amp;&nbsp;Company wrote to another representative of the same compaiijg making the following interesting statements regarding meat being sent to the soldiers at the front:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">'Wilson froze quite a little beef, some out of their own shipments and some they bought. They bought beef from, us at No. 132 North Delaware avenue, that had been wiped up twice before we sold it to them. They bagged it up and shipped it to Now York for freezing. They bought beef from Arch street that was so bad that we bathed it in vinegar and soda before we showed it to them. I think this beef also was shipped to New York for freezing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In September, 1925, before Commissioner George Gordon Battle, a witness testifying regarding the condition of meat offered for consumption in New York city, says of one lot of beef:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">All the glands of the animals were honeycombed with tuberculosis. Even the spleen, the last organ to be infected, was infected in the majority of them. The lungs were gone, the liver was full of tubercular abscesses, the kidneys were affected, the glands were ■ affected, in fact, there w<sup>T</sup>as not a single part of the carcass that was not affected. And yet, those cows on the killing bed in the slaughterhouse were dripping with milk, showing that they had been milked up to the day the farmer let them go, and it was obvious that the milk was consumed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">On January 12, 1915, Swift &amp;&nbsp;Company was fined for having on sale in Nerv York city green, sour, slimy and putrid pork butts. On May 15, 1917, Wilson &amp;&nbsp;Company was fined for having as human food 150 rotten hog livers. On July 1, 1919, Armour &amp;&nbsp;Company was fined for having on sale 1,000 pounds of putrid pork brains. On April 30, 1918, Cudahy Packing Company was fined for having on sale 40 pounds of rotten cooked pork shoulders. Swift &amp;&nbsp;Company was fined sixteen times in New York city in two years on the charge of trafficking in putrid food. The above great packing-houses supply most of the meat for American tables.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">One More for the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Un-Scientific American By Mae Gage</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">T HAVE been a reader of your valuable paper, </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age,</span><span class="font9"> ever since it was first published and have enjoyed it all that time. Now I want to express my appreciation of the good work you are doing in publishing the health articles, also of the truth regarding aluminum kitchen utensils. I was a user of this ware and, like many others, could not understand why ill health persisted even though I was careful of the kind of food I ate, the time of eating, etc., and had been a student of health articles for many years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Upon reading “An Opinion upon Aluminum Kitchen Utensils”, in your paper, I recognized that this might be the cause of my ill health, so discarded my aluminum. This, with the observance of other health suggestions, such as “Good Health Dietetic Bules”, in </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age </span><span class="font9">No. 250, I find myself very much improved.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Previous to my discarding the aluminum, my mouth, in fact the whole digestive tract, seemed seared over, my taste very much impaired as a result, mouth sore much of the time, bowels constipated; I was subject to colds every few weeks and had a long string of ailments, such as low blood pressure, gall-bladder trouble and anemia. Now my mouth is never sore, taste is acute, my bowels are regular, and the gall-bladder trouble is gone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A confirmation of my having discovered the true cause of the seemingly seared condition in my mouth is that each time I eat meals where the food is cooked in aluminum I observe that same condition in my mouth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Let the good work go on. This is an evidence of a real interest in the welfare of the people, rather than a catering to Big Business. You may use this or any part of it as you choose, to help the work along.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark30"></a><span class="font10"><a name="bookmark31"></a>A Dead Fly in the Ointment </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">By H. Sillaway</span></h3>
<p><span class="font14">A</span><span class="font9"> GLOWING- two-thirds-of-a-page advertisement of slow poison, torture and death is what greeted my vision on turning the pages of the April issue of the world’s leading health periodical. Of course it doesn’t read that way to the uninitiated, but, on the contrary, is a bit of kitchenware flattery of the spider-to-the-fly kind, enticing the public to its physical destruction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">And surely there must be something rotten in its back yard when a magazine professedly devoted to the health interests of the people lends itself as the mouthpiece of the spider in the face of the thoroughly proven unhealthfulness of aluminum kitchenware.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It has not been forgotten that this same magazine, in the June issue of 1928, published an article from the pen of Milo Hastings, its food laboratory director, under the heading of '&quot;The Tempest in the Aluminum Teapot”, in which Dr. Betts was sorely made light of in an attempt to make him appear as an ignorant and unscientific scarecrow. In the same issue the editor calls special attention to this article.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Beyond doubt, there is a policy in the stand of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Physical Culture</span><span class="font9"> on the aluminum kitchenware subject. It has never before been its publisher’s method to commit itself on a scientific question pertaining to health, without proven tests. But in this case no attempts whatever were made to test the theory out, but, instead, the opinions of a few pseudo-scientists, who would not be expected to favor the truth on the subject, were consulted. It is evident that for some unexplained reason the truth was not wanted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The value of scientific opinion on any health topic lies chiefly in the explanation of such phenomenon pertaining to it as the average layman needs information on. He may know by experience that a certain thing is poisonous or unhealthful but his scientific training may not be sufficient to determine why. And here is the sphere in which the scientist functions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It requires no scientific training to test out the healthfulness of any product either in food or cooking-ware. The result of its use, not mere scientific opinion, is the ironclad test. If scientific authority supports the results of this test, then good and well; but if not, then it is the scientist who is at fault and his opinion is worthless.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Mr. Hastings’ article on the aluminum question was a piece of shallow logic, and far from a credit to the supposed scientific training of its author. In fact it was nothing more than a strained effort to make Dr. Betts look like forty cents. Science is still in the kindergarten, and the true scientist knows it; and in opposing the theory of another he uses the logic of scientific deduction, instead of the political method of attacks on the mentality and learning of his opponent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Mr. Hastings’ pointed reference to Dr. Betts as </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">‘a</span><span class="font9"> Toledo dentist’ was in an underhanded way to call attention to his profession, well knowing that a majority of people are in a considerable measure ignorant of the real training on the human system a dentist must take before he is granted a diploma. We wmnder if Mr. Hastings has had the advantages in this way that Dr. Betts has had?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">While Mr. Hastings is harping on the lack of learning and the mental inefficiency of others who are before the public it would be well for him to check up behind his own glass door. It may be he won’t find himself so much in advantage over some others in these respects as his aluminum article indicates he seems to think.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Take, for instance, his classing of mineral oil as a food. It would not seem to require a very deep scientific mind to recognize the fact that an indigestible oil would seriously interfere with digestion and food assimilation through the coating of the food particles with it, thus preventing the free access of the digestive fluids to it; and also the detrimental effect of the same coating on the Avails and glands of the stomach and intestinal tract.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">An experiment with mineral oil on an extremely sensitive organism resulted in almost continual gas pains and otherwise bad feelings. Also, there was seemingly a partial paralysis of peristaltic intestinal action, with a loss of desire to stool. Neither was there anything like the elimination of this oil through the bowels that would be expected.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In less than thirty-six hours after stopping this experiment, which was persisted in for some length of time, these symptoms practically ail disappeared. Later it required but two doses of this oil to bring them all back.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Policy was behind Mr. Hastings’ attack on Dr. Betts, rather than any real concern in regard to the truth on the aluminum question or the health interests of the people at large. His effort was merely for journalistic influence in the matter, regardless of the equity of the ends used to attain it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">We have good reasons for assuming that the positiveness of his defence of the “healthfulness” of aluminum kitchenware was not a personal conviction. No doubt Mr. Hastings uses aluminum kitchenware in his own family, if he has one, but if so, this is because he considers his family immune, through perfection of health and constitution, to any unhealthful influence of its use.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The unhealthfulness of aluminum has time and again been absolutely proved. Nor has its harmful effects ever been in the least exaggerated by Dr. Betts or any one else. In fact, the half yet remains to be told; for the use of aluminum products in kitchenware, baking powders and phosphated flours has become quite general, and there are but few who use them who do not manifest at least some of the minor symptoms of their poisonous effects upon their systems.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">To those who are supersensitive to aluminum poisons the eating of one meal cooked in alumi-numware is sometimes sufficient to precipitate the most marked symptoms. My wife and I had an experience of this kind last Easter Sunday. We took dinner &quot;with some friends living in the country who use aluminum kitchenware and who have long been in a state of ill health unmistakably traceable to aluminum poisoning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">There was nothing elaborate about this dinner. On the contrary, it was just a plain, wholesome meal; and as our visit necessitated in the round trip a healthful five- or six-mile walk, our experience of the next day could have but one explanation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The next morning after our visit I left home early for my work. I noted that morning my wife did not appear well, but gave the matter but little thought. I -was not feeling well myself, but this was nothing so unusual with me, as I am suffering from an internal cancerous condition and, as a result, seldom feel exactly physically fit. One of the symptoms of aluminum poisoning with me in the past was spells of light-headedness, with a sinking sensation—a feeling entirely distinct from bilious dizziness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">About the middle of the forenoon I was seized by one of these light-headed spells which momentarily puzzled me to account for, as we no longer use aluminum in the kitchen in food preparation. On returning home I found my wife suffering from a severe attack of sick-headache, with vomiting. Neither of us had anticipated these ill effects from our Sunday dinner.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark32"></a><span class="font10"><a name="bookmark33"></a>Leader of the People</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">[Broadcast from Station WBBR, New York, by Judge Rutlierford.J</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">T</span><span class="font9">HIS morning we consider the campaign immediately preceding the complete establishment of God’s righteous government. That government is being established by the Lord for the benefit of all the nations of earth, and His will is that they shall have notice of His purposes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In every government there is a leader. He has assistants who work together with him under his direction. In the government God is now establishing Jesus Christ is the great Leader of the people, and those who are wholly and completely devoted to God are engaged in the campaign under His supervision.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The everlasting covenant God made with David for a government. That covenant with David, however, is fulfilled in Christ Jesus whom David foreshadowed. When Jesus received the anointing of the holy spirit He became the heir of David the king, and the everlasting covenant applied to Him from that time forward. Why was the covenant made? Among other reasons God’s prophet answers: “Behold, I have given him for a witness to the people, a leader and commander to the people.” (Isa. 55:4) God made the everlasting covenant with Jesus for a throne, and immortality, and it included all the interests of His righteous government on earth. The kingdom interests required Him to be </span><span class="font10">a </span><span class="font9">witness to the name of Jehovah. Pilate said to Jesus: “Art thou a king?” The answer of Jesus was: “Thou sayest that I am a king. To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth. Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice.” (John 18:37) This is proof conclusive that one of the conditions of the everlasting covenant was that He should bear witness to the name of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">To His faithful followers Jesus said: “And I covenant for you, even as my Father has covenanted for me, a kingdom.” Just so surely as Jesus must bear witness to the truth, even so must every one who is in that covenant bear witness to the truth. This is especially true after the Lord comes to His temple. By that covenant Jesus was made the leader of the people. It also follow’s that all who are taken into that covenant must become leaders of the people under the direction of the Head. That leading of the people must be in the -way of God’s righteousness. To be a leader each one must be </span><span class="font10">a </span><span class="font9">faithful witness as opportunity affords. It means also that such leaders must be entirely out of accord with the evil world and its god the Devil. Jesus refused to compromise with the Devil. His followers must do the same thing. As Jesus forgot self and did only as His Father commanded, even so those who are taken into the covenant must forget self and joyfully obey the commandments of the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In this day of distress and perplexity, when the people are suffering under the burdens of unrighteous governments and know not which way to turn, never was there such a blessed opportunity as that given now to the true followers of Jesus to lead the people in the way of righteousness by pointing them to God’s kingdom. It is that righteous government that shall bring relief and everlasting joy to mankind. Some of the anointed ones for a time neglected the privilege of being such witnesses. The Scriptures show that some of these become aware of their negligence and awake to their privileges and then take a part in proclaiming the glad message; and so doing, God bestows upon them His everlasting blessings. (Isa. 59:20, 21) While the Lord progresses with the establishment of His government He says to those whom He has chosen for His witnesses: “I have put my -words in thy mouth, and I have covered thee in the shadow of mine hand, that I may plant the heavens, and lay the foundations of the earth, and say unto Zion, Thou art my people.” —Isa. 51:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The fact that He has put His message in the mouth of these witnesses is conclusive proof that they must be proclaiming His name and His government to those who have hearing ears. This is the part of such in the planting of the invisible, as well as the visible, part of God’s government. It is their privilege and duty to tell the people what the present events mean and how the Lord will establish for them a government that will bring them peace and blessings. In so doing, these associates with Christ Jesus constitute leaders for the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Exalt His Name</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">For years the name of Jehovah has been pushed aside, and not even Christians have known the meaning thereof. Now the followers of Jesus learn that the name of Jehovah signifies His purposes toward His people and that</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">the time has come to exalt His name in all the earth. The exaltation of Jehovah’s name is not for any selfish reason on His part, hut in order that the people might have opportunity to know that He is the Savior and Blesser of mankind and that there is no other means of obtaining life. Through His prophet He indicates the time that such proclamation concerning the exaltation of His name shall begin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“In that day,” when used in the Scriptures, invariably refers to the time when God enters upon the great work in the establishment of His government. God, through His prophet, puts a song in the mouth of His faithful servants, telling them what to sing as He progresses with His great work. The remnant began that glad song shortly after 1918. The song opens with the words: “And in that day thou shalt say, 0 Lord, I will praise thee: though thou wast angry with me, thine anger is turned away, and thou comfortedst me.”—Isa. 12:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Up to that time many consecrated ones had put their trust in men as teachers and leaders. The experiences through which the Lord brought them caused them to see the necessity of putting their trust in Him.-—Ps. 118: 8, 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The prophet continues: “Behold, God is my salvation; I will trust, and not be afraid: for the Lord JEHOVAH is my strength and my song; he also is become my salvation.” (Isa. 12:2) His faithful witnesses realize that Jehovah is all-pov/erful and that His purpose is now to bring His government into action, and they trust Him implicitly and have no fear. They fully appreciate His promise that God preserves those w<sup>T</sup>ho love Him and who are faithful to Him.—Ps. 31: 23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“Therefore with joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of salvation.” (Isa. 12: 3) Water is a symbol of truth. But knowledge of the truth alone does not bring salvation. It is the truth known and </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">used</span><span class="font9"> according to God’s will that brings His approval. A well is a fountain of water. Drawing water from the wells of salvation, therefore, symbolizes the taking from the fountain of truth the great refreshing truths which God provides for His people and using them according to the commandments of the Lord. Only those who receive the truth and hold it in the love of it and obey the Lord’s commandments draw water (truth) from the wells of salvation. Others draw from their own wells. This is shown by the words of the prophet: “For my people have committed two evils; they have forsaken me, the fountain of living waters, and hewed them out cisterns, broken cisterns, that can hold no water.”—Jer. 2:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Then the Lord directs what the faithful remnant shall do: “And in that day shall ye say, Praise the Lord, call upon his name, declare his doings among the people, make mention tha,t his name is exalted.” (Isa. 12:4) These words are not addressed to individuals. The fact that the word “ye” is used shows it is addressed to the company of faithful ones who are anointed of the Lord and who compose the “servant” to whom the Lord has committed the interests of His kingdom.—Isa. 42:1; Matt. 24:45.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The marginal rendering of this text is ‘'proclaim his name among the people’. It is a clear command that the proclamation must he made that the name of Jehovah may be exalted in the minds of the people. Now the name of Jehovah is exalted in Zion His organization. It must be exalted in the minds of others. If now some, claiming to be in Zion, oppose the service of singing forth the praises of Jehovah, that of itself is strong evidence that such are not of the temple class: “In his temple doth every one speak of his glory.”—Ps. 29: 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Then the prophet shows that the “servant” must not be content with singing the song for a while and then ceasing, but he must continue to “sing unto the Lord: for he hath done excellent things: this [make] known in all the earth”. (Isa. 12: 5) This is in exact harmony with the words of Jesus that this good news of the kingdom, God’s kingdom, must be told to all the nations of the earth. In giving forth this message the witnesses are not to assume an apologetic attitude, but with boldness they are to proclaim it. “Cry out and shout, thou inhabitant of Zion: for great is the Holy One of Israel in the midst of thee.” (Isa. 12:6) Those who are really of Zion now see the evidence of God’s early and complete victory over the powers of evil, and with joy they give a shout of triumph in anticipation of such victory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">What are the facts in fulfilment of this prophecy? It is since 1918 that the Lord has brought into action the radio, which He foretold more than 3,000 years ago. (Job 38:35) By means of the radio the good news of the kingdom has been heralded throughout the nations of the earth. Selfish interests, under the control of Satan, use the radio, to be sure. These same selfish interests endeavor to prevent the use of the radio for a wide proclamation of the truth. Jehovah will permit just such use of it as He desires. He could prevent the enemy from interfering, but He does not; and He has good reason for so doing. In His own good way He so arranged that on July 24, 1927, the greatest chain of radio stations ever used on earth up to that time was linked together, and He used it in giving proclamation to the message of good news concerning His righteous government. At that time the evils of Satan’s oppressive government were brought before the people in contrast -with God’s righteous government and the blessings to flow therefrom. This the Lord arranged and had done that the people might have notice of His kingdom and that His name might be exalted in the minds of those who would hear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Because it is God’s will and His due time, a little company of the followers of Christ called Bible Students now employ the radio to proclaim to the people the name and plan of Jehovah God. For this same reason they print and publish books and go from house to house and place these books in the hands of the people at a minimum cost. They engage in the service, not for money, but because it is the greatest privilege and joy to serve the Lord and His King and to carry this message of good news to the people. Just -who the individuals are that go to make up the remnant, no man can say. “The Lord knoweth them that are his.” (2 Tim. 2: 19) It is not necessary for man to know. To those who continue faithful to the end God has promised to give a name that will be known only to the Lord and to the one who receives the name. (Rev. 2:17) Thus He shows the sweet and confidential relationship between Himself and those who are faithful to Him. Those now on earth, being the last members of the body of Christ, of course constitute, as the figure shows, the “feet of him”; and to those that continue faithfully in the service of the Lord He says: “How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that publish-eth peace; that bringeth good tidings of good, that publisheth salvation; that saith unto Zion, Thy God reigneth! Thy watchmen shall life up the voice; with the voice together shall they sing; for they shall see eye to eye, when the Lord shall bring again Zion.”—Isa. 52: 7, 8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Vengeance</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The anointed ones of the Lord now on earth are commanded to declare the day of the vengeance of God. (Isa. 61:1, 2) The vengeance of Jehovah is not expressed against individuals, but against Satan and his wicked organization by which he oppresses and blinds the people, and against, the instruments that he uses for that purpose. Jehovah’s purpose is to destroy Satan’s wicked wmrks and his organization, and He is now having the witness given making known that fact to the nations. For this reason He discloses to those of the temple class what constitutes the Devil’s organization. It is seen to be a powerful and dreadfully wicked organization which the Lord alone can and will destroy. He lays upon His servants the obligation of declaring His purpose to destroy it. Jesus stated that after the good news of the kingdom has been declared to the people there shall come upon the nations of the earth a time of trouble the like of which was never known, and that it will be the last. That will be the expression of God’s indignation against the evil one and his system. (Matt. 24:21, 22) The period of time during the cessation of hostilities in the world to the time of the final trouble is reserved specifically for the giving of the witness of and concerning God’s purposes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Through His prophet Jehovah declares that He has a controversy with the nations that make up Satan’s organization and that He will destroy such. We may know that, having already ousted Satan from heaven and destroyed his rule there, God will destroy his rule and influence on earth. Such is one of the pre</span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">limin</span><span class="font9">ary works of God’s righteous government. (Jer. 25: 29-36) In that work of destruction Jesus Christ leads the assault. This He does as the mighty executive oflicei’ of Jehovah. (Ps. 110:5, 6) Christ alone is the wine-press that crushes the life out of the evil organization. (Isa. 63:3-5) The part in this great work that is performed by the faithful followers of Christ on earth is that of process-servers. They serve notice by telling the rulers and peoples of earth of Jehovah’s purpose through Christ to destroy the evil organization. (1 John 3:8) Of course Satan knows that the great fight is approaching, but he is so self-centered that he believes he will win that fight. Knowing that the time is short for him to prepare for that fight, he hastens to gather the nations and rulers of earth into a condition for the great battle, in which great battle Satan’s organization will fall, never to rise again; and the name of Jehovah God shall be everlastingly exalted.—Rev. 12:12; 16: 13-16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Ambassadors</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The faithful remnant of the followers of Christ Jesus now on earth are ambassadors of God and His King. These are in the world to represent the Lord. To some it may seem to be inconsistent for these ambassadors to be in the world and yet proclaiming the truth concerning what is about to befall the world. It may be argued that ambassadors are in a country only when both countries involved are at peace and that when war is declared the ambassador withdraws; whereas God’s government is not at peace with Satan’s organization. Such is the rule that obtains in the divisions of the government controlled by Satan. Such is not the rule of the Lord. The Scriptures show that the Lord’s ambassadors are sent to the rulers wdien hostilities exist. Satan’s organization is hostile to God’s organization, and God has declared His purpose to destroy Satan’s organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Christ is God’s Ambassador to bring reconciliation between the people and God because hostilities do exist. The members of the body of Christ are ambassadors participating in that work of reconciliation because the people are hostile to God. In no other way can the words of the Apostle Paul be properly understood. (2 Cor. 5:19, 20) The ambassadors of the Lord </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">are </span><span class="font9">now in the world but not of it. They are authorized to declare in denunciatory terms that which God’s Word says concerning His purpose of manifesting His indignation against the evil system which Satan has builded up. This system being an oppressor of the people, God will relieve the people therefrom and wills that they shall be so told. Paul spoke of himself as an &quot;ambassador in bonds”, and his bonds were placed upon him by Satan’s organization. (Eph. 6:20) All the ambassadors of Christ on earth would now be in bonds except that God has put His hand over them and by His power shields them until the work committed to them is done. When that work of proclaiming His name and purposes is done, then God will take the ambassadors away.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Joy of the Lord</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">While these ambassadors of the Lord are in the world they have much tribulation, even as Jesus foretold. (John 16:33) Their tribulation is caused by the opposers of the message which they are bringing and the work they are doing. These faithful ones, however, like Paul, “rejoice in tribulation,” because such is a token from God to them that they are His anointed saints. (Phil. 1: 27, 28; Rom. 12:12; Acts 14: 22) Those of the remnant class have entered into the joy of the Lord because they see that the time has come for God to vindicate His holy name, to overthrow the oppressor, and to bring peace and righteousness to the earth through His anointed King.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">When, at the end of the long period of waiting, Jesus received the command from His Father to arise and take action against the enemy, that w<sup>T</sup>as </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font9"> time of great joy to Christ the Lord. When He came to His temple and found some whom He approved because of their faithfulness, He invited them to enter into Uis joy. Those who since that time have seen and appreciated that the kingdom is here and that the time has come to vindicate Jehovah’s name, and who continue to love the Lord, have gone forward to their w<sup>T</sup>ork abounding in the joy of the </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Government Music</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Jehovah God has provided music for the new’-born government and His faithful witnesses who delight to sing that music. The Psalms of the Bible are poems set to music. Aside from the Psalms there is very little poetry in existence that is at all worth while. The kingdom or government Psalms are addressed to the “Chief Musician”. It seems clear that the Chief Musician is that section of the anointed class, the members of which have entered into the joy of the Lord, who forget self, who are active in showing forth the praises of the Lord, and who logically take instructions from the Psalms and profit thereby. Though all others seem to forsake the Lord, these trust Him implicitly and delight to do Flis will. They sing: “The Lord God is my strength and he w<sup>T</sup>ill make my feet like hinds’ feet, and he will make me to walk upon mine high places.” (Hab. 3:17-19) The hind is an animal so sure-footed that it can climb to the very steepest part of the mountain crag without fear. Likewise that faithful remnant class composing God’s witnesses are exalted by Him to high places; but because of humility and trust wholly in the Lord they do not fear and never lose their heads.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">These kingdom Psalms, or government music, plainly imply that at the beginning of the institution of God’s government there must be carried on an advertising publicity campaign of great scope. The singing thereof is a poetical way of telling that the faithful remnant must be active in representing the kingdom interests on earth and that they will do so with joy, thus proving their love for God and His kingdom. (1 John 5:3) Some of these poems provided for the official music of God’s kingdom are mentioned here that there may be a better understanding of the work that the Lord is now having done in the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It was the established custom, and therefore the law of Israel, that when a king was placed upon a throne, the people, led by the priests (the anointed ones), should clap their hands, thus indicating their joy. (2 Ki. 11:9, 12) Record is made thereof for the benefit of those now upon whom the ends of the world have come. (1 Cor. 10:11) With that custom in mind, and applying it to the time when God sets His King upon His holy throne, the poet wrote:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">“0</span><span class="font9"> clap your hands, all ye people [particularly God’s people]; shout unto God with the voice of triumph.” A shout denotes confidence in God’s certain victory. And why is this shout given? “For the Lord most high is terrible; he is a great King over all the earth. He shall subdue the people under us, and the nations under our feet. God is gone up with a shout, the Lord with the sound of a trumpet”; meaning that God has begun His work with the shout of His people. It was the priests that blew the trumpets, foreshadowing the anointed ones proclaiming the glory of His name. “For God is the King of all the earth: sing ye praises with understanding.” This shows that the praises are sung by those who have an understanding of God’s plan. “God sitteth upon the throne of his holiness. The princes of the people are gathered together, even the people of the God of Abraham: for the shields of the earth belong unto God: he is greatly exalted.” The “princes” here are willing-hearted ones or volunteers; and therefore, because they have the faith of Abraham, these constitute the faithful remnant class who joyfully declare the praises of Jehovah. The “shields” mentioned here is Christ the King upon His throne, earth’s rightful Ruler. Shields refer to rulers or protectors.—Hos. 4: 18, margin; Ps. 47:1-9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Another one of these kingdom poems set to music is Psalm 99. It opens with the statement that Jehovah has become King and calls upon the people to tremble. “The Lord [Jehovah at this particular time] is great in Zion [His organization] ; let them praise thy great and terrible name; for it is holy. . . . Exalt ye the Lord our God, and worship at his footstool; for he is holy.” His name is exalted by a great public proclamation. “His footstool” used herein is His temple class on earth, for there the Lord God is represented on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Verse six of this psalm speaks of Moses, Aaron, and Samuel as calling upon the Lord and being heard by Him and His answering them. This is evidently here inserted as an encouragement to those who today call upon the name of Jehovah and trust Him implicitly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Another one of these government songs is Psalm 68. It opens with the statement: “Let God arise, let his enemies be scattered.” Representatively Jehovah arose in the Melchizedek priesthood. Christ the great High Priest stands up from His seat to make His enemy His footstool, and those on earth who are devoted to Jehovah are willing volunteers in this day. (Ps. 110: 3) “Sing unto God, sing praises to his name; extol him that rideth upon the heavens by his name JAH, and rejoice before him.” God is not so much concerned about hearing the singing for Himself, but to have the people hear it, that His name might be exalted. Therefore this must, be by a public witness to His name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It is written that when the ark was set forward these identical words by which the Psalmist opened were spoken: “Rise up, Lord, and let thine enemies be scattered.” (Num. 10:35) When David carried the ark to its resting-place on Mount Zion this custom must have been followed. It is recorded that on this occasion David caused to be appointed singers with instruments of music. (1 Chron. 15:16-28) With song and instrumental music the ark was brought forward and placed on Mount Zion. This was done in the presence of the enemies. That service pictured what is now going on in the earth. The song of the kingdom now says: “They have seen thy goings, 0 God; even the goings of my God, my King, in the sanctuary.” (Ps. 68:24) Thus the enemy sees the work going on and hears the remnant singing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Another song of the new government is Psalm 149. The song opens with: “Praise ye the Lord. Sing unto the Lord a new song [in view of the fact that His kingdom has come], and his praise in the congregation of saints. Let Israel rejoice in him that made him; let the children of Zion be joyful in their King,” because the King of glory is come. “Let the saints be joyful in glory; let them sing aloud upon their beds.” The Lord has been glorified as King, and the honor attaches to His remnant as ambassadors of the new King, and therefore they are “in glory”. They sing upon their beds instead of going to sleep, as some have. They are active in showing forth the praises of the Lord day and night and will continue until earthly sleep overtakes them. This is in exact harmony with the words of God's prophet in Isaiah 62:6, 7, in which the Lord says His watchmen shall not hold their peace day or night but shall continue to make mention of the name of the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“Let the high praises of God be in their mouth, and a two-edged sword in their hand.” God is their Creator and is worthy to be praised. The “sword in their hand” shows that these faithful ones are engaged in a warfare against Satan’s seed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“To execute vengeance upon the heathen [nations], and punishments upon the people.” The sword with which they are to execute this vengeance is the Word of God. (Eph. 6:17) The method of execution is simply by declaring what the Word of God has to say concerning His vengeance and the expression thereof against Satan’s organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“To bind their kings with chains, and their nobles with fetters of iron.” Manifestly it is the kings of “Christendom” that are referred to here as being bound. The faithful remnant class use the Word of God to bind these kings and nobles. “The rod of the wicked shall not rest [any longer] upon the lot of the righteous.” (Ps. 125: 3) The proclamation of the truth, and the hearing of it by the people, is destroying the influence of the “nobles”, namely, the clergy, over the people. Men are getting their eyes open and are getting away from standing in fear of these ecclesiastical “nobles”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“To execute upon them the judgment written.” This shows that the remnant class are to follow what is written and are only to proclaim the message of God’s kingdom. It is not for them to do any violence to the rulers or the “nobles” but to declare the judgment which the Lord God has already decreed against them and which is written in His Word. They are therefore merely the servers of notice as to what shall be done. The song concludes: “This honour have all his saints.” The Lord counts this an honorable work. Those who fail and refuse to joyfully have a part in performing this work of testimony to the great name of Jehovah are by the terms of the Psalm excluded from the saintly class.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Another one of these kingdom songs is Psalm 72. “Give the king [the Stone, Christ Jesus, God’s anointed King] thy judgments [thy decrees and authority to execute them], O God, and thy righteousness [the Tobe of righteousness’] unto the king’s [Jehovah’s] son [the royal sons still on the earth]. He [Christ Jesus, having been given God’s judgments and authority] shall judge thy people with righteousness, and thy poor with judgment.” This song is another evidence as to what must novz be done as a part of God’s great work in the earth and which must be done by the remnant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Another one of the new government songs is Psalm 95, which the remnant class are now singing: “0 come, let us sing unto the Lord; let us make a joyful noise to the rock of our salvation.” The reason for this song is that Jehovah is the great God and is now exalted in Zion. In 1914 the earth became the Lord’s and He sent forth His Anointed One to oust the ruler thereof. Therefore, “in his hand are the deep places of the earth.” God through His prophet Ezekiel promised that He would search out His sheep and call them, and that He would shepherd His flock and deliver them out of places where they have been scattered. (Ezek. 34:11, 12) Recognizing that the Lord God has done this the remnant sing: “For he is our God; and we are the people of his pasture, and the sheep of his hand. Today if ye will hear his voice, harden not your heart, as in the provocation, and as in the day of temptation in the wilderness.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The Apostle Paul applies this psalm to the close of the Jewish age of God’s favor; and, according to the rule laid down by him, it applies with greater force to the end of the world when God is gathering His people to Himself. Since the coming of the Lord to His temple, and the beginning of judgment throughout the house of God, the Lord’s voice thus speaks out to the temple class that their hearts may not be hardened but that they may rejoice to obey His Word. The Lord says that some of those anointed to kingship will harden their hearts and will turn away and will not engage in the glad song announcing His kingdom. These will complain against their brethren and insist that there is nothing to be done but to await the time when they shall be taken to the kingdom. The Lord represents the faithful remnant class, however, </span><span class="font1">as </span><span class="font9">singing: “And they sung as it were a new song before the throne, and before the four beasts, and the elders; and no man could learn that song but the hundred and forty and four thousand, which were redeemed from the earth.”—Eev. 14:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The complainers can not understand this song because they refuse to participate in it. Those who have already passed into glory and who are for ever with the Lord engage in the singing of the new song declaring the praises of Jehovah. The remnant still on earth participate in the singing of these songs that constitute the music of the new government. The fact that the statement is made that no man on earth can learn that song except the 144,000 shows that those of the remnant class still on earth v/ould know and participate in the song.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Another of the new government songs addressed to the “Chief Musician” is Psalm 66. “Make a joyful noise unto God, all ye lands.” This joyful noise must be made amongst the nations as a witness, and must be given, as the Lord commanded, by those who love the good tidings and who are the faithful witnesses of the Lord. The song continues: “Sing forth the honour of his name: make his praise glorious.” In the centuries past God has magnified His Word of promise. Now the time has come when His name must be exalted in the earth; and His faithful witnesses, whom He has appointed, are privileged thus to magnify it by telling forth to those who will hear, that His righteous government is at hand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Among the new government music which the remnant class sing is Psalm 75. “Unto thee, O God, do we give thanks, unto thee do we give thanks : for that thy name is near thy wondrous works declare.” (Ps. 75:1) Jehovah is now doing His works in the earth. These things seen by the anointed servants are evidences to them that God Himself is near and is taking a hand in the affairs of the earth. Some works He must do by forces other than His people on earth. Almost all His work on earth done by the anointed is the making proclamation to the honor of Uis name. Opportunities they have now to serve Him in declaring His name are proof to the anointed that God is using them, and that therefore they have His approval. Such is further proof that now is God’s due time to have His name declared in the earth. With a clearer vision of God’s purposes concerning them, the anointed can go on in His work with full confidence. They are not so much concerned about how long they must continue to work on earth, nor how great the danger of attack from the enemy; but they are concerned about faithfulness to their covenant. With serenity they sing forth the honor of His name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Some who are anointed think they should not speak against the Devil’s organization but should be at peace with it. Such are fickle, because they can not pursue that course and be loyal and faithful unto the Lord. To the anointed ones the Lord says: “My son, fear thou the Lord, and the king [God’s anointed One, the Stone laid in Zion] and meddle not [associate not] with them that are given to change [that are fickle].” (Prov. 24:21) Those who turn aside to associate with the workers of iniquity shall fall. “As for such as turn aside unto their crooked ways, the Lord shall lead them forth with the workers of iniquity; but peace shall be upon Israel.”—Ps. 125: 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Only those who are faithful to the Lord shall stand. That one is of the remnant class now is no guarantee that he is going to be of it finally. He must continue diligent and faithful even unto the end. “Seest thou a man diligent in his business [that is, the King’s business, looking after the kingdom interests] ? he shall stand [face to face] before [the] kings [Jehovah and Christ Jesus]; he shall not stand before mean [or obscure] men [the petty kings of earth; he will not have the approval of such].” (Prov. 22: 29) Those who are faithful and so continue unto the end, and who are diligent in proclaiming the praises of the name of the Lord, shall have the friendship of God’s anointed King. Tie that hath pureness of heart, and grace upon his lips, shall have the King for his friend.’-—Prov. 22:11, margin and </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">llotlzevhcim.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The marvelous work of Jehovah progresses, and His people with confidence look forward to the time when His righteous government shall be completely established in the earth and take charge of earth’s affairs.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark34"></a><span class="font10"><a name="bookmark35"></a>Bible Question and Answer</span></h3>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">/QUESTION:</span><span class="font9"> Please explain how the Father, W Son and holy ghost are one person.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Answer:</span><span class="font9"> It can not be explained, because it is not true. The trinity doctrine is nowhere taught in the Bible, but was borrowed from the ancient heathen religions, which are of the Devil. It is true that 1 John 5:7 of our “King Janies Version” Bible reads: “For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the holy ghost: and these three are one”; but Bible authorities now admit that this verse is counterfeit, some trinitarian propagandist having inserted it in the text three centuries after the Apostle John wrote this epistle. Hence all modern revised translations of the Bible have excluded this verse. The oldest Bible manuscripts in existence today are the Vatican manuscript, No. 1209, the Sinaitic manuscript, and the Alexandrine manuscript. The Vatican manuscript, which is the oldest of the three, is kept in the Vatican Library at Rome, and it does not contain this verse; neither do the other two manuscripts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Neither Moses nor any other of the Old Testament writers and prophets taught a trinity; neither did any of the apostles or New Testament writers believe it or teach it. Jesus never said He was God, His own father. As the Word or Logos He was the first creature that Jehovah God made; hence He was God’s firstborn and only-begotten Son. Jesus so states in Revelation 3:14, saying: “These things saith the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation of God.” Colossians 1:15 calls Jesus “the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature”. The literal Greek text of John 1:1, word for word, reads: “In the beginning [that is, of God’s creative work] was the Word [or Logos], and the Word was with </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">the</span><span class="font9"> God [that is, Jehovah], and the Word was </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font9"> god.” In proof of this consult Wilson’s </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Emphatic Diaglott</span><span class="font9"> translation of the New Testament.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Since Jesus, or the Word, the Logos, is the first made, or beginning, of God’s creatures, He could not be one in person with His Creator, who is “from everlasting to everlasting”. Jesus did not say, T am my Father,’ neither, T and my Father and the holy ghost are one.’ He said: “I and. my Father are one.” He meant that He and His Father were one in fellowship, in activity, in work, Jesus carrying out always His heavenly Father’s will. That this is the oneness He meant is shown in John 17:22, where He prayed for His disciples, saying: “The glory which thou gavest me I have given them; that they may be one, even as we are one.” Jesus doing His Father’s will so faithfully and showing forth so perfectly the same attributes of love, wisdom, justice and power that were in His Father, He could truthfully say: “He that hath seen me hath seen the Father.” (John 14: 7, 9) He was a true reflection of what His Father is.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The words “holy ghost” are rendered “holy spirit” in modern Bible translations. Jehovah God anointed His Son Jesus with the holy spirit. (Matt. 3:16, 17; Acts 10: 38) He anoints also true Christian followers of Jesus with the same spirit. (2 Cor. 1: 21, 22; 1 John 2: 20, 27) This could not be the case if the holy spirit -were one in person with Jesus and Jehovah God His Father. The holy spirit is not a person. The word </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">spirit</span><span class="font9"> is translated from the Greek word </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">pneuma,</span><span class="font9"> which means breath or wind. Thus the “holy spirit” means the holy power of God, which is invisible, like the wind or breath, but the effects of the operation of which are manifest or visible. Jehovah God poured out that spirit or power upon Jesus; He anointed Jesus with that power and authority, that Jesus might do His heavenly Father’s work. Thus there is a close relationship between the Father, the Son, and the holy spirit, but they are not one in person or a trinity.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark36"></a><span class="font10"><a name="bookmark37"></a>Argument Among Methodist Brethren</span></h3>
<p><span class="font14">M</span><span class="font9">ETHODIST brethren at Memphis have been having an argument as to whether card playing is right. It seems that one of the sisters of the flock was a Sunday School teacher and also a good card player. The minister had her put out at first on a foul ball, and her hubby came to a church meeting to see about it. Each of them grabbed a chair, but the minister had just taken a fresh chew of tobacco and showed himself the more valiant in the fight. Now they are after him for using tobacco, and so the battle for righteousness waxes hot.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark38"></a><span class="font10"><a name="bookmark39"></a>The Children’s Own Radio Story </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">By C. J. W., Jr.</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">Story Thirty-eight</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">U</span><span class="font9">NDER the Roman rule in Palestine, every Jew was required to pay a certain tax, or as they called it in those days, a tribute, to Herod’s temple. When Jesus had performed the miracle of casting the evil spirit from the son of the poor man, as we learned in our last story, He and His disciples journeyed to Capernaum, and lived there for a while.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">During their stay in that city the tax-collector came upon his rounds and asked of Peter, “Doth not your master pay tribute?” And Peter answered, “Yes.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Now the way in which Jesus provided the tax money was interesting, and we will have the Apostle Matthew’s account of it:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“And when he [Peter] was come into the house, Jesus prevented him, saying, What thinkest thou, Simon? of whom do the kings of the earth take custom or tribute? of their own children, or of strangers ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“Peter saith unto him, Of strangers. Jesus saith unto him, Then are the children free. Notwithstanding, lest W’e should offend them, go thou to the sea, and cast an hook, and take up the fish that first cometh up; and wdien thou hast opened his mouth, thou shalt find a piece of money; that take, and give unto them, for me and thee.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">At that time some of the disciples came to Jesus with the question, “Who is greatest in the kingdom of heaven?” And Jesus called a little child from the throng of people who were assembled to listen to Him, and stood the child in the midst of the circle of His disciples, and told them that except they became as little children, they should not enter the kingdom of heaven.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">This was another word picture, and signified that all who wish to receive the favor of the Lord must become meek and teachable as a little child, and that the proud and stubborn, and those w<sup>T</sup>ho think they know it all, will never inherit the greatest blessings that the heavenly Father has in store for mankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Now after this, the Lord and His disciples entered a village of Samaria, where the people received Him very ungraciously and made no provision for His entertainment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">This angered the apostles, and two of them, James and John, went to the Master and said, “Lord, wilt thou that we command fire to come down from heaven and consume them, even as Elias did?” But the Lord rebuked them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Then the Lord appointed seventy other disciples, to go before Him throughout all the land, into every city He would visit. And as He sojourned in Galilee, His brethren came to Him and urged Him to go to the Jews’ feast of tabernacles in Jerusalem, for the time was approaching for it to be held.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Jesus answered them and said: “My time is not yet come: but your time is alway ready. The world cannot hate you; but me it hateth, because I testify of it, that the works thereof are evil. Go ye up unto this feast: I go not yet up unto this feast, for my time is not yet full come.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Then the Bible narrative says that “when his brethren were gone up, then went he also unto the feast, not openly, but as it were in secret. Then the Jews sought him at the feast, and said, Where is he ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“And there was much murmuring among the people concerning him: for some said, He is a good man: others said, Nay; but he deceiveth the people. Howbeit no man spake openly of him, for fear of the Jews.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“Now about the midst of the feast, Jesus went up into the temple, and taught. And the Jews marvelled, saying, How knoweth this man letters, having never learned?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“Jesus answered them, and said, My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me. If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of G od, or whether I speak of myself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“Then cried Jesus in the temple as he taught, saying, Ye both know me, and ye know whence I am: and I am not come of myself, but he that sent me is true, whom ye know not.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“But I know him: for I am from him, and he hath sent me. Then they sought to take him: but no man laid hands on him, because his hour was not yet come.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The time was fast approaching, however, when the furious mob would take Jesus and do their wicked will upon Him; but we must remember that Jesus suffered death as the ransom price for all humanity, and that He is now at the right hand of Jehovah God our heavenly Father, reinstated to the position of glory He willingly left to purchase the everlasting life for mankind.</span></p>

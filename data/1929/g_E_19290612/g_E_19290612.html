<h2><a name="bookmark31"></a><span class="font0"><a name="bookmark32"></a>The Difficult and Dangerous Work of Diving</span></h2>
<p><span class="font10">W</span><span class="font6">ITHOUT the use of some special form of diving apparatus, sixty feet is about the limit of the depth to which one may force his way toward the bottom of the sea. The best divers can remain under water only about one and one-third minutes. Rarely can this be extended to two minutes; yet there are a few not well authenticated instances where divers are alleged to have remained four, five and even six minutes under water.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The work of the native pearl divers of India and Ceylon is so difficult that the workers allow themselves but one meal a day, and it is eaten after sundown. These divers are short-lived. All branches of diving work are exceedingly difficult and dangerous.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Every diving job is different. Raising sunken ships is one of the specialties. The divers go down, carefully patch the ship, close it up so as to make it as nearly air-tight as possible, and then the ship is pumped out, its water content being replaced with air. If the patching job has been well done the ship rises to the surface.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It used to be thought that the hull of<sup>r</sup> a sunken ship might never rest fully on the bottom, the theory being that at a certain depth the pressure would become great enough to sustain the heaviest object; but the argument is fallacious, because water presses equally in all directions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When a ship goes down, the part which first fills with water disappears before the rest of the vessel. If the waters are shallow the ship may break in two, doubling up like a jackknife, as it strikes bottom. This happened to the steamer “Republic”, which went down off Nantucket twenty years ago.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The buoyancy of liquids is remarkable. The displacement with air of a cubic foot of water results in a lift of 62} pounds. Hence air is the all-important factor in diving operations. Air to the diver and to his work constitute the key to modern diving.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A diver with a modern equipment can descend to a depth of three hundred feet in about two minutes, feeling no discomfort except in the ear drums. This is caused by the air pressure bending the drums inward. It can be overcome by pushing the nose hard against the face-plate of the helmet and blowing so as to open the Eustachian tube, thus equalizing the pressure. The same results are accomplished by chewing gum and swallowing the saliva.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark33"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark34"></a>Italians the First Divers</span></h5>
<p><span class="font6">Italians seem to have been the first t® use diving apparatus. Vegetius made a suit in 1511, consisting principally of a buckskin helmet with window-lights in the face. To the helmet was attached an air hose connected at the water’s surface with a bladder filled with air. When the air in the bladder was exhausted the diver had to come to the surface.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Lorini, years later, built a platform attached to a vertical shaft, by means of which he was able to work at a depth of thirty feet. Borelli, another Italian, first used compressed air in 1682. Diving without compressed air is now unthought of.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Modern diving apparatus contain electric lamps and telephones and an air supply so arranged that the diver may remain at his work under water five or six hours without coming to the surface. A recent invention makes the diver independent of any connection with persons above. A strong metallic air reservoir is carried on the diver’s back. When he wishes to leave the water he inflates his dress with air from the reservoir and immediately rises to the surface. However, divers always work in pairs, for the sake of safety. The working-depth of diving operations has been extended to 306 feet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Needless to say, diving is one of the most dangerous occupations of men. Divers are always in danger. If the air line gets tangled, or if the diving suit becomes broken, it is all up with the</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">S7»</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark35"></a><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark36"></a>QOLDEN AGE</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">’diver. Groping in the 'darkness between the decks of a vessel, he must contend with the force of the tides, and with the possibility of falling or of having something fall on him or on his life-line. All that is necessary to finish him is that a door should swing shut and pinch off his air supply at just the wrong time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Divers dread the denizens of the deep. It is not nice to be bitten in half by a shark; nor is it nice to have a barracuda saw a hole through you. By the way, it is claimed that in a space of seven feet a barracuda can attain a speed of sixty miles an hour; and it is not pleasant to have anybody come at you with a speed like that, especially if he is equipped with teeth like </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">barracuda.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Then there is another dweller of the seas that enjoys coming up and wrapping his powerful tail around you and socking a horny fin into your interior with such force that you are short-circuited for life, the length of your life in that case being about two minutes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But the pet aversion of divers is the friendly octopus. Like the Power Trust it feels for you with first one slimy tentacle and then another, intent on sucking your blood; and the worst of it is that when one arm is cut off the others are just as affectionate as ever. Instances are on record where diver and octopus have been hauled together to the surface, and even on the deck of the attendant vessel the octopus has continued to fight furiously.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark37"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark38"></a>The Search for Hid Treasure</span></h5>
<p><span class="font6">Naturally, with billions of gold coins and bullion lying beneath the sea, the wrecks that strew the seven seas are of interest to divers. One of the follies of mankind is the ease with which persons will part with real money to take a doubtful chance of recovering great sums left cached by pirates or sunk beneath the waves of the sea.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Since the World War many millions of dollars have been recovered from ships sunk in the</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark21"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark39"></a>Another Hold-up</span></h4>
<p><span class="font10">A</span><span class="font6"> DISPATCH from Ottawa to the Fort William </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Times Journal</span><span class="font6"> says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Archbishop Forbes, in a pastoral letter read in all Roman Catholic churches of the Ottawa diocese yesterday, announced the refusal of the sacraments to all Roman Catholics who continue in future to pay school taxes in favor of public schools. The announce-</span><span class="font6">shallow waters adjacent to British shores. Electrical devices were used successfully to locate bullion in some of these operations, but it was all slow, difficult and tedious work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">To recover the bullion sent to the bottom with the Laurentic took five years. In 1920 only eight bars of the bullion were recovered, in 1921 there was a recovery of 100 bars, in 1922 this was raised to 900, in 1923 the total recovered was 11,050 bars and finally, iml924, the last of the $1,250,000 which went down was brought to the surface.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Whenever* an expedition is fitted out to try to recover lost treasure there is always a great hullabaloo as to who shall have the proceeds, if there are any. Shippers of the gold, underwriters, the government, all take a hand; so it is not all roses being a diver, or even employing a diver. What you recover may be taken from you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">English laws require the delivery of treasure trove for the use of the crown, but in actual practice the finder is paid a sum nearly equal to the value of his find. American laws require the delivery of treasure to the person on whose land it is found.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Scores of expeditions have been fitted out to try to locate the riches supposed to have been buried by Captain Kidd, yet only one find of such treasure was ever made. That was made on his own place by a man named John Wilson, living on one of the islands in Casco Bay, off Portland, Me. The extent of his find was $12,000, in Spanish gold.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Many of the tales of hidden treasure are merely yarns which have no foundation in fact. </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Off </span><span class="font6">the coast of the Gaspe peninsula, Quebec, is </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">rock 500 feet high, with a flat top and unscalable sides, called Duval's Hoard. The tradition that riches are buried on the top of the rock has led to so many deaths of climbers seeking for the imaginary treasure that the legislature of the province has passed an act forbidding any one to attempt to scale the rock without permission. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">By R. D. Morin</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">ment affects 1346 Roman Catholies assessed as public school supporters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Please notice that in effect this says that Archbishop Forbes will send 1,346 souls of his flock to hell-fire (according to his own belief) if they continue to pay the school taxes which by law they are obligated to pay.</span></p>

Thus, at the barracks of the coal and iron police at Imperial, Pennsylvania, Lieutenant W. J. Lyster, of the Pittsburgh Coal Company’s private police, said, “I feel like a good workout,” stripped to his waist, picked up a poker, walked over to a prisoner, John Barko-ski, and beat him over the head until the poker was bent almost double: he paused, straightened the poker and went at it again. After beating the man into insensibility he jumped on the man’s body, broke his ribs and punctured his lungs. The man never regained consciousness. At the morgue it was said that his body was in the worst condition of any they had ever seen. His hands were swollen to twice their normal size from trying to deflect the blows. Friends of Lyster fear that,he may be reprimanded for going so far, but it is not at all likely that the Pittsburgh Coal Company’s police will lose any of their powers.

And, mind you, this is after all those airplanes blessed by the pope and his bishops have landed at the bottom of the sea. Incidentally, on the day and hour of the blessing, February 10,1929, at 10.30 a.rn., rain fell in torrents from leaden skies. The account says, “The pope, robed in white and wearing a gold tiara, was seated within the gestato-rial chair, borne by eight bearers.” Can somebody tell us wha' the word “gestatorial” means when used in this connection? The next day after his riding around in this palanquin the papers with Mussolini were signed. The Netv Orleans </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Item-Tribune</span><span class="font6"> says that this means “the definite emergence of the Catholic Church from a more or less negative, or passive, condition, which set in after the Reformation, into a world-wide condition of positive action producing important results in all the fields of human affairs”. This may be so, but we are from Missouri and wait to see. The great kingdom over Avhich the pope Avill henceforth rule now' comprises one-sixth of a square mile. Professor Salvemini, former member of the Italian Chamber of Deputies, declares that Mussolini entered into this agreement for the same reason that a droAvning man clutches at a straw. The pope’s subjects in liis new<sup>r</sup> state are estimated at about 200. The pope himself descrL the treaty as “'one of the most important steps taken by the Holy See, which may prove the turning point in its history”.

<p><span class="font5">The mightiest controversy of the age is over “rights in wool”. It is, or ought to be a controversy both in the pulpit and among Christians in the pews of every church in Christendom till God’s right is admitted and acted on. To flinch on this fundamental doctrine is to trifle with the greatest practical question the world confronts. Let God’s right to the wool of His own sheep, to say nothing of the hair of the goats—I say let God’s right be settled, and we are at the opening of a new era in the world’s history.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Shear the sheep? Yes, frequently and close. The pastors are the shepherds; and it is their business to feed the sheep, care for them, and shear them. A shepherd who neglects to shear the sheep, ought to be turned off. He is an unfaithful servant of the Great Owner. Pastors need to face this question.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">So important is this matter in the churches and in the lives of the people, that it demands special and extremely earnest treatment. Some of the sheep must be cornered and crowded before they will submit to the process clearly taught in God’s Word; but they must be sheared.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Next to redemption the greatest question in the Christian world today is the question of rights in wool. If God’s sheep were properly sheared, they would abound in health, and countless missionaries could be sent, as torch bearers, to every benighted region of the globe. The tears of widows and orphans could be dried, the sick cared for, pastors supported, homes illuminated by the Word of God, and the world belted with the light of Truth.</span></p>

Advices from housewives indicate that the packers are at least partly to blame, for it cannot be denied that the price of beef at present is enough to make any shopper hesitate before she brings home the joint. And the passion of the American woman —in common with the French, English, German, etc., woman—for a slender figure undoubtedly is also a contributing factor. Thus at the same time that the consumption of lettuce has increased, that of pastry, white bread, and potatoes is said to have fallen off 25, 20, and 15 per cent, respectively. Nevertheless, examination of the changes in our national diet sho-ws an advance in the direction of sensible eating.

<p><span class="font10" style="font-variant:small-caps;">C</span><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">harles Schwab, who has one man on his payrolls to whom he pays a salary of a million dollars a year, has the following to say as to how, in his judgment, prosperity may be made permanent. He addresses employers only:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Pay &quot;bor the highest possible wages. Prosperity is intimately related to a liberal wage scale.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Treat labor as a business partner. Successful industry depends more on human relations than upon the organization of money and machines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Conduct business in the full light of day. Public confidence and public suspicion niay be separated only by a door. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Remember that the law of supply and demand is inexorable. It would also be well to remember that there is no necessity for producing an excess.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Live and help live. Even prosperous industries can not afford to have the backward industries too far behind the procession; prosperity to be permanent must be equably distributed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">hVelcome new ideas. To establish permanent institutions we must always be prepared for change.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Never be satisfied that what has been achieved is sufficient. Smugness and complacency do not promote progress. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Operate business on the most economical basis. Price-cutting, over-expansion, uneconomical methods of distribution arc just as harmful to business and to the public as price-fixing, monopolies and rebates.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Look ahead and think ahead. It is easier to avoid depressions than it is to cure them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Smile, be cheerful, and work upon the basis that the fundamental purpose of business is to promote the happiness of human beings.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6">British flag, the Roman Catholic church enjoys privileges that it does not enjoy in any other part of the world. It has the right to tax its people for the support of the priests, the building and maintenance of its churches, and the houses of its clergy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As a consequence, it is a common sight in the small towns to see a great big church, and a fine brick or stone house for the priest close to it, and the rest of the people living in small frame houses which look quite poor and meager in comparison.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The upkeep of the Church of Rome is a great burden upon the backs of the people throughout the province; and they are tied and held to the burden by the laws of the province. The Church of Rome surely does not manifest the spirit of the great Master whom it professes to follow; for he gave His life for the people, whereas they are having a good time at the expense of the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">However, now that the great jubilee of earth has begun, the time of deliverance for the people has arrived; and it will indeed be a glad day for the people of the province of Quebec when</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">the yoke of the Church of Rome is lifted from their shoulders by earth’s new King, who will be their great Deliverer. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During the past three years a little band of Bible Students have been laboring in the province of Quebec, earnestly endeavoring to carry to the people the message of Christ’s kingdom. Naturally they have received much persecution; but the protecting hand of God has been over them, and they have come safely through it all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Ste. Anne de Beaupre was the scene of the first decisive defeat of the Catholic church in its endeavor to stop the advancing tide of truth in the province. On August 11, 1924, two colporteurs of the International Bible Students Association canvassed the town of Ste. Anne de Beaupre, selling </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Harp of God</span><span class="font6"> and other publications of the Association in the French language.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6">Towards evening they were arrested by the chief of police and taken to the priest’s residence, with whom they had a length y conversation. Upon their refusal to lower the standard of truth, they were taken by automobile to Quebec city, and placed in the gaol for the night. The next morning they were released on bail; and after two -weeks’ delay in the Quebec City Police Court, Judge Choquette dismissed the case against them, with costs against the plaintiffs, the town of Ste. Anne de Beaupre.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In February, 1925, nine colporteurs of the International Bible Students Association were arrested in the city of Westmount; but when the case came up for trial, the City of Westmount dropped the case, owing to a technical error in the wording of their by-law under which the Bible Students were arrested.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In April, 1925, Rene Marcotte was arrested for selling the same books in Rosemount, Montreal; but the case against him was dismissed by Recorder Semple.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During 1924 and 1925 the Bible Students circulated a large quantity of free literature in the province of Quebec, mainly in the French language. The first tract circulated was entitled “L’-Immortalite”, showing what is the condition of the dead, and who will get immortality. It was a hard blow to the doctrines of the Catholic</span></p>

It was followed by the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Warning</span><span class="font6"> circulated by the Bible Students world-wide during 1924, on the parable of the Sheep and Goats; and then during 1925 the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Indictment</span><span class="font6"> against the clergy was circulated to the extent of 115,000 pieces in thirty-five of the largest cities and towns in the province of Quebec.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Indictment </span><span class="font6">stirred up much opposition; and on May 11, 19 2 5, Findlay Lyster was arrested in Quebec city for distributing it; hut the case against him was dropped by the city, as they evidently</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">realized they had no real case against him. On May 14 four colporteurs were arrested at Levis for distributing the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Indictment,</span><span class="font6"> but Levis followed the example of Quebec city and dropped the case. The </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Indictment</span><span class="font6"> was distributed at Ste. Anne de Beaupre without any trouble. On May 16, A. L. Deachman and P. A. Robertson were arrested at Chicoutimi for distributing the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Indictment;</span><span class="font6"> but the judge acquitted them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">About May 25, at St. Jerome, Que., four colporteurs, A. L. Deachman, P. A. Robertson, G. H. Waterer and W. J. Waterer, were arrested for distributing the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Indictment</span><span class="font6"> and spent five days in the gaol at St. Jerome awaiting their trial. But evidently the town of St. Jerome feared to bring the case into court; for after five days the four colporteurs were released and told that they could go free.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">On May 28 two colporteurs (ladies) were arrested at Coaticook, Que., for distributing the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Indictment</span><span class="font6"> there. They were taken before a justice of the peace, charged with blasphemous libel, and upon pleading not guilty were taken to Sherbrooke gaol for the night. The next morning they were released on $500 bail each. On September 25, 1925, the case came up for trial before Magistrate Lemay at Sherbrooke.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The charge of blasphemous libel had. been laid by a member of the Knights of Columbus; and besides himself and several of his associates, two French priests, appeared for the plaintiffs. In such cases a crown attorney prosecutes, and the one employed in this instance was a French Roman Catholic. The lawyer for the defense,</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">—AT THE PRESENT STAGE</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6">Mr. J. C. Martineau, was also a Roman Catholic, and a French Roman Catholic judge was on the bench.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In summing up the case Magistrate Lemay vigorously denounced the tract, saying that the charges it contained were both insulting and erroneous; but he stated in rendering judgment that he was forced to acquit the accused because the pamphlet did not contain any words that could be considered blasphemous.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Both French and English papers gave prominence to the case. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">La Presse,</span><span class="font6"> the largest French paper, with a circulation of 174,000, reported the case in a two-column article on the front page of the third section. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Le Soleil,</span><span class="font6"> of Quebec city, with a circulation of 45,000, also reported the judgment in full; while </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">La Tribune,</span><span class="font6"> of Sherbrooke, with a circulation of 6,347, gave it precedence over all the other news items of the day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">These papers, in reporting Magistrate Lemay’s judgment,' in which he dealt at some length with the charges against the clergy, contained in the pamphlets that were distributed by the defendants, helped to circulate the very message that the Bible Students were endeavoring to bring to the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">On September 4, 1925, a colporteur was arrested at Lake Megantic, Que., for selling the books of the LB.S.A. without a license, and for distributing the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Indictment</span><span class="font6"> against the clergy. The next day, when the case came up in court, he was released on suspended sentence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The province of Quebec has long lain in darkness concerning a knowledge of God’s great plan of salvation for man, which centers in Christ’s coming kingdom; but the light of truth has begun to shine in, and naturally enough it arouses bitter opposition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The light of truth has come to stay, however’; and just as the darkness has to give way before the light when the sun rises in the east, even so the errors, superstition and ignorance of the people must give way before the advancing light of truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Quebec has been dark because the educated and the uneducated alike have bowed before the false religion; but the eyes of some are now beginning to open, and in due time, under Christ’s kingdom, Quebec will no.longer be one of the dark places of the earth, but will be filled with a happy, joyful people who will rejoice in God’s wonderful goodness to them, and in the blessings which will then be coming to them through Christ’s kingdom.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Man, however, has become the enemy of his Creator, the enemy, of his brother, and even the enemy of the lower animals which God created for man’s pleasure.

Rabbits sit on the roadside and watch us pass, showing no fear.</span></p>

The average clergyman, for example, calls God a God of love; but in the next breath we are told that this God punishes the crimes and even the errors of a short and troubled life with torture which will have no end. It is not even a man which the theologians create, for man is not quite without pity; no man, however cruel he might be, could bear to gaze for ever on the horrors of the fire and the rack; no man could listen for ever to voices shrieking with pain, and ever crying for mercy and forgiveness. And if such is the character of the churchly God, as portrayed by clergymen of supposed intelligence, is it any wonder that so many thinking folks are falling way from the influence of the church ?</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font4">[From </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">J!anclies-ter</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">I</span><span class="font6">T WAS Bismarck who once declared that any fool can govern by martial law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">All dictatorships govern by martial or semi-martial law—the Buss' n “G. P. U.,” the Italian “Militia,” the Rumanian “Siguranza,” the Polish “Defensive” are terrorist organizations, instruments of government, and hybrids, so to speak, between soldiers and police agents. There is not a dictatorship in Europe that does not rule by black-and-tannery.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is a mistake to suppose that a dictatorship brings the able to the top. The opposite is true —it eliminates the courageous, the critical, the intelligent. The able have no chance except in so far as they are servile, unscrupulous and never openly critical.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is commonly supposed that democracy is a form of mob rule and a dictatorship is the rule of the elite. Again the opposite is true. A dictatorship is organized mob rule through organized lynch law. All great dictators are great demagogues. It has been said that democracies are ruled by catch phrases. No premier in any European democracy has so many catch phrases as Mussolini or Pilsudski and can call forth popular applause so blind and hysterical.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is a mistake to suppose that dictatorships are necessarily unpopular. When they appeal to the emotions of the mob it is nearly always to die bad emotions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In Italy and Russia those masses that can be reached by public speeches, newspapers and radio are continually being whipped up into a</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">595 </span><span class="font6">paroxysm of boastful, malignant jingoism. Dictatorships thrive only in a warlike atmosphere and if their foreign policies are peaceful it is only because they are not strong enough to fight.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">No dictatorship is possible without servility. The mental prostration before dogmas, beliefs and so-called ideas or ideals in Russia and Italy is more degrading than any obeisance before an Oriental despot.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In no dictatorship is there any justice. Trials are inquisitions or legalized lynchings. If they are held in public it is so that justice may be smothered by the emotions of the mob. If they are held in secret it is through fear lest these emotions may nc oe violent enough to smother justice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Dictatorships solve no problem; they perpetuate nothing but themselves. The terror, when it begins, is always announced as a transition measure, but it never remains the servant and always becomes the master of the dictator.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Russia is still under the Red Terror, more than ten years after the revolution; Hungary is still under the White Terror, nearly ten years after the counter-revolution. In Italy the terror is not so crudely violent, but it still exists and is monstrous and cruel, more than six years after the march on Rome.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A dictatorship is the greatest calamity that can befall a nation. It is worse than plague, flood, famine or war.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">UESTION:</span><span class="font6"> Please explain James 5:13, which states, “Is any among you afflicted? let him pray. Is any merry? let him sing psalms.” I am also interested in the explanation of verses 14 to 17 of the same chapter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Anszver:</span><span class="font6"> Verses 13 to 17 of the fifth chapter of James describe the importance of the prayer of faith. If any one is afflicted, if any one is suffering, it is well for such a one to pray, in order that his faith in God may be maintained. If he is merry, it is well to sing. Be it noted that his praying and singing are intended to keep him in the Lord. In Psalm 105:1-3 we read, “0 give thanks unto the Lord; call upon his name; make known his deeds among the people. Sing . unto him, sing psalms unto him; talk ye of all his wondrous works. Glory ye in his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice that seek the Lord.” Verse 14 of the same chapter of James advises the concerted prayers of the elders of the church in behalf of those spiritually sick. The ‘anointing with, oil’ is an expression suggesting that the sick one be cheered and comforted by the words of truth. However, should there be conscientious scruples, there would be no objection to the use of literal oil. Verse 17 advises a confession of sins one to another. This does not mean that we should parade our faults indiscriminately; but if one has done a certain brother injury, it would be proper for the wrong-doer to go to the injured brother and express his sorrow and thus be reconciled by the spirit of the Lord. This text does not give license to any minister or priest to make it a business to hear the confessions of his parishioners.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Question:</span><span class="font6"> Why did God place the tree of the knowledge of good and evil in the garden of Eden and tell Adam not to eat of it ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Answer:</span><span class="font6"> The purpose of doing this was to test the obedience of Adam. Had Adam remained obedient during a certain period of time it is reasonable to believe that God would have given him everlasting life upon the earth. In Psalm 7:9 we read, “The righteous God trieth the hearts and reins.” It must be remembered that God created man a free moral agent capable of making an intelligent choice. God does not compel any one to obey him. God is pleased with willing obedience. To each one who is obedient to the Lord, Jehovah God will give everlasting life; but the result of disobedience is death from which there is no recovery.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Q'liestion:</span><span class="font6"> Please state the quotations concerning the establishment of God’s kingdom upon the earth, when peace will be assured to all peoples.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Answer:</span><span class="font6"> The fourth chapter of Micah is in point, and we read from verses 3 to 5, “And he [Christ Jesus] shall judge among many people, and rebuke strong nations afar off; and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruninghooks: nation shall not lift up a sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more. But they shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig tree; and none shall make them afraid; for the mouth of the Lord of hosts hath spoken it. For all people will walk every one in the name of his god, and we will walk in the name of the Lord our God for ever and ever.” A good chapter relative to the time of the end of the old world, Satan’s organization, and the establishment of the new order is Matthew 24. Jesus Himself stated that some of the evidences of the overthrow of the old order and of His presence would be, “Nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; and there shall be famines, and pestilences [the influenza epidemic and like diseases], and earthquakes [revolutions], in divers places. All these are the beginning of sorrows.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Question:</span><span class="font6"> If God created the being who .became Satan, the Devil, how did it happen that this creature of God sinned? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Answer:</span><span class="font6"> The mighty spirit being formerly known as Lucifer by choice rebelled against God and became Satan, the Devil. This mighty spirit being did not wish to work in harmony with God. Instead of honoring the great Jehovah he sought honor for himself. He sought to be like the Most High. In Isaiah 14:12-14 we read concerning this wicked one, “How art thou fallen from heaven, 0 Lucifer, son of the morning! , . . For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven, I will exhalt my throne above the stars of God: I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation, in the sides of the north: I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like the Most High.” The Bible promises that Satan, on account of his rebellion, will be utterly destroyed; and all who have the same spirit of .Satan will share the same end.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark26"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark153"></a>Preparation for the Government</span></h4>
<p><span class="font4">[Broadcast from Station WBBR, New York, by Judge Rutherford.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">M</span><span class="font6">ANY who have had some knowledge of God’s arrangement have wondered why He seemed to delay so long before establishing His righteous government. Not understanding the reason, they have become discouraged, turned away from the Lord’s Word, and have forgotten what they once knew.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is of greatest interest to the student to follow the progressive steps taken by Jehovah in preparing for His great government. Since it is to be the greatest government ever on earth, or that ever will be, it should be expected that preparation would be made in an orderly manner and that ample time would be occupied in so doing. This morning and next Sunday morning consideration will be given to the progressive steps in the preparation for the establishment of His government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah granted His son Lucifer lords p over man. Lucifer was therefore a prince. From and after the time of the rebellion of Lucifer his rule over men became wrongful and therefore without right. The only way that he could rule rightfully would be to rule in exact harmony with Jehovah God and continue loyal to God. Zedekiah, the last king of Israel, “sat upon the throne of the Lord,” for the reason that he was a successor to David. When he yielded to the wicked influence of Satan Zedekiah’s rulership wms wrongful and therefore without right. With the dethronement of Zedekiah God expressed His determination to permit the rightful ruler ship of man to be overthrown until the coming of him “whose right it is”. Thereafter all rulership of the peoples and nations has been by permission of God, in that He did not interfere therewith; but such rulership has not been by right proceeding from Jehovah. He has permitted man to take his owm course and has not restrained the Devil from exercising influence over man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Although Babylon was the beginning of earthly governments, the invisible ruler of which was Satan, its elevation to the position of a world power was delayed until the star of Assyria had set. At the time that Babylon arose to the position of a world power Satan there became “the god of this world”, meaning that his invisible rulership extended to all the nations and peoples of earth. Before that there were peo-pies organized by Jehovah’s authority, but from that time forward there was no organization in earth of which Jehovah was the invisible ruler. Melchizedek’s kingdom had fulfilled its purpose as a type. The government of Israel was done; and since there was no government in actual operation and in opposition to Satan, and Babylon being the dominating government of earth, it became the most important government of earth. To its first emperor Daniel said: “Thou, 0 king, art a king of kings</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">; for</span><span class="font6"> the God of heaven hath [suffered it to be] given thee a kingdom, power, and strength, and gUry.”— Dan. 2:37.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Up to that time God had placed before the peoples of earth sufficient evidence to prove His own supremacy. He had particularly manifested His supreme power in the overthrow of the world powers of Egypt and Assyria. With the overthrow of the king of Israel God would permit the Gentile peoples, that is to say, the non-Jews, to take the lead and put forth their best endeavors to set up a government and to prove whether or not they could establish a desirable government without the aid of Jehovah God. The Gentile world power, beginning with Nebuchadnezzar, the first emperor of Babylon, and its king, had a golden opportunity. God saw to it that sufficient evidence was given to its ruler that he could choose to obey Jehovah if he desired rather than to yield to Satan. Babylon went the wrong way and <sup>f</sup> 1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Babylon being the foremost p. wer of the world, and having the greatest favor bestow’ed upon it, and the most favorable opportunity of establishing a government, foreshadowed or represented “Christendom”, which embraces those nations of earth that claim to be Christian but which in fact form a part of Satan's organization. The nations called Christendom have had the greatest opportunity of any nations on earth. These nations have made advancement in material matters and in worldly knowledge but have forgotten God and served the Devil. These nations, as the evidence heretofore set forth proves, have failed to establish a desirable government for man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The fall of Babylon foreshadowed the fall of “Christendom”, together with all other parts of Satan’s organization. Beginning with the world power Babylon, God gave the Gentile nations a free hand by refraining from interfering. He numbered the days of Babylon (Dan. 5:26); and He also numbered the days of the Gentile supremacy in the earth, which period of time is designated in the Scriptures as the “times of the Gentiles'&quot;’. (Luke 2.1: 24) The Gentile or non-Jewish governments of earth have therefore never been governments representing the Lord Jehovah, nor have any of these governments or rulers ruled by divine right. They have existed or ruled by sufferance; which means that God has tolerated them and by a negative consent has permitted these governments to exist.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">During all that time God has had His witnesses in the world to testify concerning His goodness, and those men who have desired to learn of Him and follow His way of righteousness have had opportunity so to do. God has awaited His own good time when He -would bring forth His loyal Son, whose right it is to rule, and to that Son the right shall be given and His rule shall be by divine right. He is the King and the first One that will rule the world by divine right. It is of importance to man, in order that his faith may be established, that he definitely determine the lineage of this mighty Euler.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Lineage</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Scriptures leave no room for doubt as to who shall be the rightful Head of all earthly government, which government shall be set up in God’s own due time. The truths concerning that great government were written expressly for the benefit of those who search out the truth, that these might have their faith firmly established and have a sure foundation for the hope of a righteous government. (Rom. 15:4) To such God has furnished His Word as a lamp or light to guide the course of action taken by those who want to serve Him.—Ps. 119:105.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Shortly following the flood, Noah, by God’s direction, uttered a prophecy foretelling the blessing of his sons Shem and Japheth, particularly the blessings concerning Shem. “'And he said, Blessed be the Lord God of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant. God shall enlarge Japheth, and he shall dwell in the tents of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant.”—Gen. 9:26, 27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Melchizedek is the first one mentioned in the Scriptures as a man who ruled any people by divine right. Undoubtedly he was of Shem’s line, and it is quite probable that Shem and Melchizedek -were one and the same person. Shem was living at the time Abraham met Melchizedek and paid tithes to him. (Gen. 11:11) Abraham was a descendant of Shem. (Gen. 11:12-26) To Abraham God said: </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“I</span><span class="font6"> will make nations of thee, and kings shall come out of thee.” (Gen. 17: 6) Based upon these prophetic parts of the Record, it is certain that He who should receive the right to rule would descend from the line of Shem and through Abraham.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jacob -was a grandson of Abraham. God changed Jacob’s name to that of Israel. Then God caused this prophecy to be written: “There shall come a Star out of Jacob, and a Sceptre shall rise out of Israel. . . . Out of Jacob shall come he that shall have dominion, and. shall destroy him that remaineth of the city.” (Num. 24:17, 19) Jesus said of Himself: “I am the root and the offspring of David, and the bright and morning star.”—Rev. 22:16. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">. Judah was a son of Jacob,, concerning whom a special prophecy was written. “The sceptre shall not depart from Judah, nor the ruler’s staff from between his feet, until Shiloh come; and unto him shall the obedience of the peoples be.” (Gen. 49:10, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">R. V.)</span><span class="font6"> The descent of the rightful Ruler of earth must therefore be through the line of Judah. The name Judah means praise. (Gen. 29:35) “Judah, thou art he whom thy brethren shall praise.” (Gen. 49:8) The mighty One whom Judah foreshadowed is called “the Lion of the tribe of Juda”. (Rev. 5:5) This shows that the mighty One foretold would praise Jehovah God and would in turn be praised for His faithfulness and loyalty’- to God and His praise should arise from all creation in God’s due time.—Phil. 2: 5-11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">After the death of Joshua,, leadership was given to Judah. (Judg. 11:1, 2) “For Judah prevailed above his brethren, and of him came the chief ruler;'but the birthright was Joseph’s.” (1 Chron. 5:2) “Judah is my sceptre [symbol of authority].”—Ps. 60: 7, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">R. V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Caleb was of the tribe of Judah; and at the division of the land in Palestine Caleb received as his inheritance the mountain of Hebron. (Josh. 14:12-14) “Mountain” is a symbol of a government or kingdom. In that division of the land the tribe of Judah as a whole received a tract of land which bordered on Mount Seir, the latter being a symbol of the Devil’s organization of earth. (Josh. 15: 8-10) This would indicate that the Devil’s organization would extend up to the beginning of the government of Jehovah ruled by Him whose right it is to rule, which ruler should descend through the line of Judah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jesse was of the tribe of Judah. It was Jesse’s son David whom Jehovah anointed as king over Israel. (1 Sam. 16:13) To David the Lord said: “And it shall come to pass, when thy days be expired that thou must go to be with thy fathers, that I will raise up thy seed after thee, which shall be of thy sons; and I will establish his kingdom. But I will settle him in mine house and in my kingdom for ever: and his throne shall be established for evermore.” (1 Chron. 17:11, 14) To Solomon the son of David, God said: “And if thou wilt walk before me, as David thy father walked, in integrity of heart, and in uprightness, to do according to all that I have commanded thee, and wilt keep my statutes and my judgments: Then I will establish the throne of thy kingdom upon Israel for ever, as I promised to David thy father, saying, There shall not fail thee a man upon the throne of Israel.”—1 Ki. 9:4, 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">That both David and Solomon foreshadowed the real Ruler is made clear by the words of the prophecy: “Of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end, upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom, to order it, and to establish it with judgment and with justice, from henceforth even for ever. The zeal of the Lord of hosts will perform this.” “And in mercy shall the throne be established: and he shall sit upon it in truth in the tabernacle of David, judging and seeking judgment, and hasting righteousness.” (Isa. 9:7; 16:5) That David foreshadowed the rightful Ruler and His coming righteous government is just as certain as day and night.—Jer. 33: 20, 21, 25, 26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the year 606 B.C., with the overthrow of Zedekiah, the last king of Israel, there was a breach made in the line of rulers over Israel, God’s chosen people. Through His prophet God foretold a day coming when He would close up this breach and bring into power earth’s rightful Governor and that that Ruler would be of the line of David. “In that day will I raise up the tabernacle of David that is fallen, and close up the breaches thereof; and I will raise up his ruinSj and I will build it as in the days of old.” —Amos 9:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Mount Zion is a symbol of God’s organization, of which organization earth’s rightful Governor must be the Head. In line with the foregoing prophecies it is written : “Moreover he refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose no.t the tribe of Ephraim: but chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved. And he built his sanctuary like high palaces, like the earth which he hath established for ever. He chose David also his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds.”—Ps. 78: 67-70.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Bethlehem was small among the families of Judah, but God chose it as the place of the birth of the rightful Ruler of earth and foretold that through His prophet: “But thou, Beth-lehem Ephratah, though thou be little among the thousands of Judah, yet uut of thee shall he come forth unto me that is to be ruler in Israel; whose goings x. /th have beten from of old, from everlasting.” (Mic. 5:2) Bethlehem was the home of Jesse and the home of David, who was anointed by Jehovah as the king over Israel, and Bethlehem is often called the city of David.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Mary, the virgin of the house of David, conceived a Son by the power of the holy spirit of God. (Luke 1:27-29) God sent his angel from heaven to inform Mary that she should be the mother of the promised One which the prophets of God had foretold: “And the angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary: for thou hast found favour with God. And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name JESUS. He shall be great, ; and shall be called the Son of the Highest; and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David.”—Luke 1: 30-32.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Scriptures therefore trace the lineage of Jesus in an unbroken line from Shem, from Abraham, from Jacob, from the tribe of Judah, through David, God’s anointed king over His people. In due time the Son of Mary, who God announced through His angel should be called Jesus, was born at Bethlehem as foretold. On that memorable occasion the holy angels of heaven bore testimony to His identity. The special messenger whom God delegated to give witness said: “Fear not: for behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people. For unto you is born this day, in the city of David, a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord.”—Luke 2:9-11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Apostle Peter, moved by the power of the holy spirit, testified that Jesus Christ is the</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">One whom God foretold as ‘he whose right it is to be the ruler of earth’. “Men and brethren, let me freely speak unto you of the patriarch David, that he is both dead and buried, and his sepulchre is with us unto this day. Therefore being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him, that of the fruit of his loins, according to the flesh, he would raise up Christ to sit on his throne; he, seeing this before, spake of the resurrection of Christ, that his soul was not left in hell, neither his flesh did see corruption.”—Acts 2: 29-31.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark154"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark155"></a>His Anointing</span></h5>
<p><span class="font6">From the time of His birth until He reached the age of thirty years very little is said about Jesus. At that age He had reached His majority, and there His work in the earth began. He proceeded immediately to John and requested John to baptize Him in the waters of the Jordan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Anointing is a symbol of delegated power and authority. tVhen Jehovah would signify that He had conferred authority upon David as king He caused His prophet to anoint David with oil. (1 Sam. 16:13) “I have found David my servant ; with my holy oil have I anointed him.'’ (Ps. 89:20) “And Nathan said to David, Thou art the man. Thus saith the Lord God of Israel, I anointed thee king over Israel, and I delivered thee out of the hand of Saul.”-—2 Sam. 12:7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Wherever the Scriptures speak of “the Lord’s anointed” that term almost exclusively refers to the Ruler or Governor. (Ps. 2:2; Lam. 4: 20) The titles “Messiah” and “Christ” mean “the Anointed One”. The title is used particularly with reference to rulership. Daniel the prophet spoke of Messiah, or the Anointed One, as “the Prince” or ruling One. (Dan. 9:25) The Jew's so understood the term Messiah to mean Tie who should rule’. The Jews were looking for a king or ruler who should relieve them from the Roman yoke and establish a just and righteous government. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When some of the faithful Jews had learned from John concerning Jesus and had seen Jesus they spoke to their brethren and said: “IV e have found the Messias, which is, being interpreted, the Christ [the Anointed, margin].” (John 1:41) God’s prophet testified that the Anointed One is the rightful Ruler of the earth: “I saw in the night visions, and, behold, one like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days, and they brought him near before him. And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all people, nations, and languages, should serve him: his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom that -which. shall not be destroyed.”-—Dan 7:13, 14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The baptism of Jesus in the waters of the Jordan symbolically testified that He had agreed to be entirely submissive to the will of Jehovah God. At that time He was anointed by Jehovah with His spirit and power. God there announced His approval of Jesus. “And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the water: and, lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting upon him: and lo a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.” (Matt. 3:16, 17) The Scriptural proof is that His anointing showed that He was clothed with power in due time to destroy the wicked organization of the Devil. “How God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the holy spirit and with power: who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for God was with him.” (Acts 10: 38) “He that committeth sin is of the devil; for the devil sinneth from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil.”—1 John 3:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At the time of the anointing of Jesus God. conferred upon Him the authority and power to be God’s Priest and Prince. He was there appointed to the office of Priest and Prince for ever after the order of Melchizedek. (Ps. 110: 4; Heb. 6:20; 7:17) Let the fact be kept in mind that Melchizedek was a priest upon his throne. As a priest he was a servant of the Most High and therefore the special officer of the Most High; and as a prince he was a ruler or king acting by authority from the Most High. Melchizedek was a type o<sup>p +</sup>he great Ruler who shall rule the world by divine right and authority. It was at the time of the baptism of Jesus that the authority to be King or Ruler was conferred upon Him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Tim anointing of Jesus carried with it the power and authority and obligation to tell the people who would hear of and concerning the government that God would erect and'how the people could be relieved from Satan’s rule.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Shortly after His anointing at the Jordan He said in the presence of the Pharisees and people : “The spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor; he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised, to preach the acceptable year of the Lord.”—Luke 4:18, 19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">On that occasion He was quoting from the Prophet Isaiah, who had foretold what should be done by the Anointed of the Lord when on earth. (Isa. 61:1-3) He stated on that occasion that on that day He began the fulfilment of that prophecy. “From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.”, (Matt. 4:17) During the three and one-half years of His ministry that followed, Christ Jesus emphasized the fact of God’s kingdom or government of righteousness that should be established for the benefit of man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Temptation</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There must be a preparatory work concerning Himself as earth's rightful Ruler. At the very outset of His work Jesus was subjected to great temptation or test. He had been forty days and nights in the wilderness without food. It was at the end of those forty days of fasting that the temptation came to Him. (Matt. 4:1) To be sure, it was the spirit of Jehovah that led Jesus into the wilderness, because He had agreed to do Jehovah’s will and was being led by the power of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But why should Jehovah God even permit His beloved Son to be beset by Satan the Devil and subjected to temptation? Briefly, the answer is, that Jesus by withstanding this temptation or trial might prove His loyalty and faithfulness to God. To be tempted means to be put to a test. Jehovah had anointed His Son Jesus to be King or Ruler, and before permitting Him to reign God would prove His Son by a severe test. Jesus had always been loyal and true to His Father, but now He was anointed to be God’s great Prince and King to rule the world, and God would prove His Son by actual experience.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The purpose of Satan, of course, in placing the temptation before Jesus was to induce Jesus to break His agreement with Jehovah, which would have resulted in Jesus’ own destruction. If Jesus would break His agreement with God to be obedient to Him He w<sup>T</sup>ould die and of course would not take the office of Ruler over the world. If Jesus would prove His faithfulness and loyalty to God under the test He would prove Himself entirely worthy to be trusted with the great authority and power as Ruler of the world. Therefore God permitted the enemy Satan to apply the test, and God saw to it that that test resulted to His own praise and glory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The subtle and wily enemy Satan put the temptation before Jesus. He knew that Jesus, having fasted for forty days, was hungry. He said to Him: “If thou be the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread.” The reply of Jesus was: “It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that pro-ceedeth out of the mouth of God.” Moses had said in substance the same thing to the Israelites, that their life depended upon faithfulness in the keeping of their covenant with God. (Deut. 8:3) Jesus was holding firmly to that rule. He resisted the Tempter and proved His faithfulness to God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Satan, knowing that God had anointed Jesus to be Ruler, and knowing the opposition that Jesus had among the Pharisees, thought to entrap Jesus by inducing Him to perform some daring and spectacular feat. He thought to appeal to His pride. The enemy therefore, in substance, said to Jesus: ‘Why don’t you go up on the temple and jump off into the valley? God’s angels will bear you up so that you won’t be hurt, and the people seeing this miracle will be convinced that you are more than an ordinary man and they will more readily support you.’ That proposition was seductive, diplomatic, politic and cruel. Jesus replied: “Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Devil then and there laid claim to rulership of all the kingdoms of the world. Jesus did not dispute that claim. In fact Satan was then the god of the whole world. The Devil then proposed to Jesus that he would abdicate and turn over the rulership of the world to Jesus provided Jesus would worship the Devil. Had Jesus done so He would have shown His disloyalty and unfaithfulness to God and would have been destroyed. His reply to Satan was: “Thou shalt worship Jehovah thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In this great test Satan had lost, Jesus had won, and God had proven His Son to be loyal, faithful and true. (Matt. 4:1-10; Luke 4:1-13) Then the Devil left Jesus for a season. Never during the three and one-half years that Jesus was on earth did Satan miss an opportunity to try to entrap Jesus and destroy Him. The temptations that he put before Him were divers and numerous and were advanced in a subtle and wily manner. Through them all Jesus proved His full devotion to His Father. This was a part of the preparatory work for rulership.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark156"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark157"></a>Persecution</span></h5>
<p><span class="font6">An attempt was made to kill Jesus even before Mary gave birth to the babe. Satan was back of that attempt. Then an attempt was made by Herod to have the child Jesus destroyed. To carry out his purpose he caused all the children of Bethlehem of two years and under to be killed. (Matt. 2:16) The master mind of Satan arranged that..scheme for the destruction of the child.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When Satan found that he was unable to turn Jesus away from His course of righteousness and complete devotion to His Father, then He instituted a system of cruel persecution against Him. God could have prevented it, but He permitted it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">From and after the day of Enos, when the people under Satan’s supervision in derision and mockery called themselves by the name of the Lord, Satan continued to reproach God. When Jehovah sent His beloved Son into earth and anointed Him to be King or Ruler then Satan heaped upon the Son the reproaches which he had heaped upon the Father. It is written: “I am become a stranger unto my brethren, and an alien unto my mother’s children. For the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up: and the reproaches of them that reproached thee are fallen upon me.”—Ps. 69: 8, 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jesus was born a Jew, and was subject to the terms of the law covenant with the Jews. God sent Him to the Jews to do a work in connection with His coming government, and particularly to inform the Jews thereof. The leaders of Israel, to wit, the clergy and the principal ones of their flocks, led the persecutions against Jesus; and Satan was the super-mind back of it all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There were some faithful Jews who acknowledged Jesus as the Anointed One of God, and to them _yyas extended God’s special favor: “He came unto his own, and his own received him not. But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name.” (John 1:11,12) The others put forth their best efforts to make His existence burdensome and to destroy Him. These experiences of Jesus were in exact accord with what had been prophesied of and concerning Him. “He is despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief; and we hid as it were our faces from him; he was despised, and we esteemed him not.”— Isa. 53: 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jesus was perfect, holy, harmless, and without sin, and He did harm to no one. The fact that He w<sup>T</sup>as despised and persecuted is proof that Satan the evil one was causing the persecution and for the reason that Jesus was anointed to be the Ruler of the world. Jesus had a message of special importance to the Jews that would be beneficial to them. They were His brethren and He came to help them. Satan induced them to despise and reject and persecute Him. Bear in mind always that those men whom Satan used to lead the persecution against Jesus, and who caused Him great sorrow and suffering, were the clergymen of that time, who claimed to be the representatives of God. This proves that the clergymen and the principal of their flock were the sons of the Devil and not the sons of God. Jesus plainly told them that they were of the Devil.—John 8: 43, 44. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jesus was “a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief”; and one reason was that He saw men who claimed to represent His Father, and who were daily misrepresenting Him and slandering His holy name, and who were heaping ignominy upon Jesus because He came from God and represented Him on earth. Those instruments of Satan hated Jesus without a juM cause or excuse for so doing. “They that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of mine head; they that would destroy me, being mine enemies wrongfully, are mighty; then I restored that which I took not away.”—Ps. 69: 4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">God through His holy prophets had repeatedly told the Jews of the coming of the One whom Moses and David foreshadowed. Now Jesus had come in fulfilment of these prophetic utterances. He furnished ample evidence for the leaders of Israel to know that He was God’s Anointed. These Jewish clergymen were familiar with the law and the prophets and yet they continued to persecute Jesus and laid upon Him all manner of reproaches. They accused Jesus of being a glutton and a winebibber and a sinner because He drank and ate according to His needs and because He showed some kindness to publicans and sinners.—Matt. 11:19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Because, by casting out demons Jesus relieved some of the people of their sufferings, which sufferings the Devil had caused to come upon them, the clergy accused Jesus of being the chief of devils. (Matt. 12: 24) They accused Him of blasphemy because He told them the truth concerning Himself, which they should have known by reading the prophecies. (John 10: 36) Then Jesus spoke a parable to the clergy, which parable was in fact a prophecy and was to the effect that Jehovah had planted a vineyard and entrusted it to the Jews, particularly the leaders in Israel; that Jehovah had sent His prophets to them and they had beaten and stoned and killed them; and now at last He had sent to them His Son, and when they saw the Son these evil-minded men,had said: ‘Let us kill him, and seize the inheritance.’—Matt. 21: 33-41.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">To be sure Satan induced this persecution of Jesus by and through the clergy and Jesus was telling them that they were so doing. Satan could use the clergy because they had forsaken God and had yielded to the invisible rulership of the Devil. They preferred the approval of men and enjoyment of the little power they had to being faithful to God. Although they claimed to represent God, they were in truth the representatives of the Devil, as Jesus told them; and because He told them the truth they sought to kill Him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">For more than three years the relentless persecution of Jesus continued, and at the end of His earthly ministry the representatives of the peoples of Israel, to wit, the clergy, profiteers, and politicians, entered into a conspiracy to have Jesus put to death. (Matt. 26: 3-5) Carrying out that conspiracy they caused the arrest of Jesus, brought forth false witnesses, held a session of court contrary to their own law, compelled the accused to give testimony against Himself contrary to their law, and without any true evidence and without any just cause or excuse Jesus was convicted, sentenced, and then put to an ignominious death by being hanged upon the cross. He died as if He had been a sinner. The prophet had written the words that were in Jesus’ mouth: “Thou hast known my reproach, and my shame, and my dishonour: mine adversaries are all before thee. Reproach hath broken my heart; and I am full of heaviness: and I looked for some to take pity, but there was none; and for comforters, but. I found none.”—Ps. 69:19, 20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Could not Jehovah God have prevented the persecution and suffering and ignominious death of His beloved Son h To be sure Jehovah could, because He is almighty and His power knows no limitation. Why then did the Almighty God permit His Son to be persecuted and thus to suffer?</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark158"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark159"></a>'Obedience</span></h5>
<p><span class="font6">The inspired writer answers the question: “Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered.” (Heb. 5: 8) Again God would emphasize the importance, of obedience. In the days of Saul God had said through His prophet: “To obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams. For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry.”— 1 Sam. 15: 22, 23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">God had anointed His son Lucifer to be a covering cherub and that son had proven unfaithful and disloyal. God had now anointed His beloved Son Jesus to be the Head of the great government of righteousness, which He would establish; and before He would exalt Him to the high position of actual rulership God would prove His beloved Son by permitting’ Him to be subjected to the most severe trials. The persecutions that were heaped upon Him afforded the opportunity for Him to learn obedience. By these experiences Jesus did learn obedience and proved His worthiness to be fully and for ever’ entrusted with the work before Him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jesus was so thoroughly devoted to His Father and to the work set before Him that He said: “I can of my own self do nothing.” (John 5: 30) That did not mean that He had no ability to do, but that His covenant with Jehovah would permit Him to do nothing contrary to God’s holy will. Thus He emphasizes the lesson God would teach all of His intelligent creatures: that obedience is of the greatest importance. Those who fail to obey fall to the influence of the evil one, and their stubbornness in refusing to obey J orders is lawlessness that leads to devil-wor-i ship. This rule’s being so thoroughly and completely established in the experience of Jesus in preparing Him for His exalted position is conclusive proof that God will require obedience of every one whom He exalts. To this end it is । written: “Humble yourselves therefore under | the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you I in due time”; Tor God resists the proud, but j gives his favor to the obedient.’—1 Pet. 5:5, 6. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">I</span><span class="font6"> Paul under inspiration states that Jesus did I not seek to grasp more than was intended for ; Him, nor did lie take a course contrary to God’s • will. He was willingly submissive to His Father’s will; and knowing that no trials and persei cutions and sufferings could come to Him with-| out His Father’s permission, He gladly sub<sup>;</sup> mitted thereto. It brought upon Him great suffering and sorrow and it led to an ignominious death. But by all these experiences He learned to he obedient; and because He thus learned . obedience, Jehovah exalted Him to the highest } place in the universe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">t “Have this mind in you, which was also in | Christ Jesus: who, existing in the form of God, j counted not the being on an equality with God t a thing to be grasped, but emptied himself, . . . f &nbsp;&nbsp;being made in the likness of men; and being</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">; &nbsp;&nbsp;found as a man, he humbled himself, becoming</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">| obedient even unto death, yea, the death of the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">I</span><span class="font6"> cross. Wherefore also God highly exalted him, { &nbsp;&nbsp;and gave unto him the name which is above</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be visible or invisible to men? He will be in-</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>5</sup> visible because He was put to death as a man ; and raised out of death a spirit. (1 Pet. 3:18) Hu-[ &nbsp;&nbsp;man eyes can not behold a spirit. To man a</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">j &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;spirit being is like the wind. Man can see the</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">J &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;effects of the wind, and can hear it and feel it,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but he can not, by the exercise of the human sense of sight, see the wind itself. That is, in substance, what Jesus told Nicodemus concerning spirit beings.—John 3: 5-8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jesus was born of the spirit at His resurrection out of death. He afterward appeared to His disciples in human form and in different bodies. Manifestly the body for each appearance was created for the purpose. He did not appear, hotvever, at any time in His glorious spirit body. Paul came the nearest of any one to seeing His glorious body. Paul saw<sup>T</sup> only the reflection of the light therefrom, and the brightness of that light exceeded the brightness of the sun at midday. (Acts 9:3; 26:13) This is exactly in harmony with what Jesus said to His disciples concerning men of the world seeing him: “Yet a little while, and the world seeth me no more.”—John 14:19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Seeing that the Logos, the Son of God, was originally a spirit and that His life was thereafter transferred to human, that He became a man, and that He died as a man and was raised from the dead as a spirit being, and it being true that He will exercise His power as ruler while a spirit being, could He have become the Head of the righteous government that God will establish and rule it without ever having come to earth? Yes, He could have become the invisible ruler without becoming a man, but had He done so His rulership would never have resulted in the complete and full blessing of mankind. Vvhy, then, did Jesus become a man, and why did He die ? .</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Ransom</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The purpose was to ransom or redeem the human race and to make it possible for man to lie-come perfect mentally, morally and physically. To understand the relationship that the deatii and resurrection of Jesus bear to His rulership will enable the student to see some of the wonderful expressions of Jehovah’s loving-kindness toward man. The proper answer to the foregoing can illuminate the matter. The sending of Jesus to earth as a man by Jehovah, the death and resurrection of Jesus, all were a part of God’s preparatory work for the great government that shall result in the eternal blessing of the human race.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah’s human creature Adam was a perfect man. His wilful disobedience of God’s law brought upon Him the sentence of death and expulsion from his perfect home in Eden. The perfeet man and his perfect wife had no offspring. After man was under the sentence of death, and after he had been expelled from Eden, he begot and his wife gave birth to their children. Adam and Eve, being under the sentence of death, and undergoing that sentence, were of course imperfect ; and the natural result was that their offspring came into existence as imperfect creatures. These children were born in sin because anything imperfect can not keep God’s law perfectly but will transgress it, and sin is the transgression of God’s law. (1 John 3:4) The recompense or wages of sin is death. (Bom. 6:23) It follows then that all the children of Adam were born sinners. (Rom. 5:12) They were all “born in sin and shapen in iniquity”. (Ps. 51:5) The ultimate destiny of all would therefore be destruction, which is death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">God purposes to redeem or ransom man from death and the grave and He gave His word that this should be done. (Iios. 13:14) Being absolutely just, God could not reverse His own judgment and forgive man and release him. The infraction of the law which Adam committed demanded a perfect human life. If another perfect man would willingly take, Adam’s place in death as Adam’s substitute, and thus meet the demands of the judgment, then God could with consistency release Adam and his offspring from the judgment and its effects. But there was no man who could redeem even himself, because of his own imperfection; and of course he could not give himself as a ransom fox<sup>-</sup> his brother. “None of them can by any means redeem his brother, nor give to God a ransom for him.”— Ps. 49:7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The disloyal son of God, Lucifer, now called Satan the Devil, was really the first who started sin in action. God’s purpose is to take away Satan’s lordship over man and institute a righteous government in the place and stead thereof and to give that government to one in full harmony with Himself. God loved man and purposed to recover him. The perfect man was His creature; and He would give imperfect man an opportunity to be fully recovered. God would place in the hand of His beloved Son, the Logos, the government of righteousness that He would proceed to establish foi’ man’s benefit. To the end that mankind might benefit fully therefrom, however, man must first be ransomed or redeemed from death and the grave. By willingly being a man, and then willingly suffering death that God’s purposes might be carried out, His beloved Son would prove beyond a possibility of doubt that He would be for ever loyal and faithful to God and would carry out God’s righteous plan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">His beloved Son was the great delight of Jehovah. (Prov. 8:30) God is entirely unselfish, which means that God is love. He would, however, deny Himself the delight and daily communion with His beloved Son in order that He might recover man and at the same time prepare His beloved Son for the most exalted position of rulership. Therefore God, to carry out His purposes and because of His love for humankind, sent Jesus to earth to die in behalf of the sinful race. “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.” (John 3:16, 17) God would first save the human race from destruction and then establish with man a. righteous government, that mankind might be fully restored to the position of perfection and fully enjoy that perfect government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When Jesus was thirty years of age He was a perfect man in every respect and fully qualified to become the ransomer of man. At that age He expressed His full desire to do the will of God, His Father. Therefore Jehovah entered into a covenant with His beloved Son, which is the 'covenant by sacrifice’, the carrying out of which would lead to the sacrifice of the man Jesus in order that He might take the place of Adam in death. That covenant was fully performed. Jesus said that He came to earth to give His life a ransom to the end that mankind might live. (Matt. 20:28; John 10:10) The death of the perfect man Jesus therefore provided the exact corresponding price, to wit, a perfect life for a perfect life which Adam had been compelled to give up because of sin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jesus became a man that God’s purpose to redeem man might be carried out. He was made a man for the tasting of death, and by giving His life He became a ransom for all. (Heb. 2:9; 1 Tim. 2: 3-6) If Adam and his offspring are to profit by the death of the perfect man Jesus, then Jesus as a man must remain dead for ever. This is true because the perfect man Jesus became a substitute in 'death for the perfect man 'Adam and the benefit thereof results to Adam and his offspring.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But why should Jesus die an ignominious death? Adam was a wilful sinner and was driven from Eden because of sin. Whoever would provide the ransom price for Adam must take his place as a sinner, and although being holy and without sin must die like a sinner. The manner of the death of the Redeemer was fixed in the penalty imposed upon the wilful sinners of the Jewish nation. It was written in the Jewish law: “Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree.” (Gal. 3:13; Dent. 21:23) The death of Jesus upon the cross or tree removed that curse from the Jews. Jesus was holy, harmless and without sin, and indeed He must be in order to provide the ransom price; yet He must take the place of the sinner in death and to that end He must die as a transgressor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Concerning Him it is written: “But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed. ... He hath poured out his soul unto death: and he was numbered with the transgressors ; and lie bare the sin of many.” (Isa. 53:5, 12) The value of the life of the perfect man Jesus poured out in death as a sinner must be presented in Jehovah’s court to constitute an atonement for sin, or a sin-offering, on behalf of man. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Next Sunday morning consideration will be given to the resurrection of Jesus as one of the progressive steps in preparing for Jehovah’s righteous government.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark27"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark160"></a>What the Congregationalists Stand For</span></h4>
<p><span class="font10">T</span><span class="font6">HE merest beginner of a Bible Student knows that our Lord and Savior Jesus</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Christ, and all His apostles, had the utmost reverence for Moses and the prophets, and accepted their words as God-given, as indeed they claimed to be. It follows, as a matter of course, that if Jesus and His apostles honored and worshiped a fraud, then they were unworthy of honor themselves, their record is not to be believed, and we are all without God and without hope in the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Now notice, in view of the above, what the Reverend Dr. H. C. Culbertson, pastor of the Plymouth Congregational Church, Los Angeles, California, thinks of this same collection of ancient writings, which Jesus and the apostles revered as the Word of God; and tell us whether the Reverend Culberston desires the people to reverence God or would be much better satisfied to have them reverence the Reverend Culbertson and stop right there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Out of the welter </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">of the million years of history </span><span class="font5">. sprang a nation Israel, which became famous, not for extent of empire nor material wealth, but because its prophetic leaders were thrilled by a new idea of God, and a dream of an ideal kingdom of righteousness. In their little country of Palestine, amid primitive conditions of barbaric warfare and cruel oppression, these teachers sought to follow the inner light of the soul, All the artistic genius of this race went into religious literature, and the choicest of their parchment scrolls were ultimately collected in what is now called the Old Testament. Here are included poetry and prose, history and fiction, drama and apocalypse. The collection represents different epochs of thought and varying heights of spiritual discernment. It records quaint old superstitions, strange ancient distinctions between clean and unclean and crude ideas about bribing the Deity with animal sacrifices. There are passages in it so immoral in teaching and in suggestiveness that they should not be allowed to circulate today. It should not be treated as scientific authority in the present day. Amid all these crudities and inadequacies, however, rise many passages of supreme and everlasting value.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The Children’s Own Radio Story </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">. By C. J. W., Jr. </span><span class="font6">Story Thirty-one</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">A</span><span class="font6">FTER healing the servant of the Roman centurion at Capernaum, Jesus went to a city of Palestine called Nain. As usual, many of His disciples went with Him, and He was followed by a great concourse of people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As Jesus approached the gate of the ancient city, He saw a funeral procession emerging from it, for it was the custom in those days to bury the dead outside the walls of a town. There is a very pretty story in the Bible relating the incident that happened at Nain, and we can not do better' than give it word for word right here:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Now when He came nigh to the gate of the city, behold, there was a dead man carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow: and much people of the city was with her.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“And when the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her, and said unto her, Weep not.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“And he came and touched the bier: and they that bare it stood still. And he said, Young man, I say unto thee, Arise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“And he that was dead sat up, and began to speak. And he delivered him to his mother.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“And there came a fear on all: and they glorified God, saying, That a great prophet is risen up among us; and. That God hath visited his people:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“And this rumour of him went forth throughout all Judaia, and throughout all the region round about.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Now two of the followers of John came to Jesus, and asked whether He was really and truly the Messiah for whom they had been looking, or whether they should look for one still greater.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jesus reproved them, and testified to His being the true Christ, having done these mighty works by the power of Jehovah God His Father. Jesus then began to upbraid the cities wherein He had done most of His mighty works, because they had not repented and listened to Him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">And then Jesus lifted up His eyes to heaven, and, addressing the heavenly Father, said: “I thank thee, 0 Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jesus was thanking God because He had made the Truth impossible for the worldly-wise and conceited Pharisees to understand, but easy to grasp and appreciate by the poor, every-day, uneducated man, who loved God. So you see that He here refers to the Pharisees as the “wise and prudent”, somewhat making fun of their comical pride, while He lovingly refers to the earnest seekers of Truth as babes, for such they are in God’s sight. Though many may be great,, strong men and well aged, they are but babes in the Truth, and God pities them as </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">human father pities his children.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Now there was a Pharisee of the city who invited Jesus to sup with him upon a certain night. And there was a woman of that'city who had sinned much, and everybody in the city knew that she was a wicked woman.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When this woman knew that Jesus was eating dinner with the Pharisee she came into the Pharisee's house with a box of perfume, and kneeling at Jesus’ feet, kissed them and anointed them with the perfume, and then wiped them with the hair of her head, which had grown long and abundant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Now the Pharisee thought, If this mam is really a prophet, he would know that this woman is a wicked person, and would not allow her to touch him.’ And Jesus knew at once what thoughts were passing in the man’s mind, so He. turned to him and said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“There was a certain creditor which had two debtors: the one owed five hundred pence and the other fifty. And when they had nothing to pay, he frankly forgave them both. Tell me, therefore, which of them will love him most?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">And His host, the Pharisee, answered: “I suppose that he to whom he forgave most.” And Jesus said: “Thou hast rightly judged.” And he turned to the woman and said, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Seest thou this woman? I entered into thine house, thou gavest me no water for my feet: but she hath washed my feet with tears, and wiped them with the hairs of her head. Thou gavest me no kiss: but this woman, since the time I came in, hath not ceased to kiss my feet. My head with oil thou didst not anoint : but this woman hath anointed my feet with ointment [perfume].</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Wherefore I say unto thee, Her sins, which are many, are forgiven; for she loved much: but to whom little is forgiven, the same loveth little.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“And he said to the woman, Thy faith hath saved thee: go in peace.”</span></p><img src="g_E_19290612_files/g_E_19290612-17.png" alt="" style="width:462pt;height:297pt;">

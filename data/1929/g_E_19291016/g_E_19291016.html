<p><span class="font9">The Race Between Man and Machine</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">f^QUPPOSE that civilization has increased the world’s demands to five times what they were fifty years ago (and surely that should be considered a very liberal estimate), how-is it with the supply? All will agree that invention and machinery have increased the supply to more than ten times what it was fifty years ago. A mentally blind man can see that as soon as enough machinery has been constructed to supply the demands, thereafter there must be a race, a competition between man and machinery: because there will not be enough work for all, even if no further additions were made of either men or machines. But more competition is being added; the world’s population is increasing rapidly, and machinery guided by increased skill is creating more and better machinery daily. Who can not see that, under the present selfish system, as soon as the supply exceeds the demand (as soon as we have overproduction) the race between men and machinery must be a short one, and one very disadvantageous to men? Machines in general are slaves of iron, steel and wood, vitalized by steam, electricity, etc. They can do not only more work, but better work, than men can do. And they have no minds to cultivate, no perverse dispositions to control, no wives and families to think of and provide for; they are not ambitious; they do not form unions and send delegates to interfere with the management of the business, nor do they strike; and they are ready to work extra hours without serious complaint or extra pay. As slaves, therefore, machines are far more desirable than either black or white human slaves, and human labor and skill are therefore being dispensed with as far as possible; and those who own the machine slaves are glad that under nresent laws and usages their fellow men are ee and independent, because they are thereby relieved of the responsibility and care on their behalf which their enslavement would necessitate.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The foregoing reads as if it might have been written yesterday; but it was written thirty-two years ago by Pastor Bussell, and it sizes up accurately a situation which is giving occasion for profound and anxious thought by myriads of people at this time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">A Fixed Permanent Mass of Unemployed</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">For more than a year now Secretary of Labor Davis has been insisting that the mechanization of industry has brought about a great problem of unemployment, and seems to be building up in America a fixed permanent mass of unemployed, and even the reactionary </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Literary Digest</span><span class="font5"> cautiously admits that “some of the men whose places are taken by a machine are given other jobs in the same concern, but such an absorption can take place only when the firm’s operations are expanding faster than laborsaving devices are being installed”. The National Industrial Conference Board’s figures show that, with the machinery they now have to work with, only sixty-seven men are needed to do the work which required a hundred men only twenty-five years ago.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Every time there is an increase in production of manufactured articles there is a small increase in manufacturing employment; and every time there is a decrease in production of manufactured articles there is a decrease in manufacturing employment; but the lines of production are growing farther and farther apart every year. Production every year is much, very much, greater than manufacturing employment, and meantime the population is steadily increasing. This is interesting, but more than interesting: it is ominous. Unemployed men and their families must eat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There was a time when Great Britain forbade the American colonies either to manufacture machinery or to import it; with characteristic generosity toward the rest of the world she wanted to do all the manufacturing herself. Just now she seems to be taking lessons, and not very pleasant ones, on how to do the very kind of work in which she once sought a monopoly. America has set the pace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It used to be thought that a salesman was more sure of his daily food than almost any other kind of person. Now it is open to question. Automatic merchandising machines are making their appearance everywhere, and the latest ones make it unnecessary for the buyer to have the exact coin called for by the purchase ; he may drop a coin of any denomination into the slot and receive his correct change, together with the article purchased. Efficiency experts have figured it out that sixty percent of the time of the average drug store salesman is consumed on automatic functions that a machine could perform just as well; and that inevitably means sixty percent fewer drug clerks to sell the tooth paste, razor blades, soaps, cigarettes, powders and medicines usually dispensed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Commerce and Finance</span><span class="font5"> says grimly (but perhaps does not realize just how grimly): “Automatic merchandising machines have given such a good sales account of themselves that almost any amount of effort looking toward their improvement is justified. As salesmen, they are worth training for bigger results.”</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark29"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark30"></a>The Machine in the Office</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5">It seems as if there is no end to the detail of office work, does it not? It is a day when every business undertaking rests upon statistics. But those statistics are now gathered so rapidly by machinery that it makes one’s head swim to think about it. Information is punched on cards, and after that data is once punched the cards are assorted and classified at the rate of 20,000 an hour, and any data any of the cards contain can be gleaned from them in a very short time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There is addition and subtraction, multiplica-. tion and division! It might be more correct to say that there used to be these things. In modern business offices this work is now all done by machinery. Only about twelve percent of office workers are now doing bookkeeping and stenography. Most office work is done by machinery.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Even typewriting, prosaic old typewriting (and the art is only fifty years old), has been all upset by the mechanical invasion. There is a new typewriter which prints twenty-two selected words and syllables, each at a single stroke. The job of typewriting at the branch office has. ceased to be a job at all. One sending machine in the main office, operated by any typist, is connected by wire to any number of motor-driven typewriters located in distant cities or departments, and as the original sender writes, so writes every other machine on the line. One operator does all the work formerly done by scores.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Would you be a linotype operator? You are learning the business just a little too late. Now a reporter comes in and spells the letters of each word direct into a ‘Talkie Typesetter’. By belt transmission the matrices are set, and, if desired, the same type may be set in one hundred other composing rooms throughout the country, by means of the teletypesetter. It is evident that the time is at hand when without the intervention of any linotype operator at all it will be possible to set the same story in type in every city in the country.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark31"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark32"></a>Jobs You Will Not Get</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5">Perhaps you aspire to be a telegraph o_perator or a wireless operator. But why aspire? The telegraph and the wireless companies now do not need operators. All they need is persons who know how to do typing on a typewriter; the machinery does all the rest, sending and receiving messages by wire and by wireless accurately and much more rapidly than could be done if the human brain were to intervene. Really, the human brain would be in the way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Possibly you would like a position as a telephone operator. You may as well forget it. The prediction is made that by 1930 there will not be a telephone girl in Washington, D. C.; and the automatic telephone will soon displace the 20,000 girls that make their living as telephone operators in New York city.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Ah! You would be an engineer, working out abstruse and difficult problems of curves and graphs that take years to learn and months to perform. Sorry, but Dr. Bush, of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, has designed the Integraph, which makes it unnecessary to employ you. It is an adding machine carried to mathematical heights to which few people can </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">50,</span><span class="font5"> and it does a month’s work in a few minutes and does it accurately.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Maybe you would risk a brush with the police and resort to telling fortunes for a living. You won’t need to. There is a machine that will tell just as good a fortune, even print it on a little card and hand it to you, including the date and your correct weight, all for one cent, and you certainly could not afford to compete with it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Chimney sweep! That’s the thing. Face streaked with soot, ladders, ropes, brooms, brushes and dirt galore. Too late. The whole thing is done by machinery, and the suction of the forty-horsepower engine used is so strong that one time a live kitten was rudely hauled off the hearth and kited up the chimney into the dirt bag in jig time, whence it was rescued with some difficulty and somewhat the worse for wear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">You could at any rate be a companion for somebody who needs to have a person handy to read to him. But no! The General Electric laboratories have invented a thing that will read aloud, thus relieving the strain on the eyes, and the listener will get the contents three times as fast as if you were reading it to him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There was a time when you would have liked a job as watchman somewhere; but not now. The big concerns are making robots as fast as they can turn them out, and these mechanical servants have the ability and the gall to call up headquarters and solemnly say , “It is hot” or “It is cold”, and they do other things; which keeps several men off the pay roll. In March of this year England had seven of these mechanical servants in use, and it is predicted that within a few years they ‘will be commonplace sights in all large cities. In response to a challenge Dr. II. D. Baernstein, of the University of Wisconsin physiological chemistry department, has invented a robot which he claims can be taught. The account says: “Dr. Baernstein’s 'thinking’ apparatus consists of numerous switches, wires, and an incandescent light. The mechanism, he said, is so arranged that the bulb may be lighted by one of the switches and that any of the other switches may be 'taught’ to light the bulb. The operation, he claims, is analogous to the presentation of stimuli. The . ffiine is merely a symbol of mechanism of the human body.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">More Production but Fewer Employees</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the last four years there has been a decrease of five percent in the number of employees in the oil refining business, but an increase of eighty-four percent in the amount of oil refined. There has been a decrease of thirteen percent in the number of tobacco factory employees, but an increase of fifty-three percent in the amount of the dirty weed made ready for human pollution. There are nineteen percent - fewer employees in the slaughtering and packing of meat, but there is an output twenty percent greater. The railroads have one percent fewer employees and are handling thirty percent more traffic. And so it goes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">You would be a miner? No, you would not. Coal-mining is fast becoming a factory routine. Already, seventy-one percent of American bituminous coal is mined by machinery. You do not need to hang around the steel works looking for a job; for the steel companies can produce almost three times as much pig iron today as they did in 1904, with the same crew of men. Yes, of course, the country is prosperous. You read it in the paper, did you not? But the prosperity goes to the machine owners.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Where does labor go? It goes to the same place the bent pins go. There has been a decrease of 900,000 factory employees since 1920, and the railroads have cut their force 240,000 in the same time. One man now turns out as many razor blades as sixty-four could make in 1912. In ten years the output has increased 211 percent in rubber manufacture and 102 percent in automobiles. A machine which tests radio tubes accurately takes the place of twenty-five to thirty girls. Trenching machines, gasoline cranes, bucket conveyers and other devices have transformed the building industry into a machine industry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Let’s get jobs in banks. No, let’s not. The largest banks are rapidly installing ledger-posting and typewriter accounting machines. The new and improved pattern, known as the “business brain”, will do simultaneously the work of a cash register, a bookkeeper and an adding machine, and, from another part of the building, make a complete record of a sale at the time it is made. One of these machines installed in a bank (and it can be operated by a girl) does away with the work of nine-tenths of the employees. A feature of the machine is that it calls attention to an overdraft by automatically locking itself, and prints the amount in red when the lock is released. ..</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark33"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark34"></a>Machines for All Kinds of Work</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5">Let’s give up trying to get a high-class job. Better take one as a longshoreman and be done with it. Too late once more! The new motor-driven banana unloader not only saves much labor, but damages the fruit much less than unloading by hand. How about selling soft drinks or gasoline? Nothing doing. Very soon now and all this work will be done by machines operated with quarters or other coins in slots, like the washing machines in the basements of apartment houses. Some of these new selling machines actually give a sepulchral &quot;Thank you’ as the coins fall down into their hollow insides. There is a store at Atlantic City where all the salesmen are robots.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the city of Washington there are three robots, Adam, Cain and Abel, that furnish daily information on the amount of water in each reservoir. By means of the televox, a load dispatcher of an electric power company or street railway company can call up on any telephone an unattended power plant or substation, receive reports on the status of every machine from the robots in the station, and start or stop machines, open and close switches, and perform other operations at will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Road-making is now done by machinery. Concrete pipe is made and laid in position in a continuous line, without any joints. The huge water tunnels hundreds of feet beneath New York city will be dug by robots now being built at Schenectady. In the next war giant tanks will climb hills and plunge through gullies with no human being aboard. Machinery can be made to handle all the situations that the inventor of the machinery can foresee.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">You can always get a job on a farm. Or can you? Forty-five thousand harvesting and threshing machines have displaced 130,000 farm workers but recently. The plowing of a field is now done entirely automatically, and if the machine completes its task before morning the power is automatically shut off. The herediscope saves the time and study of livestock breeders figuring out how the Mendelian law will operate in given conditions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Today there is a typewriter weighing one ounce which fits into the vest pocket, and at the other end of the mechanical world there is a dynamo fifty feet in height which uses up one ton of coal every two minutes, to make light and powder for a part of New York city. There is a machine which exerts 600,000 pounds of pressure to the square inch; there is noiseless machinery, with gears made of compressed fibrous materials, and there is a machine which registers the tiny amounts of moisture in any substance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">How is it all to end? The editor of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Iron Trade Review</span><span class="font5"> says that we must have more machinery and ever more, so that more men may be taken into the purely service occupations which new machinery creates. But this does not go to the root of the matter. The American Federation of Labor, sensing the danger, says timidly that “the machine has justified labor’s demand for a five-day week”. It proposes to go over Niagara in a skiff.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Rabbi Goldman, of Cleveland, says that “industry, commerce and the machine are grinding men to pulp”; and that is the truth. Aldous Huxley, the English novelist and critic, sees culture ruined by mass production, democracy on the junk-heap, and the selfish and intelligent minority (owners of the machines) fighting for their lives against those who do not own the machines; and probably that is the truth too.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">What does all this mean? Did not the great God who made this world know what the result would be when He gave man an inventive mind 1 Of course He did, and that is what He wants man to use. God made man to be a prince, and not a slave. But when man desired to have his own way, God said to him, ‘All right. Suppose you try it; and while you are trying it, you may do the work yourself. When you find out how much you can do, you may desire to have some help.’ Man is now calling for that help; blindly, it may be, but calling nevertheless.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">God is now arranging that man may return to the plane God intended him for in the first place, namely, that of a prince. A prince usually has servants to do his menial work. So God has provided that man may have all the servants necessary to do all the manual labor, while man is to do the “bossing”, namely, run the machines and utilize the powers of nature. This is in preparation that man may have time for selfculture and education. God is also prepari’--to give each man the necessary education . fit him for a position as prince.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Thus what appears to he man’s greatest calamity is really but God’s preparation for his release from slavery, and his greatest blessing. Lift up your heads, ye weary, discouraged workmen ! God has not forgotten ybu, and soon the clouds will break and the glorious day of God’s heavenly kingdom will break through with all its glory.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">But why should any democratic government want to go to war unless its people, or the great majority of them, can be led to see the justice of such a course </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">1 </span><span class="font3">And especially when a government, in agreement with practically the whole -world, has renounced war as an instrument of national policy and agreed never to seek the solution of its disputes with other nations except by pacific means. Why should such a government seek to go to war unless it has back of it the moral support of at least the great majority of its thoughtful and conscientious citizens ?</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark65"></a>Mining the Heavens for Fertility of Earth </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">By W, H. Barton</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">T</span><span class="font5">HE time will come when it will be an honor to be called a farmer, a “husbandman”. Zechariah 13:5 says: “But he shall say, I am no prophet, I am an husbandman.” Here we have the false prophet speaking after he gets into the Millennium. He is ashamed of what he has been prophesying, and when he is addressed by his associates as “prophet”, in derision, he will claim to be of one of the most honorable vocations known to that age, farming. (See Zechariah 13:4: “And it shall come to pass in that day, that the prophets shall be ashamed every one of his vision, when he hath prophesied”)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Then is when he will claim to be of that honorable and noble class to whom it is promised: ‘Every man shall dwell under his own vine and fig tree where none dare to molest or to make afraid’; “the meek shall inherit the earth”; and ‘the righteous shall feed upon the fat of the land’. Ample evidences here of agricultural prosperity! Just what we might expect under a just rule: “And the Lord shall be king over all the earth; in that day shall there be one Lord, and his name one.”—Zech. 14: 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Satan is “the prince of this world” now; so acknowledged by Jesus when He was on earth, and he has never allowed the farmer a square deal. On the contrary, he has led him into ‘paths of unrighteousness’ in farm practice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In our farming today, as well as in our religion, there is little oneness of mind or purpose. Every man has his own ideas and is “prophesying” as if endowed with authority. Thus it has been ever since Satan caused our foreparents to be turned out of the only perfectly farmed area the world has ever known. But when He takes charge “whose right it is”, when the full light of Millennial truth shall shine alike upon all, then our agricultural practice, as well as our moral practice, will be directed strictly by a oneness of purpose and a oneness of practice that will result in a glorious harvest fitting the conditions of that “Golden Age”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If farmers had all the money accredited to ancient Croesus, and continued their present practice of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">soil robbery</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">feed buying,</span><span class="font5"> they would soon again be “as poor as Job’s turkey”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The world has never yet discovered how to obtain and maintain permanent prosperity without an agriculture based on soil building and economic production in a self-sustaining system.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">My friends, if I should make the statement that “all farmers are millionaires”, some of you, at least, would reply: “He’s talking nonsense.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Let me ask you this question: If you had millions of dollars’ worth of gold in the rocks on your farm, would you regard it “nonsense” to be called a millionaire? No. You would feel good over it and proceed at once to mine the gold and realize on your wealth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Now, I want to announce to you that each man who owns even one acre of land, is a </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">multimillionaire.</span><span class="font5"> Let me prove this statement!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Every square inch of the earth’s surface has a column of air resting on it that weighs approximately fifteen pounds. That fifteen pounds is four-fifths nitrogen, and four-fifths of fifteen is twelve; therefore, you have twelve pounds of nitrogen over each square inch of your land, waiting to be mined. Nitrogen is worth an average of about twenty cents a pound; therefore, you have $2.40 worth of it over each square inch of your land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Now listen: an acre of land contains 6,272,640 square inches, which at $2.40 a square inch would make $15,054,336, the value of the nitrogen over one acre of your land, waiting to be extracted by cooperating with nature in growing and turning legumes, such as vetch, crimson clover, etc. The supply is inexhaustible. You </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">can’t</span><span class="font5"> remove it all. You couldn’t use it all if you had it; for plants are like animals: they can eat just so much, and no more, each year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">How Can We Mine This Wealth?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">By sowing vetch in the fall and turning it in full bloom the next spring, you can easily get sixty pounds of nitrogen, which is equivalent to 400 pounds of nitrate of soda or 850 pounds of cotton-seed meal, a value approximating $12, plus the value of the humus-making material plowed under, which is easily worth as much more in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">soil ability.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If you thus treated as much as 100 acres each winter, your fertilizer benefit alone would be $1200 a year and $1200 more in soil ability, making a total increase of $2400 a year in soil fertility and soil ability, to say nothing about the 100-percent increase in the crops gathered for the first few years, at least, under this system.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If you should live to practise this system on the 100 acres for twenty years, the total income in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">nitrogen alone</span><span class="font5"> would be $24,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In Richmond County, N. C., from 1920 to 1925, when almost all the counties of both North and South Carolina were losing and lost from five hundred to a thousand farmers a county, Richmond County increased her number of farmers 415 during that time; and it was due to nothing more than the fact that she planted five thousand acres in velvet-beans, about two thousand acres of soybeans, and a carload of vetch seed. In other words, that “God-forsaken” county, consisting of three-fourths deep sand, woke up to the light of soil fertility and economic production through the use of legumes, and was not </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">afraid</span><span class="font5"> and its </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">banks</span><span class="font5"> vzere not afraid. You know banks do not loan money on uncertainties; you and I wouldn’t. They are “from Missouri”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Man knows that he can’t build up his body so that it will remain built up. He knows that he must build every day, even three times a day, to keep built up; and he knows also that he can’t build up his body by taking chemicals that stimulate only. He knows that he requires solid foods and bulky rations, additionally, to keep him “fit”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Strange to say, however, he doesn’t seem to know that his land’s requirements are similar. If he turns one crop of cow-peas or other legumes, he thinks that he has done wonders and his land ought to produce for ever on this one meal of fertility and ability. He doesn’t seem to realize that it must be fed yearly, to Say the least, if he expects it to build up and stay built up. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">He doesn’t seem to realize that God’s laws of nature are such that land will keep built up as long as man will let it alone and not rob it. It grows wild legumes, that take nitrogen from the air and drop it on the ground to enrich it, and deep-rooted weeds and trees bring up mineral plant food from the subsoil and drop it in their leaves on the surface of the land to keep it ‘fit’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If livestock is fed only non-legumes, such as cottonseed meal, corn, wheat products, oats, grass hays, etc., and the manure returned to the fields that grew the feeds, such land will gradually grow poorer; for all the manure that is in such feeds came from the soil of these fields, and the livestock uses about one-fourth of it and gives back only three-fourths, thus returning to the soil one-fourth loss than was taken from it. This is assuming that such livestock is kept on cement floors, day and night, to preserve every ounce of plant food in the manure. Of course, under our usual method of caring for manure the loss would be far more.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When legumes, such as pea hay, soybean hay, vetch or clover hay, etc., are fed and the manure returned to the fields that grew them, such fields gradually increase in fertility; for two-thirds of the nitrogen in the legumes is taken from the air; and, when fed to livestock, one-fourth of this two-thirds is used by them, and the remaining three-fourths of this two-thirds, or one-half the nitrogen in the legumes, is “brand new” nitrogen from the air that goes to increase soil fertility.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The writer has recently been in correspondence with our American Consulate at Jerusalem and has learned that the historic “plain of Jezreel”, Palestine, which, until 1920, lay for centuries a barren waste, has been settled by Jewish immigrants who have fulfilled prophecy by making the “desert blossom as a rose”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">They not only have purchased this vast waste of 51 square miles, but have improved thousands of acres of land and established twenty villages, all within about five years, 1921-1926.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">These villages are chiefly cooperative farming centers which practise diversification and rotation of crops, utilizing poultry and the dairy cow as a part of their system; </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">and it is distinctly stated</span><span class="font5"> that the chief sustenance of these cows is </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“vetch and clover”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This country is known as “Emek Jezreel”, which means, “Here sows God”; we are told that He sows </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“vetch and clover”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A few writers, like Calumella, Varro, Cato, and others, recognized such virtue in legumes in their day; but few farmers adopted their advice in practice. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Prof. W. F. Massey lived more than eighty years, and forty years of his life were devoted to preaching the cow-pea as a soil-saver and a crop-doubler. Yet his principal reward was to be dubbed “Cow-pea Massey”. The last twenty or more years of his life were devoted as faithfully to crimson clover; yet that plant is as scarce in southern agriculture as the proverbial “hen’s teeth”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The writer has spent the last twenty years of his life, in season and out of season, preaching winter and summer legumes as the key to soilsalvation and economic production in the South, and he has never failed to secure a large local acreage where he has worked; yet “the blamed thing don’t stay put”. Just as soon as the first three to five years of &quot;protracted meeting” are over, farmers proceed to backslide into the old well-beaten paths on which they again attempt to “climb up some other way”.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11" style="font-variant:small-caps;">D</span><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">octor Norman, of Bentonville, recently related to me the following strange experience. He and his party were arrested by the mayor of North Little Rock, Arkansas, as they were en route to a chiropractic convention. The mayor was drunk, swearing, and very intent on securing “bond money”, after which he would allow his prisoners’ release. When refused “bond money”, the mayor even threatened to shoot down the party as they stood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Finally the doctor and his party were rescued from the mayor and allowed to proceed on their otherwise peaceful journey. A city aiderman secured the sworn testimony concerning the truth of the affair from the doctor and friends; the mayor resigned to avoid impeachment; the above-mentioned aiderman was found dead with a bullet in his head, the reason for which was unknown. All this within a few days.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark68"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark69"></a>Cocoon, Most Beautiful of Caskets</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">M</span><span class="font5">OST beautiful of all caskets is the cocoon, the lovely shroud which the silkworm weaves for itself in the last three or four days </span><span class="font6">of </span><span class="font5">its life. So delicate is the tiny thread that issues from the spinneret in the silkworm’s upper lip that five of them must be united to produce </span><span class="font6">a </span><span class="font5">thread strong enough to stand handling, and sixty to produce a stocking thread.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One silkworm, during its feeding season, will eat its weight of mulberry leaves every day, and in a little over a month grows to be about two and a half inches long, loaded down with sacks full of the gmn of which the silk thread is subsequently spun into a two-strand thread carefully covered with gum.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A single worm will produce as high as ten thousand feet of silk filament, or up to two hundred feet of first-class stocking thread. This thread is woven in figure-eight fashion, evidently designed by the Creator to be removed and used for just the purpose for which it is now employed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The removal of the thread is a delicate job.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The surface of the cocoons must be cleaned and five of them uncoiled at one time, when together they are passed through the tiny guide which forms them into a miniature thread. The only way they can be handled at this stage is in trays of warm water, and constant resort to water is an element in all silk manufacture and use.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If the thread of the cocoon is not removed in ten or fifteen days, a beautiful moth emerges, destroying the cocoon in the process. This moth lives but a few days, and its only food is water. Nevertheless, during its brief period of life this moth lays its eggs, another supply of young silkworms, and the process begins all over again.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The name “silk” is derived from the name of the little Chinese lady, Si-Ling-Shi, who first made silk fabric. For centuries the secret of how silk is made was carefully guarded in the Orient, but finally two spies sent out by Emperor Justinian succeeded in bringing a quantity of silkworm eggs back to Europe in the staves which they used on their journey.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark72"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark73"></a>Do “Health Foods” Violate the Law?</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">(By Dr. G. R. Clements, Editor of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">How to Live</span><span class="font3"> Magazine)</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">U</span><span class="font5">NDER the heading, “Health Foods Hit by</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Ruling of U. S.,” the hand of the medical trust is again seen at work. The article appears in the press of May 26, and begins:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The public has been warned by the food division of the Department of Agriculture against using highly advertised “health foods” which claim curative or health-giving properties.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In a statement made public today, it is said that the department believes the use of the word “health” in connection with foods constitutes a misbranding under the food and drug act. The use of the word implies, it is said, that the products have health-giving or curative properties, when they merely possess some of the nutritive qualities to be expected in any wholesome food products.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If the medical trust advertises that vaccination and inoculation protect one’s “health” by making one immune to disease, not one word is said against it by the Department of Agriculture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If the medical trust kills and cripples scores of soldiers and school children by the deadly practice of vaccination and inoculation, not one word is said against it by any department of the government. But when health-building doctors, using only natural, hygienic measures, speak, about “health foods”, they are violating the law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The article continues:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The label-claims on these products are such that the consumer is led to believe that our ordinary diet is sorely deficient in such vital substances as vitamins and minerals, and that these so-called “health foods” are absolutely necessary to conserve life and health.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Ask the German sailors of the June issue of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">How To Live For Health and Strength</span><span class="font5"> whether or not “our ordinary diet is sorely deficient in such vital substances as vitamins and minerals”. Just 255 days on “our ordinary diet” put many of them in the hospital, and the rest of them on the verge of collapse.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When the surgeon of their ship put them on a diet of “health foods”, recommended by Alfred McCann, the men soon recovered from their disorders, after everything known to medical science had been done, and done in vain. Here is proof that “health foods” </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">are absolutely necessary to conserve life and health.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Quoting further from the article :</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The department does not object to calling these products “wholesome”, it is said, provided they are wholesome; but the effort to give the impression that we all need something added to our every-day diet if we are to avoid nutritional disaster is a misrepresentation which the food-law-enforcing authorities aim to combat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Not only would the medical trust force vaccination, inoculation, medication, and surgical operations upon the race, but now, with the aid of the government, the trust would compel humanity to adhere to “our every-day diet”. For it “is a misrepresentation which the food-law-enforeing authorities aim to combat” if any one shall claim “that we all need something added to our every-day diet if we are to avoid nutritional disaster”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At the Texas State Medical Society convention, held during May, 1929, it was decided, among other things, to launch during the coming year-</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Active campaigns throughout; Texas for the election of more (medical) doctors to the legislature, and more intensive efforts to obtain medical legislation....</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The legislative program demands that each state hospital be provided with a building for the treatment of acute infectious and contagious diseases; that provisions be made for the immunization against smallpox and typhoid fever in the hospitals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Why does the medical trust find it expedient to put medical doctors into political places ? To ■write the very articles from which we have quoted above regarding “health foods”. No one but medical doctors holding political offices write such articles, and they are published as coming from the “Department of ’Agriculture”, all of which constrains the unthinking mass to place much faith in information issued by the government. But the information is the product of a medical trust doctor, holding political office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The medical and serum trust is always working : planning, planning, planning to grasp greater control of the field of health and disease. The time is not far off when national medical compulsion will be a reality, unless the people see the handwriting on the wall and defeat at the polls every medical doctor running for office and every politician who is influenced by the medical and serum trust.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark74"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark75"></a>The Crime of Vaccination <a name="footnote1"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark76">1</a></sup>&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">By Tenison Deane, M. D.</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">T</span><span class="font5">HE author will relate this case, as one that started him in his investigation and study on the subject. June 15, 1889, the author was spending his vacation on the ranch of a wealthy farmer in the northern part of the state of California, fifteen miles from the nearest town, a farm of 10,000 acres, and no immediate neighbors. The farmer had a wife and seven children. The foreman, a negro, had a wife and five children. None had ever been vaccinated. Six of them were selected and vaccinated by the author.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The farmer’s wife, age 43 years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The farmer’s daughter, age 6 years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The farmer’s son, age 8 years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The farmer’s son, age 25 years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The negro foreman, age 46 years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">His son, age 12 years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">All the rest were left out and were not afterwards vaccinated. On August 1, 1890 (13% months later), the farmer, his wife and five children went to the mountain ranch forty miles away, taking with them the foreman, his wife and five children. There had been no diphtheria in the town nor any in their neighborhood. The mountain ranch was an uninhabited virgin pine forest district with pure water, where they took up their camp.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">On August 24 an epidemic of sore throat and canker sores developed among the children. Farmer’s daughter, seven years old; son, nine years old, and the foreman’s son, thirteen years old, developed very serious throat and constitutional symptoms and were taken to the home ranch, where a doctor was sent for. Diphtheria ■was the diagnosis. The farmer’s wife also developed diphtheria. All the rest who had not been vaccinated cured rapidly of their sore throats. The farmer’s daughter, seven years old, died. The farmer’s son, nine years old, did not recuperate for one year. The farmer’s wife, 44 years old, had paralysis and sequela;, -which lasted over one year. The foreman’s son, thirteen years old, became very weak and did not return to normal health.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In 1893 (4 years after being vaccinated) the farmer’s son, 29 years old, died in Los Angeles, Calif., of tubercular intestinal trouble; in 1900 (11 years after vaccination) the foreman, at 57 years of age, died of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">tubercle</span><span class="font5"> or </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">cancer of larynx;</span><span class="font5"> in 1902 (13 years after vaccination) the foreman’s son, 25 years old, died of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">tuberculosis; </span><span class="font5">in 1909 (20 years after vaccination) the farmer’s wife, 63 years old, died of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">cancer;</span><span class="font5"> in 1911 (22 years after vaccination) the farmer’s son, 30 years old, died of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">tubercular meningitis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The farmer died of old age. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">All the rest are living and in perfect health, nor have they ever been vaccinated.</span><span class="font5"> No tuberculosis has shown in any of those living, nor is there any family history of tuberculosis. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">All who were vaccinated in 1889 are now dead.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark77"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark78"></a>Sequoia, the Big Trees </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">By J. A. Bohnet</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">S</span><span class="font5">TARTING from Fresno, a 75,000-population city of surpassing beauty in central-eastern California, towards the southeast, one passes through the towns and hamlets of Sanger, Reedley, Dinuba and Orosi, on the fine national highway. Thence, more nearly eastward, we headed directly for the high Sierra Nevada range of mountains on a well-graded roadway in the early morning of a beautiful October day, when the air was balmy, and the fall foliage was at its best. The autumn flowers nodded in obedience to gentle zephyrs, meanwhile emitting their lingering aromas to cheer us on our 110-mile jaunt to the section of biggest trees in the Vvorld, a whole forest of sequoias covering thousands of mountain acres.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Presidents and princes have gone over the road ahead. Artists and writers have thrilled over the rich anticipation of witnessing the scenes on this trip of wonders. The ozone-laden air is exhilarating as one listens to the low hum of his motor and skims over the level plain of farmland and orchardry tovzards the Sierra foothills overtopped by the higher range of mountains just beyond.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The blue haze of recent forest fires and of distance makes them appear to be much farther away than they really are. The car has been going thirty miles an hour for the past hour, and still those mountains seem just as far away. Distances in California are often very deceptive. Sometimes an object seems three or four times as near as it is by actual measurement. And then again it may appear to be twice as far away, all depending upon the existing atmospheric conditions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The trip takes one through orchards and grain-culture fields, past cozy little country homes, mostly of bungalow architecture, in groves of evergreen trees, some of them live oak and eucalyptus or pepper tree variety. There are no big barns on the farms as on the farms of most eastern states. During winter months the cattle run at large. In summer many people sleep out of doors. The summer days may be hot, but the nights are always delightfully cool. It is now October, and as yet no frost, and none expected in this locality for perhaps another month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">No state can boast of better auto roads than has California. The speed limit is thirty-five miles an hour, but so long as you do not crash into any one you can run up to fifty. Perhaps </span><span class="font6">a </span><span class="font5">few years hence speed cops will arrest the “slowpoke”. On the state highway one should keep pace with the general traffic or get off the roadway. There is no dimming of lights in night travel here. One would be snapping them on and off constantly, the traffic is so dense.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There is hardly a chance to swerve out of line to pass a slow driver and get back into line again in front of an onrushing car. Hence the necessity of keeping the line at regulation speed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The fast driver is usually safe on the highway. The slow driver is in everybody’s way but his own. This is the Californian’s view of the matter. “Hey there! Step on it or get off the road!” “What’s the matter with you? Are you asleep?” etc., etc., rings on the air if you poke along on the state road.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In California there are six groves of big trees besides the Redwoods: Calaveras, Yosemite, Wawona, General Grant, Sequoia and Santa Cruz. During 1926, to a given date 26,503 autos entered Sequoia Park, carrying 89,404 visitors, as against 12,869 cars to the same date in 1925, carrying 50,597 visitors. The auto charge is now $1.00. Last year the charge was $2.50. Total revenue, $12,650, as against $10,965.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The first five big-tree groves mentioned are all in the Sierra Nevada mountains; the sixth mentioned is on the Pacific coast line. The car entrance fee to General Grant Park is fifty cents. This park is one-tenth the size of Sequoia Park, and the trees are not so large, but it is a nicer place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the foothills near the park entrance is the little town of Three Rivers. Along the road we saw a flock of wild passenger pigeons (a species now nearly extinct), in a tree top close by. Fifty years ago these birds could be seen in flocks of thousands, if not millions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The cement roadway follows the middle branch of the Kaweah river in a winding course a mile or two beyond Three Rivers where the hard surface road ends and a good gravel road begins, and one quite level several miles. There the road becomes serpentine, still following the little stream called a river. Wild deer crossed the roadway about seventy-five feet ahead of us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Higher and higher we climbed, skirting the</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">steep mountainsides, until looking down into the narrow valley from the dizzy height caused us to involuntarily shrink away from the outer edge of the road. We crossed and recrossed the line view below us repeatedly. The scene is one of America’s best. Moro Dome towered above us several thousand feet. Mt. Whitney, the highest peak in the West, stood majestically grand just to the eastward, an inspiring sight, saw-toothed and apparently impossible of ascent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We had paid our $1.00 entrance fee and were getting our money’s worth, and more. Then very suddenly at a turn in the roadway we were in the grove of Sequoia big trees, the largest in all the world. The elevation is about 7,000 feet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A few miles’ drive brings us to Government Camp, or “headquarters”, as it is called. Here is the post office, and various rustic buildings. But we make a pause here only long enough to be directed to the Sherman tree, the largest in the park. It is two miles farther on. The way is lined with giant Sequoia. We halt and step around one of them, twenty-nine long paces.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There are others still larger, until finally we arrive at the Sherman tree, with a row of logs laid on the ground all the way around it, and there is a sign bidding us keep outside. Well, we don’t see that sign or can’t read it until Ave have paced close around its base, thirty-nine long steps, approximately as many feet in diameter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Were a tunnel cut through that tree two street cars could easily stand in it side by side and enough wood be left on each side to sustain the tree. We could not see its top. That tree would supply lumber enough to build a town; it is the oldest a,nd largest living thing on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">Am</span><span class="font5">ong the larger trees might be mentioned Washington, President McKinley, Pershing and Lincoln. The Fallen Monarch may have existed when Moses led the children of Israel out of Egypt into Canaan. All of them were in existence in the time of Christ. Mention might be made of the Hollow tree, the Window tree, the Keyhole tree, the Nursery tree, the Stricken tree, the Overgrown Stump, the Cloister, the Congress group, the Black Causeway, the Pillar of Hercules, the Chimney tree, and many others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A big buck deer came and took food out of our hands. The bears would not come near, but gave us a look from afar.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Sequoia Park season is from May 25 to September 15, and at any time for motorists carrying their own camp equipment. A one-day stay should include the Sherman tree, Moro Rock, Profile View, Parker Group and Crescent Meadows. A two-day stay should include additionally the McKinley tree, Congress Group, Circle Meadows to the Washington Tree. A three-day stay should take in also Lodge Pole Camp, Topopa Valley, Sugar Pine trail to Ka-Aveah Vista and Tharp Cabin. And in a four-day stay one can visit all the other attractions, including Twin Lakes, Admiration Point, Marble Falls, Mt. Silliman, Emerald Lakes, Meadows, Peaks, etc., too numerous to mention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The exact dimensions of the Sherman tree, in feet, are as follows: Height, 280; base circumference, 103; base diameter, 35; circumference 6 feet above ground, 86; diameter 100 feet above ground, 18. In all the world there is no larger tree than the Sherman in Sequoia Park.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We made the trip from Fresno, 110 miles, easily in less than four hours, and returned in less than three hours. So it was not at all a hard trip. There were five of us in the party.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In Sequoia Park there are scores of big trees almost as large as the General Sherman, and hundreds over ten feet in diameter. The summer population is about 1,500. There are about 400 camp sites for park visitors. All signs in the park are official. No advertising signs are allowed. No smoking is allowed during the fire season on roads or trails in the park, but is permitted at stations or in camps.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Sequoia Park in scenic value does not compare with Yosemite Valley, but in forestry greatly surpasses it. The big trees of Sequoia must ever remain the supreme attraction of this extensive park of 161,597 acres. These trees are not to be confused ■with the Redwood trees found only in the Coast Range. The Sequoia are about four times as large. The wood is similar in color and texture, but the foliage is distinct. The bark of the big tree is much thicker, of a rich red color, instead of a dull brown. The big tree is produced only from the seed. The Redwood when cut down sprouts from the stump.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Abe Lincoln tree is 270 feet high and 31 feet in base diameter. The William McKinley tree is 290 feet high and 28 feet in diameter. The Warren Harding tree is 280 feet high and 27 feet in diameter. There are many large trees not yet given a name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The trip to Sequoia National Park is through sections of the finest orange groves and vineyards of California. The oranges were still green on the trees, but boxes were being hauled and distributed in the orchards pursuant to orange-picking within the next ten days for eastern shipment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Grapes were for the most part already gathered, as were also the figs and other small fruits, olives, nuts, etc. There were large fields of mown alfalfa here and there along the way. Palm trees lined the roadway in places on both sides. The district is generally under irrigation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The trip was a most enjoyable one. The day was perfect and balmy from first to last, and we had no mishap, although one careless driver nearly ran us into the roadside ditch. We should have gotten his number and had him arrested and fined.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark79"></a>The Horrors of Mustard Gas </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">By N. Berry</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">F</span><span class="font5">ROM time to time one meets those people who declare that we are evolving nearer and nearer to the summit of perfection, that all our present systems of government, etc., are growing more humanitarian and standing more for the interests of peace and the enlightenment of the people, until eventually we shall dwell in a peaceful world, the dream of poets and philosophers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">But while this is the thought of some, what are the facts? In 1926 it was thought necessary by the command of the Army Council to publish a manual on the medical aspects of modern warfare. This cam be obtained by the public at a small cost. It shows clearly the horrors of warfare in these days, and the dreadful effects of various poisonous gases on the organisms of those who become victims of these gases.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Some have suggested that the publishing of this book widely would end all war, while others declare that it would create panic and trouble would result that way, because the picture of horror is so clearly brought before the mind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Space is given to mustard gas: what it is and how it affects those who come in contact with it; and how to relieve those suffering as a result of it. It says: “In the crude state mustard gas is an oily liquid resembling brown sherry. The liquid is almost insoluble in water, is slightly soluble in paraffin or vaseline, but freely soluble in animal and vegetable fats and oils, also in alcohol, ether, chloroform and in benzine and petrol. It vaporizes very slowly at ordinary temperatures, so that ground splashed by the liquid at the burst of a shell is a source of danger for a time, depending on conditions of weather and terrain, and men may unwittingly carry the liquid on their boots and clothing with them into dugouts and other shelters where it vaporizes in the warmer atmosphere. It is slowly hydrolyzed in water, but is rapidly destroyed by dry bleaching powder. It has a characteristic mustard-like odor, which, however, is neither quickly detected nor offensive. In an area heavily shelled with gas, the odor may be readily perceptible on first entering the area, but the sense of smell rapidly becomes dulled and within ten minutes it will cease to be appreciated. This is of serious importance, as troops are only too likely to underestimate the danger in the absence of the warning afforded by strong odor or any immediate irritant effect on the sensory nerves.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The manual goes on to say: “On exposure to a vapor on a finely atomized spray of the substance, nothing is noticed at first save the faint though characteristic smell. After about two hours symptoms begin to appear and subsequently develop with some rapidity. The eyes begin to smart and water. The nose also runs as from a severe cold in the head, and sneezing is frequent. Nausea, retching and vomiting associated with epigastric pain commence at the same time as the pain in the eyes and they recur at frequent intervals for several hours.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Then, still continuing, the manual says, “Inflammation of the skin now shows itself in a dusky red erythema of the face and neck, which look as though they had been scorched, other parts of the body are similarly affected, and should any part of the clothing have been actually splashed by the liquid, the underlying skin would be profoundly irritated. In this stage the patient suffers from the most intense itching, especially if he gets hot, which interferes with rest and sleep and is most wearing. Later, small vesicles appear, which quickly coalesce into large blisters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“At the end of twenty-four hours the typical appearance is presented. The main distress is caused by the pain in the eyes, which may be very great. The patient lies virtually blinded, with tears oozing between bulging eyelids over his reddened and slightly blistered face, while there is a constant nasal discharge and a harsh cough.” Added to these things “there may also be a frontal headache”, says the manual, as though the poor unfortunates who should be gassed have not sufficient to bear with all the foregoing agonies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">To give further comfort (?) it says, “death rarely takes place during the first twenty-four hours; it sometimes occurs on the third or fourth day, but it has been known for cases to linger on until the third or fourth week before getting relief in death. With well-protected troops the death rate is low, but with badly protected troops it may be very high.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Let those who dream that we are evolving to a more humane state read “The Medical Aspect of Modern Warfare”, and they will clearly see, if they are honest with themselves, that the world is heading fast to destruction, and the ways used to destroy human life in this, our day, must have been inspired by none other than the Devil himself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Word of God declares that life is a sacred thing, and in this day He has set His anointed King on His throne to deliver mankind from the great destroyer of life. Soon His kingdom will be fully established, and then will the pro</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">mi</span><span class="font5">se be fulfilled, “I will make a man more precious than fine gold; even a man than the golden wedge of Ophir” (Isa. 13:12), and nothing will then be allowed to hurt or destroy throughout the whole earth.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">L</span><span class="font5">AST year I told </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font5"> readers how I cooked rolled oats in aluminum, fed it to young goats and made them sick (with bowel trouble). This year we had a larger supply of </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">mil</span><span class="font5">k, so did not need to substitute oats. I wanted to experiment more with the feeding; so I fed one pair of twins the milk warmed in aluminum, and the other pair the same kind of milk wanned in a graniteware pan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">All were healthy, strong youngsters. The smaller of the aluminum pair was very greedy, got a little more than her share; grew faster; at four weeks refused milk at all; lingered for a couple of weeks more by taking a few nibbles of hay, and then died. Her mate quit the m</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">ilk </span><span class="font5">a week later, and died a week later. The two fed from granite have not missed a meal, and are growing fine. This test some may think a little severe on the kids; but it may be the means of saving kiddies more precious.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Buttermilk as a Food </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">By W. H. Barton, County Agent</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">T</span><span class="font5">HERE is 13 percent of food elements in 4-percent milk. Of this amount, 4 percent is fat and 9 percent protein, carbohydrates and valuable mineral elements. Thus it is seen that approximately three times the food value of cow’s milk lies in “buttermilk” after the fat has been removed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Listen to what Authority says, about “buttermilk”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Buttermilk is a real food as well as a refreshing drink; for it contains a very fine quality of protein, valuable mineral salts, sugar, and a lactic ferment which gives its satisfying sharp taste.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The people of Biblical times associated buttermilk with long life. Nations of today whose people drink buttermilk are strong physically and long-lived.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Doctors recommend buttermilk as a healthful drink, because it stimulates digestion, acts as a tonic to the body, and helps to correct constipation and other disorders of the digestive tract.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The U. S. Government says, “Buttermilk is an excellent food, good alike for young and old. For health and pleasure, few drinks excel pure, fresh, cold buttermilk. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Buttermilk and a sandwich or salad make a nutritious, healthful luncheon, popular with business men. In </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">your</span><span class="font3"> interest, drink more buttermilk.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">SUBSCRIBER writes us as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“As a reader of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font5"> for two or three years, and having enjoyed and agreed with many real Bible truths in your paper, simple and clear as crystal, I am sometimes pained to note some comments and contents in your otherwise good magazine. At present I am much put out at the article in which the good people of Atlanta, Georgia, are reflected upon because they have an ordinance which prohibits the use of golf courses and ball grounds on the Sabbath day. You say that the ordinance was passed by people who did little of any useful work on six days of the week; also that the city ordinance was founded on a law that was given to the Jews, and never to the Gentiles, from which I take it that you mean the whole ten commandments. Why, what in the name of all good and holy Scripture would we do without the ten commandments ? - And upon what are all the civil laws based, if not upon the ten commandments? So, is it not just as wrong today to break any or all of these ten commandments as it was 1,929 or 4,000 years ago? All murder, theft, idolatry and every one of the rest are punishable by our civil law as well as by God’s laws. It is careless, abominable, reckless and devilish to wilfully break the Sabbath day. As to the laboring people, I am one myself, and I believe they should have one day in the week for recreation. Saturday would be proper, I believe. Please answer in your columns and print as much of this letter as you see fit.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">From the time of the fall of our first parents in the Garden of Eden God purposed to lift them up and restore them during the seventh thousand-year day of earth’s history. Never for a moment has He lost sight of this, and He designs that man shall never' forget the great act of loving-kindness on His part which makes their restoration to their lost estate a reality. It is for this.reason that, from the very first, God sanctified the Sabbath day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">But the supposition that He is particularly concerned about the typical commemoration of a thing when the reality is at hand will not bear consideration. God’s offering of His only Son on Calvary was a part, and a very essential part, of the reality. Without the Redeemer there would never be a restoration of man. But, now that He has paid the wages for Adam’s disobedience, the restoration is sure, for as many as will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During Jesus’ ministry He performed most of His works of healing on the Sabbath day and gradually prepared His followers and all who should come after Him to see that He was merely showing forth beforehand His coming glory, soon to make the whole earth glad.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At no time during His ministry did Jesus fall in line with the ideas of the religionists of His time regarding the Sabbath. Whenever He referred to the subject it was in such a way as to point their attention to the fact that “the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath”, or that “the sabbath was made for man, and not man for the sabbath”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We do not question at all that one day of rest in seven is good for man. Just now the labor papers are insisting that he must have two, because the machines which he has invented do so much of his work that he can not keep busy six days out of seven. But the Sabbath was not made for man merely to give him rest one day in seven. It was given him so that in the Millennium, the seventh thousand-year day of man upon the earth, he might get the real rest of heart which can come only from restoration of fellowship with God, a fellowship possible only through the One that is Lord also of the Sabbath.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As to a superficial regard for one day in seven, we have some millions of Jews and Seventh-day Adventists in the United States, who are more or less punctilious (mostly less) as to what they do between sundown Friday night and sundown Saturday night, and then we have many more millions who are not at all particular what they do between midnight Saturday night and midnight Sunday night, but who nevertheless pass under the general sobriquet of “Christians”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There are some 22,000,000 automobiles in the United States, and, though we have not counted them, it seems that about 21,999,999 are going somewhere every Sunday. We do not know if there are that many Sunday newspapers (the “American’s Bible”, and the only one with which he is at all familiar), but almost every family has one of them, printed on the Sabbath of the Jews and sold on the Sabbath of the Gentiles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We have examined the time-tables of the railroads, and we notice that all the principal trains go chugging along day and night in every direction. Neither Saturday nor Sunday looks like anything to the director of a railroad; and Uncle Sam, custodian of what morals some people have, seems fairly well content to have it so and uses all these trains to carry his mails, and some years ago was proud of it and in the Post Office Department at Washington had a tablet or memorial setting forth the fact that it was a relatively pious thing in his judgment to keep the mails moving on the Sabbath day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We know of some gentlemen who make a living by rattling collection baskets, and without exception they do all their work on Sunday, though they do not wish any competition and are very desirous that something should be done so that everybody would have to listen to them on Sunday, and do nothing else.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Practically all of these men are unbelievers in the Bible, and nobody takes their agitation for Sunday observance as anything more than a clamor for such part of the family income of the laboring people as cam be gotten away from them by cajolery or superstition. The idea that they wish to magnify God’s name in the earth is proven false by their eagerness to </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">hin</span><span class="font5">der or stop those who are engaged in that very work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As to the suggestion that Uncle Sam is guided by the ten commandments in all his practices, we can judge fairly well of the facts when we consider the record of the Harding administration. If there are any of the ten commandments that the Ohio gang failed to break, they are revisions written into the code since we last saw it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As to murder, who was responsible for the death of 100,000 young men in France, to make Morgan’s investment in French bonds safe? As to adultery, better read “The President’s Daughter”. As to bearing false witness, probably George Creel’s explanation of the government propaganda bureau during the World War would be illuminating. As to stealing, we have the Teapot Dome and ten thousand times ten thousand other steals. Probably the record on covetousness is 100-percent perfect; and when it comes to graven images, none will deny that all America bows down before the dollar mark and has none other gods besides. Do we need earth’s sabbath, the real sabbath? We do.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark23"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark84"></a>Bible Questions and Answers</span></h3>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">0</span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">UESTI0N:</span><span class="font5"> Is it possible for a person to live a Christian life and be pleasing to God, and yet not be a member of any of the presentday churches?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Answer:</span><span class="font5"> Our answer is, most emphatically, Yes. One can be a true Christian without joining any of the various sects or denominations now in existence. Jesus established the one true church on the day of Pentecost. Jesus is the Head of that church, and the names of its members are written in heaven, in the Lamb’s book of life. We are told that only the Lord knows them that are His. Over five hundred years after Jesus founded this true church, the Catholic church came into existence. About a thousand years later the Lutheran church was organized; and just a few years later, the Church of England. Then followed the Presbyterian, Baptist, Methodist and others, until it is claimed that there are 160 different denominations or sects of Christian people, none of which is the true church. The word “church”, as used today, refers either to a building or to a sect of people who adhere to a specified creed. In the Bible the word “church” refers to the little classes of Bible students who met in private homes for Bible study. In Romans 16:3-5, Paul wrote to the church at Rome and used these words: “Greet Priscilla and Aquila, my helpers in Christ Jesus; . . . likewise greet the church that is in their house.” There is no thought of a creed or of sectarianism or of a powerful religious system in these words of the apostle. The Greek word for church is </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">ecclesia,</span><span class="font5"> and means “called out ones”, and refers only to those who have been called out of the world, those who have heard the call and have separated themselves from the world, from its politics, its shams and hypocrisies. If one has to join one of these denominations to be a Christian, then Jesus and the apostles were not Christian in any sense; for they were not members of any of them, for the reason that none of these denominations were in existence in their day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Question:</span><span class="font5"> Why is it that the Bible Students never offer prayer over the radio, either at the beginning or at the conclusion of a lecture”?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Ansiver:</span><span class="font5"> For the reason that Jesus never used prayer when addressing the public, the multitudes of unregenerate ones. The privilege of prayer is only for those who have renounced this present evil world and entered into a covenant to do the will of the Lord. Only such can address God as their Father, and only such does He recognize as sons. In Romans 8: 9 we read: “If any man have not the spirit of Christ, he is none of his.” It is written, again, that he can not serve God and mammon, that there are only two masters. It is entirely unreasonable, as well as unscriptural, to think that the children of disobedience, who are serving Satan, can come to God in prayer and ask Him for favors and receive His blessings. The psalmist (Ps. 50:16,17) states the matter in positive language, saying: “Unto the wicked God saith, What hast thou to do, to declare my statutes, or that thou shouldest take my covenant in thy mouth? seeing thou hatest instruction, and easiest my words behind thee.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Prayer is the privilege extended to God’s saints, God’s sons, those who have entered into </span><span class="font6">a </span><span class="font5">covenant with Him; and it would be just as inappropriate to offer a prayer in the presence of the unconsecrated as it would be to offer a prayer to the true God in the presence of heathen people who refuse to acknowledge any God but Baal. Jesus never prayed in public. Another reason why Bible Students do not pray in public is that Jesus roundly denounced such prayers and in most emphatic words tells us how to pray. (Matt. 6: 5, 6) Jesus said: “When thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. . . . But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.” In not offering prayer to God in the presence of the unconsecrated, Bible Students are following Jesus’ words and example.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark85"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark86"></a>Making Converts in Syria </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">By Avery Bristoiv</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">A</span><span class="font5"> FEW days ago I went into a little cafe in</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Long Beach, Miss., to endeavor to place the good news of the Kingdom in the hands of the proprietor. Ilaving learned who he was I ■went to him and introduced myself and began to state my mission, but I had said scarcely a dozen words before he interrupted me and told me he had nothing for me and did not want to hear any more. I took him to be one of the pious hypocrites one meets so often (the more pious they look, the more they seem to hate the Lord’s message) and kept right on talking. His attitude soon changed, and he invited me to sit down and have a cup of coffee as he wished to apologize and explain why he had been so rude. This is what he told me:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“When you first began to talk to me I thought you were going to ask me for money to send to some foreign missionary, and that is why I began to get mad.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“I was born and raised in Beirut, Syria. That is one of the towns where the Americans send missionaries, and as a boy I used to see them fat and lazy, lolling on a shady porch of a nice residence, enjoying the money that was sent them from America. The people of Beirut did not need them and did not want them. We had our own churches and knew that we loved the Lord more and were much better Christians than the missionaries, but we had to tolerate them. They didn’t bother us much, and we got along with them by ignoring them as much as possible. This made them have to resort to all sorts of schemes to have something to report on their work in order to keep the money coming from America.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">remember one instance in particular: A neighbor of ours had five small children and, being poor, they were unable to dress them as well as some of the other children in the neighborhood whose parents had more means, but the children’s clothing was always comfortable and neat. One morning the missionary called at this home and asked the mother’s permission to measure the children. This was granted, and in a few days the missionary returned with a nice new suit for each of them, stating that all that he asked in return was that the children be sent to his place to Sunday school the following Sunday. The mother agreed to this, but when the father came home and learned of the arrangement he was displeased, as the children were already attending Sunday school regularly, only at a different church. However, they decided to send them the one Sunday.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Sunday came and the children went to the missionary’s house as agreed. There their names and ages were taken and duly recorded on the church book and the report was sent back to America: ‘Converted five this morning.’ “This is how the reports are made of the work done by your foreign missionaries and is why I felt like throwing you out when I thought you were another one begging money for them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“I</span><span class="font5"> will take the two of your books and read them, and if times were better I would gladly take them all.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Onward, Christian soldiers, marching as to war, With the cross of Jesus going on before.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Christ, the Royal Master, leads against the foe, Forward into battle, see His banners go!</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">.Onward, Christian soldiers, marching as to war, With the cross of Jesus going on before.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Below these words is a picture of Christ beckoning the troops onward. Next below that is the “Cross of Jesus”, the Union Jack of the British Empire, two of them, with the cross feature of the flag emphasized to make sure the point would not be overlooked, and finally, at the bottom of the card, the ranks of the “Christian soldiers” themselves, many of them, no doubt, fresh from the brothel, some of them probably half-drunk, others chewing tobacco and cursing, but all of them fully armed and en route to the killing of their fellow men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The second one is entitled “The White Comrade” and is intended to show that Christ Jesus, the same One that said, “Put up thy sword into its sheath,” was the silent partner of every British soldier during the World War. On this card a soldier is helping a wounded comrade to the rear while Jesus, still crowned with thorns, and dressed in white shadowy garments, is guiding the two to the rear and saying, “Lo, I am with you alway.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The third one is entitled “Stand up for Jesus (3)”, and has at the top of the card the familiar words,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Stand up!—stand up for Jesus!</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Stand in His strength alone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The arm of flesh will fail you, Ye dare not trust your own.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Put on the gospel armor,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Each piece put on with prayers When duty calls, or danger, .</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Be never wanting there!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Below these words appear the serried ranks of the soldiers, not marching this time, but “standing up for Jesus”, standing at attention, and fully clad with their “gospel armor”, the knapsacks and other military accoutrements being conspicuously in evidence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The fourth one has the following words at the bottom of the card:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Stand up!—stand up for Jesus’</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The strife will not be long: This day the noise of battle, The next the victor’s song.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">To him that overcometh,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A crown of life shall be: He with the King of Glory Shall reign eternally.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Above these words a wounded soldier lies in a hospital tent, with a nurse sitting at his bedside, reading to him. The flap of the tent is open, and outside can be seen “the noise of battle”; while overhead appear the shadowy forms of the King of Glory and accompanying angels, ready to receive the victor into jointheirship and to give him the crown of life on the morrow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Could presumption go further?</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark25"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark89"></a>The Form of Government</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2">[Broadcast from Station WBBR, New Xork, by Judge Rutherford.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">I</span><span class="font5">T IS my pleasure this morning to greet every one who has a desire to see a government of equity established on earth for the benefit of man. For some weeks consideration has been given to God’s preparation for such government which He long ago promised man he should enjoy in due time. Now we come to the consideration of the form of that government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah has been compassionate, mercifully gracious, and long-suffering with man. Such is characteristic of Him. He has permitted man to have a long period of time in which to put forth his best endeavors to build for himself a desirable government. In that period of many centuries not only has man tried one form of government, but he has tried many forms. The history of each form of government has been recorded. No people can read that history with real satisfaction. Disappointment has marked every period of man’s experience with these various forms of government. It is God’s purpose that through such experiences man might learn valuable lessons. The time has now come for thoughtful persons to calmly consider the history of the nations during the past twenty-five centuries in particular and learn therefrom lessons of great benefit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Amidst , all the dreadful experiences of time the reverential mind can discern the gracious hand of God holding before man the truth, that he might have opportunity to learn and profit therefrom. For centuries there has been placed before the peoples of so-called “Christendom” the great truth: “Blessed is the nation whose God is Jehovah.” (Ps. 33:12, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">A. R. V.)</span><span class="font5"> Even when all these nations have disregarded that great truth, God has continued to manifest His loving-kindness and long-suffering toward them, abiding His own good time when He will lift the people out of the mire. When the course of the people has been such as to warrant their destruction the great Jehovah God has shown compassion and mercy toward them. Now it is manifest that His due time has come when His purposes, shall be more plainly put before the people, that they may understand how a righteous government is to be erected on the earth for them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There are three primary classes into which may be divided all the governments which man has attempted to establish. Where the supreme political control is in the hand of a single individual, that form of government is called a monarchy. Where the supreme political power is vested in a few, that government is called an aristocracy. Where the supreme power of control is in the hands of a populace, that government is called a democracy. When a monarchy is corrupt, it is called a tyranny. When aristocracy is corrupt, that government is called an oligarchy. Where a democracy is corrupt, the government is designated as a mobocracy. Monarchies are either absolute or limited. The power of an absolute monarchy is vested in and exercised by one supreme ruler. </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">A</span><span class="font5"> limited monarchy usually has a fundamental law or constitution which limits the power and authority of the chief ruler and grants a portion thereof to the citizens. A monarchy is either one of heredity or an elective government. A democracy is either direct or indirect. Where the people elect their representatives who form the governing power, such government is designated an indirect democracy or a republic. A direct democracy is a government in which all the people have some voice in the enactment and enforcement of the law’s. Man has tried all these forms.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Looking over the history of the nations whose governments have been that of monarchy, aristocracy or democracy, not one has been found to be entirely satisfactory to the people. The history of every nation shows that it has been a struggle betw’een the classes. It has been a few<sup>7</sup> against the many. It has been a contest between the exploiting and the exploited. As a general rule, the class smaller in number has ruled and oppressed the class greater in number. These struggles have resulted in ma</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">n</span><span class="font5">y revolutions, great suffering, and much bloodshed. Out of these struggles have developed the various theories or forms of government called radical, including communism, socialism, the soviet and bolshevism. The birth of these has been due to the struggles of the oppressed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Communism advocates a sharing of all things in common, aiming at the abolition of private ovmership of property and at holding of all property for the benefit of the community.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Socialism holds that the means of production and distribution of the wealth of the nations are the collective properties of the workers, who by</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark90"></a><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark91"></a>The QOLDEN AGE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">their efforts produce that property, while the goods which are to he consumed become the private property of the individual workers. Such government would do away with the aristocratic class.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Out of the World War was born the soviet government of Russia. Peoples of that nation had long suffered under a monarchy that boi’-dered closely on a tyranny. The war furnished the opportunity to overthrow the monarchy. “Soviet” really means council or harmony. The soviet government, however, has been anything but harmonious. The government is made up of councils of working men and soldiers called deputies. There are various councils and one supreme council. The soviet rule is called an organized form of dictatorship of the proletariat, but this government denies the right of suffrage to certain classes. The soviet government has not been a success, and never can be, and is far from being satisfactory to the people who have tried it. lake all other forms of government where the people are supposed to have a voice, the demagogues and party men dominate the various councils and therefore the government has presented no advantages over any other government. In fact, bolshevism has resulted in great suffering of the people, and it is feared by many of the other nations and governments of the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Every form of government man has tried, whether that be monarchy, aristocracy, democracy, republic or socialism, has been unsatisfactory. In all these forms of government there have been many men who have endeavored to establish a just and equitable rule, but have failed. Suppose the World War had made it possible to establish democracy in all the nations. Would that democracy have succeeded and been satisfactory to the people? It would have been impossible for it to succeed and be entirely satisfactory. The demagogue and the professional politicians would have done as they have always done: put party interests and private interests above the common welfare. No stronger proof is needed to support that conclusion than the present-day conditions prevailing in the government of the United States of America. That government is more nearly an ideal democracy than any other nation that has ever existed on earth; and yet it is plainly stated by many who are high in authority, and</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">it is well known by the people in general, that selfish men dominate and control. The general welfare of all the people is secondary, while selfish and favored interests are given chief advantage. The United States of America has been the most favored, and has existed under the most favorable conditions, of any nation under the sun. Within the period of its existence there have been many really noble men who have given their best efforts to establish a desirable government. After more than one hundred and fifty years’ experience that government is found to be entirely unsatisfactory to the rank and file of the people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Let it be conceded that honest men in every nation have done their best to erect a satisfactory government. It must also be admitted that they have failed. If, after twenty-five centuries of honest endeavor’ and strenuous effort on the part of the Gentile nations to establish a desirable government, dissatisfaction and failure are the result, is it not time for sober-minded persons to calmly and dispassionately seek to know the real reason why? Why are there discontent, distress and perplexity in every nation? Why has no people been able to establish an ideal and satisfactory government?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There are two reasons: (1) The invisible ruler of all the nations of the world is evil, and his influence over the visible rulers has been and is evil. (2) Man himself is imperfect and therefore susceptible to evil influences. Imperfect men under such conditions could not possibly establish a righteous government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It follows, therefore, that before a righteous and ideal government can exist the supreme and unlimited power must be vested in and exercised by one who is just, wise, and wholly unselfish, and that that power must be exercised for the general welfare of all and for the special interests of no class. This principle can not be successfully gainsaid by any honest man. Such a government is what the people have desired for centuries. Such a righteous government is exactly the Mnd of government that God long ago promised to establish for man and which He is now beginning to establish foi’ the benefit of man. He will remove all power from the invisible evil ruler so that evil can not any more influence man while he is striving to reach an ideal condition. Both the invisible and the visible influence of God’s government upon man will be for good.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark92"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark93"></a>Theocracy</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5">What form of government will then control the peoples of earth? That government will be a pure theocracy. For centuries the whole creation has groaned and suffered in pain, waiting for the manifestation of that government. (Bom. 8:19) Now the time has come for its establishment, and both the rulers and the ruled of the earth should learn the truth and rejoice. What is said here against the various forms of government is not said with a view to provoking revolution, of course, but is said that thoughtful men and women might consider the only way that leads to a condition of righteousness, peace and happiness. Such a desirable condition of righteousness, peace and happiness could never have been enjoyed under a monarchy, aristocracy, democracy, communism, socialism, or sovietism, or any like form of government. The desire of the people can come only in God’s provided way. “For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given, and the government shall be upon his shoulder; and his name shall be called Wonderful Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace. Of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end, upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom, to order it, and to establish it with judgment and with justice, from henceforth even for ever.”—Isa. 9: 6, 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A theocracy is a, government of which the chief ruler is Jehovah God. He is the Maker and Executor of its laws through His duly constituted agencies. While it is true that supreme power has always resided in Jehovah, with the overthrow of Israel’s last king He has permitted man to take his own course and has not interfered until His time has come to set upon His throne Him “whose right it is”. He it is whom God has appointed and anointed to rule under and in harmony with Jehovah. The prophecies uttered by the holy men whom God appointed to speak must come to pass some time; and now the time has come when the followingprophecies are being fulfilled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah King</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It was in 1914 that God began to exercise His authority over the affairs of the world through His beloved Son whom He then placed upon His holy throne. There began the fulfilment of the prophecy: “Say among the nations, Jehovah hath become King. Surely he hath fixed the world. It shall not be shaken, he will judge the peoples with equityPs. 96:10, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Rotherham.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“God hath become king over the nations, God hath taken his seat upon his holy throne.”—Ps. 47:8, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Rotherham.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Jehovah hath become king. Let the earth exult, let the multitude of coastlands rejoice. Clouds and thick darkness are round about h</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">im</span><span class="font5">, righteousness and justice are the establishing of his throne. Fire before him proceedeth, that it may consume round about his adversaries. His lightnings have illumined the world, the earth hath seen and hath trembled.”—Ps. 97 :l-4, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Rotherham.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Zion is the name given to God’s organization. Jerusalem is also a name applied thereto, and the two names are often used to mean the same thing. The people of Israel organized by Jehovah constituted typical Zion. That government, as long as the people remained in harmony with God, was a theocracy. It failed, not because of the Lord Jehovah, but because of the imperfection of man and because of the evil influence exercised over man by Satan, which influence -will not be permitted when God’s righteous government is in full swrny. God withdrew His favor from typical Zion in 606 B.C. His prophets foretold a time when He would set up real Zion, and thereby they represented the Lord as returning to Zion. This undoubtedly takes place at the time God places His Anointed Son upon His throne. (Ps. 2:6) “Thus saith the Lord of hosts, I was jealous for Zion -with great jealousy, and I was jealous for her with great fury. Thus saith the Lord, I am </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">returned</span><span class="font5"> unto Zion, and will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem; and Jerusalem shall be called, A city of truth; and the mountain of the Lord of hosts, The holy mountain.” (Zech. 8:2,3) “The Lord shall reign for ever, even thy God, 0 Zion, unto all generations. Praise ye the Lord.”—Ps. 146:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The great theocracy, when seen and appreciated by the people, will be the joy of the whole earth. It will be Zion, God’s organization, exercising power and authority over man for his good. “Great is the Lord, and greatly to be praised in the city of our God, in the mountain of his holiness. Beautiful for situation, the joy of the whole earth, is mount Zion, on the sides of the north, the city of the great King.” (Ps. 48:1, 2) “For the Lord is a great God [in Zion], and a great King above all gods. In his hand are the deep places of the earth: the strength of the hills is his also.”—Ps. 95: 3,4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In Jehovah is vested all original power, to which there is no limitation. His name Almighty God means that there is no power above Him. (Gen. 17:1) In His hand the nations of the earth are no more than the small dust of the balance or the drop of a bucket. (Isa. 40:15-22) He has complete and absolute power over all things. (Rom. 9: 21) He may delegate that power to whomsoever He will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah God is all wise. He knew the end from the beginning. (Acts 15:18) His counsel stands for ever. (Ps. 33:11) “The Lord by wisdom hath founded the earth; by understanding hath he established the heavens. By his knowledge the depths are broken up, and the clouds drop down the dew.”—Prov. 3:19, 20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah is just. “Justice and judgment are the habitation of thy throne; mercy and truth shall go before thy face.”—Ps. 89:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">He is no respecter of persons or classes. (1 Pet. 1:17; Jas. 3:17) He is unchangeable. (Mal. 3:6) “Righteous art thou, O Lord, and upright are thy judgments.” (Ps. 119:137) “Thy righteousness is like the great mountains; thy judgments are a great deep; 0 Lord, thou preserves! man and beast.”—Ps. 36: 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah God is love. (1 John 4:16) That means that He is entirely unselfish and that His pow’er is administered not for selfish benefit but for the benefit of all His creatures who obey Him. “How excellent is thy lovingkindness, 0 God! therefore the children of men put their trust under the shadow of thy wings.”—Ps. 36:7; 63:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jesus taught His followers to always pray to God: “Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done on earth, as it is in heaven.” Because Jehovah God is the great King above all, the government is therefore spoken of in the Scriptures as God’s kingdom, which it is.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">His Anointed</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah God has anointed His beloved Son and delegated to Him the power to be ruler over all the world. God anointed Lucifer for a certain work, and Lucifer abused the power that was delegated to him. God gave His Son Jesus a higher anointing and He has been faithful thereto.—Ezek. 28:14; Num. 24: 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the year 1914 A.D. the end of the period of waiting came, and at that time the great prophecy came true that God caused to be written: “Yet have I set my king [anointed One] upon my holy hill of Zion.” (Ps. 2: 6) The kingdom is therefore God’s kingdom and Christ’s kingdom because Christ acts by reason of the power and authority delegated to Him by Jehovah His Father. (John 5: 22-26; Matt. 28:18) It was in that year, 1914, that the following prophecy began to be fulfilled. “And the seventh angel sounded; and there followed great voices in heaven, and they said, The kingdom of the world is become the kingdom of our Lord, and of his Christ: and he shall reign for ever and ever. And the four and twenty elders, who sit before God on their thrones, fell upon their faces and worshipped God, saying, We give thee thanks, 0 Lord God, the Almighty, -who art and who wast; because thou hast taken thy great power, and didst reign.”—Rev. 11:15-17, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">R.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Lucifer, who has long been the invisible ruler of the peoples of earth, loved wickedness. Jesus the beloved Son of God has always loved righteousness and hated iniquity. “Thou art fairer than the children of men: grace is poured into thy lips; therefore God hath blessed thee for ever. Thou lovest righteousness, and hatest wickedness; therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.”—Ps. 45: 2, 7; Heb. 1: 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is by divine wisdom that Christ Jesus becomes the ruler. (Prov. 8:1,15) By the authority conferred by Jehovah upon Jesus Christ the responsibility of the righteous government rests upon His shoulder. (Isa. 9: 6) Christ Jesus is that One “whose right it is”, to whom God has promised and has given the kingdom. (Ezek. 21:27) Having placed Him upon the throne and given Him the right to rule, Jehovah says to Christ: “Thy throne, 0 God, is for ever and ever: the sceptre of thy kingdom is a right sceptre.”—Ps. 45: 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">He is the One whom Jehovah has sent forth to rule in the midst of His enemies. (Ps. 110: 2) It is the mighty Son of God, or Priest “after the order of Melchizedek”, whom God will use to make all things new. (Rev. 21:5) Concerning Him Jehovah God says: “His enemies will I clothe with shame: but upon himself shall his crown flourish.” (Ps. 132:18) He is “the firstborn of every creature”. (Col. 1:15) “I also will make him my firstborn, the highest of the kings of the earth. My lovingkindness will I keep for him for evermore; and my covenant shall stand fast with him. His seed shall endure for ever, and his throne as the sun before me. It shall be established for ever as the moon.”—Ps. 89: 27, 28, 36, 37, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">R.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the Scriptures “the stone” is used to symbolize God’s Anointed King. All governmentbuilders, including the clergy both of the Jews and of so-called “Christendom”, have rejected Him. “The stone which the builders refused is become the head stone of the corner. This is 'the Lord’s doing; it is marvellous in our eyes.” (Ps. 118: 22, 23) This mighty Stone has become the great King, and His kingdom is one that can never be wrongfully influenced or moved out of the way.—IIeb. 12: 28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">God used Moses as a type to foreshadow Jesus Christ. Moses might have become the king of Egypt; but he refused, preferring to serve Jehovah. (Heb. 11: 25) Likewise Jesus refused Satan’s offer to Him of the rulership of the world. (Matt. 4:8-10) Moses did not seek to exalt himself as king over Israel. He knew that the scepter could never “depart from Judah”. Likewise Jesus did not seek earthly kingship over Israel, but withdrew when the people would by force make Him king. (John 6:15) Him who was abased Jehovah God has exalted above all others, and in due time all others shall bow before Him to the glory of Jehovah God.—Phil. 2:5-11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jesus Christ, earth’s new and rightful Governor, is the “express image” of Jehovah God and acts in exact harmony with Jehovah. In Him is therefore found the complete expression of justice, wisdom, power and love; and such is a guarantee that as ruler over all the peoples all His power and authority shall be exercised unselfishly for the benefit of the people. (Heb. 1:3) Jehovah God has made Him, Christ Jesus, “a leader and commander of the people.” (Isa. 55:4) His leadership and rule over the people will be in exact accord with Jehovah’s will. “The [anointed] king’s heart is in the hand of the Lord [Jehovah], as the rivers of water; he [Jehovah] turneth it [the King’s heart] whithersoever he will.” (Prov. 21:1) His thoughts are so lofty, good and righteous, and so far above those of man, that they are unsearchable. (Prov. 25:2,3) “An oracle [God’s Word] is on the lips of a king [Christ]: . . . his mouth must not be unfaithful.” (Prov. 16:10, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Rotherham)</span><span class="font5"> “Behold, the Lord God will come with strong hand [unlimited power], and his arm [His anointed King] shall rule for him: behold, his reward is with him, and his work before him.” (Isa. 40:10) That Jehovah God has prepared Him and made Him the ruler over all the wmrld is testified to by the prophet: “Who raised up the righteous man from the east, called him to his foot, gave the nations before him, and made him rule over kings? he gave them as the dust to his sword, and as driven stubble to his bow.”—Isa. 41: 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Associates</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the great government of Jehovah God there will be no one clothed with power and authority save those who receive it from Jehovah and who act exactly in accord with His will. Many who have supposed that God has been trying to get them into heaven will be disappointed. God has taken out “a people for his name” and has put these through a course of training and is yet training “the remnant” on earth to fit in some place in His kingdom. Jesus covenanted to take into His kingdom only those who have followed the course similar to that which He led, that is to say, those who have been with Him and like Him in His trials and who have remained absolutely loyal to God through them all. (Luke 22:28-30) To that class He said: “The servant is not greater than his lord. If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you.” (John 15:20) As Jesus came to the world to be a witness and was reproached because of His faithfulness as a witness, even so those who shall be associated with Him in His kingdom must be faithful and true witnesses to all and suffer reproach because of that faithfulness. (John 18:36,37; Isa. 43: 10-12) To such the Lord said: “To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down vntli my Father in his throne.”-Rev. 3: 21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">No Others</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah God through His prophet plainly states that His official government shall have none as a part thereof aside from His anointed, because “the kingdom shall not be left to other people”. (Dan. 2:44) This for ever precludes the profiteers, the politicians, and the clergymen and all other selfish ones from being of that government. “The Most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and givetK it to whomsoever he will.” (Dan. 4:32) It is certain that God would give no one a part therein save those who are completely in harmony with Him and who have successfully stood the test of loyalty to Him. Jehovah God, through His prophet, pictures the falling of the forces of earth, which have been controlled by Satan, and then describes those who shall have a part in the glorious theocratic government for the blessing of humankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“I beheld till the thrones were cast down, and the Ancient of days did sit, whose garment was white as snow, and the hair of his head like the pure wool: his throne was like the fiery flame, and his wheels as burning fire. I saw in the night visions, and, behold, one like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days, and they brought him near before him. And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all people, nations, and languages, should serve him: his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed. But the saints of the Most High shall take the kingdom, and possess the kingdom for ever, even for ever and ever. And the kingdom and dominion, and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the saints of the Most High, whose kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey him.”—Dan. 7: 9,13,14,18, 27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The statement that it &quot;shall be given to the people of the saints of the Most High” is conclusive proof that the government will be for the benefit of the people. “Saints” means those made pure through the merit of Christ Jesus’ shed blood and who then prove themselves loyal under the greatest test. Christ Jesus is the Head of all saints. “The people of the saints” are those who have been brought to a knowledge of the truth and who gladly obey the law of Christ and walk in the way of righteousness. The servants of the kingdom, the method of administration of the government, and the boundless benefits that shall result to the people, I hope to treat in subsequent lectures from this station, pointing- out the method by which the people will become the recipients of the richest blessings under that government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is about this government of righteousness that the small number of Bible Students are now telling the people. Satan the Devil is endeavoring to keep the people in ignorance of these great truths. To this end he blinds the political, judicial and ecclesiastical powers of the land. Under one pretext or another these cause the arrest and punishment of men and women who at the expense of much energy, time and money are carrying the message of truth to the people. A sample of this persecution has recently been experienced in Bergenfield, New Jersey.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A religious element of that community, which suffered an ignominious defeat in the late American election, has now sought to vent its spleen upon the Bible Students. This is a sample of what would result if such men controlled the government. These efforts, however, will in no way stop the preaching of the message of God’s kingdom. Let the people use their radios and tune in on this station, and get the Bible literature that will help them to study their Bible, and study their Bibles at home and learn of the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The righteous government now being set up is and ever will be a pure theocracy. In the Scriptures it is called God’s kingdom because Jehovah God is the Ruler above all. It is called Christ’s kingdom because the Anointed One of God rules in accord with and under the supervision of Jehovah. It is called “the kingdom of heaven” because the Ruler and Controller will be invisible to human eyes and will at all times exercise a beneficent power and influence over men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The privilege of carrying to suffering humanity the message of good news concerning God’s righteous government that shall deliver and relieve them of all oppression is the greatest privilege that has ever been granted to man. Let those who are engaged therein take courage and rejoice that they are counted worthy to bear the burden and suffer at the hands of those that oppose. This is the time above all times to give the witness to Jehovah’s name, and blessed is he or she who has part-therein. Let every one who loves righteousness and truth take his stand on the side of the Lord and continue to increase in the knowledge of the Lord and be the recipient of His blessings.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Story Thirty-nine</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A </span><span class="font5">S JESUS was walking one day through the streets of Jerusalem, He cast a glance toward the portals of a house and beheld a beggar sitting upon the doorstep.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This man had lived by begging all his life, for he could do no work, and no one would take care of him. He was born blind, and had never seen the light of the sun, nor the myriad stars of heaven at night.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Some of Jesus' disciples, who were walking with Him, said, as they saw the Master stop and gaze pityingly upon this poor blind man, “Master, who did sin, this man, or his parents, that he was born blind ?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">And Jesus made answer, and said, “Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents,” and then told them that here was another opportunity for the works of God to be shown to all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The disciples wondered at this speech until they saw what Jesus was about to do for the . blind man. Going up to the poor creature, the Lord spat upon the ground and, taking the moistened clay in His hands, rubbed it upon the sightless eyes of the beggar. Then He said to the man, “Go, wash in the pool of Siloam.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The pool of Siloam was a famous cistern or watering-place of Jerusalem, not far from the steps on which the poor blind man was sitting. The man arose, and, guiding himself with his stick, groped his way to the pool of Siloam to obey the command of Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At the pool the blind man washed his eyes, as Jesus had commanded, and straightway sight was bestowed upon him, and the dense blackness in which he had lived all his life was gone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">You may be sure it did not take the man, whose sight was thus given to him, very long to run from the pool of Siloam and present himself to those who had known him when he was a poor, blind beggar.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Many people who had passed his doorstep every da;/ could not believe it was he, and asked one another in amazement, “Is not this he that sat and begged 1” And others said, 'Surely, he is like him?’ But the man, overhearing them, said joyfully, “I AM he.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Then the people gathered around and asked the man, “How were thine eyes opened?” </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">An</span><span class="font5">d the man could tell them no more than this: “A man that is called Jesus made clay, and anointed mine eyes, and said unto me, Go to the pool of</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Siloam, and wash: and I went and washed, and I received sight.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">And the people were curious to know more about this man Jesus, and they asked him who had been given sight, “Where is he?” But the man answered, “I know not.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Now the Pharisees, when they heard of this latest act of Jesus, were exceedingly angry, because Jesus had performed the deed upon the Sabbath day. They caused the man who had received his sight to be brought before them as they sat in pomp and state in the synagogue, and questioned him concerning Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">They said to the man, speaking of Jesus, “We know that God spake unto Moses: </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">as for this fellow,</span><span class="font5"> we know not from whence he is!” Now when the preachers and priests, the Pharisees, spoke of Jesus as “this fellow” it made him who had been cured of blindness very angry, for the man was a good man, and felt deeply grateful to the Lord, although he really did not know yet who Jesus was.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">So this man stood before the stiffnecked and silken-robed Pharisees and replied to their accusations of Jesus: “Why herein is a marvellous thing, that ye know not from whence he is, and yet he hath opened mine eyes. Now we know that God heareth not sinners: but if any man be a worshipper of God and doeth his will, him he heareth. Since the world began was. it not heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was born blind. If this man were not of God, he could do nothing.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">And, of course, the Pharisees were too “good” to be impressed by this man’s beautiful faith in God, so they said: “Thou wast altogether born </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">in</span><span class="font5"> sins, and dost thou teach us?” The same words the Pharisees of today use when the Bible Students tell them that Jesus is the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Son</span><span class="font5"> of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Then the leader of the Pharisees arose and cast the man out of the synagogue. Jesus heard of it, and when He met the man He said to him, “Dost thou believe on the Son of God?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">And the man said, “Who is he, Lord, that I might believe on him?” And Jesus made answer: “Thou hast both seen him, and it is he that talketh with thee.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">And the man lifted up his eyes in adoration to the face of Jesus and said, “Lord, I believe,” and fell at Jesus’ feet in worship.</span></p>

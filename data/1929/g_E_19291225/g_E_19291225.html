<p><span class="font14">Christ nas: Its Origin and Purpose </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">By </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;">r.h.</span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;"> Barber</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">[Reprinted from </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font3"> No. 241, by request]</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">W</span><span class="font7">ITHOUT doubt, very few have ever taken the time to investigate the origin and&quot; purpose of the day which we call Christmas. Nearly everybody takes the easy course, and takes everything for granted without taking the trouble to investigate. As a result nearly everybody is convinced that Christmas is the most notable day in history because they think it celebrates the birth of our Saviour. Until about a year ago, I had never investigated this subject. Like everybody else, I had taken it for granted that it was a religious festival and that the Bible authorized the observance of the same.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">I had concluded that it was proper to observe the day for the following reasons: It was claimed that it was associated with the birth of our Savior; it was backed up by many centuries of popularity; it w<sup>T</sup>as a day of good cheer and festivity ; millions of people seemed to get so much enjoyment out of it; and the giving of gifts at this particular time seemed to emulate the example of our Savior, who has given so many gifts to the children of men, and who said that it is more blessed to give than to receive.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>A Proper Subject of Inquiry</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">The Scriptures, however, tell us to “prove all things; hold fast that which is good”. They also urge the Christian to “be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you”; and they warn us that a true Christian should not be carried away by every wind of doctrine, but that he should be able to give a “Thus saith the Lord” for what he believes and teaches.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Ma</span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">n</span><span class="font7">y others have investigated this subject before I have, and it is to them that I am indebted for such a mass of evidence that it is impossible to doubt its origin and purpose. Both Webster’s and the Standard Dictionary tell us that Christmas day is of pagan origin. So do all the encyclopedias. In its issue of December 26, 1927, the New York </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">World</span><span class="font7"> carried a full-page article on Christmas which showed beyond a doubt that the day was observed by various heathen nations for many centuries before the birth of Christ. On the same date, the Chicago </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Tribune,</span><span class="font7"> the Cincinnati </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Enquirer</span><span class="font7"> and the St. Paul </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Daily News</span><span class="font7"> carried shorter articles proving the heathen origin of the day. So did some of the larger magazines of the country. Should any one desire to investigate the subject further, after reading this article, I would recommend a perusal of the following four books: Kitto’s </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Illustrated Commentary;</span><span class="font7"> Wilkinson’s </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Egyptians; History of Medieval Drama,</span><span class="font7"> by Robinson; and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Two Babylons,</span><span class="font7"> by Alexander Hyslop, an English clergyman. The last-named book is specially interesting in its revelations, not only on the subject of Christmas, but also on other holidays and feast days now so popular.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Be Not Offended at Truth</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">I fully realize that what I shall say will not please some. However, I assure you that I have no desire to offend any one, nor to be unkind to any one. I am speaking from no other motive than to help you each and all to be better servants of the Lord. I do not wish to offer destructive criticism, but it is my desire to offer that which will be constructive; something that will help you to understand that Jehovah God has a subtle, wicked and vindictive enemy; and that this enemy is God’s enemy and your enemy and the enemy of all who are trying to do the Lord’s will, and also the enemy of all righteousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This enemy has but one purpose, namely, to mock God, to slander His name and to deceive those who are trying to serve God, by hiding the truth from them. To do this, this enemy sets up</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">false doctrines and deceives the people into believing that these doctrines are taught in the Bible, and thus brings reproach upon God and His Word. Millions of intelligent people despise God, and doubt the reliability of the Scriptures, because they are led to believe that the false doctrines of eternal torment, trinity, immortal soul, the divine right of kings, and the divine right of the clergy are taught therein.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Fountain of All Error</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">All false doctrines come from the Devil. The apostle (1 Tim. 4:1) warns us against false doctrines in the last days, our day. I quote: “[This know,] that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This enemy also foists upon the people many rites, forms, ceremonies, feast days and holidays, and makes the people believe that these are commanded of the Lord; then he makes these appear attractive by surrounding them with a glamour of piety, sanctity, and sentimentality, in order to further his deceptions and keep the people in bondage to ignorance and superstition, so that he may the better control them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This enemy will at once be recognized as the Devil. The Bible tells us that the Devil comes as an angel of light; which means that he uses religion as a cover to conceal his deceptions, for it is well known that deceptions put forth in the name of religion have greater influence than any other form of deception. The Devil assumes to be a friend of mankind, when in reality he is man’s worst enemy. He tempted mother Eve in Eden, by professing to be her friend. I want to reveal this enemy in all his hideousness, so that none of my readers will encourage or support his wicked designs in the future.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">If I can show that Christmas day is a fraud, and an injury to people in general; that it promotes selfishness, dishonesty and falsehood; that the Devil is its originator, and that his purpose was, and is, to hide some of the most important and beautiful truths of the Bible, then I shall be a blessing to you. If Satan is the author of the day, and his purpose was to deceive, then we should expect that no good thing could be said about it, because Jesus said of the Devil, “There is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it.”—John 8:44.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Practical Objections to Christmas</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Before giving the Scriptural presentations, I wish to enumerate some practical arguments against the observance of Christmas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Because of the unusual demands upon the people’s time and purse, at this season, and the unusual amount of work involved in purchasing gifts and arranging the festivities, it is always a time of nervous tension and worry. Thus it has become a real burden to the people, and many times do we hear people say, “I shall be glad when Christmas is over.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Again, there is no command to observe the ...day to be found in the Bible, but we are commanded to observe the memorial of our Lord’s death. Satan, however, has taught the people to give more prominence to the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">birth</span><span class="font7"> of the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">babe </span><span class="font7">Jesus than to the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">death</span><span class="font7"> of the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">man</span><span class="font7"> Jesus, in order to hide the importance of the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">ransom,</span><span class="font7"> the chief doctrine in the Christian religion. Satan knows full well that if he can cast a halo about the babe Jesus, and get people to feast and fast and work and worry to celebrate His birth, they will, to a large extent, overlook and forget that it was the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">death</span><span class="font7"> of the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">man</span><span class="font7"> Jesus “which taketh away the sin of the world”, and that without the shedding of the blood of the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">MAN </span><span class="font7">Jesus, there could be no remission of sins.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">With this purpose of keeping the ransom work of Jesus in the background, the Devil has caused the world to be flooded with cards, poems, sermons, and pictures of the babe Jesus and His mother, until they are worshiped and reverenced far more than the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">risen</span><span class="font7"> Lord. Satan does not want the people to know about the value and necessity of the death of the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">man</span><span class="font7"> Jesus and of His resurrection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Then, too, scholars are agreed that December 25 is not the date of the birth of Jesus. December is a winter month in Palestine, and no shepherds are keeping watch over their flocks at that time of the year, as the flocks are not in the fields then. The true date of our Lord’s birth is about October 1. (See </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Studies in the Scriptures,</span><span class="font7"> Vol. 2, pages 54-62.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Profiteering and Misrepresentation</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Then again, everybody is well aware of the fact that the profiteers rob the people during the Christmas season; that the spirit of rivalry and competition enters into the giving of gifts; that the poor people give more than they can afford; that often honest debts are never paid because people spend so much at Christmas t</span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">im</span><span class="font7">e that /hey can not pay their debts; that millions of useless presents are given, which not only waste money, but are just so much junk in the homes, and a few days later find their way into the waste basket. Chief among these are the Christmas cards on which the profiteers make a profit of from 500 to 1000 percent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Often a gift places the one who receives it under an obligation to the giver, a very unpleasant feeling if one does not have the money to make a gift in return. Ofttimes gifts are given for the selfish purpose of receiving gifts in return. Still again, Christmas trees are laden with expensive gifts for the children of the rich, while the children of the poor go home from the Christmas entertainments with aching hearts, with an orange or five cents’ worth of candy or peanuts as a sort of sop.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One of the worst features in connection with Christmas is the habit which parents have of telling lies to their children about Santa Claus’ coining down the chimney and filling their stockings; and then in later years they wonder why the children tell them lies. These lies may be little fibs at first, but the result is a wicked habit formed by the bad example of the parents. The parents are reaping what they have sown.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">No Honor to Jehovah Gad</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Still again, every one is aware of the spirit of frivolity, debauchery, drunkenness and revelry so prevalent during the Christmas season, and the propensity to overeat, with the resultant sick-headaehes the next day. Surely none of these things honor’ either Jehovah God or His Son, our Lord Jesus. Every one knows that they are a disgrace, and yet the Christmas season is prolific of all these excesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">These reasons alone are sufficient to condemn all Christmas festivities, but these reasons are secondary. There are other vastly more important reasons found in the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">According to Genesis 3:15, God told the Devil that the seed of the woman would eventually bruise the serpent’s head. In plain words, God said that a future seed of the woman would eventually destroy the Devil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In Hebrews 2:14 we read an emphatic statement that </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Jesus</span><span class="font7"> is to destroy “</span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font7"> that had the power of death, that is, the devil”. The </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">man </span><span class="font7">Jesus who died on the cross, and whom God raised from the dead on the third day, and who now has “all power in heaven and in earth”, is the One who is to destroy the Devil. The babe Jesus will have nothing to do with destroying the Devil.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>What Satan Would Like to Do</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">When God told Satan that a “seed of the woman” 'would destroy him eventually, the words • “seed of the woman” would suggest to the mind of Satan the thought of a </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">mother and a son,</span><span class="font7"> and that the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">son</span><span class="font7"> would be the one who would destroy him. Consequently, that </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">son</span><span class="font7"> would be the mortal enemy of Satan. Satan, however, at that time, did not know who the seed was to be, nor when the seed would appear, nor when he (Satan) would be destroyed. Paul shows us that the “seed of the woman” who is to destroy Satan, is Christ, the Messiah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The text already quoted (Heb. 2:14) says that Jesus became a man and died That He might destroy the Devil’. All true Christians know that Jesus had to </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">die</span><span class="font7"> and be resurrected to the divine plane of being in order to get “all power in heaven and in earth”, so that He would have both the power and the authority to destroy the Devil. Somehow Satan seemed to grasp the thought that the one who was to be the Messiah must die and be glorified, and so he determined to make a counterfeit Messiah, a counterfeit “seed of the woman” for the purpose of deception, and also in order to confirm that first lie uttered in Eden, when he told mother Eve that she would not surely die. Let us see how he did this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Nimrod and Semiramis</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Shortly after the flood lived Nimrod, a greatgrandson of Noah, and a very wicked and licentious man. He married his own mother, whose name was Semiramis. These two together engaged in hunting and drunken debauchery. Finally Nimrod was slain, and the Devil used the wicked and cunning mother to foist the false messiah on the world. The Devil instigated the plot and used Semiramis as his dupe. She announced that her son and husband had been resurrected, and was now a god, an invisible spirit god, and succeeded in making the people believe this lie. Semiramis was a wicked, shrewd and unscrupulous woman, and wanted some glory for herself; so she boldly put forth the claim that </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">she</span><span class="font7"> was the “woman”, and that her </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">resurrected son</span><span class="font7"> was the “seed of the woman” mentioned by Jehovah God in Eden, and that the resurrected Nimrod was the one who was to destroy the serpent. Here was the beginning of the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“mother and son”</span><span class="font7"> idea which has been perpetuated in all the heathen religions of earth, and which has been adopted into the so-called Christian religions of earth, and still exists in our day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Urged on by Satan, this wicked woman designed a symbol of all this deception, as follows: The dead Nimrod was pictured by the dead stump of a tree. Semiramis claimed that an evergreen tree grew up out of this dead stump in one night, and that this evergreen tree pictured Nimrod </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">risen</span><span class="font7"> and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">glorified.</span><span class="font7"> Semiramis also gave her son the titles “the father of gods” and “the branch”, and adopted the titles “mother of God” and the “queen of heaven” for herself. These titles are found in all heathen religions, and still persist in some of the so-called Christian religions of our day.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Belittling Our Savior</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">Now notice that a title applied to Jesus, in the Bible, is “the Branch”. Notice, also, that evergreen is a Bible symbol of everlasting life, but that Semiramis used it to teach that Nimrod was the possessor of everlasting life. Nimrod, before his death, founded the Babylonian Empire, and built the Tower of Babel. Oh the stone tablets, recently dug up in the vicinity of ancient Babylon, Nimrod is pictured with a mace crushing a serpent’s head; in other words, he is represented as doing just what Jesus is soon to do, namely, destroy the Devil. Thus Nimrod became a false Messiah, and Satan succeeded in getting the Babylonian Empire to ac<sup>!</sup> cept his fraudulent and counterfeit Messiah. ; The Scriptures declare of the true Messiah ' that He would give gifts unto men, and the , Scriptures show that these gifts consist of a i resurrection of all the dead, and the further gifts of liberty, peace, happiness and everlast-i ing life for all who will obey and do the will of j the Lord. Now please notice the miserable counterfeit of these gifts which the Devil instituted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Our present-day Christmas tree had its origin , in that evergreen tree said to have grown up : out of the dead stump. Semiramis claimed that ■ the tree was laden with gifts every year on the t, anniversary of the resurrection of Nimrod, and <sup>i;</sup> that Nimrod placed these gifts there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">1 And now comes the explanation of the 25th day of December’s being chosen as the birthday of our Lord. The truth is that December 25 was Nimrod’s birthday, and that all through the centuries people have been celebrating this date. Nearly all the heathen religions celebrate this date. Here, then, is where the Christmas tree idea originated. However, the day was not called Christmas, nor the tree a Christmas tree, until the heathen custom was adopted into the Christian religion, some time in the fourth century after Christ.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>The Counterfeit Messiah</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">This false system, the counterfeit Messiah, called in the Scriptures the “mystery of iniquity”, is in direct contrast to the “mystery of God”, the true Messiah. This counterfeit system gradually extended to all other heathen nations by the help of Satan, who has led all the world captive at his will. With hardly an exception, all the nations have had the same “mother and son” idea, with the evergreen tree and the giving of gifts in connection therewith; and nearly all of them adopted a date corresponding with the 25th of December as the date of the birth of the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">son.</span><span class="font7"> Candles were always placed on the trees on these occasions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In Egypt the “mother and son” were called Isis and Osiris; in India (to this day) they are called Isis and Iswara; in Asia, Cybele and De-oius; in Pagan Rome, Fortuna and the boy Jupiter; in Greece, Ceres with the babe at her breast, or Irene with the boy Plutus in her arms; in China, Ching Moo, the holy mother, with a child in her arms.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In Japan, Scandinavia, Thibet and Mexico, we find the same “mother and son” idea, and also among the North American Indians.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When the children of Israel went into idolatry they served Baal and Ashtaroth, a mother and son, and spurious woman and her seed. (Judg. 2:10-13) No wonder Jehovah God was angry with the Israelites when His own loving arrangements were so miserably counterfeited and misrepresented, and His name thus slandered, and His beloved Son thus mocked. The very word “devil” means slanderer. See Ezekiel 36: 20-23; Judges 8: 33.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>Other Idolatries of Mother and Son</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">Other names given to the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">son,</span><span class="font7"> the false seed of the woman, in different languages, are Bacchus, Saturn, Molech, Adonis, Cupid, Tammuz, Achilles and Teotle; while other names given to the mother are Rhea, Juno, Venus, Minerva and Diana of the Ephesians. The </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">mother</span><span class="font7"> is always called “the mother of God” and “the queen of heaven”, while the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">son</span><span class="font7"> is called “the father of gods” and “the branch”. All the heathen religions of earth are based on the miserable counterfeit instituted by Satan through his dupe Semiramis. It is the same general idea, although some of the nations have adopted different customs, feasts and rites with advancing centuries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In connection with this idolatrous worship of the mother and son in all the heathen countries of earth, there were held numerous feast days and holidays. These were celebrated with the wildest orgies, licentiousness, debauchery and drunkenness. This fact is doubtless the basis for the Scriptural remark in Revelation 17:4,5 which reads: “And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet colour, and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls, having a gold-e’ cup in her hand full of abominations and filthiness of her fornication: and upon her forehead was a name written, MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.”</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>Santa Claus the Devil</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">In the Bible the true church is called a woman, a virgin; and the false church also is called a woman, but a harlot. This false system of ec-clesiasticism, originated in Nimrod’s day, is also called “the mystery of iniquity”, because it is the most iniquitous thing that ever cursed the earth. It was originated by the great deceiver of the whole world, the slanderer of Jehovah God, namely, the Devil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">To help you get an idea of how successfully Satan has deceived the whole world, I want to call your attention to the fact that the name and title “jolly old St. Nicholas” is a deception, for any unabridged dictionary or encyclopedia tells you that St. Nicholas is the name of the Devil. In the English language we do not use the words St. Nicholas, but use Santa Claus instead, and Santa Claus and St. Nicholas are the same words in different languages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Magi and Their Gifts</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Bible also tells the story of how this ■wicked creature called the Devil and Satan tried to kill the real seed of the woman, the real Messiah. In the second chapter of Matthew there is a story of how certain “wise men” from the East (that is, from Persia), came to </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Jerusalem </span><span class="font7">to locate the babe Jesus. The words “wise men” are a translation of the word “magi”, which means magicians, who are men under the control of demons, and all through the Old Testament, magicians, star-gazers, astrologers, necromancers, and those having familiar spirits are condemned by Jehovah God, and God commanded that they should be killed by stoning.—■ Lev. 20:27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jesus was born in Bethlehem, but Satan set a false light in the sky, which sentimental people call “the star of Bethlehem”, and by using this false light led the magicians to Jerusalem instead, to the palace of the wicked king Herod. Satan knew that Herod would try to kill Jesus, and the record shows that Herod, with devilish fiendishness, caused all the male children under two years of age to be killed so that Jesus could not escape. However, God protected His beloved Son against the machinations of the Devil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Devil directed those magicians, but the angel of the Lord announced to the shepherds the birth of the Babe who was to become the true Messiah. -It is interesting to note that the Devil’s messengers bestowed gifts, gold, frankincense, and myrrh, on the babe Jesus, but that the shepherds, God’s representatives, bestowed no gifts, but went out and announced the fact that the Messiah was born, a thing which the Devil’s representatives did not do.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>Let Us Live the Truth</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">There could be no objection to the proper observance of the birthday of our Lord, an observance which would be an honor to His name, and especially if it were held on the anniversary of His birth, and in no way connected with the miserable counterfeit of Satan, an observance which would be befitting to sanctified common sense and which would in no way be a deception, nor be made a source of profit by the profiteers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When our Lord was on the earth, 1900 years ago, He established the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">true</span><span class="font7"> church. This church continued faithful to the Lord during the lifetime of the apostles; but in his day the Apostle Paul said, “The mystery of iniquity doth already work.” (2 Thess. 2:7) Yes, there had already begun an apostasy from the true faith. This apostasy consisted of an effort on</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">s</span></p><img src="g_E_19291225_files/g_E_19291225-3.png" alt="" style="width:9pt;height:486pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">the part of certain godless men to adopt all the heathen customs into the true church, and thus increase their membership by making it easy for the heathen to join the church.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Bible records this apostasy in Matthew 13:24-28, where it tells us that Jesus sowed good seed, and an enemy came and sowed tares. In verses 37-39 of the same chapter Jesus explained the parable in these words: “He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man: the field is the world: the good seed are the children of the kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked one: the enemy that sowed them is the devil.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The culmination of this apostasy was reached in the fourth century, when the tares had become so numerous in the true church that they could outvote the true saints, and adopted, in their entirety, all the customs of heathen idolatry and gave to these the name Christian. What a slander upon Jehovah God to have all the Devil’s deceptions and frauds called after the name of His Son, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Christian!</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark23"></a>Easter a Heathen Festival</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">The “mother and son” idea was adopted into the so-called Christian church, and now we have “the madonna and her child”. The evergreen tree which symbolized the birth of Nimrod, with its festivities, drunkenness and debauchery, was also brought over into the professing Christian church, but for the first time it was now called the Christmas tree. It is significant, too, that the word “Christmas” means “Christ’s mass”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The prominent heathen festival of Easter was also brought over and engrafted into the so-called Christian church. “Easter” is derived from the name of the heathen goddess, Astarte, which is only another name for Ashtaroth, the mother of Baal. Easter and its festivals are supposed to be in honor of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus. But I am at a loss to know how the pomp and pride, the selfishness and vainglory, the extravagance and splendor, the bunny rabbits and the hot cross-buns, the colored eggs and the cheap and poisoned candies displayed at Easter time, can honor the great King of kings and Lord of lords.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark25"></a>Away with Pagan Humbugs</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">Thus the so-called Christian church has been thoroughly paganized, and has become thoroughly heathen. The Devil has now succeeded in grafting his counterfeit festivals, feast days, fast days and holy days upon the church, and making it pander to all the pride and vanity and selfishness in the human family. Right here I want to quote a witness of highest authority on this point. Cardinal Newman, of the Roman Catholic church, in a book entitled </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">'Development</span><span class="font7"> (pages 359, 360), speaking of the adoption of these heathen customs into the church, says: “These are the very instruments and appendages of demon worship, but they are sanctified by adoption into the church.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Here, then, is the indisputable evidence that these customs are of the Devil and were adopted into the so-called church, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">knowingly.</span><span class="font7"> The Devil has succeeded in getting the people to adopt all his wicked schemes and to give them the name Christian, in order that thus he might mook the great Jehovah God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">For centuries the people have been humbugged with the worship of images, dead saints, relics, holy candles, holy water, Ash Wednesdays, Christmas trees with their mythological nonsense and falsehoods about Santa Claus and his reindeer; with eternal torment; trinity nonsense; with the immortal soul idea; signs of the zodiac; birth months and birth stars; with beads, crosses, forms, rites and ceremonies, all of which have been and are God-dishonoring, foolish, and childish.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark26"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark27"></a>Away with Demon Worship</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">Cardinal Newman was right when he said that “these are the very instruments and appendages of demon ’worship”, but he was wrong when he said they were “sanctified by adoption into the Christian church”. The very opposite is true; namely, the Christian church was degraded and rapidly became filled with tares, children of the wicked one, so that in our day the church is reaping what it has sown, a church whose membership is made up of bootleggers, thieves, murderers, liars, adulterers, profiteers and grafters. God has been dishonored and blasphemed, and His truth has been trailed in the mud.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">How glad we are to know that very soon now all the wicked schemes of the Devil are to be exposed and the Devil himself is to be bound for a thousand years, so that he may deceive the nations no more. After the thousand years he is to be loosed for a little season and then cast into &quot;the lake of fire”, which means his everlasting destruction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Bible encourages the giving of gifts, and in most explicit ±anguage tells us whom to make the recipients of our gifts. There are no scriptures warranting us in giving gifts to those w<sup>T</sup>ho do not need them. Let me quote: “Whoso hath this world’s goods, and seeth his brother have need, and shutteth up his bowels of compassion, . . . how dwelleth the love of God in him?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Bible further advises that in giving gifts we do not let our right hand know what our left hand does; but the way of so-called Christians is to hang the gift on a tree or publish the name and amount in the newspaper so that everybody will know about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Christmas” the Year Around </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">By Harold W. Kline</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">N</span><span class="font7">OW that </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font7"> has so dearly and logically presented the truth about Christmas customs, which arrangement is indeed be-, coming a heavy burden and a greater hypocrisy year by year, I offer the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Let each one, on his birthday anniversary, bestow upon acquaintances all that his prosperity will allow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">All mankind instinctively desire to be a blessing to their fellow men, but circumstances of lack of knowledge or substance have precluded this pleasure from the majority. However, the invisible King is here and the Kingdom is being shaped and the world is due to witness a multiplicity of radical changes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;’•</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">By the present method, the donating and receiving takes place once a year. And what a melee! By the plan I suggest, the entire following year is spread before each one as a reception period, and all the memory work necessary is to remember the date of one’s birthday. No more trying to keep track of friends’ birthday dates and remember them with a postal card or gift!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">On one’s own birthday anniversary it should be a genuine pleasure to express thankfulness and appreciation for another year of life by overflowing blessings to friends, according to your conception of their needs and your ability.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">I can imagine receiving, during the year, a little note from a friend proffering me some coin of the realm; another would send a latest book of elucidation of the Lord’s purposes; another might offer the use of his automobile for so many hours during the year; while another may send me a postal card telling me he is alive and striving to honor the Lord, and that I am still in his memory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">And so, throughout the year, I would find myself the recipient of gifts of various kinds, some of which I may not cash in during the year; but then again, I might have the toothache and find it a real blessing to cash in on my dentist friend’s gift of professional work up to the amount of ten dollars, or cash in on another friend’s gift to supply me with any of the Truth books that may be published during the coming year or use my &quot;automobile hours” gift to spread the message of the Kingdom in territory which I could not reach otherwise. And so forth, and so on. As space will not permit enumerating other examples, just day dream a couple of pages of gifts you would like to receive during the year and see if you don’t get a kick out of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">And then, some gifts might seem odd to offer, yet I am sure if I should, on my birthday, send a note to a widow who lives nearby and whose health is none too good, saying I pledge as a &quot;birthday gift” to keep her sidewalk clear of snow all winter and will put her ashes out every week, it would be very much appreciated and would only afford me exercise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">If I were rich in gold, perhaps I might scatter many coins or bank notes, but then my gift to read s'o many hours during the year to an elderly neighbor whose sight is failing, might be more appreciated than gold. So again, dear reader, to conserve space, day dream a couple of pages of what you would like to do for your friends when your birthday anniversary rolls around.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Order, economy, and real help are, of course, pleasing to the Lord, and this arrangement seems to me ideal, for it would contain the elements of surprise, thoughtfulness, unselfishness and variety which are the charms that have held the Christmas idea together as long as it has in this day of increasing light. How is it by you? ??</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Paganisms of the Season </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">(Contributed)</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">H</span><span class="font7">AVE just finished reading “Christmas, Its Origin and Purpose”, by R. H. Barber, in December, 1928, issue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At last some one has come forward and said just what has been rankling in many persons’ minds. Long before I ever knew anything of Pastor Russell’s books, I perceived that Christmas as celebrated in our “civilized” countries was a hideous curse, with its paganisms, its shameless profiteering in which merchants made mints of money while clerks who were paid the scantiest wages went home about midnight only to spend a Christmas day in bed, trying to recuperate lost strength of a previous two weeks of crazy buying on the part of the public, known as the “Christmas rush”. When I dared to raise my voice against it I was roundly criticized as a Christ-hater. The more I thought of Christmas, as now practised, the worse it looked. No wonder many people are glad when Christmas is over. It is a wonder they are allowed to say it, though.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This article gives mighty good thought upon the subject. It is plainer than ever why Christmas is what it has become.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When the Kingdom shall have fully arrived no doubt we shall see many changes. Many lovers of the old order won’t know the New World, with all their old paganisms gone. Its vigorous and righteous rule will be galling indeed to the lovers of fables. It is easy to see how all this will be a fiery torment to them;</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">I have heard many discussions as to whether it is right to tell the children that there is a Santa Claus. It seems too silly to discuss such a thing. Of course, the only answer is to tell the children the truth. If we do not do so we need not expect them to be truthful either. It would be a shock to some fathers to hear what a*Scotch child said to his little girl neighbor: “I used to believe in Santa Claus, but now I know it’s only me faither, and I am beginning to think that the Devil is me faither too.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Teachings of the Druids-—Pagans &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">By Harry Powell</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">R</span><span class="font7">H. Barber’s article makes it plain that the</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">• Devil is the author of Christmas. A fellow Bible Student and I have made a study of it for some time. We looked up some of the oldest English history, and it shows that the doctrines of trinity, torment, god of war, etc., were part of the teachings of the Druids, which were in existence long before Catholicism, and, as the writer says, these are perpetuated to. this day. Clearly then, churchianity is pagan. We have not observed Christmas for several years, but, on the contrary, have denounced it to all who conversed with us on that subject.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">I would suggest to you the following scriptures, which give a clear picture of a Christmas tree, even to the hammer and nails. These trees were used in the worship of Baal and Ashtaroth, the Israelites having left the worship of Jehovah. The prophet shows the contrast between the god they worshiped, represented in the tree (and which had to be carried), and Jehovah, Maker of heaven and earth. (Jer. 10:1-11) Hosea 4:13 shows that Baal worship was associated with groves on the high places.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">St. Nicholas the Highwayman </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">By Dr. W. G. Wright</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">I</span><span class="font7"> DID a little investigating on my own part of this venerable old St. Nicholas and find that he was the patron saint of thieves and highwaymen. These no doubt include some of the merchants who ply their trade so energetically at this joyful season.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The venerable Bede (De temp, rat., Chap. 13) relates that “the ancient people of the Angli began the year on the 25th of December, when we now celebrate the birthday of the Lord; and the very night that is now so holy to us, they called</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">202</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">in their tongue </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">modranecht (modra nicht),</span><span class="font7"> that is, the mother’s night, by reason of the ceremonies which in that night-long vigil they performed”. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The 25th of December was a feast of Mithra-ism, a religion that invaded the West at the same time as Christianity, but, unlike Christianity, Mithraism died of its own inanition. The Mithrais feast w<sup>T</sup>as called the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">natalis invicti solis,</span><span class="font7"> or birthday of the unconquered sun.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">ZA NE clergyman was given a copy of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font7"> of December 12, 1928, and was advised to read the first article, “Christmas, Its Origin and Purpose.” Later he was asked what he thought of it. He replied: </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“I</span><span class="font7"> knew that both Christmas and Easter were heathen holidays, and therefore say just as little as possible about them.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Another man who is affiliated with organized Christianity, after having read the same article was asked his opinion of it. He said that it was good except for one thing. Upon being questioned concerning that one thing, he replied: “They are a little too hard on the Devil.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">I also want to tell you of an incident that occurred in one of the public schools. The teacher asked the pupils this question: “Who are dependent upon others for support?” They were told to write the answer. When examining the papers the teacher found one little girl had written her answer thus: “The clergy.” The teacher told the little girl that this was not right. What do you think about it?</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Gifis in Season—</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">tiousness. One of the common practices was for a group of young men and young women to meet together. The names of the young women were placed in a box and the young men drew them as chance directed and they became partners for a day subsequently known as St. Valentine’s Day. The young woman’s gift for the day was a man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The gift the young woman drew might be more or less bad, mostly bad; and therefore the gifts passed out on St. Valentine’s Day are often bad ones. It will be noticed that St. Valentine is supposed to be the god of love, or at least that cupids represent him. The dragging of the word “saint” into this thing is only a scheme of the Devil to make real saintliness seem like what it is not, licentiousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Lady Day, sometimes called the Feast of the Annunciation, was celebrated in Pagan Rome two hundred and fifty years before Christ was born. This day, March 25, was celebrated as the day when Cybele, mother of the Babylonian Messiah, became pregnant, the birth of the sungod, Decius, taking place nine months thereafter. December 25.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Lady Day became the origin of Mollier’s Day in this wise. On Lady Day, during the Dark Ages, the faithful were supposed to visit the churches in which they were baptized, bearing with them their gifts. In 1910 this custom was modified by Protestants, so-called, and adopted to fit the present practice. Good children need not to be reminded to be appreciative of their mothers once a year; but it boosts business for a day, and that is the real reason the newspapers have so much to say about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">April Fool’s Day refers to that part of Christ’s agonies where lie was sent from Annas to Caiaphas and from Caiaphas to Pilate and from Pilate to Herod and from lierod back to Pilate on the bootless errands which finally terminated in His death. The Devil’s reason for perpetuating buffoonery and mischief on this day is to give him and his comrades occasion to sneer at the sufferings of the Man of Sorrows. The Hindu Feast of Huli ends on March 31 with the usual April Fool practices common in Europe and America.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">May Day, the first day of May, is in celebration of Baal, Bel, Cahna-Bel (Cannibal), the husband of Ishtar, or Ashtoreth, and in British almanacs the day is still called Beltane. The worship of Bel, or Moloch, was very early introduced into Britain, along with the Druids, the ‘priests of the groves’. The Queen of the May, originally, was the Roman goddess Flora.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Hallowe’en is the eve or night before Hallowmas, or All Saints’ Day, November first. This night is coincident with the Old</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Roman Apple festival of Pomona, when pranks with apples were in order; also with the old Celtic Witches’ Night, when spirits walked abroad and when fortunes could be told.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">On Christmas Eve, four thousand years ago, the Babylonians lighted wax candles, and the night was known as Mother Night. During that night the mother of Adonis was mystically said to have changed into a tree (Christinas tree) and, when in that state, brought forth her “divine” son, variously called Decius, Tammuz, Horus, Plutus, Tsi, Nimrod, Jupiter Puer and Thor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Chaldee name for child is Yule, and this entirely accounts for the putting of the Yule log into the fire on Christmas eve and the appearance of the Christmas tree on the next morning. As the mother was a tree, we thus have the pagan counterfeit of her son as “the man the branch”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Devil is willing enough to have Christ’s birth celebrated, provided it is done at the wrong time and provided most attention is given to the mother, as the queen of heaven; but he is determined that on no account shall Christ’s death as man’s Redeemer receive any attention at the proper time. Our Saxon ancestors celebrated Yule day, or Child’s Day, centuries before they came in contact with Christianity in any form.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Flathead Indians’ Appeal</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">(Transcript of a portion of a school history, with appended comments, by Albert S. Johnson.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">I</span><span class="font7">N THE year 1832 four Indians belonging to the Flathead tribe, living west of the Rocky Mountains, performed a most trying journey, going on foot to St. Louis, Mo., for information concerning the “Christian’s book and the white man’s God.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">These Indians had learned some of the teachings from Lewis and Clarke, and were imbued with a desire for more knowledge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In 1833, notice of this wonderful trip and its cause was given in the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Christian Advocate and Journal,</span><span class="font7"> published m New York; and a general feeling of interest in their behalf was created there among the churches. \</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A meeting of the missionary board of the Methodist Episcopal church was called for the purpose of pr&lt; eeeding forthwith to establish a mission among the Flathead Indians.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At a meeting of this board, Jason Lee was selected to superintend the Indian mission beyond the Rocky Mountains. Rev. Daniel Lee, his nephew, was appointed as his assistant in the same field of labor. They learned that Capt. N. J. Wyeth, of Cambridge, Mass., had just returned from a tour west of the Rocky Mountains, and that he contemplated returning to Oregon the following spring. On receiving this good news, Rev. Lee ivent at once to Boston to arrange, if possible, to make the trip with them; and to this Capt. Wyeth readily consented.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Rev. Lee added to his number by the consent of the board, Cyrus Shepard and P. L. Edwards, who joined them when their party arrived in Missouri; their party now numbered four. After holding a missionary meeting in St. Louis, they proceeded to Fort Independence, Mo., which was a general frontier rendezvous; and there met Capt. Wyeth and his party on the 24th of April, 1834.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Only two of the Indians returned to their people to carry the good news, the other two having sickened and died.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">To give a better understanding of the Indians on this-journey and while at St. Louis, and of their expressions of disappointment, I here quote from chapter three of the work of Dr. O. W. Nixon:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“While St. Louis was at that time so near the border of civilization, yet in 1832 the appearance of the four Flathead Indians dressed in tribal costume was a rare sight, as they strolled along the streets.” Dr. Nixon tells us that “General Clark, who commanded the military post of that city, was promptly notified and took the strangers in charge”. He had been an Indian Commissioner for many years in the far west, knew their tribe well, and could easily communicate with them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“With it all he was a good friend of the Indians and at once made arrangements at the fort to make them comfortable. They informed him that they were all chiefs of the tribe and had spent the entire summer and fall upon their journey. Their wearied manner and wasted appearance told the fact impressively, had the general not known the locality where they belonged.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Continuing, Dr. Nixon says, “For a while they were reticent regarding their mission, as is usual with Indians; but in due time their story was revealed. They had heard of the White Man’s Book of Life’, and had come to hunt for it and to ask for teachers to be sent to their tribe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“To General Clark this was a novel proposition, to come in that way from wild Indians.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“General Clark was a devoted Catholic, and treated his guests as a humane and hospitable man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“After they had rested up he piloted them to every place which he thought would entertain and interest them. Frequent visits were made to the Catholic churches and- to theaters and shows of every kind. And so they spent the balance of the winter. During this time, two of the Indians, from the long journey and possibly from overeating rich food, to which they were not accustomed, were taken sick and died, and were given honored burial by the soldiers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“In the early spring the two remaining Indians began planning for their return home, when General Clark proposed to give them a banquet on the last evening of their sojourn, and to start them on their way loaded with all the comforts he could give. At this banquet one of the Indians made a speech brimming over with Indian eloquence, which fired the Christian hearts of the nation into new life. The speech was translated into English and thus doubtless loses much of its charm.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“The chief said: T come to you over the trail of many moons from the setting sun. You were</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">the friends of my fathers, who have gone the long way. I came with my eyes partly open for my people, who sit in darkness. I go back with both eyes closed. How can I go back blind to my blind people?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“ ‘I made my way to you with strong arms, through many enemies, and strange lands, that I might carry back much to them. I go back with both arms broken and empty. Two fathers came with us; they were the braves of many winters and wars. We leave them asleep here by your great waters and wigwams. They were tired in many moons, and their moccasins wore out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">। &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“ ‘My people sent me to get the White Man’s</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">| &nbsp;&nbsp;Book of Heaven. You took me to where you al</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">low your women to dance as we do not ours; and the Book was not there. You took me to where they worship the Great Spirit with can-i &nbsp;&nbsp;dies; and the Book was not there. You showed</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">me images of the good spirits and the pictures of the good land beyond; but the Book was not among them to tell us the way. I am going back the long and sad trail to my people in the dark land. You make my feet weary with gifts, and my moccasins will grow old in carrying them;</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">f yet the<sup>-</sup>Book is not among them.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">“There was a vein of sadness in the expression of disappointment of the Indians on the evening of departure that must touch the cord of real human fellowship, carrying with it the feeling of regret that even after their strong appeal they were not given a Bible to carry ■ back with them.

<p><span class="font7">“Not wishing to tarry here longer, the mission party resolved to proceed in company with Mr. Thomas McKay and Captain Stewart, also of the American Fur Company, and on September 1 arrived at Fort Wallalula, on Columbia River.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Here they learned that the Flathead tribe was a small one, and not properly situated for the establishment of a mission among them; and learning this, they determined to go down the country and find a more desirable site for their mission.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“They took passage down the Columbia, on one of the Hudson Bay Company’s boats, and arrived in safety at Vancouver, the 15th of September, where five were most hospitably received by Dr. John McLoughlin’.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">The settlers soon found themselves in need of certain laws as necessity called for them; and a circumstance transpired in February, 1841, which differed materially in its obligation on the community from any that had yet happened.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The cause of action taken at that time was the death of Ewing Young, one of the principal men of the colony, leaving a large estate, with no provision for its administration. He had not a single relative to follow him. Immediately after his funeral, arrangements were made to call a public meeting for the purpose of appointing officers for the government of the community and to properly provide for the disposition of the estate of Ewing Young.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At this meeting the Rev. David Leslie was chosen chairman, and a committee to form a constitution and draft a code of laws included the names of the Rev. Jason Lee and other members of the company who had been sent from St. Louis by the missionary board of the Methodist Episcopal church in response to the appeal of the Flathead Indians for the “White Man’s Book of Life”, and for teachers to “make the way plain” to them.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">This story impresses me as typical of the whole history of the institutional church and the futility of the work of caste-ridden Christians with a professional clergy bound in the civil and social institutions of this world.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Question.</span><span class="font5"> I am a Jew, one of a family of ten, seventeen years of age and born in this country. My parents were natives of Russia, and, like many others, came here to start life anew. They brought with them the old Jewish religion, with its traditions and quaint customs. In 1920 my father passed away, and with him, I am sorry to say, most of the religious fervor of our family. I was taught to pray and read from the Hebrew texts, but without any knowledge of the Hebrew language. Since I could not understand Hebrew prayers I soon ceased to pray. I joined the Y. M. C. A. about a year ago and there I made many Gentile friends, becoming somewhat acquainted with Christianity, which resulted in my taking an interest in it and attempting to understand it. At present I do not know where I am at. I was born a Jew and wish to remain one. I have gone so far as to possess a Bible and am reading both Testaments during my leisure. To a young man situated as I am what would you advise me to do ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Answer.</span><span class="font5"> Your questioning attitude is highly creditable. It is not the purpose of this column to make proselytes. But I advise you not to commit yourself definitely until you have larger information and have made a wider personal observation of the issues you raise. I suggest that you write Rabbi Alexander Lyons, of Brooklyn, whose spiritual liberalism will guide you fairly.

<p><span class="font7">Bishop Criticizes Apostles</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-variant:small-caps;">B</span><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">ishop Edgar Blake, of Indianapolis, presiding at the annual Illinois conference of Methodist Episcopal churches, referred to the apostles as “a tough lot of Galilean fishermen who quarreled and swore and were self-seek-j ers”. He declared that when they came to Jesus their first inquiry was, “What are we going to i get out of this?” (though we know of no such 1 text, nor anything akin to it) and then he finally - capped the climax by saying, “I don’t believe Peter, James, or John could get into the Illinois i conference.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">i We think that last statement of Bishop Blake is correct. The apostles could not get into the Methodist Episcopal church. Let that stand for t a moment while we look at it. The bishop be<sup>:</sup> lieves in what is sometimes called the “historic episcopate”. Otherwise he could not be a bishop i in the Methodist Episcopal church. The “historic episcopate” is a high-toned way of saying that the bishop thinks he is lined up with the apostles themselves, in what is called the apos-( tolic succession.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">J Too bad the original apostles could not get I ;■ into the place of high honor occupied by their p' successors! As the writings of the New Testament are all the work of the apostles, and as the bishop holds them in such light esteem, we are fair in supposing that he regards the Bible about as he regards the writers of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">, This leads us inevitably to the position that i as Jesus Christ selected the apostles, and was responsible for their writings, Jesus Himself could not get into the church of which Bishop Blake is one of the shining lights, and we think, as a matter of fact, that He could not get into it, and never did get into it, and is not in it now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">If there had been a World War in Jesus’ day, Jesus’ various declarations, “Blessed are the peacemakers,” “Resist not evil,” “Love your enemies,” 'Do to others as ye would that they should do to you,’ Tut up thy sword into its sheath,’ “Thou shaft not kill,” etc., etc., would have made Him entirely unacceptable as a member of the church of which the bishop is one of the rulers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The bishop is a “Right Reverend”, but Jesus ■was not a “Reverend” at all. The bishop has been “regularly ordained”, but Jesus was never anything but a humble carpenter before He began His ministry. The bishop has built many, many churches (with money cleaned out of the pockets of other people), but Jesus never built a single one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When you come to think of it, the bishop does not ask any odds of the twelve apostles, nor of the Bible, nor of Jesus of Nazareth, nor of the One who sent Jesus into the world, and as far as we are concerned he can rest secure in his conviction that the three favorite friends of our Lord, not one of them, “Peter, James, or John, could get into the Illinois conference.” Indeed, we will go a step further and say for them that none of them would wish to.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">[Broadcast from Station WBBR, New York, by Judge Rutherford.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">G</span><span class="font7">_OD’S Word, addressed to men is set forth in the Bible. The most illuminating and beneficial study in which man can engage is therefore the Bible. It disposes why there has been so much suffering amongst men and how man</span><span class="font6">kind </span><span class="font7">will be completely relieved therefrom and have a full and fair opportunity for everlasting </span><span class="font6">life </span><span class="font7">on earth in a state of happiness. It is a great privilege and real joy to be permitted to </span><span class="font6">call </span><span class="font7">the attention of this radio audience to some of the wonderful truths contained in the Scriptures. The moving cause for Bible lectures should always be to magnify the Word and the name of Jehovah God and to bring information to the people that will bo helpful to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This morning begins a series of lectures on the book of Job. I hope you have all carefully read that marvelous book. In my lectures I shall read only portions of it, and I strongly urge that you carefully read the Bible texts thereof preceding each lecture. It is not unusual in the world to hear men mentioned as great men. God’s Word shows, however, that man is insignificant within himself and is properly called great only to the extent that God uses him. Man has nothing that is worth while except that which he receives from the great Creator. Therefore to the Creator, and not to the creature, is due all honor and glory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah is the greatest moving-pictwe producer.</span><span class="font7"> He permits men to make some pictures, and as a result of their efforts they think they are great. They are not. Beginning in the early days of man Jehovah used men to move according to His purpose, and by their movements He pictured the coming days of salvation and restoration to life. Of course those men, although anxious to know the meaning of their course of action, did not understand the meaning thereof, because it was not the will of God nor His due time for them to understand. Many of those men thus used had faith in God, and their faith He will in due time reward. Even the angels of heaven desired to understand, but God reserved the understanding thereof to those who should live on earth at His appointed time and who are devoted to Him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Among the great pictures made and set down in the Bible is that of the case of Job. In fact it stands out separate and distinct, teaching lessons of greatest importance to creation. The</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">217</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font7">book that bears Job’s name has been little understood, as indeed it could not be understood until God’s due time. Viewed now in the light of fulfilled prophecy and of the revealed purpose of God, the book of Job begins to unfold to the diligent searcher after truth. The very language employed in the book gives a clear picture of God’s power to give life to mankind by means of restitution, and also of His purpose so to do. The restitution picture applies not only to Jews but to all peoples of the earth. So far as the Scriptures disclose, Job was not a Jew. He lived outside of the land of Israel. He dwelt in Uz, which is east of Palestine. Concerning Job it is written: “This man was the greatest of all the men of the east.” (Job 1:3) This places Job in a class all by himself and indicates that the picture God used him to make must be a distinctive one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">That Avhich is written concerning Job takes on greater interest when we begin to see that God used him to make a marvelous picture of restitution as a means of bringing life to the human race. Uz was a descendant of Shem through Aram. It therefore follows that Job was a descendant of Shem, the son of Noah and upon which son God pronounced special blessings.' (Gen. 9: 26; 10: 23) “Uz” means “counsel” or “consultation”, which seems to indicate that Uz and his descendants w<sup>r</sup>ere those who sought counsel or knowledge of Jehovah God. That seems to show that Job had relationship with God and that God used him for a specific purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A picture is an image of the real substance. The image may be one that is seen by the natural eye, or it may be a mental representation of that which is tangible. Whether Job existed as a real person or whether the statement concerning him is an allegory matters not. The account is written in the Word of God and is intended for the instruction of mankind. Since the Bible abounds with proof that God used men to make living pictures concerning the fulfilment of His purposes, the proof is overwhelming that Job was a real man and was used to make a living picture, and that he had communication or' relationship with God. Furthermore the proof is quite conclusive that Job lived some time after the days of Abraham. That he did really exist, and that the story is not an alle-</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark134"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark135"></a>Correspondency</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">There is a striking correspondency of Job with Adam that can not be ignored. The difference was that Adam did not maintain his integrity, while Job did maintain his integrity. Adam, the perfect man, was a prince and dwelt in the garden of God which ivas planted eastward in Eden, and Adam had communication or counsel with God. Job was “the greatest of all the men of the east”, which constituted him a prince among men. He is spoken of in the Scriptures as a prince. (Job 21: 28; 31: 37) He lived in the land of Uz, the meaning of which is that he had communication or counsel with God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">God made the man Adam perfect, and it was the will of the Creator that this perfect creature should worship God. It was the work of the Devil to turn the man Adam away from God. The Devil took that course of action for selfish reasons. Jehovah did not hedge Adam about so as to make him invulnerable to the wiles of Lucifer. God permitted Adam to be subjected to temptation to prove him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Concerning Job it is written: “That man was perfect and upright, and one that feared God, and eschewed evil.” Even though he was imperfect in his organism and had no right to life, his heart was pure toward God and therefore God counted him perfect. Since God looks upon the heart or motive that induces man to act, He judged him from that viewpoint. “The Lord seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the ; outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart.” (1 Sam. 16:7) Job’s heart was soft toward God and he feared God with a proper J or godly fear. (Job 23:15-17) Job therefore i stood before God as though he were a perfect man, being upright and pure in heart. Adam ' was actually perfect in Eden; so Job was counted perfect, and therefore there was a correspondency in this regard.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Prince Adam was a wealthy man. He had a : wife whom God had given him, and he had the prospect of filling the earth with a happy and perfect race of sons and daughters. He was the । father of the human family. He was given do-jminion over every living creature, of the beasts and fowls of earth.—Gen. 1:26; 2:19. j In his time Job was chief among men. (Job ,29:25) His wealth and position among men w<sup>T</sup>as one of the reasons why he was the greatest of all men of the east. God uses symbols in connection with the pictures He has made. The number </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">ten</span><span class="font7"> is a symbolic number representing completeness, that is to say, including all. Any multiple of ten would therefore symbolize the same thing. In this connection it is interesting and important to note the wealth that Job possessed, and it shows a correspondency to that of Prince Adam. Job had seven sons and three daughters, making a total of ten children. This total number of his children would well represent </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font7"> the offspring of Adam, or, otherwise stated, all the human family. Job possessed seven thousand sheep and three thousand camels, making a total of ten thousand animals. He also possessed five hundred yoke of oxen and five hundred she asses, and a very great household. (Job 1:3) It is thus seen that his position among men and his great w<sup>T</sup>ealth constituted him the greatest man of his time. In his restitution Job was given all that he had lost, and much more; and this is further proof that God used Job to make a living picture representing the course of man and how<sup>r</sup> man would be granted life by means of redemption and restitution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Adam should have been wholly demoted to God because that was his duty as a perfect creature. Job was wholly devoted to God as a matter of choice. His sons made a feast, and all these sons together with their sisters partook of that feast. The devotion of Job to Jehovah is proven by what immediately followed that feast: “And it was so, when the days of their feasting were gone about, that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in the morning, and offered burnt offerings according to the number of them all: for Job said, It may be that my sons have sinned, and cursed God in their hearts. Thus did Job continually.” (Job 1:5) The fact that Job did so “all the days” (margin), or “continually”, is further proof of his devotion to Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Lucifer was the overlord of Adam during his sojourn in Eden. Jehovah God appointed him to that position. Because of Lucifer’s disloyalty and rebellion God changed his name to that of Dragon, Serpent, Satan and Devil. The lordship over man was not taken away from the Devil, however, and as the Devil he has continued to exercise power over men. The proof of this is given in the book of Job, as well as in other portions of the Scriptures. That which caused the fall of Lucifer and turned him into a devil was his coveting the devotion of Adam to God. Lucifer wanted that worship of man for himself. To accomplish his wicked purpose he worked through Eve, the woman whom God had given to Ad? a; ,and he succeeded in his wicked purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Devil begrudged the worship and devotion that Job was giving to the Lord. The Devil accused Job of serving God for a selfish reason. The day came when the sons of God presented themselves before the\,ord Jehovah. Satan the Devil also appeared with that heavenly company. This is proof that Satan was in heaven and had access to the presence of Jehovah God. Satan desired to turn Job away from God; and God, knowing this, offered him the opportunity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“And the Lord said unto Satan, Whence comest thou? Then Satan answered the Lord, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it. And the Lord said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil? Then Satan answered the Lord, and said, Doth Job fear God for nought? Hast not thou made an hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he hath on every side? Thou hast blessed the &quot;work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land. But put forth thine hand now, and touch all that he hath, and he will curse thee to thy face. And the Lord said unto Satan, Behold, all that he hath is in thy power; only upon himself put not forth thine hand. So Satan went forth from the presence of the Lord.”— Job 1:7-12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Satan accused Jehovah of hedging Job about, and also all his beasts, so that Job could not be induced to worship the Devil. Jehovah told Satan that he might try his hand to induce Job to repudiate the Lord; and then Satan went forth to make preparations for the attack, with the wicked purpose of destroying Job’s devotion to the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The day came when all Job’s children were in the house of his eldest son, eating and drinking together. Satan stirred up his instruments the Sabeans, and they stole the oxen and the asses of Job and took them away, and killed his servants. Other servants were herding the sheep, when both sheep and servants were destroyed by fire. About the same time the Chaldeans] also servants of the Devil, stole the camels of Job and slew his servants having them ini charge. While the children of Job were together] eating and drinking, Satan stirred up a great windstorm that destroyed the house in which; they were, and all Job’s children were </span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">kill</span><span class="font7">ed J (Job 1:13-19) The Devil thought that now Job] would curse God. On the contrary, Job abased] himself before the Lord God and said: “Naked] came I out of my mother’s womb, and naked) shall I return thither: the Lord gave, and the? Lord hath taken away; blessed be the name of the Lord. In all this Job sinned not, nor charged) God foolishly.” (Job 1:21,22) Unlike Adam, Job showed his complete submission and willing obedience to Jehovah. Job therefore maintained his integrity and his devotion to God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is quite probable that Adam wept and cried because of his loss, after he was expelled from Eden. Also that he became embittered and suffered. Both Adam and his offspring have been hated by and have suffered at the hands of the Devil. The name Job means “he that weeps, that cries, that is hated and is persecuted”. In this he well represents the members of the human family that have suffered because of their efforts to do right. The history of the human race is recorded in tears of bitterness. After the loss by Job of his children and his property there came another day when the sons of God presented themselves before the Lord, and again Satan was there also to present himself before the Lord. (Job 2:1) Satan the Devil still had conversation with God:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“And the Lord said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil? and still he holdeth fast his integrity, although thou movedest me against him, to destroy him without cause. And Satan answered the Lord, and said, Skin for skin, yea, all that a man hath will he give for his life. But put forth thine hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will curse thee to thy face. And the Lord said unto Satan, Behold, he is in thine hand; but save his life.”—Job 2: 3-6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Satan was determined to break the confidence of Job in the Lord and to turn him away from the Lord God. “So went Satan forth from the presence of the Lord, and smote Job with sore boils, from the sole of his foot unto his crown.”</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font3">i'i</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">(Job 2:7) Again Job humbled himself before the Lord, which is shown representatively by his sitting down among the ashes. “And he took him a potsherd to scrape himself withal; and he sat down among the ashes.”—Job 2:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Then Satan bethought himself of his method of reaching Adam. In his effort to break Job’s integrity he now used the woman whom God had given Job for a wife. “Then said his wife unto him, Dost thou still retain thine integrity? curse [renounce] God, and die.” (Job 2:9) Again the Devil failed in his wicked attempt to destroy Job’s faith. Job responded to his wife in words of rebuke: “Thou speakest as one of the foolish women speaketh. What! shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not reI ceive evil? In all this did not Job sin with his ! lips.”—Job 2:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">] Adam fell when the test was upon him. He .1 sinned willingly with his eyes open. (1 Tim.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">2:14) Adam did not love God. He was con-;l trolled by his selfish desire. Satan concluded :,that, because Adam yielded to his selfish desire tat Eve’s suggestion and fell, Job would likewise || yield to his wife’s<sup>-</sup> suggestion and fall. Job did not fall under the test. He did not rebel against God or deny Him. After Job had lost his chili dren and all his property he still had the confidence of God and full faith in God and therefore maintained his integrity. It was at that time that God said to Satan: “And still he hold-eth fast his integrity, although thou movedst me against him, to destroy him without cause.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Integrity means fidelity to what one believes . Is right, regardless of what extraneous influence : pay be brought to bear upon him. It means that one insists upon his own innocence of any wil-iful wrong-doing and still maintains his faith in and devotion to his Creator. One may be charged with crime and suffer great punishment under and by reason of such charge and yet be inno-’pentj and amidst all his suffering honestly in-i^ist upon his innocence of wilful wrong-doing. I In this he would hold the confidence of those who knew him. The record, made in the book I bearing his name, shows that Job at all times I and under the. greatest suffering stedfastly I naintained his integrity by holding fast his I faith in God and having the confidence of God. I j It has been suggested that Adam in Eden was I perfect in everything except experience. Such II Conclusion is wrong and contrary to the Scrip-I lures. Jehovah God created Adam perfect. It is expressly written that all the works of Jehovah are perfect. (Deut. 32:4) There is no such thing as a qualified perfection, when speaking of the handiwork of Jehovah. Adam preferred to yield to the influence of the Devil rather than to obey God, and he therefore fell and lost everything which God had given him. In describing his condition the Prophet Isaiah uses these words: “From the sole of the foot even unto the head there is no soundness in it; but wounds, and bruises, and putrifying sores: they have not been closed, neither bound up, neither mollified with ointment.”—Isa. 1: 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Job was imperfect in his organism, but he had a perfect heart devotion to the Lord. He preferred to serve God rather than the Devil, and in this he maintained his integrity and had God’s confidence therein. Thus it is demonstrated that there was no excuse for Adam’s wrongful course. This also proves that there is no excuse for an intelligent creature to willingly choose to serve the Devil rather than to serve God. One who loves God will seek to know His way and to do it so far as it is possible; and such a course is pleasing to God.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark136"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark137"></a>Involved</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">The book of Job has long been a mystery. By many it is claimed to be merely a choice piece of literature. Others say it is the greatest poem in the world. It is much more than either of such claims. It was Jehovah God who caused the book to be 571'111611. For the benefit of all those who are wholly devoted to Jehovah it is further written in the Bible: “For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope.” (Rom. 15:4) Furthermore, God made promise that during “the time of the end” some would have the correct understanding of His Word, which must include the book of Job. (Dan. 12:4,10) It seems quite clear, then, that a time must come, before God’s anointed class have passed from the earth, for some of them to understand the book of Job. Involved in the record are these: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jehovah God; the sons of God; Satan the enemy; Job, the man of Hz; the wife of Job; the ten children of Job; Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar, the three professed friends of Job; Elihu, the young man; and numerous spectators. The places involved included both heaven and earth. It seems quite certain that there is contained in the book a lesson of paramount importance to all creation, and particularly to man. It is therefore the privilege of the anointed to search out by God’s grace the meaning thereof in God’s due time.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark138"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark139"></a>Pictures</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">The Scriptural proof is positive that God used the people of Israel to make pictures of the fulfilment of His purposes. The law which God gave to the Israelites foreshadowed better things to come to humanity. Aj i aat came to pass with the Jews was recorded for examples or ensamples for the benefit of those who will learn of the outworking of God’s purposes. Although Job was not a Jew, that 'would in no wise mean that God did not use him as an example or picture. Job being the greatest man of the east, and seeing that many creatures of heaven and earth were involved, even the great Creator Himself, we are warranted in the conclusion that the picture of Job must have even a greater scope than the one in which Israel was involved. If so, then the picture would have to do with all mankind, both Jews and Gentiles. It is deemed advantageous to the student in the examination of the book of Job to state here in general terms what are some of the pictures that plainly appear, and then to show from the Scriptural proof the correctness of that conclusion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Job in the day of his prosperity pictured Adam, the perfect and prosperous prince in Eden.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Job in his adversity pictured the entire human race suffering loss, sickness and death by reason of sin, which sin the enemy Satan put in operation through Adam.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Job suffering the loss of all his children pictures Adam losing all his offspring by reason of sin which was put in operation by Satan the enemy through Adam’s wrongful act.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Job maintaining his integrity under test pictures a class of men who under test do prove their fidelity and devotion to God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Job as the servant of God maintaining his. fidelity pictured all the servants of God who through adversity stedfastly and immovably hold their faith in God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The three men, Eliphaz, Bildad and Zophar, who posed as friends of Job, were in fact not his friends. They can better be classed as three frauds. They, therefore, picture the Devil’s agencies, or his organization, attempting to direct man as to what is the course for him to take.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Elihu, the young man, well pictures or represents God’s anointed messengers who magnify the name of Jehovah and, as God’s messengers, speak His message of truth to those who will hear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The wife of Job also pictures an instrument that Satan the Devil employs to induce men to curse God, and therefore well represents Satan’s organization passing under the name or symbol of a woman.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Job fully restored to health and happiness and to all and even more than he had in former days pictures the great truth that God in His due time will restore the human race to health, happiness and life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The great lesson taught by the book of Job is that of life from the dead by means of resurrection and restitution; also that life, which is the greatest desire of man, may be had only through the office of a redeemer and mediator whom God provides.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Next Sunday morning consideration will be given to the great controversy between God and Satan, and the relationship of man thereto. The book of Job gives a vivid picture of that controversy, and, in view of the present existing evil conditions in the world, is especially illuminating now to the searcher for truth. I ask that between now and next Sunday morning you carefully read the Bible text as set forth in Job, chapters 1 to 3 inclusive.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">UESTION:</span><span class="font7"> How do we know that Job 38:4-7 does not refer to man in his prehuman estate, as claimed by our Mormon friends ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Answer:</span><span class="font7"> Because there never was any man in a prehuman state, with the solitary exception of the Lord Jesus Christ ; and even He, in His prehuman estate, was not a man, but a spirit being, the Logos, the representative of Jehovah. So far as man is concerned, he is of the earth</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">earthy. The apostle tells us that God “hath made of one blood all nations of men, for to dwell on all the face of the earth”. This is a plain statement that every human being now living, or that ever has lived, or that ever will live, with the single exception of the Lord Jesus, is a descendant of one man. In no other way could they properly be spoken of as being “of one blood”. If it were true, as our Mormon friends seem to think, that man lived in heaven before he lived on earth, we should be forced to the conclusion that the tragedy in Eden happened in heaven, and not where we have every reason to know it did happen, namely, where we mortals dwell.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Question:</span><span class="font7"> Why does God take an only child from a home when the parents are living as best a Christian.life as to their knowledge?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Answer:</span><span class="font7"> It is blasphemy for any religious teacher to tell you that God took your only child, for that would be equal to saying that God is selfish and put your only child to death, thus depriving you of the joy and privilege of having the child with you. God does not need to, and does not, take any children from their earthly parents in order to have company for Himself in heaven. Christ Jesus promised that at His second coming He would take only His followers, intelligent Christians of responsible years, to Himself, if they were faithful unto death. (John 14:1-3) It was not God, but death, that took your child, and death takes the beloved children of all parents, Christian or heathen. That death is due not to your sin, but to Adam’s sin six thousand years ago. As Romans 5:17</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Billy Sunday Unmasked”</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font2">i</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">rpHIS little book by William Lloyd Clark resorts to pages and pages of the deadly parallel which show that Billy Sunday helped himself liberally to the orations of Robert G. Ingersoll, Sidney C. Tapp, T. DeWitt Talmage, George R. Stuart, John Uri Lloyd, Gipsy Smith, Wil</span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">li</span><span class="font7">am T. Ellis, David McConaughy and Charles C. Albertson, and without giving due credit. But Billy Sunday has done much worse things than that. He has preached as his own sermon, almost word for word, Pastor Russell’s great sermon on “The Manner of Our Lord’s states: “By one man’s offence death reigned by one.” Since both of you are trying to be Christians, it may fitly be said that God is specially interested in your family and hence permitted your child to succumb to death so soon to test your faith and to teach you lessons which even yet you have not fully appreciated. He has provided that in His due time, under Christ’s kingdom, the child shall be awakened from the sleep of death and be raised from the grave, and then both of you, if faithful to Him, shall have the inexpressible joy of seeing this child again. This child’s untimely death testifies only that death is an “enemy” (1 Cor. 15:26), and it calls for you to believe more fully in God’s resurrection power through Christ and to look forward to, and pray more earnestly for, Christ’s kingdom to be fully set up over earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Question:</span><span class="font7"> Are Bible Students socialists?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Answer:</span><span class="font7"> No! If you do not believe it, then inquire at your local socialist headquarters. Bible Students are students of the Bible who are striving to do God’s will as faithful Christians.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Question:</span><span class="font7"> Were there people here before Adam ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Answer:</span><span class="font7"> The Bible plainly shows there were no human beings on earth before God created Adam. Spirit beings were evidently present unseen while the earth was in preparation, but 1 Corinthians 15:45 says: “It is written, The first man Adam was made a living soul”; thus showing that Adam was the first man on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Return and Appearing”, as printed in the second volume of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Studies in the Scriptures,</span><span class="font7"> which volume is entitled </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Time Is at Hand,</span><span class="font7"> and has contemptuously referred to the work of the great man, from whose works he had been stealing, as “Old Russell”. Bible Students believe he did this to dissuade his hearers from reading Pastor Russell’s'books, so that they would not read the books and find where the sermon on the second advent, which they so much admired, was procured. William Lloyd Clark is right; and so was Barnum.</span></p><img src="g_E_19291225_files/g_E_19291225-26.png" alt="" style="width:328pt;height:241pt;">

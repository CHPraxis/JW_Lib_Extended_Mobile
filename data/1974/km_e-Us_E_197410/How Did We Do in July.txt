How Did We Do in July?
Most of us attended an assembly during the month, yet a fine effort in the service resulted in the distribution of 1,116,444 books. That exceeded last July’s report by more than 320,000!
Several congregations, along with 98 temporary special pioneers, were busy in unassigned territory, making sure people in those areas hear the good news.
The number baptized was 12,997, bringing the 11-month total to 76,566. That is 20,991 above last year’s total! In a marvelous way, we see Jehovah “Increasing the Wealth of Earth’s New King”!

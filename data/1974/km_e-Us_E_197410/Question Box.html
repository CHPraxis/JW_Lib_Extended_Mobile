<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"><strong>● How can we get help to solve a personal problem?</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">There is real satisfaction in being able to solve our own problems with the help of God’s Word. Many find they can successfully resolve most personal difficulties through prayer and personal study of the Bible. Better than anyone else, Jehovah knows our problems and invites us to come to him for help. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:4:16-58:4:16" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Heb. 4:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:1:2-59:1:5" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Jas. 1:2-5</a>: <a class="xt" data-xtid="102" href="jwpub://p/E:1974486/1-16"><em>Watchtower, </em>July 1, 1974, pp. 414, 415</a>) <em>The Watch Tower Publications Index </em>can be used to locate material that deals with specific problems and the Bible counsel that applies.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">After following the above suggestions, if you still feel the need for assistance, then talk to one of the elders in your congregation. These brothers know you and your circumstances; they are usually in a good position to offer the counsel you need from God’s Word. Remember, the elder arrangement is Jehovah’s provision for giving spiritual assistance.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">If the problem persists and you have good reason to feel that you need further help, you may write to the Society. If you decide to write, we suggest that you do the following: Identify yourself, your congregation and any other persons directly involved. Anonymous letters are never answered. Do not inquire about hypothetical situations. State things accurately, avoiding conjecture and unrelated details. Provide complete information, clearly stating the nature of your problem. Relate what you have done so far to solve it and why you feel that you have been unsuccessful. An effort will be made to point out the Bible principles that apply. If you write about counsel given by the elders, it would be good to provide them a copy of your letter. When others are involved, the Society may send a copy of its reply to the elders so that they will know what advice has been given.</p>

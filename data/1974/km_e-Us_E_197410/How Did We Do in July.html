<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Most of us attended an assembly during the month, yet a fine effort in the service resulted in the distribution of 1,116,444 books. That exceeded last July’s report by more than 320,000!</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Several congregations, along with 98 temporary special pioneers, were busy in unassigned territory, making sure people in those areas hear the good news.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The number baptized was 12,997, bringing the 11-month total to 76,566. That is 20,991 above last year’s total! In a marvelous way, we see Jehovah “Increasing the Wealth of Earth’s New King”!</p>

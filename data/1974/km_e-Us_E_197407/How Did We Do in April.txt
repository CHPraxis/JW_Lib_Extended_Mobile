How Did We Do in April?
Total number of publishers is up more than 18 percent over last year’s average. There were new peaks in regular and temporary pioneers. Altogether these publishers placed over 41 percent more subscriptions, 2,385,976 more magazines and conducted 24 percent more Bible studies than a year ago. How encouraging!

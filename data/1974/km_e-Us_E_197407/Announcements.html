<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">◆ With the August <em>Kingdom Ministry </em>there will be an insert. Please remove all of these from the copies of <em>Kingdom Ministry </em>before they are distributed to the congregation. Trim them neatly along the left-hand edge so as to separate pages 3 and 4 from pages 5 and 6. The first portion will be distributed to newly interested ones at the conclusion of the first meeting in September; the second portion will be distributed at the second service meeting in September, to those who are publishers.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn">◆ With the September issue of <em>Kingdom Ministry </em>the Society plans to provide details concerning a special series of public talks to be given in the congregations during November and December. To the extent possible, we recommend that they be scheduled on consecutive weeks until they have all been heard.</p>

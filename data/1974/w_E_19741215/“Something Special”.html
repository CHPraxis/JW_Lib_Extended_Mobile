<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">That is what one New Yorker called last year’s <em>Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses. </em>“I found it was impossible to put it down,” she wrote. “After five days of rescheduling, not only was it read, but it had become the main topic of conversation in our home.”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">You will find the <em>1975 Yearbook </em>equally interesting. It features the gripping story of Jehovah’s witnesses from the 1870’s until today, with main emphasis on the United States. Order now. Only 50 cents, postpaid.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Please send, postpaid, the <em>1975 Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses; </em>I enclose 50c.</p>

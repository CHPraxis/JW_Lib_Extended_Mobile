<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">With many district assemblies beginning this month, baptisms increased and we are thrilled to report that 12,300 new brothers and sisters were added to the congregations. This makes a total of 63,569 baptized in the first ten months of the service year; 7,794 more than all last year!</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">It is also encouraging to note that 886,685 Bibles and books were placed. This is over 155,000 more than were placed last June! Of course, we will want to cultivate this growing interest in Godâ€™s Word by making return visits.</p>

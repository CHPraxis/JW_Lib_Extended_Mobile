Branch Letter
Dear Kingdom Publishers:
With the end of August comes the end of another service year, and what a wonderful year it has been! A year with the greatest Memorial attendance ever; a year when the greatest number were baptized. Think of it, more were baptized in the United States in 1974 than in all the world a mere seven years ago!
Capping off the year and making it complete was the delightful series of “Divine Purpose” District Assemblies. They will long be remembered for the two new releases, God’s “Eternal Purpose” Now Triumphing for Man’s Good and Is This Life All There Is?
Have you finished reading these exciting new publications? If not, we urge you to do so without delay. Don’t put this off until the material is covered in the series of public talks that are to be given. The information these books contain you need to know now.
And don’t wait either until the special campaigns later this year before letting your friends, neighbors and relatives get copies of these new books. Why not carry a copy or two of each wherever you go​—to work, out shopping, when visiting friends? And you children, in starting back to school, why not take copies to your teachers? This way it will be easy to explain where you went this summer and why you enjoyed the assembly.
Now we are starting a new service year, and one that holds promise of being an exciting one. Before we get around to distributing Kingdom News No. 19 we will have a big magazine month, October. The special October 8 issue of Awake! deals with the question “Does God Care?” In these troubled times this is an issue you will certainly enjoy distributing. Tell the brother handling the magazines in your congregation now how many extra copies you want. You’ll be sorry if you run out.
Your brothers,
BROOKLYN BRANCH OFFICE

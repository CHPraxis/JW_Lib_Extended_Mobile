<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Regarding Job’s blessings following his difficult test, <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:42:10-18:42:10" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Job 42:10</a> says: “And Jehovah began to give in addition all that had been Job’s, in double amount.”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Does not the expression “double amount” bring to mind great blessings for Job, even as the account goes on to describe? But think of the “double” blessing in the form of new pocket-size books that we received at the recent district assembly. We were delighted at the release of <em>Is This Life All There Is? </em>(<em>ts</em>) and looked forward to reading it ourselves and using it in the field service. Yet then our joy at the assembly was more than “doubled” when we got <em>God’s “Eternal Purpose” Now Triumphing for Man’s Good </em>(<em>po</em>) and learned that we will be studying it in the congregation book studies starting in December. What blessings!</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="ss"><strong><em>Special Talks</em></strong></p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">We also learned that during November and December we will have a series of special talks based on these new books. Many of us know from experience in past years how beneficial it is to cover new books quickly by means of such talks. It aids us rapidly to become familiar with their contents, or serves as a fine review if we have already read them. However, additional benefits will be ours in this case. We will be placing the <em>“Eternal Purpose” </em>book in the field service in November, and the <em>This Life </em>book along with the <em>New World Translation </em>during December. Hence, will not our covering the books in these talks stimulate our enthusiasm to share the publications with others? And will not this coverage also familiarize us with their contents so we can effectively present them to others?</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">True, you may not be one of the speakers handling these talks. By all means, though, plan to read ahead of time the chapters to be covered. Make the talks a part of your conversation. Enthusiastically invite your relatives and interested persons. Make sure they have personal copies of the books so they can follow along during the talks, just as you will be doing. Thus all will benefit fully.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="ss"><strong><em>Scheduling</em></strong></p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">As announced in the July <em>Kingdom Ministry, </em>if possible, the talks should be arranged for the nine weekends of November and December. The first five talks will be based on the <em>“Eternal Purpose” </em>book, followed by four from <em>Is This Life All There Is? </em>If the circuit overseer’s visit or a circuit assembly comes during that period, the series of talks should be arranged around these events.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">In some cases the elders (and certain ministerial servants) of a congregation will be able to handle all of the talks. If that does not seem possible or advisable, two congregations can exchange speakers who are elders, dividing the talks between the two. When this is the arrangement, an elder will give his talk in both congregations. This may involve one congregation’s having each talk a week after the same talk was given in the other congregation. But in working out the schedule, the nine talks should come in their proper sequence. As soon as details have been completed, handbills should be ordered. And the congregation should be informed exactly when they can expect the talks.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="ss"><strong><em>Speaker’s Preparation and Delivery</em></strong></p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">If you are to give one of the talks, thoroughly study the chapters assigned to you and the corresponding outline that follows. Note that you are not merely covering material​—you are to give an informative talk on a specific theme. Instead of trying to present every detail of the chapters assigned to you, strive to convey the main ideas highlighted in the outline. Be conscious of your audience, working to involve them; reason with them and motivate them. You may want to refer the audience to key passages or illustrations in the book so they can actually follow along in the book, becoming more familiar with its contents. Thus you will be multiplying the benefits.</p>

<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb"><em>Do you believe rebellion against God can succeed? </em>(5 min.) Rebellion is common. Sometimes on personal basis, as student against teacher. Often on national basis. Usually stern efforts are employed to deal with rebels. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:17:11-20:17:11" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Prov. 17:11</a>) But some succeed​—North American colonies against England. Could rebellion against God succeed? How would rebellion affect God’s purposes? How much confidence do you have in God’s accomplishing his purposes?</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb"><em>His purpose continued despite rebellion in heaven and on earth. </em>(15 min.) Original purpose was to populate earth with true worshipers. (P. 61, ¶21) God did not desire man to die. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:18:23-26:18:23" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Ezek. 18:23</a>; pp. 54, 55) Through serpent, an unseen spirit led Eve to rebel. (P. 57, read ¶11.) She followed course of that rebellious spirit. (P. 59, ¶16) In face of rebellion, did God abandon purpose? No. God’s sustaining of His purpose evident in allowing Adam and Eve to procreate. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:3:16-1:3:16" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Gen. 3:16</a>) Reinforced it by forming purpose to have anointed one who would crush Rebel.

<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb"><em>Examples of those who cooperated with God’s purpose. </em>(20 min.) Since first humans rebelled, how could God produce “seed”? Bible focuses on His doing so. (P. 65, ¶2) Did death of Abel thwart God’s purpose? No. Used Seth. (P. 66) Enoch stuck to God and his purpose even in face of danger to life. Would we? (Pp. 68-70, read ¶15.) Noah walked with God for centuries, not quitting. Do we show patient obedience? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:6:9-1:6:10" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Gen. 6:9, 10</a>; p. 71) Finally God brought Flood to cut short wickedness; showed he was in control. (Pp. 72, 73) By preserving Noah and family, God also preserved line of “seed.” (P. 75, ¶29; p. 77, read ¶35.) Wicked spirits still active. (P. 78, ¶38) Rebellion did not defeat God’s purpose; faithful ones stuck to it. (Pp. 79, 80)</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb"><em>History of “seed’s” line shows purpose was sustained. </em>(15 min.) Could Satan thwart purpose by preventing “seed’s” appearance? (P. 81 ¶1) Line was through Shem; blessing was in accord with Shem’s respect for God’s dealing. (P. 83) Centuries later God promised “seed” through Abraham. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:12:1-1:12:3" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Gen. 12:1-3</a>; p. 85) Isaac’s birth gave assurance God could produce “seed.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:3:15-1:3:15" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Gen. 3:15</a>; p. 87, ¶15) Melchizedek blessed Abraham; prefigured coming kingly “seed.” (Pp. 88, 89) Because of faith, Abraham was God’s “friend.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:41:8-23:41:8" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Isa. 41:8</a>; p. 90)</p>

<p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb"><em>God can irresistibly use a nation. </em>(5 min.) Nations now strive for power and full independence; have strong armies, powerful weapons. But does any nation have God’s approval, being used to accomplish His purpose? Could any nation resist his will? Answers affect our view of life and how we use it. Nebuchadnezzar was forced to acknowledge correct conclusion. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:4:34-27:4:35" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Dan. 4:34, 35</a>) God’s ability to choose irresistibly to use a nation is seen in Bible record.</p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb"><em>God himself would do choosing in working out purpose. </em>(15 min.) Had made covenant to bring “seed” through Abraham’s descendants. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:12:1-1:12:3" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Gen. 12:1-3,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:12:7-1:12:7" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> 7</a>) In selecting one of Isaac’s sons, God was not bound by right of firstborn. (Pp. 93, 94, read ¶4.) Choice of Jacob explains why Bible focuses on his line. (P. 95) Through which son would Messiah come? Again, God adapted to circumstances; selected Judah. (Pp. 96, 97, 100) Royal leadership not bound to firstborn. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:5:1-13:5:2" data-bid="21-1" class="b">1 Chron. 5:1, 2</a>; p. 101) Bible record aids in following progress of purpose; of interest, as our future is involved.</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:24:6-2:24:8" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Ex. 24:6-8</a>; p. 113) If they kept Law flawlessly, could gain life.

(P. 116)</p>
<p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb"><em>From this nation God chose line of kings leading to “seed.” </em>(15 min.) God allowed time for nation to be guided by judges. (Pp. 120-122) Saul of tribe of Benjamin selected as king. Was God abandoning stated will about Judah? No. When Saul went bad, God chose David of Judah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:13:13-9:13:14" data-bid="25-1" class="b">1 Sam. 13:13, 14</a>; p. 123) After being selected, David waited on God to become ruler of whole nation.

When Israel given choice between life and death, chose correctly.

<p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="sb"><em>Heaven involved in appearance of Messiah of God’s purpose. </em>(25 min.) Coming of Anointed One was important in accomplishing God’s purpose.

But in other ways heaven was involved, supporting Messiahship. Angels communicated with Mary and Joseph before His birth, highlighting role as king and Messianic sin-remover.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sa">It is already being done despite racial conflicts the world over.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">This remarkable feat has been possible as a result of the liberating Bible truths published in <em>The Watchtower. </em>These truths have helped multitudes to transform their minds from the racially divisive thinking they had.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The demand for <em>The Watchtower </em>continues to grow at a time when many other magazines are either suspending publication or cutting down on the number printed. The circulation of <em>The Watchtower </em>now far exceeds that of many popular news magazines. Read it and see for yourself why it is in such demand. For only $1.50 you can receive it twice a month for a year.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">I would like to receive by mail <em>The Watchtower, </em>for which I am enclosing $1.50. Also send me the three gift booklets <em>“Look! I Am Making All Things New,” God’s Way Is Love </em>and <em>Divine Victory​—Its Meaning for Distressed Humanity.</em></p>

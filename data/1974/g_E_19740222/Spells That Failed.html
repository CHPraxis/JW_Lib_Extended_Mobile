<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">‚óè In Nigeria a witness of Jehovah was threatened by a witch doctor with death if he did not leave town. The Witness stayed. After the witch doctor cast a spell, people waited for the Witness to die. The spell failed, and a more powerful witch doctor was called in. He also failed. Then the most powerful witch doctor in the province was called in. When he too failed, he went to the Witness and, in effect, begged for mercy.</p>

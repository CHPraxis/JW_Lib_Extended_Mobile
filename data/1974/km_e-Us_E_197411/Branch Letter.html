<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sh">Dear Kingdom Publishers:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The figures are now in, and indeed this past service year has had Jehovah’s blessing. The number of publishers in the United States increased 15 percent; that means, on an average, 66,878 more praisers of Jehovah. This, in turn, made necessary 483 additional congregations, for a total of 6,542 just in this country. The tremendous increase is also reflected in the number baptized. There was an all-time record of 81,588 persons immersed this past year! Just think​—that is more than the annual figure for the whole world just seven years ago. It certainly makes us rejoice to see so many persons get started on the way that leads to real life.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">These newer ones, along with the rest of us, will find the <em>1975 Yearbook </em>fascinating. Many who have joined us in Jehovah’s service in recent years, while deeply appreciating the truth, have not read much about the actual development of the modern-day organization of Jehovah’s witnesses. But the details are in the new <em>Yearbook. </em>It focuses on the development of the work here in the United States and is the most complete and comprehensive account yet written on the work of Jehovah’s witnesses in modern times.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">We suggest that you order extra copies of the <em>1975 Yearbook. </em>Providing copies of it for your relatives, neighbors and acquaintances may prove to be a good way to help them to learn the facts about Jehovah’s witnesses. Even though they might not read other publications about our beliefs, they might be very interested in this. It is an official account of the organization, its development and growth for the past one hundred years.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Ever since the hurricane that slammed into the Central American country of Honduras in mid-September, leaving between 7,500 and 8,000 persons dead according to newspaper reports, we have had many inquiries about the welfare of our brothers there. A few days after the storm we here at Bethel got the news that, although hundreds of our brothers lost their possessions, not one of them had lost his life. In short order brothers in nearby Nicaragua and Belize, as well as here in New York and in New Orleans, had relief supplies on their way to the brothers in Honduras. All together, within a very short time some 56,700 pounds of relief supplies were sent, in addition to thousands of dollars for the purchase of supplies locally. Isn’t it a blessing to be part of an organization in which there is real love for one another?</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Soon all who live will be people of that sort. As we confidently await the coming divine victory, let’s keep busy aiding all who have a love for righteousness to take their stand on Jehovah’s side. We send you our warm love.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sj">Your brothers,</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Have you read the recent issues of <em>The Watchtower </em>carefully? If so, you will doubtless recall these points:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn"><strong>● What was the purpose of Jesus’ transfiguration?</strong></p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">It served to show that Jesus’ presence in Kingdom power would be a glorious heavenly one. The visionary appearance of Moses and Elijah (with Moses representing the Law, and Elijah the prophets) in connection with the transfiguration revealed that both the Law and the prophets foretold Christ.​—P. 297.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span></p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn"><strong>● What is absolutely essential for one to be an approachable person?</strong></p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">The main thing is sincere, genuine interest in other people, coupled with due humility.​—Pp. 367, 368.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sn"><strong>● Why, as </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:18:11-20:18:11" data-bid="1-1" class="b"><strong>Proverbs 18:11</strong></a> <strong>says, are valuables “a protective wall” in the “imagination” of the rich?</strong></p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Valuables can give protection. But to view their ability to protect as unlimited is only imagination. They cannot secure good health, happy family life and other vital needs.​—P. 419.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sn"><strong>● What is involved in treating an unrepentant sinner as a “man of the nations and as a tax collector”?​—</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:18:17-40:18:17" data-bid="2-1" class="b"><strong>Matt. 18:17</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">True Christians would not fraternize with one who has been expelled from the congregation. But they would still show such ones common courtesy and consideration. And especially the elders in the congregation would be concerned about helping those who abandon any practice of gross sin and show a desire again to become a part of the congregation.​—Pp. 464, 472.</p>

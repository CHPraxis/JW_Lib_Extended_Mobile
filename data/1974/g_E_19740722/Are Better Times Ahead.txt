Are Better Times Ahead?
Man’s promises of better times never seem to materialize. Bad news all too often overshadows the good. Is there reason to believe that the desire for better times will ever be satisfied?
Awake! magazine provides an optimistic outlook. It peers behind the news and sees sound reasons for confidence that better times really are ahead. And, of special value, Awake! shows what you and your family can do to benefit yourselves.

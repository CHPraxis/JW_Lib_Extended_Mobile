<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"><strong>● What factors should be considered if you are thinking about moving to serve where the need is greater?</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Much good has been accomplished by publishers who, with a desire to serve Jehovah whole-souled, have offered themselves for such work. And there still are areas where there is considerable need for zealous publishers.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Of course, not everyone’s circumstances are the best for this sort of work. Congregations needing assistance usually are small, located in less populated areas and have few theocratically experienced brothers. So, if you have just recently been baptized, it might be wise to stay with a larger congregation until you gain sufficient experience. If you are experiencing some serious personal problem or are under some restriction by a judicial committee, it would be beneficial to stay where you can get the spiritual help you need. Young persons may encounter problems if they are in an isolated area without the guidance and assistance of their parents or some older person. And a brother with a large family to support may find it difficult to care for that responsibility if he moves into an economically depressed area. Before deciding to move, it is good to consider factors such as these that have a bearing on one’s spiritual condition.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">If you believe that your circumstances are suitable for a move, then talk it over with your family, also the elders in your congregation, realistically analyzing your reasons to be sure you are prompted by a desire to do more in Jehovah’s service. A long move may not be necessary; consult with your circuit overseer about the needs in your own area. If you wish, write the branch office for suggestions, making sure to provide us with all the information requested in the “Organization” book on page 135.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">When you decide on a location, it would be wise to visit the area to get some idea about the climate and to get acquainted with the brothers. You can inquire about school facilities, and investigate opportunities for housing and employment. If you find that you truly will be able to do more in Jehovah’s service by making the move, then by all means do so, with full trust in Jehovah. But if, even at this point, such a move does not seem wise, remember that there is much that you can do in Jehovah’s service where you are right now.</p>

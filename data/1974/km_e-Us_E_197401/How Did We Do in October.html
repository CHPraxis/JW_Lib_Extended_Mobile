<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">There was an 8.1 percent increase over last year’s average number of publishers, and that is fine! It is true that many who shared in tract work in September were not out again in October. They have shown a desire to serve Jehovah, but now they need encouragement to follow through.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The total of subscriptions obtained was down somewhat. But there was a fine new peak in number of regular pioneers; it is good to see that 814 more arranged their affairs to get into this branch of full-time service. Also, magazine placements, return visits and home Bible studies all showed fine increases.</p>

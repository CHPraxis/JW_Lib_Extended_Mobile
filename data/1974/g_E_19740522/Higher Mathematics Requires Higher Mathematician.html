<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">■ No one believes that complicated mathematical formulas evolved without the intelligence of a mathematician. They would never be attributed to a chance coordination of chalk molecules on a blackboard. Then what of the fantastic mathematical precision found in the universe? A professor of mathematics from the University of Cambridge, P. Dirac, said, in the magazine <em>Scientific American:</em></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“It seems to be one of the fundamental features of nature that fundamental physical laws are described in terms of a mathematical theory of great beauty and power, needing quite a high standard of mathematics for one to understand it. . . . One could perhaps describe the situation by saying that God is a mathematician of a very high order, and He used very advanced mathematics in constructing the universe.”</p>

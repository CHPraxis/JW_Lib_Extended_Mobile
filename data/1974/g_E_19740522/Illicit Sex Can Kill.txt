Illicit Sex Can Kill
● Illicit sex relations can be deadly to a person with heart trouble. According to Dr. Lenore R. Zohman, sex relations between a husband and wife are “no more strenuous than climbing two flights of stairs or a rapid walk down the street.” But illicit sex places a heavy strain on the heart because of the emotional stress resulting from a guilty conscience as well as anxiety over the quality of performance. A Japanese study showed that eight out of ten sudden deaths that occurred during sex relations involved illicit sex.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">HAVE you noticed that a common trait of young people is their desire to act and believe like the majority of other young people? This is often manifested in the type of music they listen to or in their styles of clothing. How refreshing it is, though, when a young person is willing to be different if there is valid reason for it!</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">At an assembly of Jehovah’s witnesses in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada, a sixteen-year-old Witness related what occurred when she did not concur with the majority of students in her school who accepted the teaching of evolution as presented to them. She explained:</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“Evolution is a major theory in the study of biology. My teacher gave us an assignment to write an essay on any subject at all, as long as it was about biology. I decided to write an involved study of evolution, but <em>disproving </em>it, using the Bible. I wrote a twenty-four-page essay entitled ‘Evolution: Is It Really the Story of Life?’”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">What was the result? How would the teacher react, since he strongly believed in evolution? Would he evaluate the logical and Scriptural reasons with an open mind? On the front page of the essay he wrote this comment:</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">“An excellent piece of work! You have spent a great deal of time and put much effort and thinking into this essay. It puts forth a good argument for your beliefs. To me, [it is] quite refreshing to read the logic and thinking of one who is willing to say what she thinks, even if it is a ‘minority’ opinion.”</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">This was not a matter of being different just to attract attention or because of being ornery. There was valid reason for taking exception to the belief of the majority. And when such is the case, truly it is “quite refreshing” for one to be willing to hold “a ‘minority’ opinion.”</p>

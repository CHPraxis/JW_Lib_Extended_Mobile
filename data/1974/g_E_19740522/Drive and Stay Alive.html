<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">◆ Heavy summertime driving nears. That will mean vacation pleasure for many; but, undoubtedly, in many lands, death for others. Last year 56,000 people died on United States highways alone, and more than two million were injured. Damages were in excess of 20 billion dollars. Can this be brought down?

Electric Energy Sparks A Nation
Whose power sustains the universe?
Shortages of electricity cause inconveniences. But our very life is dependent upon the Creator, who energizes this tremendous universe.
How can we best become acquainted with him?
A valuable help is the book “All Scripture Is Inspired of God and Beneficial.” It enables you to examine the evidence that Almighty God, the Creator and Sustainer of the universe, is also the Author of the Bible.
Read this informative book. It contains 78 chapters, including one on each of the 66 books of the Bible. Hardbound; 352 pages the same size as this magazine. Only $1.
Please send “All Scripture Is Inspired of God and Beneficial.” I am enclosing $1.

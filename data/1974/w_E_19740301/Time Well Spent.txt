Time Well Spent
● Jehovah’s Christian witnesses appreciate that true worship is valuable. It has given them real joy and a purpose in living. That is why they are eager to use time well in telling others about their Bible-based beliefs.
Take the example of one of Jehovah’s witnesses in the state of Minnesota. One night he was working with another man on a power shovel. Since it was very stormy that night, the two men spent a lot of time in the truck warming up and drying off. During the course of the evening’s work the conversation swung toward religion. After answering his fellow worker’s question about what Jehovah’s witnesses do about charity, the Witness mentioned the home Bible study arrangement and said: “That’s something you should take advantage of. It doesn’t cost anything and we could have it in your own home at a time convenient to you.” The fellow worker replied: “You know, I’ve been thinking about that. When could you come over?”
What was the result of time well spent in upbuilding conversation about the Bible? Both the fellow worker and his wife progressed to the point of themselves helping others to gain a knowledge of God’s Word as dedicated, baptized witnesses of Jehovah.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"><strong>● Does the <em>por·neiʹa </em>(gross sexual immorality) mentioned in the Bible include masturbation, making masturbation a valid basis for Scriptural divorce?​—Ecuador.</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The Bible does not mention masturbation or self-abuse, and there is no indication that the Greek word <em>por·neiʹa </em>included this practice.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Masturbation is definitely an unclean habit. This is evident from the fact that, according to the Mosaic law, even an involuntary emission of semen made a man ceremonially unclean until the evening. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:15:16-3:15:16" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Lev. 15:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:23:10-5:23:11" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Deut. 23:10, 11</a>) This being the case, a deliberately induced emission of semen through masturbation would have been a greater uncleanness. But it was not as serious as the gross sexual immorality designated by the Greek word <em>por·neiʹa. </em>For example, adultery, homosexuality and bestiality (different forms of <em>por·neiʹa</em>) were capital offenses under the Law and therefore paved the way for the surviving mate to remarry. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:20:10-3:20:10" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Lev. 20:10,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:20:13-3:20:13" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 13,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:20:15-3:20:16" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> 15, 16</a>) But we can point to no evidence indicating that this was true of masturbation.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Nevertheless, the Bible speaks out strongly against unclean practices. The inspired apostle Paul wrote to fellow believers: “God called us, not with allowance for uncleanness, but in connection with sanctification.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/52:4:7-52:4:7" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Thess. 4:7</a>) Hence, the Christian should strive hard to avoid any unclean habits, including masturbation.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span></p>

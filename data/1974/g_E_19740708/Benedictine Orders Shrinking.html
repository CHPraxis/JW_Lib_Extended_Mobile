<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">● Throughout the world there are some 600 communities of Benedictine monks and nuns. Now this order of the Roman Catholic Church finds itself in a period of sharp decline. <em>Newsweek </em>comments: “Like other orders, they are losing 10 per cent of their priests and sisters every year and are finding replacements hard to attract.

Read The Bible with Your Family in Modern-Day Language
Do you want your family to enjoy Bible reading? The vigorous, expressive language of The Bible in Living English has delighted many. “I can forget I’m reading and just live alongside the characters, and so absorb more of the background,” one reader writes.
This easy-to-understand Bible was translated by Steven T. Byington and published in 1972. It has large print, marginal notes and a dark-blue, hard cover with gold-embossed title; 1,598 pages. Only $6, postpaid.

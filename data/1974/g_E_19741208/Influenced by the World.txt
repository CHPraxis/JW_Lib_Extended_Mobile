Influenced by the World
The world​—not the Church—​is more influential in the lives of many Catholics. So the United States National Conference of Catholic Bishops notes: “At the very least, many would say that for a large number of Catholics, the influence of secular society​—and all that implies, for good as well as ill—​counts more heavily than the influence of the Church.”

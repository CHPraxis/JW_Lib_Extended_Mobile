<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">● At times a person’s situation may look hopeless. Yet the prayers of honest-hearted ones have led to their finding joy in true worship. A woman from Chicago, Illinois, relates:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“My husband began to drink heavily and, under the influence of alcohol, he began to beat me and the children. Things got so bad that I thought I was going to lose my mind. One day while I was very depressed, I prayed to God, saying: ‘O God, please help me, because I’m about to lose my mind.’”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">That same week Jehovah’s witnesses called on her, but, thinking they were fanatical, she turned them away. Later, however, this woman obtained one of their Bible study aids, <em>“Things in Which It Is Impossible for God to Lie.” </em>She read it in one night and recognized it to be the truth. Seeing the woman Witness who had left her the book, on the street, she asked her to call. This led to her becoming a baptized witness of Jehovah. But for a number of years thereafter she experienced physical and mental abuse from her husband. All during this time she continued praying to God for strength. Finally, through her fine example in Christian conduct, her husband began to change. Now the whole family is united in true worship.</p>

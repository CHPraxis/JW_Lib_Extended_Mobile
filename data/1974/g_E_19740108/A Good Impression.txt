A Good Impression
PARENTS know how “impressionable” young children are. Some of the experiences they have may seem quite minor to adults. Yet from these experiences in childhood young people can learn lessons that will last throughout their life.
Some Christian at a district assembly of Jehovah’s witnesses in San Antonio, Texas, helped to provide just such a lesson​—in honesty—​for a ten-year-old lad. This young boy was attending the assembly with his parents and, after the end of the day’s sessions, walked with them through an amusement park section of the “Hemisphere” on their way to their motel. Not long thereafter, the Watch Tower Society received the following letter from this youngster:
“I appreciated the ‘Divine Name’ District Assembly. The departments were run very well. Something strange happened while I was going to the motel. My new wallet fell out of my pocket. I was very upset. My wallet contained 3 dollars and my library card. We went to San Antonio and walked the whole hemisphere grounds. The next day I checked at the Lost and Found Department at the assembly. It wasn’t there. I checked about 30 minutes later. I checked again. There it was. . . .
“May Jehovah Be With You.
[Signed]”
How fine it is when an individual by manifesting Christianity can provide such a lesson in honesty for a youngster!

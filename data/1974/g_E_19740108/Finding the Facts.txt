Finding the Facts
What was life like in early Bible times? What did people eat, drink and wear? What did they do for entertainment? In what kind of homes did they live? Do you know?
Factual answers to these and hundreds of similar questions are found in the 1,700-page alphabetical reference work Aid to Bible Understanding. Its publishers have endeavored to discuss every person, place, plant, river and animal mentioned in the Bible, as well as notable events and the record of Godâ€™s dealings with men.

<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Jehovah rightly requires exclusive devotion; we cannot compromise his righteous principles and still serve him.

<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">Vital that we have deep appreciation for our brothers. Proper view will help when times are difficult. Jesus said “All you are brothers.” He said genuine Christians would manifest genuine love for one another. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:23:8-40:23:8" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Matt. 23:8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:13:35-43:13:35" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> John 13:35</a>) Ask audience: (1) Though brother may speak unkindly or not agree with us on some matter, why should we not hastily view him as an enemy? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:3:23-45:3:23" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Rom. 3:23;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:2:13-59:2:13" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> Jas. 2:13</a>; “yb,” pp. 174, 175) (2) Some, out of weakness, may fail to maintain integrity under severe pressure. Does this necessarily mean that such ones are our enemies? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:26:69-40:26:75" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Matt. 26:69-75;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:6:1-48:6:1" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> Gal. 6:1</a>: “yb,” p. 178, par. 3; p. 168, par. 2) (3) What will identify one who professes to be a brother as false to that claim? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:26:14-40:26:16" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Matt. 26:14-16,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:26:48-40:26:49" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> 48, 49;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/65:1:4-65:1:4" data-bid="10-3" class="b"> Jude 4,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/65:1:8-65:1:8" data-bid="10-4" class="b"> 8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:2:1-61:2:1" data-bid="10-5" class="b"> 2 Pet. 2:1</a>) (4) During time of intense persecution, how has Satan used some who professed to be Christian brothers? (“yb,” pp. 53, 148, 178, 179) (5) Why might the enemy want to give us the impression that some of our brothers had betrayed us? So how should we view charges heard from such a source? (“yb,” p. 231; <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:144:11-19:144:11" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Ps. 144:11</a>) (6) If a brother does prove false, how should we view our other brothers? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:1:22-60:1:22" data-bid="12-1" class="b">1 Pet. 1:22;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:4:7-62:4:7" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> 1 John 4:7,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:4:20-62:4:21" data-bid="12-3" class="b"> 20, 21</a>) (7) How can we guard ourselves so that we do not betray our brothers?​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:22:19-20:22:19" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Prov. 22:19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:10:28-40:10:28" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> Matt. 10:28;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:20:24-44:20:24" data-bid="13-3" class="b"> Acts 20:24</a>; “yb.” p. 210, par. 2; p. 175, par. 4 to p. 176, par. 2.</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">Our brotherhood is a gift from Jehovah. We love our brothers. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:3:14-62:3:14" data-bid="14-1" class="b">1 John 3:14</a>) Do not let the enemy destroy your confidence in your faithful brothers. As to God’s faithful people, we reflect Paul’s spirit as expressed at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/53:1:3-53:1:3" data-bid="15-1" class="b">2 Thessalonians 1:3</a>.</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sn"><strong>10 min: </strong>Reporting Our Field Service. Distribute a Publisher’s Field Service Report slip and a Bible Study Report slip to each one in attendance. Remind them that this is the time to turn in their reports for the month. Discuss problems that have been observed locally in the use of these report slips. (For example, even literature that is left at a not-at-home is to be counted; save fractions of hours until there is a full hour to report; include time used in informal witnessing; what to count as a return visit; how to report home Bible studies.) Comment briefly on why we turn in reports.</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sn"><strong>10 min: </strong>Concluding comments. Build up enthusiasm for the distribution of Kingdom News No. 18.

<p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sn"><strong>10 min: </strong>“‘What is the Bible’s View?” There is a wealth of material in “Awake!” articles bearing this heading. Each one provides a concise treatment of a Bible subject that may be just what is needed to reach someone you have contacted in field ministry, someone you work with, go to school with, a relative or a neighbor. List subjects covered in recent months. Demonstrate father talking with son on challenge son faces in school on loose morals.

<p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sn"><strong>15 min: </strong>Offering the Book “God’s Kingdom of a Thousand Years Has Approached.”</p>
<p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="sb">Discuss use of the Bible in house-to-house ministry. In distributing tracts and in placing magazines we use brief presentations. These activities serve a good purpose. Also beneficial to endeavor to draw people into conversation, to discuss points from the Bible. Many new publishers may never have done this; it is not difficult; we encourage you to learn.</p>
<p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="sb">Several publishers on platform discuss and demonstrate how to draw householder into conversation, and then read just one or two verses from the Bible. (Keep it simple.) Offer “God’s Kingdom of a Thousand Years Has Approached.” (Use ideas from October 1973 “Kingdom Ministry.”)</p>
<p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="sn"><strong>15 min: </strong>“<a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:201974126/">Presenting the Good News​—Developing Interest on Return Visits</a>.” Talk on material, including some audience participation, and handled possibly by Bible study overseer.</p>

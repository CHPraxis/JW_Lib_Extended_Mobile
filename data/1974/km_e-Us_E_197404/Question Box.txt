Question Box
‚óè Is there a way to reach prison inmates to witness to them?
Many requests come to the Society each week from prison inmates asking for literature and requesting that someone conduct a Bible study with them. To help such persons, the Society writes the local congregation and asks that the interested person be contacted in the prison. It would be appreciated if prompt attention would be given to these calls. Literature can, in some cases, be given directly to the prisoner by those calling, but in some prisons it is required that the literature be sent directly from the publishing house. Where the prisoner cannot afford a contribution, the congregation or the individual publisher may provide the contribution to cover the cost and ask the Society to send the literature.
In some localities it has been possible, after discussing our Bible educational program with the prison officials or with government officials who have jurisdiction over prison matters, to obtain a permit that will actually allow one to go from cell to cell in the prison to talk with the inmates, leaving literature where possible. Older magazines may be left free with the inmates, if the prison officials permit, and then, as interest is developed, books or subscriptions may be placed and Bible studies started.
If there is a prison in your territory, it is recommended that the congregation arrange for an elder to visit the prison officials to find out what may be required to contact the prisoners and to provide Bible literature for them to read and, if at all possible, to conduct Bible studies with them on either a group or an individual basis.

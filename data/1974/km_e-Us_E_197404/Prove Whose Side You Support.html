<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sa">Kingdom News No. 18 Stresses the Issue</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>How long have you been serving Jehovah? A few of us may say, “More than thirty years,” others, “Fifteen years.” But did you realize that fully one third of Jehovah’s witnesses in the United States​—about 175,000—​would say, “Less than five years”?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>Is it not a thrill to see so many taking their stand on Jehovah’s side? And no matter how long we have been supporting God’s government, are we not delighted to have ceased being vessels for Satan’s use and to have become vessels useful to our rightful owner, Jehovah God?​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:2:21-55:2:21" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Tim. 2:21</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>What helped you to take your stand on Jehovah’s side so as to be useful to Him? It was getting an understanding of the Bible, was it not? Often the starting point is reading <em>The Watchtower. </em>As you continued to read <em>The Watchtower, </em>you appreciated it more and more. Has that appreciation been moving you to be enthusiastic about offering <em>Watchtower </em>subscriptions to others?</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>Perhaps, though, despite your efforts, you have not placed even one subscription during the campaign. Have you thought about sending a gift subscription?</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>In Germany a woman and her daughter came to the <em>Watchtower </em>study for the first time. It was learned that a relative had sent the mother a gift subscription, and by reading the magazines she learned that she had only a short time left to become acquainted with the truth. She came to the Kingdom Hall to see if there was still the possibility of having a Bible study.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup>Do you have a relative, acquaintance or work associate that you feel would benefit from having a <em>Watchtower </em>subscription? If so, why not subscribe for that person during April. When submitting a gift subscription, be sure to mark “Gift” on the upper right-hand corner of the subscription slip, and print your name clearly on the bottom of the slip as the giver.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb"><sup>7 </sup>As you know, we have some fine special issues of the magazines for distribution in April. No doubt you are already making good use of some of them. Have you considered that persons with whom you are studying may enjoy the privilege of helping you to distribute the very timely information in these magazines? First, review the requirements for new publishers, as set out on page 129 of the <em>Organization </em>book, to be sure that they qualify. Then, why not ask them to go with you in the magazine work? April is a good time to get them started. Then, during May, they will no doubt want to have a part in giving out that exciting new <em>Kingdom News, </em>No. 18.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="ss"><strong>DISTRIBUTION OF KINGDOM NEWS NO. 18</strong></p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb"><sup>8 </sup>The title of the new tract clearly presents the issue facing all mankind today​—“Government by God—​Are You for It or Against It?” We know what our choice is. We are for God’s government both now and forever! This is the agency that will vindicate Jehovah’s name, and there is no other government that can satisfy mankind’s desire for true peace and security. We know that, and <em>Kingdom </em><span id="page3" class="pageNum" data-no="3" data-before-text="3"></span><em>News </em>No. 18 provides a marvelous opportunity to show both Jehovah and fellow humans where we personally stand as to this great issue.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb"><sup>9 </sup>And think of the fine results that can be expected. Some who have studied the Bible with us may now be moved to take a definite step to show their decision by sharing with us in this special work. Others, who have in the past listened to us, may now be aided to see the urgency of the matter and so may want to start studying or may come to the Kingdom Hall. Surely, then, all of us who love God’s government will want to have the fullest share possible in distributing <em>Kingdom News </em>No. 18!</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb"><sup>10 </sup>Keep in mind the time for this work​—it is May 3 through 12. Each congregation will be consigned tracts at the rate of 100 for each publisher who reported field service in December. If more publishers are now sharing in the work, the supplies can be divided up accordingly. Feel a personal responsibility to distribute your share.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb"><sup>11 </sup>But what will we say? As when presenting the previous issues of <em>Kingdom News, </em>we should be brief. We can simply say: “I’m sharing in distributing an important message. We are leaving one, free, in every home. This is your copy.” Or: “I am calling to present you with a message that deals with an issue that is especially vital in our day. It is free. Please read it.” It is best to place the tract in the householder’s hand as you speak. Also, leave a copy for each household where no one is at home; but the tracts are not meant for general distribution on the streets.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb"><sup>12 </sup>In many ways we can prove that we really do support God’s government. May offers a special opportunity to do so. Do not miss out. Share fully in the distribution of <em>Kingdom News </em>No. 18.</p>

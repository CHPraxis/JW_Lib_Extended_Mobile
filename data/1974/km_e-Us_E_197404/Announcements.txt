◆ Literature offer for April: One-year subscription for The Watchtower, along with three booklets, for $1.50, or subscriptions for both The Watchtower and Awake!, with six booklets, for $3.00. May: The book God’s Kingdom of a Thousand Years Has Approached with a booklet, on a contribution of 50c. If this book is not available, you may offer any other 50c book. From May 3 through 12 we will distribute Kingdom News No. 18. June: New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures along with the book True Peace and Security​—From What Source?, for $1.25. July: True Peace and Security​—From What Source? for 25c.
◆ It is suggested that congregations of 75 or more publishers include in their stock of literature on hand at least two copies of the large-print New World Translation, also Aid to Bible Understanding and the Concordance. Based on your record of the number of these publications that were actually taken from the literature room during the last six months, it would be well to order a six-month supply. If you do it now, they will be available for the publishers for their use in the field ministry during June. A covering remittance should be submitted with your order.
◆ Regular pioneers who were appointed on or before February 1, 1974, will be sent a cafeteria ticket for use at a district assembly during this service year. These will be sent to the presiding overseer along with the monthly statement for May. Pioneers, be sure to bring your cafeteria ticket to the assembly and treat it as cash; no replacements will be available.
◆ It will be a great help to the Society if all publishers and pioneers with congregations will order literature, magazines and subscriptions through the congregation rather than direct from the Society.
◆ Out of Stock in U.S.A.:
The Truth That Leads to Eternal Life​—Siamese
Is the Bible Really the Word of God?​—Chinese

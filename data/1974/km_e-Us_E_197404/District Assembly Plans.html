<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>You are undoubtedly looking forward with eagerness to attending one of the 1974 district assemblies as listed in the February 1, 1974, <em>Watchtower. </em>Those shown as tentative are now definite as listed, with the exception of the two assemblies planned for Springfield, Massachusetts, June 27-30 and July 4-7. These have now been replaced by second assemblies at both Utica, New York, and Pawtucket, Rhode Island, on July 4-7.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>In some cases it is necessary to balance the size of the crowd with the seating facilities available by suggesting that certain circuits attend a particular assembly even though another one may be slightly closer. We would like to recommend that, if possible, all of Kansas Circuit 2 attend at Oklahoma City (July 4-7) instead of at Tulsa and that Ohio Circuits 1 and 10 attend at Pittsburgh (July 25-28) instead of at Detroit. Also, we suggest that the circuits in the San Diego-Los Angeles area attend as follows:</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="se">July 4-7: San Diego, Calif.: Calif. 1, 2, 3, 4, 16, 20, 28, 30, 31, 33.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="se">July 25-28: Los Angeles, Calif.: Calif. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 17, 21, 24, 25, 32.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>This year there are a number of cities where two assemblies are being held in succession and so we are recommending that the brothers in the circuits listed here attend during the particular week indicated, to the extent possible, to assure adequate seating for everyone:</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="se">June 20-23:</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sk">Laurel, Md.: Md. 1, 2, 3; Va. 4.</p>

<p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sn">In all other cases, we recommend that, where possible, you attend the assembly nearest to you.</p>
<p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>ROOMING: In ample time the Society will send a supply of Room Request forms to each congregation, on which will be printed the address of the rooming headquarters for each assembly. Please fill out the form very carefully and mail it directly to the assembly city (<em>not to the Society</em>), doing so no earlier than six weeks ahead of the date of the assembly you have selected. If you receive a rooming assignment and later have to change your plans and cannot accept it, please send word (1) to the name and address on your assignment card and (2) to the convention rooming department so that the room may be reassigned.</p>
<p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>VOLUNTEER SERVICE: There is much work to be done at each assembly to care for the needs of our brothers, yet many volunteers make the work light and joyful. Why not plan to volunteer as individuals and family groups? Fill out Volunteer Service applications, giving the completed forms to your presiding overseer for him to sign and forward to the convention city (<em>not to the Society</em>). If you later find that you are unable to serve <span id="page4" class="pageNum" data-no="4" data-before-text="4"></span>in your assignment, please advise the volunteer service department at the assembly city of the change.</p>
<p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup>FIELD SERVICE: Starting the weekend prior to each assembly and on until the day before the program begins, there will be a concerted effort made in and around the assembly city to invite the public to attend the entire program. Millions of handbills are being printed for special house-to-house distribution. Publishers living in assembly cities and nearby will be invited to share. If you plan to travel from out-of-town to an assembly, could you arrange to arrive a day or two early to share in this work? If so, request your rooming accommodations accordingly. And, on arrival at the assembly city, go to the address of the rooming department for territory and handbill supplies.</p>
<p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="sb"><sup>7 </sup>We warmly encourage you to plan now to attend all four days of the 1974 district assembly.</p>

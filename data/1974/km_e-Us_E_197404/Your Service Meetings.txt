Your Service Meetings
WEEK STARTING APRIL 14
12 min: Song 51. Introduction, with very brief comments on text. Discuss how to offer special “Watchtower” and “Awake!” in field ministry.
 3 min: Accounts report, if not previously presented.
15 min: “Prove Whose Side You Support.” Question-and-answer coverage of paragraphs 1-7 of article. Include experiences from audience as to how and when they have obtained subscriptions; especially emphasize the sending of gift subscriptions. Discuss, too, aiding new ones who qualify to share in the field ministry during April. Include comments that are directed to these potential praisers of Jehovah; many of them will be there in the audience.
20 min: Overcoming Efforts to Make Us Compromise. After brief introductory comments, draw audience into discussion, using questions provided. Apportion material carefully so that all the scriptures are considered and so that some experiences are covered from each of the numbered sections.
Invite brief comments on the following scriptures as to what they show that we as Christians are to do and what we should avoid in our contacts with the world. (1) Romans 13:1, 7; Acts 5:29; (2) 1 Peter 2:17, compare it with Acts 12:21-23 and Matthew 4:10; (3) John 6:15; James 4:4; Revelation 14:9, 10, 12; (4) Isaiah 2:4 and Matthew 22:39.
Have prepared publishers relate the following “1974 Yearbook” experiences, taking some from each section as time permits. Ask audience to point out how the scriptures already discussed show the Christian course to follow under such circumstances: (1) “yb,” p. 133, pars. 2-4; p. 136, par. 4 to 137, par. 1; (2) “yb,” p. 118, par. 1; (3) “yb,” p. 115, par. 4 to p. 117, par. 2; (4) “yb,” p. 187, par. 3; p. 189, par. 4; p. 204, par. 3.
Jehovah rightly requires exclusive devotion; we cannot compromise his righteous principles and still serve him. He will help us to be faithful if that is what truly is in our hearts. So determined were brothers in Germany to obey Jehovah that even when in concentration camps they openly witnessed despite threats of opposers.​—“yb,” p. 203, pars. 1, 2.
10 min: Concluding comments. Earnestly discuss what the Branch Letter says about the need for workers at Bethel. In preparation for the meeting next week, encourage all to study carefully the March 1, 1974, “Watchtower” article on prayer. Song 62.

25 min: If Brothers Prove False. After brief introductory remarks, draw remaining points from audience with questions. Have some publishers prepared to relate experiences from “1974 Yearbook.”
Vital that we have deep appreciation for our brothers. Proper view will help when times are difficult. Jesus said “All you are brothers.” He said genuine Christians would manifest genuine love for one another. (Matt. 23:8; John 13:35) Ask audience: (1) Though brother may speak unkindly or not agree with us on some matter, why should we not hastily view him as an enemy? (Rom. 3:23; Jas. 2:13; “yb,” pp. 174, 175) (2) Some, out of weakness, may fail to maintain integrity under severe pressure. Does this necessarily mean that such ones are our enemies? (Matt. 26:69-75; Gal. 6:1: “yb,” p. 178, par. 3; p. 168, par. 2) (3) What will identify one who professes to be a brother as false to that claim? (Matt. 26:14-16, 48, 49; Jude 4, 8; 2 Pet. 2:1) (4) During time of intense persecution, how has Satan used some who professed to be Christian brothers? (“yb,” pp. 53, 148, 178, 179) (5) Why might the enemy want to give us the impression that some of our brothers had betrayed us? So how should we view charges heard from such a source? (“yb,” p. 231; Ps. 144:11) (6) If a brother does prove false, how should we view our other brothers? (1 Pet. 1:22; 1 John 4:7, 20, 21) (7) How can we guard ourselves so that we do not betray our brothers?​—Prov. 22:19; Matt. 10:28; Acts 20:24; “yb.” p. 210, par. 2; p. 175, par. 4 to p. 176, par. 2.
Our brotherhood is a gift from Jehovah. We love our brothers. (1 John 3:14) Do not let the enemy destroy your confidence in your faithful brothers. As to God’s faithful people, we reflect Paul’s spirit as expressed at 2 Thessalonians 1:3.
10 min: Reporting Our Field Service. Distribute a Publisher’s Field Service Report slip and a Bible Study Report slip to each one in attendance. Remind them that this is the time to turn in their reports for the month. Discuss problems that have been observed locally in the use of these report slips. (For example, even literature that is left at a not-at-home is to be counted; save fractions of hours until there is a full hour to report; include time used in informal witnessing; what to count as a return visit; how to report home Bible studies.) Comment briefly on why we turn in reports.
10 min: Concluding comments. Build up enthusiasm for the distribution of Kingdom News No. 18. Encourage all to participate early; remind them that the work is to be completed by May 12. If any realize that they will be unable to distribute their complete allotment, request that they return these as early as possible so that others will have opportunity to use them during the following week. Song 116.
WEEK STARTING MAY 5
 8 min: Song 12. Introduction, text and comments. Make use of appropriate Theocratic News items to show joy in serving Jehovah shared by ever-increasing number of brothers world wide.
10 min: “‘What is the Bible’s View?” There is a wealth of material in “Awake!” articles bearing this heading. Each one provides a concise treatment of a Bible subject that may be just what is needed to reach someone you have contacted in field ministry, someone you work with, go to school with, a relative or a neighbor. List subjects covered in recent months. Demonstrate father talking with son on challenge son faces in school on loose morals. Cover material in January 22, 1974, “Awake!” on the subject “Fornication​—Why Not?” In handling this, chairman can emphasize that this material can be very beneficial to parents who want to help their children to have the Bible’s view on matters.
15 min: Offering the Book “God’s Kingdom of a Thousand Years Has Approached.”
Discuss use of the Bible in house-to-house ministry. In distributing tracts and in placing magazines we use brief presentations. These activities serve a good purpose. Also beneficial to endeavor to draw people into conversation, to discuss points from the Bible. Many new publishers may never have done this; it is not difficult; we encourage you to learn.
Several publishers on platform discuss and demonstrate how to draw householder into conversation, and then read just one or two verses from the Bible. (Keep it simple.) Offer “God’s Kingdom of a Thousand Years Has Approached.” (Use ideas from October 1973 “Kingdom Ministry.”)
15 min: “Presenting the Good News​—Developing Interest on Return Visits.” Talk on material, including some audience participation, and handled possibly by Bible study overseer.
12 min: Concluding comments. Briefly discuss Question Box; enlarge on it if it applies locally. Build up enthusiasm for final weekend of distribution of Kingdom News No. 18. Song 11.

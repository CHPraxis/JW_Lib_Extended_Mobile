How to Keep Delinquency Out of Your Home
Is there true peace and security in your home? Family troubles are a major reason why children turn to drugs and unclean sex practices. But you can protect your family.
The 192-page book True Peace and Security​—From What Source? has been provided to help you. It discusses the attitude of young persons toward their parents, drug abuse, homosexuality, masturbation and other topics. Send only 25 cents, and a copy will be mailed to you.
Also, if you desire, a minister will call at your home and, free of charge, have regular discussions on Biblical matters with you and your family.
Check either or both: Please send True Peace and Security​—From What Source? I enclose 25c. □ Also, I would like to have one of Jehovah’s witnesses call to discuss the Bible free of charge. □

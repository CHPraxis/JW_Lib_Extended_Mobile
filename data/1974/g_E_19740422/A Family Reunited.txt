A Family Reunited
THE Bible can have a wholesome effect on people’s lives, as was experienced by a woman in Norway. From her Bible discussions with Jehovah’s witnesses she came to recognize that she could not continue living with a man to whom she was not legally married. Because of her refusing to change her newly acquired Bible-based view on moral matters, he left her and went out to sea. A few weeks later her former husband came to see the children. She invited him into the home and told him about what had happened meanwhile and that she was now studying with Jehovah’s witnesses.
There was a meeting at the Kingdom Hall of Jehovah’s Witnesses that evening. Since she did not have a car, she asked if her former husband would be willing to take her and the children there. This he did, and he was so impressed by what he heard that he continued to attend the meetings, bringing the family. He was also pleased with the fine changes his former wife had made in bringing her life into harmony with the Bible. She had stopped smoking and had become more calm and balanced. A good relationship existed between her and the children. Due to what he could observe, he decided to remarry his former wife. Now the entire family is united in striving to live according to Bible principles.

Kingdom Halls
Many congregations are enjoying the pleasure of being in new Kingdom Halls or in enlarged or improved facilities. In the past 38 months in the United States (including Alaska and Hawaii), 839 congregations have either constructed new Kingdom Halls or purchased and remodeled existing buildings. Another 1,139 congregations have engaged in remodeling projects, enlarging or improving existing Kingdom Halls. Some have increased the seating areas, some have added rooms for additional Theocratic Ministry School classes, some have increased parking facilities, and so forth, in an effort to accommodate the increased numbers attending meetings. This is fine and it is good to see them expanding now. There may be even more congregations that have done something along this line.
It is a joy to see the increase that Jehovah is giving, and it is a pleasure to observe that the congregations are taking appropriate steps to accommodate the increase. What a congregation does in this regard is, of course, for the congregation to determine. If a congregation finds it necessary to go outside the congregation to finance such a project, the Society will be glad to entertain such inquiries and provide any information it can that may be helpful.

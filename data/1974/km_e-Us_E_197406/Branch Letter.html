<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sh">Dear Kingdom Publishers:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Reports coming in here each month from the more than 6,000 congregations in the United States are most encouraging.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">In March there was a new peak of 20,104 regular pioneers. The report of 507,681 publishers represents a 15.5-percent increase over last year’s average. Comparisons of this March report with that of a year ago reveal that the number of return visits increased over 12 percent and home Bible studies were up nearly 11 percent. And this in spite of widespread sickness in many parts of the country.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">And do you know that every month during this service year has seen a phenomenal increase in the number of those baptized? Why, so far in the first seven months there has been a total of 39,118 baptized, compared to 25,469 in the same period last year. That represents a 53.5-percent increase!</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">It is only to be expected that with all this stepped-up activity, this year’s Memorial attendance would make a big jump over last year’s. It is too early for the worldwide figure on this, but here in the continental United States there were over 130,000 more present than a year ago​—more than a 12-percent jump!</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">The busy month of March ended with the special talk and was quickly followed by the even busier month of April, with the Memorial and with special issues of the magazines to distribute. There is no indication of letup in May either, with the distribution of <em>Kingdom News </em>No. 18. And now after such a busy spring we are looking forward to a very busy summer with the series of “Divine Purpose” District Assemblies beginning this month of June.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">What a happy sight to see so many new ones also standing steadfast and looking intently at the promised inheritance​—perfect life under government by God!</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sj">Your brothers,</p>

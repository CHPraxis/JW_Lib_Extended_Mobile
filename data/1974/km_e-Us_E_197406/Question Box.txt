Question Box
● What can be done when a householder verbally requests that no one call at his home, or there is a sign on the door saying that no salesmen or religious groups should call?
When we meet persons who are very much opposed and who request that we not call at their home again, we will respect their wishes in the matter. A dated note may be put in the territory envelope so no one will call in the future as long as the householder remains there. Of course, people do move, and at times some have a change of heart. If one is not certain about the householder’s still living there in time a tactful inquiry can be made. Decide locally what would be best in each case.
Where there are signs saying “No Peddlers or Solicitors,” and so forth, it may be best to identify yourselves as one of Jehovah’s witnesses, taking the viewpoint that such signs do not apply to our work. Where signs specifically state that no religious calls be made or that Jehovah’s witnesses not call, it may be well to talk personally to the householder, since the previous occupant may have put up the sign, or the householder may have had a change of heart. If the householder then verbally requests that we not call, matters may be handled as outlined above.

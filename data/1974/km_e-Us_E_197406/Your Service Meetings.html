<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn"><strong>20 min: </strong>Appreciation of Jehovah’s Provision for His Servants to Assemble Together.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">“Divine Purpose” District Assemblies are soon to begin. Assemblies are important in the lives of Jehovah’s servants. (Invite the audience to comment on the following points, using material from the Bible, “The Watchtower,” “Awake!” and “1974 Yearbook.”)</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">(1) How does the Bible show that large assemblies have long been a feature of true worship? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:8:1-16:8:3" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Neh 8:1-3,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:8:7-16:8:8" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 7, 8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:23:1-3:23:44" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> Lev. chapter 23</a>) The experiences of our brothers in Germany and elsewhere can help us to appreciate this provision. (2) Although some had very little materially, what did they do about attending assemblies? (“yb,” p. 99, par. 2; p. 219, par. 1) (3) What type of sleeping accommodations did they gladly accept? Why? How can we benefit from their example? (“yb,” p. 249, par. 1) (4) When they encountered opposition, how did the outcome give evidence of Jehovah’s blessing? (“yb,” p. 215, par. 5, through p. 216, par. 2; p. 224, pars. 1, 2) (5) How have large assemblies resulted in a grand public witness, to which all those in attendance contributed by their presence? (“yb,” p. 219, par. 4; p. 238, par. 4; p. 239, par. 4) (6) How has the conduct of our brothers and sisters attending assemblies resulted in a good witness? What responsibility should we feel in this regard? (<a class="xt" data-xtid="1" href="jwpub://p/E:1973600/27:279-34">w73 8/15 p. 486;</a> <a class="xt" data-xtid="2" href="jwpub://p/E:1974165/28:367-38">w74 3/1 p. 149;</a> <a class="xt" data-xtid="3" href="jwpub://p/E:101972764/23-40:156">g72 10/22 p. 19;</a> <a class="xt" data-xtid="4" href="jwpub://p/E:201973161/9-10$p/E:201973166/$p/E:201973167/$p/E:201973168/$p/E:201973169/$p/E:201973170/$p/E:201973171/1-6">km 5/73 pp. 7, 8</a>)</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">The facts make it evident that Jehovah’s blessing is on these assemblies of His people; by our attendance we share in that blessing. Encourage all to attend one of the assemblies this summer. Discuss any local arrangements to aid all in the congregation to get to the assembly.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sn"><strong>10 min: </strong>Concluding comments. As time allows, include recent items of special interest from “Insight on the News” or “Watching the World.” Encourage all to read, before next week, the March 15, 1974, “Watchtower” article “Consider What Jehovah Has Done for You.” Song 30.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="ss"><strong>WEEK STARTING JUNE 16</strong></p>

<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sn"><strong>20 min: </strong>Joy in Finding Answers. Discourse and demonstration.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">In daily life and field service, questions arise. What answer is in the Bible and publications of “faithful and discreet slave”? Rather than just ask someone, use “Watch Tower Publications Index” to find the answer. Doing your own research with “Index” is both quick and satisfying. It will bring you joy.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:2:4-20:2:5" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Prov. 2:4, 5</a>.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">Display indexes. (1930-1960; 1961-1965; 1966-1970; 1971; 1972; 1973) Publications are indexed by year. The “Aid” book is covered by 1966-1970 “Index,” so that “Index” is of particular value. Abbreviations of publications are explained in front of each and on left-hand pages. Each “Index” has Scripture portion and subject portion. Available in Kingdom Hall library.</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">With indexes and some publications on platform, show how to use. Note: State answers in one or two sentences. Do NOT spend time giving detailed answers; show HOW TO FIND answers. (1) Is it wrong to have a pet sterilized? (Check subject portion in 1973 “Index” under “Animals” and subheading “sterilization.”) (2) Does <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:27:52-40:27:52" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matthew 27:52</a> mean that at Jesus’ death some persons were resurrected? (Check Scripture portion of 1973 “Index,” then 1972, 1971, and finally 1966-1970; brief answer at “ad,” p. 478; p. 1004 deals with another aspect; p. 1134 gives extensive discussion.) (3) What material can I use to help someone who is depressed? (Check subject portion under “Depression”; 1973 “Index” lists g73 10/8 12 but it is not right aspect; 1972 “Index” leads to w72 521, 522, good, but is there more?; 1971 “Index” refers to whole article, 261-264.) (4) Why is Gehenna called “second death” if some persons going to it never died before? (1973 “Index” under “Second Death” refers to “ka,” p. 157, 158.)</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">If you do not have a certain publication referred to, likely another brother does, or it may be in the library at Kingdom Hall. Increase your joy and blessings by using “Index” often.</p>

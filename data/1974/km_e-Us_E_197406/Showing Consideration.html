<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>Would you want someone to leave a visible sign that you are not at home in these days when burglars are watching for opportunities to ransack homes? We are sure you would not. So it is well, as we participate in the field service and leave handbills or older magazines at doors when people are not at home, to be sure that they are completely out of the view of passersby, if at all possible. If the handbill or magazine is slipped inside a screen or storm door, then, of course, you will want to be sure that the door is properly closed when you leave. If it is not possible to leave a magazine out of sight, then you may deem it best simply to leave a handbill in some unobtrusive spot, if possible slipping it under the door.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:7:12-40:7:12" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matt. 7:12</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>It should be borne in mind, too, that any article that is placed in a <em>receptacle </em>that is identified as being for “U.S. Mail” should have postage on it. So do not use mailboxes in this way. However, if there is a slot in the door through which an article can be pushed (but behind which there is no receptacle), there is no objection to leaving a tract or a handbill or a sample magazine in this way.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>If you decide to send literature through the mail to someone who has shown interest or to a householder whom you are having difficulty in finding at home, please be certain that you have enough postage on it and show your own name and address as the sender. Do not show the Society’s return address for items that you mail personally.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>Considerately handling matters in these ways will leave a more favorable impression with those upon whom we call.</p>

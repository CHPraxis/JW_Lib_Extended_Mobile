Your Service Meetings
WEEK STARTING JUNE 9
10 min: Song 33. Introduction, text and comments.
 5 min: Accounts report; include comments on the article entitled “Kingdom Halls.”
15 min: Discourse, along with some audience participation, on the article “Steadfast in Faithful Service.” Include comments on weekend arrangements for field service and encouragement to participate.
20 min: Appreciation of Jehovah’s Provision for His Servants to Assemble Together.
“Divine Purpose” District Assemblies are soon to begin. Assemblies are important in the lives of Jehovah’s servants. (Invite the audience to comment on the following points, using material from the Bible, “The Watchtower,” “Awake!” and “1974 Yearbook.”)
(1) How does the Bible show that large assemblies have long been a feature of true worship? (Neh 8:1-3, 7, 8; Lev. chapter 23) The experiences of our brothers in Germany and elsewhere can help us to appreciate this provision. (2) Although some had very little materially, what did they do about attending assemblies? (“yb,” p. 99, par. 2; p. 219, par. 1) (3) What type of sleeping accommodations did they gladly accept? Why? How can we benefit from their example? (“yb,” p. 249, par. 1) (4) When they encountered opposition, how did the outcome give evidence of Jehovah’s blessing? (“yb,” p. 215, par. 5, through p. 216, par. 2; p. 224, pars. 1, 2) (5) How have large assemblies resulted in a grand public witness, to which all those in attendance contributed by their presence? (“yb,” p. 219, par. 4; p. 238, par. 4; p. 239, par. 4) (6) How has the conduct of our brothers and sisters attending assemblies resulted in a good witness? What responsibility should we feel in this regard? (w73 8/15 p. 486; w74 3/1 p. 149; g72 10/22 p. 19; km 5/73 pp. 7, 8)
The facts make it evident that Jehovah’s blessing is on these assemblies of His people; by our attendance we share in that blessing. Encourage all to attend one of the assemblies this summer. Discuss any local arrangements to aid all in the congregation to get to the assembly.
10 min: Concluding comments. As time allows, include recent items of special interest from “Insight on the News” or “Watching the World.” Encourage all to read, before next week, the March 15, 1974, “Watchtower” article “Consider What Jehovah Has Done for You.” Song 30.
WEEK STARTING JUNE 16
15 min: Song 31. Introduction, text and comments. Discuss highlights of Branch Letter and items of interest from Theocratic News.
10 min: “Regular Coverage of Territory.” Discuss article, using audience participation. Include comments on field service arrangements for the days ahead.
20 min: Joy in Finding Answers. Discourse and demonstration.
In daily life and field service, questions arise. What answer is in the Bible and publications of “faithful and discreet slave”? Rather than just ask someone, use “Watch Tower Publications Index” to find the answer. Doing your own research with “Index” is both quick and satisfying. It will bring you joy.​—Prov. 2:4, 5.
Display indexes. (1930-1960; 1961-1965; 1966-1970; 1971; 1972; 1973) Publications are indexed by year. The “Aid” book is covered by 1966-1970 “Index,” so that “Index” is of particular value. Abbreviations of publications are explained in front of each and on left-hand pages. Each “Index” has Scripture portion and subject portion. Available in Kingdom Hall library.
With indexes and some publications on platform, show how to use. Note: State answers in one or two sentences. Do NOT spend time giving detailed answers; show HOW TO FIND answers. (1) Is it wrong to have a pet sterilized? (Check subject portion in 1973 “Index” under “Animals” and subheading “sterilization.”) (2) Does Matthew 27:52 mean that at Jesus’ death some persons were resurrected? (Check Scripture portion of 1973 “Index,” then 1972, 1971, and finally 1966-1970; brief answer at “ad,” p. 478; p. 1004 deals with another aspect; p. 1134 gives extensive discussion.) (3) What material can I use to help someone who is depressed? (Check subject portion under “Depression”; 1973 “Index” lists g73 10/8 12 but it is not right aspect; 1972 “Index” leads to w72 521, 522, good, but is there more?; 1971 “Index” refers to whole article, 261-264.) (4) Why is Gehenna called “second death” if some persons going to it never died before? (1973 “Index” under “Second Death” refers to “ka,” p. 157, 158.)
If you do not have a certain publication referred to, likely another brother does, or it may be in the library at Kingdom Hall. Increase your joy and blessings by using “Index” often.
15 min: Concluding comments. Discuss with audience material from the March 15, 1974, “Watchtower” article “Consider What Jehovah Has Done for You.” Include material from the article itself, but encourage audience to comment from their own hearts too. Song 23.

25 min: Review of District Assembly Program.
Invite comments on the following points: (1) New things learned; these may be new to the individual publisher, not necessarily all of them new to the organization. (2) Helpful counsel regarding elders, their qualifications and responsibilities. (3) Suggestions that were offered to assist new ones to make progress spiritually. (4) What young ones among Jehovah’s witnesses are doing in service to God. (5) Qualities or attitudes that we should cultivate; how and why to do so. (6) Lessons learned from the Bible dramas. (7) Experiences, whether related on the program or enjoyed personally.
It would be beneficial to make arrangements before the assembly for various ones to make notes on the points suggested above as a basis for review of the program.
10 min: Concluding comments. Song 36.
(If you have not had your district assembly by early July, you can have another program on this week and then arrange to have this assembly review after your district assembly.)

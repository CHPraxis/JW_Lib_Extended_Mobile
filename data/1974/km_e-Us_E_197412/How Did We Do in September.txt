How Did We Do in September?
The new service year got off to a splendid start with 522,055 proclaimers of the good news in the field. This is nearly 10,000 more publishers than for the previous September. Also, 298,740 home Bible studies were conducted. It makes us rejoice to see the fine efforts being put forth to help honest-hearted ones, and what a privilege personally to have a share!

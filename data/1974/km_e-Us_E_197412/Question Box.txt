Question Box
● In a case in which a person, because of genuine repentance, is not disfellowshipped, is it nonetheless proper to restrict him from the preaching work under certain circumstances?
When one is privately or publicly reproved, the information on page 168 of the Organization book applies. While it is true that certain restrictions may be placed on such individuals, it is good to note what is said on page 168 regarding the preaching work, namely: “The person would be free to engage fully in the preaching work and to report such . . .” Likely in the case of a notorious situation where one is publicly reproved, it would be the course of wisdom for that one to engage in the preaching work in a section of the territory where the problem is not widely known, at least for a while. It is good to keep in mind that the preaching work is a basic part of our service to God, and all who serve Jehovah should be sharing in it.​—Matt. 24:14; 28:18-20.
What about a person who has been reinstated following disfellowshiping? Should he be allowed to engage in the field service immediately? Yes, in harmony with the above thoughts he should be allowed to engage in the field service following reinstatement. As to other privileges in this regard we can be guided by what is stated in the Organization book, page 177.

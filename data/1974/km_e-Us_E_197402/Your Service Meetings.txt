We can learn much from the experiences of our brothers who have carried on their ministry under difficult conditions. To receive full benefit, however we must ask ourselves: ‘What would I do?’
Invite audience to comment on the following points; have individuals prepared to relate selected experiences. (1) What commission in connection with the good news have we been given? (Mark 13:10; Matt. 28:18-20) (2) Why is the house-to-house method of preaching so effective in fulfilling this commission? (“or” p. 114) (3) In some places Jehovah’s witnesses have been banned; it could happen here too. Would you still have the responsibility to preach even if it might result in arrest and imprisonment? (Acts 5:27-29; 8:1, 4; Rev. 1:9; yb74 p. 132) (4) How could we carry on house-to-house preaching if our ministry were banned? (yb74 pp. 141, 155, 156) (5) In what other ways might we make contact with persons to whom to witness? (John 4:6-15; yb74 pp. 55, 141, 186, par. 4) (6) How could we carry on the preaching work if no literature were available to offer? (yb74 p. 20; yb70 p. 312) (Could we do as our brothers and sisters in Singapore are now doing? Now is the time to improve our ability to use the Bible in our field ministry by doing so each week.​—Heb. 4:12) (7) How might caution be displayed in making return calls where interest is shown?

18 min: Worshiping the God of Peace. Audience discussion based on “Aid” book, pages 1279-1281. Chairman to direct discussion to highlight what is most appropriate to local needs and circumstances. Some might be assigned to epitomize scriptures, but allow all to express selves freely as time allows.
While world makes strenuous efforts to achieve peace in our generation, world does not and cannot find genuine peace, “peace” in the Biblical sense. What is this peace? How is it obtained in our own personal life and in association with others?
(1) Besides referring to state of being free from war, what other ideas are associated with “peace” in the Biblical sense? (“Aid.” p. 1279, pars. 9, 10) Give examples of such usage.​—Luke 7:50; 2:29; Deut. 23:6.
(2) Who is the Source of peace? (“Aid,” p. 1280, par. 1; Num. 6:26; Ps. 4:6-8) How important is righteousness to the possession of peace?​—Ps. 85:10; Isa. 32:17.
(3) What is the “peace of God that excels all thought”? (Phil. 4:6, 7) How do we individually obtain it? How does it influence our lives? (“Aid,” p. 1280, par. 5) How does Jesus Christ impart peace to us?​—Col. 3:15.
(4) Use Scripture texts to emphasize the importance of preserving peace in the congregation, among ourselves as Christians.​—2 Tim. 2:22; Heb. 12:14; Rom. 14:13.
(5) How do elders and ministerial servants show they are ‘pursuing peace’ in dealing with one another and with all in the congregation?​—Rom. 12:10; Gal. 6:1, 2; 5:22, 23.
(6) How does our work of Kingdom-preaching and disciple-making contribute to our identification as true worshipers of the God of peace?​—Eph. 6:15; Col. 1:20-25.
Chairman may make brief, motivating conclusion.

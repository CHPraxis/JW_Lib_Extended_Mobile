<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sn">Invite audience to comment on the following points; have individuals prepared to relate selected experiences. (1) What commission in connection with the good news have we been given? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:13:10-41:13:10" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Mark 13:10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:28:18-40:28:20" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Matt. 28:18-20</a>) (2) Why is the house-to-house method of preaching so effective in fulfilling this commission? (“or” p. 114) (3) In some places Jehovah’s witnesses have been banned; it could happen here too. Would you still have the responsibility to preach even if it might result in arrest and imprisonment? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:5:27-44:5:29" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Acts 5:27-29;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:8:1-44:8:1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 8:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:8:4-44:8:4" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> 4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:1:9-66:1:9" data-bid="2-4" class="b"> Rev. 1:9</a>; <a class="xt" data-xtid="2" href="jwpub://p/E:301974005/18:317-22:258">yb74 p. 132</a>) (4) How could we carry on house-to-house preaching if our ministry were banned?

Chairman to direct discussion to highlight what is most appropriate to local needs and circumstances. Some might be assigned to epitomize scriptures, but allow all to express selves freely as time allows.</p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sn">While world makes strenuous efforts to achieve peace in our generation, world does not and cannot find genuine peace, “peace” in the Biblical sense. What is this peace? How is it obtained in our own personal life and in association with others?</p>
<p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sn">(1) Besides referring to state of being free from war, what other ideas are associated with “peace” in the Biblical sense? (“Aid.” p. 1279, pars. 9, 10) Give examples of such usage.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:7:50-42:7:50" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Luke 7:50;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:2:29-42:2:29" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 2:29;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:23:6-5:23:6" data-bid="5-3" class="b"> Deut. 23:6</a>.</p>
<p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sn">(2) Who is the Source of peace?

<p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sn">(3) What is the “peace of God that excels all thought”? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:4:6-50:4:7" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Phil. 4:6, 7</a>) How do we individually obtain it? How does it influence our lives? (“Aid,” p. 1280, par. 5) How does Jesus Christ impart peace to us?​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:3:15-51:3:15" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Col. 3:15</a>.</p>
<p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="sn">(4) Use Scripture texts to emphasize the importance of preserving peace in the congregation, among ourselves as Christians.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:2:22-55:2:22" data-bid="10-1" class="b">2 Tim. 2:22;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:12:14-58:12:14" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> Heb. 12:14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:14:13-45:14:13" data-bid="10-3" class="b"> Rom. 14:13</a>.</p>
<p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="sn">(5) How do elders and ministerial servants show they are ‘pursuing peace’ in dealing with one another and with all in the congregation?​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:12:10-45:12:10" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Rom. 12:10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:6:1-48:6:2" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> Gal. 6:1, 2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:5:22-48:5:23" data-bid="11-3" class="b"> 5:22, 23</a>.</p>
<p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="sn">(6) How does our work of Kingdom-preaching and disciple-making contribute to our identification as true worshipers of the God of peace?​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:6:15-49:6:15" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Eph. 6:15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:1:20-51:1:25" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> Col. 1:20-25</a>.</p>

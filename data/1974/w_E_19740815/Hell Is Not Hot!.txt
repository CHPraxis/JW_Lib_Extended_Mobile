Hell Is Not Hot!
The churches have long taught that the wicked are tormented in a hot hell. But the Bible does not teach that.
Learn what hell is, and what the Bible says about the condition of the dead. Read the chapter “Where Are the Dead?” in the book The Truth That Leads to Eternal Life. Hard bound, 192 pages, only 25 cents.
Please send, postpaid, the book The Truth That Leads to Eternal Life. I enclose 25c.

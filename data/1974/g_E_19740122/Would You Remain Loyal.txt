Would You Remain Loyal?
Or in the face of opposition, would you compromise principles that you know to be right?
In Nazi Germany Jehovah’s witnesses refused to compromise. They remained loyal to righteous principles. They had no share in Hitler’s political or military aggressions. Just a few decades ago, hundreds died in his concentration camps. But thousands came out strong in faith.
Strengthen your own conviction by reading a moving account of the integrity of Jehovah’s witnesses in Germany. Also read the thrilling reports about their activity in China and the Central African Republic. It is all in the 1974 Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

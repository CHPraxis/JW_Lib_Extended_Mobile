Branch Letter
Dear Kingdom Publishers:
For many months we looked forward to this year’s series of “Divine Purpose” District Assemblies and the privilege of attending one of them. Now, as this letter goes to press, the majority of us are looking back on this thrilling experience, calling to mind the many blessings we there received. If you have not yet attended, we earnestly urge you to do so.
Early reports show that, at the first 25 assemblies held in 17 states from coast to coast, there was a peak attendance of 325,542 with 8,468 being baptized.
Among the many interesting reports brought back from these assemblies was the news item that Brother Knorr related during his comments at Jacksonville, Florida. He told how the Society had just arranged to purchase a new Wood-Hoe rotary printing press, to be delivered next year.
This press, much bigger than any we have now, is 61 feet long and weighs about 42 tons. It is unique in that it has three large printing cylinders, each 70 inches wide and over 4 feet in diameter. The 70-inch-wide web of paper travels through the press at 1,000 feet a minute​—over 11 miles of paper an hour! At this speed the cylinders make 75 revolutions per minute, and with each revolution they print 768 pages, the equivalent of FOUR 192-page books per revolution. That is 18,000 complete pocket-size books an hour​—150,000 books during each day’s regular shift! As they come off the press the pages are all collated and ready for sewing and binding.
You can just imagine how long and loud the Bethel family applauded at hearing this good news. We are sure you are just as eager as we are to see it in operation​—a press capable of printing more than 40,000,000 books a year without overtime!
Your brothers,
BROOKLYN BRANCH OFFICE

<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn">◆ Each congregation will receive two Literature Inventory forms and should take an actual count of campaign literature at the end of August. Please do not include cash items such as the <em>Aid </em>book, the large-print Bible (bi8) and the <em>Concordance </em>in value of campaign literature in stock.

<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn">◆ The elders in each congregation should arrange to meet together early in September. Any recommendations for new appointments should then be sent to the Society using the S-2 form. Presiding overseers should send in their report for the service year on the S-10 form at the same time, also the new S-9 form regarding elders to attend the Kingdom Ministry School. All these forms are being sent to congregations with the July literature statement. (See <em>Organization </em>book, page 67, and August 1973 <em>Kingdom Ministry.</em>)</p>

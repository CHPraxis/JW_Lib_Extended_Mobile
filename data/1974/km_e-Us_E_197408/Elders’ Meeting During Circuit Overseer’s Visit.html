<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>Some questions have arisen as to the circuit overseer’s role in connection with the elders’ meeting. This meeting should be just as carefully and thoughtfully planned by the presiding overseer, who acts as chairman of such meeting, as the regular elders’ meetings held quarterly. If the visit coincides with the time for one of the quarterly meetings, or is near that time, the presiding overseer may deem it appropriate to combine these into one meeting.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>The <em>Organization </em>book, pages 82 to 86, deals with the circuit overseer’s visit with the congregation, including this special meeting. On pages 64 to 67, it also shows the need to prepare properly for these important meetings. The book mentions a number of matters that beneficially could be considered, but there are undoubtedly other matters that the local body of elders realize need attention, and each elder should let the chairman know, orally or in writing, well in advance of the meeting, if possible, what items he believes deserve discussion. Based thereon, the chairman should prepare a schedule, allowing time for each subject, and planning for a meeting that will not be unduly long.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>The circuit overseer, based on his review of the condition of the congregation with the presiding overseer on his arrival, may also suggest questions for discussion at the meeting. Also, if the meeting is near the close of his visit, since he will have had opportunity to observe the condition of the congregation and may have some additional valuable suggestions to make, the chairman can ask him to mention these.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>Generally the circuit overseer has many years of experience in Jehovah’s organization. And since he, as a specially appointed traveling elder, spends much time in such meetings in different congregations, he is in position to pass on to the elders helpful examples and things learned. So the elders should avail themselves of his experience.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:1:12-45:1:12" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Rom. 1:12</a>.</p>

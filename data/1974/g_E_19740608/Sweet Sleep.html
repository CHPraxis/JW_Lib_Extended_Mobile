<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">In getting a good night’s sleep, the state of one’s mind is much more important than the state of one’s body. One saying puts it this way: “A man’s conscience and not his mattress has most to do with his sleep.” The inspired writer of Ecclesiastes expressed it: “Sweet is the sleep of the labourer whether he eats little or much; but the rich man owns too much and cannot sleep.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:5:12-21:5:12" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Eccl. 5:12</a>, <em>New English Bible.</em></p>

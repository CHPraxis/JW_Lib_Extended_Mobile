Sweet Sleep
In getting a good night’s sleep, the state of one’s mind is much more important than the state of one’s body. One saying puts it this way: “A man’s conscience and not his mattress has most to do with his sleep.” The inspired writer of Ecclesiastes expressed it: “Sweet is the sleep of the labourer whether he eats little or much; but the rich man owns too much and cannot sleep.”​—Eccl. 5:12, New English Bible.

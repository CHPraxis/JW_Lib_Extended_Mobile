<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">● The danger caused to children by excessive TV viewing may be more than wrong moral influences and a factor in the generation gap. Phyllis Dolhinow of the University of California, at Berkeley, explains: “The child sits passively in front of a television set, uninvolved in social interaction or creative use of the intellect.” Referring to such children as ‘telly dunces,’ the London <em>Daily Mirror </em>noted the concern of British scientists for many aged nine to eleven whose reading age is less than six. “They are likely to wind up as illiterate adults​—because they come from homes where their main . . . source of information is television and pop records.”</p>

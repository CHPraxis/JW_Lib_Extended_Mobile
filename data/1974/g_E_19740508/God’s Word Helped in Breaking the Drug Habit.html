<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">MORE and more people today are using drugs to escape reality. Many are in desperate need of a solid hope that would give purposeful direction to their lives. Accurate knowledge of the Bible could help them. This is illustrated by those who have successfully broken the drug habit after they began to study the Bible with Jehovah’s Christian witnesses.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A man now living in the northeastern part of the United States relates: “I was taking ‘trips’ by means of mescaline, LSD and other drugs, thinking that these would ‘open me up.’ Instead, I only found myself in an ‘empty box,’ with the feeling that my head was sinking into my chest.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“Then, one day I came home, and two men were standing at my door. I thought that they were narcotics agents. How surprised I was when they told me about a real government of God and its solution to earth’s problems! A Bible study was started with me.” What was the result? This study aided him to break the drug habit, as it gave him a real hope and a purpose in living.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Another young man tells about his situation: “I started using drugs shortly after graduating from high school and rapidly became very much involved in the drug scene. I would ‘trip’ on LSD for days and sometimes weeks at a time. I was also involved in the sale of drugs and for some time I did this as my means of support. Then I got hepatitis from using a dirty needle and was sick for almost a year. During this time I started studying ‘white’ magic. By now many people began to consider me completely lost.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">“Later, I met one of Jehovah’s witnesses on the street and began talking to him, as I knew he had in the past studied philosophies similar to those I had examined. He told me that the only place he found real truth was in the Bible. So I agreed to talk to him about this a little more.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">“As we continued meeting, he showed me, from the Bible, how my course of action was actually taking me away from God rather than bringing me closer to him. The only honest thing to do was to examine the Bible: first, to see if it was really God’s Word, and, then, to find out what was pleasing to Jehovah and to do it.”</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Today this young man rejoices in having broken free of drug abuse and having a solid hope based on the Bible.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Truly God’s Word can have a wholesome effect on people’s lives!</p>

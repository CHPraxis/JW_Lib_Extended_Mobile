<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">■ Will the Church of Scotland continue to tolerate a minister who challenges the truthfulness of the Bible? Alestair Bennett of Strathkinness Church, Fife, says: “The Church of Scotland has freed itself from compulsory submission to the ancient creeds. . . . The next bold step must be to free the Church of Scotland from compulsory submission to all that is in Scripture. . . . primitive and outdated beliefs and practices are not occasional or trivial but they occur throughout Scripture.”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">But what does the <em>New English Bible, </em>approved by the Church of Scotland, say about this? “It was not through any human whim that men prophesied of old; men they were, but, impelled by the Holy Spirit, they spoke the words of God.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:1:21-61:1:21" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Pet. 1:21</a>) The church’s taking action in this case, or its failure to do so, will show where it stands on this issue.</p>

The Church of Scotland and the Bible
■ Will the Church of Scotland continue to tolerate a minister who challenges the truthfulness of the Bible? Alestair Bennett of Strathkinness Church, Fife, says: “The Church of Scotland has freed itself from compulsory submission to the ancient creeds. . . . The next bold step must be to free the Church of Scotland from compulsory submission to all that is in Scripture. . . . primitive and outdated beliefs and practices are not occasional or trivial but they occur throughout Scripture.”
But what does the New English Bible, approved by the Church of Scotland, say about this? “It was not through any human whim that men prophesied of old; men they were, but, impelled by the Holy Spirit, they spoke the words of God.” (2 Pet. 1:21) The church’s taking action in this case, or its failure to do so, will show where it stands on this issue.

The Future for Mankind​—How It Can Be Known
You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth
Humans have proved unable to predict the future consistently. Yet, if man was originally created by God, then the purpose of God determines what the future hold for mankind.
You can learn about the bright future that God promises in the beautifully illustrated 256-page book You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth. It provides convincing evidence as to why we are here, why we grow old and die, yet how humans will live forever on earth in paradise. More than that, it explains why God has permitted wickedness to exist until now.
Is the Bible Really the Word of God?
But how can a person be sure that the Bible, the basis for knowing the future, truly is from God? Read the 192-page book Is the Bible Really the Word of God?
To obtain either of these attractive hardbound books postpaid, just send $3 for You Can Live Forever on Earth, $1 for Is the Bible Really the Word of God?, or $4 for both. (Contributions subject to change).

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><span id="page2" class="pageNum" data-no="2" data-before-text="2"></span>AN ADMINISTRATION that operates successfully is what all mankind sorely needs. The vast majority of people do not know it, but our Creator lovingly purposed such an administration for us shortly after mankind started on its downward path. Examination of facts proves that His administration moves onward in its operation toward glorious success, with credit to God and lasting good for all mankind. There is nothing finer than to know this and to line up with it. To aid people in coming to a knowledge of this, the booklet before the reader is published. We enjoyed publishing it. You will enjoy reading it.</p>

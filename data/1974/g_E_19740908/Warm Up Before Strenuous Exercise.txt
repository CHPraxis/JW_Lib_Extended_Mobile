Warm Up Before Strenuous Exercise
● A medical-school study urges people who exercise to avoid starting strenuous physical activity suddenly. Being in good physical condition has no bearing on the danger. Electrocardiograms on forty-four healthy firemen showed that thirty-one of them developed abnormalities after starting a running exercise abruptly. Dr. R. James Barnard said that this sudden start could cause a blood shortage in the heart’s coronary arteries and bring on a heart attack. This could happen even if the arteries are not abnormally clogged. The study advised first doing some warm-up activity before strenuous exercise.

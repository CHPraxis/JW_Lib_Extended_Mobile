Enjoy A Bible In Living English
The vigorous, expressive language of The Bible in Living English has delighted many. “I can forget I’m reading and just live alongside the characters, and so absorb more of the background,” one reader writes.
Order this new Bible translated by Steven T. Byington. It has large print, marginal notes and a dark-blue cover with gold-embossed title; 1,598 pages. Only $6, postpaid.
Please send The Bible in Living English, also, as a gift, the booklet “Look! I Am Making All Things New.” I enclose $6.

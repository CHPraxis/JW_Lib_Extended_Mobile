Branch Letter
Dear Kingdom Publishers:
During the past couple of weeks, we at Bethel have enjoyed some delightful reports about the final “Divine Victory” assemblies.
Despite the world’s mounting problems, Jehovah’s people were able to assemble in peace and without serious difficulty.
Brother Suiter was at one of the largest assemblies in Africa​—at Lagos, Nigeria, where 65,279 gathered in the National Stadium to hear the public lecture. The largest of all the “Divine Victory” assemblies, however, was in Port Harcourt, Nigeria, where the attendance reached 107,442.
Although Brothers Henschel and Suiter were unable to get to the assembly in South Africa due to circumstances beyond their control, happily brothers on two chartered planes from Europe were delighted to get there. As required by law, separate assemblies were held in Johannesburg for the three main racial groups. But for the final session it was possible to move to the Rand Stadium, where segregation laws do not apply. A crowd of 33,408 packed the stadium. “It was indeed a beautiful sight for us in South Africa,” observed an eyewitness, “to see our African, Colored and European brothers all associated together in worship of Jehovah.”
Brother Knorr reported on all the South American assemblies, with fascinating details. In the ten lands visited, the Kingdom work is moving ahead marvelously with 239,000 attending and a grand total of 12,453 baptized. At São Paulo, Brazil, a huge sports stadium was packed during the assembly even though the brothers had to stand for some sessions because of heavy rain. The public meeting attendance there was 94,586.
Our brothers there are working hard. May all of us, too, continue to aid others to get a firm hold on the real life while there is yet time.
Your brothers,
BROOKLYN BRANCH OFFICE

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"><strong>● What publications should one read before baptism?</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Page 18 of the “Organization” book states that one contemplating baptism will be greatly aided by personally reading the recent publications of the Society in addition to the book he is currently studying. Please observe that no publications are named. It is left up to the local elders to recommend what they believe will be of most help to the individual. Some, in addition to studying the “Truth” book, would be benefited most by absorbing the principles of Christian living set out in the “Peace and Security” book. A person who has been plagued with doubts about the authenticity of the Bible would be benefited by the “Word of God” book. In some cases the elders might recommend the ‘Impossible to Lie’ or the “Life Everlasting” book. It is not a matter of setting out as required reading so many books, but of helping individuals to grow spiritually. That is why this same page in the “Organization” book says: “The elders of the congregation with which you are associated will gladly make recommendations to you of material that will be most helpful.”</p>

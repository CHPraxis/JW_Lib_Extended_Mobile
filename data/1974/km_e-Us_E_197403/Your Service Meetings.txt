If Jehovah is real to us, then even though we may be in dire straits we can maintain integrity by fully relying on him.​—Ps 86:7.
Jehovah is real to those who base their faith on accurate knowledge. (Heb. 11:1, 2, 6; Rom. 1:20; John 4:24) Jehovah is real to those who know his qualities. Review page 266 of “Make Sure.” We draw close to Jehovah when we imitate his qualities. (Eph. 4:32-5:1) This requires a knowledge of His Word. (John 17:3; Prov. 2:1-6; 2 Tim. 3:16, 17) Jehovah is real to those who experience his dealings with them. (Heb. 11:17-38) Regular communication with Jehovah through prayer will draw us closer to him as we thoughtfully observe the way he answers our prayers and blesses our efforts in his service. (Ps. 65:2; Phil. 4:6, 7) We will be blessed as we cultivate the habit of relying fully on Jehovah. (Phil. 4:13) Then, as we work with him in his service, we can meditate on his goodness manifest in so many ways. (1 Thess. 5:17, 18; Eph. 5:20; 1 Pet. 4:7) By our obeying his commands and by daily meditating on his ways, Jehovah will be real to us. (Ps. 37:30, 31; 1:1-3)

(Heb. 11:6; Rom. 8:38, 39; yb p. 180, par. 4) We must mentally prepare ourselves so that if need be we too can encourage our loved ones to faithfulness in the face of death.

25 min: Identifying the Modern “Faithful and Discreet Slave” Class.
If we are to prove ourselves loyal to Jehovah and his organization in spite of increasing pressures and obstacles to our worship, necessary to cooperate with and serve under direction of “faithful and discreet slave,” to whom ‘all the Master’s belongings’ have been entrusted. Thus vital to identify modern “slave” class.
(17 min.) Chairman to read Matthew 24:45-47. Ask audience to identify that “slave” today. Make sure following points are covered: (1) Noteworthy that Matthew 24:46 shows “slave” found providing food upon Master’s return. Explain. (ka pp. 342-347) (2) Historical evidence clear that at time of Christ’s second coming, in 1914, only one organization was feeding people spiritual food “at the proper time” and had its “identifying marks.” (w62, pp. 760, 761) (3) Scriptural credentials of “slave” strong. (w60, pp. 437, 438) (4) “Slave” not one person, but all the members of spirit-begotten ones on earth as class at any given time. (ka pp. 340, 341; li p. 183) “Slave” class provides food for individual members of anointed, the “domestics.” (li pp. 183-185) (5) Slave now enjoys new position; appointed over all Christ’s earthly belongings (Matt. 24:47), all the spiritual things that belong to him here on earth in connection with his established heavenly kingdom. (ka pp. 353-357) (6) As in first century, certain members of slave class selected to be governing body, which, directed by holy spirit, makes appointments of overseers and ministerial servants. (Acts 14:23; w71, pp. 755-762)
(8 min.) Get observations of audience on following points: How can we show we are deeply convinced that this is Jehovah’s organization and that no man, but Christ Jesus, is the appointed Head of it? How can we daily work with “slave” class, Christ’s “brothers,” yet on earth, loyally and willingly sharing in giving final witness? In what ways do we see need of Jehovah’s organization and wisdom of cooperating with it and its appointed elders and ministerial servants?

Noah’s Ark No Minor Vessel
● The ark that God commanded Noah to build may sometimes be thought of as an insignificant vessel. (Gen. 6:14, 15) But not so, says a recent article on supersize tankers: “The ark had to be one of the largest vessels to ride the seas until even fairly modern days, for at about one and one-half feet to the cubit it was 450 feet long, 75 feet in beam and 45 feet high. This was bigger by far than most of the famous wooden sailing craft built since Noah’s time and surpassed even many early steam-powered steel ships, thereby qualifying Noah as one of the master shipbuilders of all time​—although it must also be assumed that he received more than a little help from a higher source.”​—Oil Lifestream of Progress, Number Three, 1973.

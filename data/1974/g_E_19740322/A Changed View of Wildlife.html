<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">● “One of the best rough-and-ready naturalists in the Canadian north woods is a former trapper called Long Joe,” reports the volume <em>Marvels &amp; Mysteries of Our Animal World. </em>Why did he suddenly end his trapping activity? “One day a she-bear was caught in Long Joe’s trap,” says the account. “When he got to the trap, the bear’s mate was there. The big, shaggy brute had his arms around her, hugging her and sobbing . . . Long Joe has never trapped another living thing.”</p>

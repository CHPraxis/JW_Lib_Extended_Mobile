<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Or did the races of mankind have different origins?</p>

<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Consider the evidence in the 192-page, hardbound book <em>Is the Bible Really the Word of God?</em></p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Other questions, too, will be answered, such as: Do the Bible and ancient history agree? Are the miracles of the Bible true? Are the Bibleâ€™s moral standards consistent?</p>

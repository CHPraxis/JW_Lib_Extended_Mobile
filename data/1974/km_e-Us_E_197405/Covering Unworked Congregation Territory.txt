Covering Unworked Congregation Territory
1 Publishers or pioneers interested in helping a congregation to cover territory that it has and that has not been worked for at least a year should review the information in the April 1973 Kingdom Ministry article “Covering Unworked Territory.”
2 The presiding overseer can then send a letter to the Society listing the names of car group captains and show how far the car group could travel and how many territories of about 200 homes could be worked by each group listed. This information should be sent to the Society about May 15 by the presiding overseer.
3 Where there is congregation territory needing to be worked within the distance specified, the Society will write to the presiding overseer, advising him of the name of the congregation needing help, etc. This information can then be given to the ones who have volunteered. Where there are no congregations within the distance specified that need help, no reply will be sent.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">With Jehovah’s blessing, we did very well! There were 498,177 who shared in field service during this winter month. That is the highest number of publishers who have shared in Jehovah’s service in this country in any one month except December, when we were distributing the “Kingdom News.” It is 61,718, or 14.1 percent, more than shared in field service last February. It is a fine indication that many who shared with us in the tract work are determined to show their love for Jehovah and for their neighbors by continued activity in Kingdom-preaching. It is an indication that you brothers appreciate the love that Jehovah has shown you.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">And Jehovah blessed you with good results in your activity. You placed 150,067 subscriptions, 9,379,160 magazines and 547,274 books, which is an excellent report. No doubt these publications will aid many who are seeking Jehovah and seeking righteousness.</p>

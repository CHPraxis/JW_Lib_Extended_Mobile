<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>Publishers or pioneers interested in helping a congregation to cover territory that it has and that has not been worked for at least a year should review the information in the April 1973 <em>Kingdom Ministry </em>article “Covering Unworked Territory.”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>The presiding overseer can then send a letter to the Society listing the names of car group captains and show how far the car group could travel and how many territories of about 200 homes could be worked by each group listed. This information should be sent to the Society about May 15 by the presiding overseer.</p>

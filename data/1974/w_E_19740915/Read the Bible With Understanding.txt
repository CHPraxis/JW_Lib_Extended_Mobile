Read the Bible With Understanding
Do you desire to understand God’s Word? The Bible in Living English, translated by Steven T. Byington and published in 1972, is such an easy-to-understand Bible. It uses 20th-century English and yet conveys the flavor of the times in which the Bible was written. It has large print, marginal notes and a dark-blue hard cover with gold-embossed title; 1,598 pages. Only $6, postpaid.
Please send The Bible in Living English, also, as a premium, the booklet “This Good News of the Kingdom.” I enclose $6.

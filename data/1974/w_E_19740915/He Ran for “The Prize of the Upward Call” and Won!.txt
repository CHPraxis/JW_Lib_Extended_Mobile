He Ran for “The Prize of the Upward Call” and Won!
On July 30, 1974, at the age of 86, Thomas James Sullivan finished his earthly course. He was born on May 14, 1888, in County Kerry, Ireland. In March 1916 he was baptized, and in 1924 he and his wife Evelyn entered full-time service in the Brooklyn Bethel. His intimate friends affectionately called him “Bud,” and as the Superintendent of Evangelists he was in charge of the Watchtower Society’s Service Department for many years. In this capacity he regularly visited his Christian brothers who were imprisoned in the United States because of their neutrality during World War II and thereafter. On October 31, 1932, he was made a member of the board of directors of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania; he was also one of the eleven-member governing body of Jehovah’s witnesses. When he died at Watchtower Farm, where he had lived for the past eleven months, he was able to say, as did the apostle Paul, “I have fought the fine fight, I have run the course to the finish, I have observed the faith.”​—2 Tim. 4:7; Phil. 3:14.

Applying Bible Principles Saved a Marriage
THE WIFE of a police officer in Massachusetts began to study the Bible with Jehovah’s witnesses, but her husband began to oppose. After a period of separation, however, he consented to studying the Bible in the hope of saving his marriage. But the officers with whom he worked began to make fun of him. Due to this and other pressures he stopped studying. Soon he fell back into his former ways​—drinking heavily and having many problems at home. This led to another separation.
As to what happened next, he relates: “After a time my wife informed me that she was filing for a divorce, for which she had Scriptural and legal grounds. Having six children and still caring very much for them and my wife, I did not want a divorce. I called the Witness who originally studied the Bible with me and asked if he would study with me again.”
Because of this man’s applying what he was learning, his wife began to see that he was really changing his ways. Therefore, when asked by her husband whether they might try again, she accepted him back. Both are now united in building a happy family according to the guidelines found in God’s Word.

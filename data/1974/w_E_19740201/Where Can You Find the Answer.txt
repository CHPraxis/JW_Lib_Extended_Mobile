Where Can You Find the Answer?
Do you have trouble in finding answers you want? The Watch Tower Publications Indexes can help you. They index all subjects, Biblical and others, discussed in the Watchtower and Awake! magazines, as well as in other publications of Jehovah’s witnesses.
The 1973 Index is now available. It costs 10 cents. The 1971 and 1972 Indexes are also 10 cents each. The 1930-1960 and 1966-1970 Indexes cost $1 each; the 1961-1965 Index is 50 cents.

District Assemblies Planned for 1974
LAST year, 1,402,238 persons in North America, Europe and the Far East attended a delightful series of international assemblies held by Jehovah’s witnesses between late June and mid-August. Since then, hundreds of thousands more have been enjoying the same program in South America, Africa and the South Pacific.
What plans have been made for 1974? If it be Jehovah’s will, there will be an even larger number of assemblies than last year. In the United States, for example, over three times as many assembly sites have been selected. This should reduce the need for extensive travel and make it convenient for more persons to attend.
In view of the nearness of the foretold “day of Jehovah,” we urge all persons who seek the goodwill of God to put forth every effort to be present at one of these assemblies. Each assembly will provide a four-day program of timely information. Sessions will be held during mornings and afternoons, Thursday through Sunday, unless stated otherwise. Except for those places for which another language is shown, the programs at all assemblies listed here will be only in English.
This list of assembly dates and cities is published to help you to begin now to make your plans to attend. Further details will be provided later. All these assemblies are arranged by the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society on behalf of Jehovah’s witnesses.
If you are a person who longs for the time when rulership by God will bring righteous conditions to this earth, we encourage you: Do not miss any of the program!

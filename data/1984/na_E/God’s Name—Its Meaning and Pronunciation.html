<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">ONE of the Bible writers asked: “Who has gathered the wind in the hollow of both hands? Who has wrapped up the waters in a mantle? Who has made all the ends of the earth to rise? <em>What is his name </em>and what the name of his son, in case you know?” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:30:4-20:30:4" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Proverbs 30:4</a>) How can <em>we </em>find out what God’s name is? That is an important question. The creation is a powerful proof that God must exist, but it does not tell us his name. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:1:20-45:1:20" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Romans 1:20</a>) In fact, we could never know God’s name <em>unless the Creator himself told us. </em>And he has done that in his own Book, the Holy Bible.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">On one celebrated occasion, God pronounced his own name, repeating it in the hearing of Moses. Moses wrote an account of that event that has been preserved in the Bible down to our day. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:34:5-2:34:5" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Exodus 34:5</a>) God even wrote his name with his own “finger.” When he had given Moses what we today call the Ten Commandments, God miraculously wrote them down. The record says: “Now as soon as [God] had finished speaking with him on Mount Sinai he proceeded to give Moses two tablets of the Testimony, tablets of stone written on by God’s finger.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:31:18-2:31:18" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Exodus 31:18</a>) God’s name appears eight times in the original Ten Commandments. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:20:1-2:20:17" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Exodus 20:1-17</a>) Thus God himself has revealed his name to man both verbally and in writing. So, what is that name?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">In the Hebrew language it is written יהוה. These four letters, called the Tetragrammaton, are read from right to left in Hebrew and can be represented in many modern languages as YHWH or JHVH. God’s name, represented by these four consonants, appears almost 7,000 times in the original “Old Testament,” or Hebrew Scriptures.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The name is a form of a Hebrew verb <em>ha</em>·<em>wah</em>ʹ (הוה), meaning “to become,” and actually signifies “He Causes to Become.”<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> Thus, God’s name identifies him as the One who progressively fulfills his promises and unfailingly realizes his purposes. Only the true God could bear such a meaningful name.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Do you remember the different <span id="page7" class="pageNum" data-no="7" data-before-text="7"></span>ways that God’s name appeared in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:83:18-19:83:18" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Psalm 83:18</a>, as set out in the previous section (page 5)? Two of those translations had mere titles (“the L<span class="altsize">ORD</span>,” the “Eternal”) as substitutes for God’s name. But in two of them, Yahweh and Jehovah, you can see the four letters of God’s name. However, the pronunciation is different. Why?</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="ss"><strong>How Is God’s Name Pronounced?</strong></p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">The truth is, nobody knows for sure how the name of God was originally pronounced. Why not? Well, the first language used in writing the Bible was Hebrew, and when the Hebrew language was written down, the writers wrote only consonants​—not vowels. Hence, when the inspired writers wrote God’s name, they naturally did the same thing and wrote only the consonants.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">While ancient Hebrew was an everyday spoken language, this presented no problem. The pronunciation of the Name was familiar to the Israelites and when they saw it in writing they <span id="page8" class="pageNum" data-no="8" data-before-text="8"></span>supplied the vowels without thinking (just as, for an English reader, the abbreviation “Ltd.” represents “Limited” and “bldg.” represents “building”).</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Two things happened to change this situation. First, a superstitious idea arose among the Jews that it was wrong to say the divine name out loud; so when they came to it in their Bible reading they uttered the Hebrew word <em>’Adho</em>·<em>naiʹ </em>(“Sovereign Lord”). Further, as time went by, the ancient Hebrew language itself ceased to be spoken in everyday conversation, and in this way the original Hebrew pronunciation of God’s name was eventually forgotten.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">In order to ensure that the pronunciation of the Hebrew language as a whole would not be lost, Jewish scholars of the second half of the first millennium C.E. invented a system of points to represent the missing vowels, and they placed these around the consonants in the Hebrew Bible. Thus, both vowels <em>and </em>consonants were written down, and the pronunciation as it was at that time was preserved.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">When it came to God’s name, instead of putting the proper vowel signs around it, in most cases they put other vowel signs to remind the reader that he should say <em>’Adho</em>·<em>naiʹ.</em> From this came the spelling Iehouah, and, eventually, Jehovah became the accepted pronunciation of the divine name in English. This retains the essential elements of God’s name from the Hebrew original.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="ss"><strong>Which Pronunciation Will You Use?</strong></p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Where, though, did pronunciations like Yahweh come from? These are forms that have been suggested by modern scholars trying to deduce the original pronunciation of God’s name. Some​—though not all—​feel that the Israelites before the time of Jesus probably pronounced God’s name <span id="page9" class="pageNum" data-no="9" data-before-text="9"></span>Yahweh. But no one can be sure. Perhaps they pronounced it that way, perhaps not.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">Nevertheless, many prefer the pronunciation Jehovah. Why? Because it has a currency and familiarity that Yahweh does not have. Would it not, though, be better to use the form that might be closer to the original pronunciation? Not really, for that is not the custom with Bible names.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">To take the most prominent example, consider the name of Jesus. Do <em>you </em>know how Jesus’ family and friends addressed him in day-to-day conversation while he was growing up in Nazareth? The truth is, no human knows for certain, although it may have been something like Yeshua (or perhaps Yehoshua). It certainly was <em>not </em>Jesus.</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">However, when the accounts of his life were written in the Greek language, the inspired writers did not try to preserve that original Hebrew pronunciation. Rather, they rendered the name in Greek, <em>I</em>·<em>e</em>·<em>sousʹ. </em>Today, it is rendered differently according to the language of the reader of the Bible. <span id="page10" class="pageNum" data-no="10" data-before-text="10"></span>Spanish Bible readers encounter <em>Jes</em>ú<em>s </em>(pronounced <em>Hes</em>·<em>soosʹ</em>). Italians spell it <em>Ges</em>ù (pronounced <em>Djay</em>·<em>zooʹ</em>). And Germans spell it <em>Jesus </em>(pronounced <em>Yayʹsoos</em>).</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">Must we stop using the name of Jesus because most of us, or even all of us, do not really know its original pronunciation? So far, no translator has suggested this. We like to use the name, for it identifies the beloved Son of God, Jesus Christ, who gave his lifeblood for us. Would it be showing honor to Jesus to remove all mention of his name in the Bible and replace it with a mere title like “Teacher,” or “Mediator”? Of course not! We can relate to Jesus when we use his name the way it is commonly pronounced in our language.</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">Similar comments could be made regarding all the names we read in the Bible. We pronounce them in our own language and do not try to imitate the original pronunciation. Thus we say “Jeremiah,” not <em>Yir·meyaʹhu. </em>Similarly we say Isaiah, although in his own day this prophet likely was known as <em>Yeshaʽ·yaʹhu. </em>Even scholars who are aware of the original pronunciation of these names use the modern pronunciation, not the ancient, when speaking about them.</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">And the same is true with the name Jehovah. Even though the modern pronunciation Jehovah might not be exactly the way it was pronounced originally, this in no way detracts from the importance of the name. It identifies the Creator, the living God, the Most High to whom Jesus said: “Our Father in the heavens, let your name be sanctified.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:9-40:6:9" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Matthew 6:9</a>.</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="ss"><strong>‘It Cannot Be Supplanted’</strong></p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">While many translators favor the pronunciation Yahweh, the <em>New World Translation </em>and also a number of other translations continue the use <span id="page11" class="pageNum" data-no="11" data-before-text="11"></span>of the form Jehovah because of people’s familiarity with it for centuries. Moreover, it preserves, equally with other forms, the four letters of the Tetragrammaton, <em>YHWH </em>or <em>JHVH.</em><span data-fnid="2" class="fn">b<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="2"></span></span></p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">Earlier, the German professor Gustav Friedrich Oehler made a similar decision for much the same reason. He discussed various pronunciations and concluded: “From this point onward I use the word Jehovah, because, as a matter of fact, this name has now become more naturalized in our vocabulary, and cannot be supplanted.”​—<em>Theologie des Alten Testaments </em>(Theology of the Old Testament), second edition, published in 1882, page 143.</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">Similarly, in his <em>Grammaire de l’h</em>é<em>breu biblique </em>(Grammar of Biblical Hebrew), 1923 edition, in a footnote on page 49, Jesuit scholar Paul Joüon states: “In our translations, instead of the (hypothetical) form <em>Yahweh, </em>we have used the form <em>J</em>é<em>hovah </em>. . . which is the conventional literary form used in French.” In many other languages Bible translators use a similar form, as indicated in the box on page 8.</p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">Is it, then, wrong to use a form like Yahweh? Not at all. It is just that the form Jehovah is likely to meet with a quicker response from the reader because it is the form that has been “naturalized” into most languages. The important thing is that we use the name and declare it to others. “Give thanks to Jehovah, you people! Call upon his name. Make known among the peoples his dealings. Make mention that his name is put on high.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:12:4-23:12:4" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Isaiah 12:4</a>.</p>
<p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb">Let us see how God’s servants have acted in harmony with that command through the centuries.</p>

<p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="sc"><strong>Different scholars have different ideas about how the name YHWH was originally pronounced.</strong></p>
<p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="sc">  In <em>The Mysterious Name of Y.H.W.H., </em>page 74, Dr. M. Reisel said that the “vocalisation of the Tetragrammaton must originally have been Y<sup>e</sup>HūàH or YaHūàH.”</p>
<p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="sc">  Canon D. D. Williams of Cambridge held that the “evidence indicates, nay almost proves, that Jāhwéh was not the true pronunciation of the Tetragrammaton . . . The Name itself was probably JĀHÔH.”​—<em>Zeitschrift für die alttestamentliche Wissenschaft </em>(Periodical for Old Testament Knowledge), 1936, Volume 54, page 269.</p>
<p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="sc">  In the glossary of the French <em>Revised Segond Version, </em>page 9, the following comment is made: “The pronunciation <em>Yahv</em>é used in some recent translations is based on a few ancient witnesses, but they are not conclusive. If one takes into account personal names that include the divine name, such as the Hebrew name of the prophet Elijah (<em>Eliyahou</em>) the pronunciation might just as well be <em>Yaho </em>or <em>Yahou.”</em></p>
<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="sc">  In 1749 the German Bible scholar Teller told of some different pronunciations of God’s name he had read: “Diodorus from Sicily, Macrobius, Clemens Alexandrinus, Saint Jerome and Origenes wrote <em>Jao; </em>the Samaritans, Epiphanius, Theodoretus, <em>Jahe, </em>or <em>Jave; </em>Ludwig Cappel reads <em>Javoh; </em>Drusius, <em>Jahve; </em>Hottinger, <em>Jehva; </em>Mercerus, <em>Jehovah; </em>Castellio, <em>Jovah; </em>and le Clerc, <em>Jawoh, </em>or <em>Javoh.”</em></p>
<p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="sc">  Thus it is evident that the original pronunciation of God’s name is no longer known. Nor is it really important. If it were, then God himself would have made sure that it was preserved for us to use. The important thing is to use God’s name according to its conventional pronunciation in our own language.</p>

<p id="p79" data-pid="79" class="sc">  Additionally, French composer Arthur Honegger’s oratorio “King David” gives prominence to the name Jehovah, and renowned French author Victor Hugo used it in over 30 of his works. Both he and Lamartine wrote poems entitled “Jehovah.”</p>
<p id="p80" data-pid="80" class="sc">  In the book <em>Deutsche Taler </em>(The German Taler), published in 1967 by Germany’s Federal Bank, there is a picture of what is one of the oldest coins bearing the name “Jehovah,” a 1634 Reichstaler from the Duchy of Silesia.

<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu"> 1. What future was predicted back in 1864?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb">WHAT will tomorrow bring? People would like to know. But how unsatisfying their forecasts! To illustrate: Back in 1864 naturalist Alfred R. Wallace predicted this man-made ‘future for the human race’: “Each one will . . . work out his own happiness in relation to that of his fellows; . . . the well balanced moral faculties will never permit any one to transgress on the equal freedom of others; . . . each man will be guided by the best of laws; a thorough appreciation of the rights, and a perfect sympathy with the feelings, of all about him.” Why, Wallace foretold that man would convert our earth into “as bright a paradise as ever haunted the dreams of seer or poet”!</p>
<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu"> 2. The failure of mere human forecasts leads to what questions?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>The author of those words died just nine months before mankind was plunged into the dark night of World War I. Where, then, was that ‘bright paradise’ filled with compassionate people? And what of today? Unquestionably, ‘the love of the greater number has cooled off’​—and that despite any predictions to the contrary. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:12-40:24:12" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matthew 24:12</a>) But should this make us doubt all prophecy? Jehovah God identifies himself as the One ‘who reverses wise men and makes their knowledge foolish, while making good his servant’s word.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:44:24-23:44:26" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Isaiah 44:24-26</a>, <em>By</em>) However, some may ask: ‘Can we rely on Bible prophecies?

<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>There is an abundance of evidence to prove that we can, indeed, rely on Bible prophecy. For instance, prophecies of ruin and of restoration came true in the case of God’s ancient people, the Israelites. When they faithfully worshiped Jehovah, they prospered in their God-given ‘land of milk and honey.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:20:24-3:20:24" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Leviticus 20:24;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:4:1-11:4:1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 1 Kings 4:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:4:20-11:4:20" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> 20</a>) But they had been forewarned that this virtual paradise would become a devastated wilderness if they disobeyed. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:26:27-3:26:35" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Leviticus 26:27-35</a>) In the year 607 B.C.E., some 900 years after Moses recorded Leviticus, the Babylonians conquered Judah and Jerusalem. Not long thereafter, Jews remaining in the land fled to Egypt, and the foretold desolation was complete.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:39:8-24:39:10" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Jeremiah 39:8-10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:40:5-24:40:5" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 40:5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:41:2-24:41:2" data-bid="6-3" class="b"> 41:2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:43:1-24:43:7" data-bid="6-4" class="b"> 43:1-7</a>.</p>

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>More than a century before Jerusalem’s destruction, however, Jehovah had promised to return his repentant people to their desolated homeland and to restore its paradisaic splendor.

<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu"> 5. Through Ezekiel, what had Jehovah foretold regarding Tyre?</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>Divinely inspired prophecy also was fulfilled upon the ancient city of Tyre, rightly called “the Queen of the Sea.” Concerning this Phoenician seaport, Jehovah had declared: “I am against you, O Tyre, and I will bring up against you many nations . . . Here I am bringing against Tyre Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon . . . and your towers he will pull down . . . And your stones and your woodwork and your dust they will place in the very midst of the water. . . . And I will make you a shining, bare surface of a crag.

<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu"> 6. In fulfillment of prophecy, what happened to ancient Tyre?</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup>Such a downfall seemed impossible. According to the Jewish historian Josephus, the Babylonian siege of Tyre lasted 13 years. (Josephus, <em>Against Apion, </em>Book I, Chapter 21) History does not record how effective Nebuchadnezzar’s efforts were, although the loss of Tyrian property and lives must have been great. A later prophetic pronouncement through Zechariah indicated that God would destroy the city completely. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/38:9:3-38:9:4" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Zechariah 9:3, 4</a>) This prophecy was fulfilled nearly 200 years after it was given. By then those living in the nearby island city of Tyre felt secure behind its formidable walls. However, in 332 B.C.E., the forces of Alexander the Great overthrew that island city, using debris from mainland Tyre to build a causeway leading to the island. Since then this artificial peninsula has been enlarged by sand deposited there by the water. Moreover, in the present seaport village, fishermen can be seen drying their nets​—another fulfillment of prophecy. Certainly, Jehovah’s Word is sure!</p>

<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu"> 7, 8. (a) Through his prophets, what had Jehovah foretold regarding Nineveh? (b) Why would it have seemed impossible for Nineveh to become a “desolate waste”?</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><sup>7 </sup>God’s prophetic Word also proved true in the case of ancient Nineveh, the capital of the Assyrian Empire that oppressed Jehovah’s people. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:17:1-12:17:6" data-bid="13-1" class="b">2 Kings 17:1-6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:5:6-13:5:6" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 1 Chronicles 5:6,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:5:26-13:5:26" data-bid="13-3" class="b"> 26</a>) Concerning Nineveh, at the height of its power Jehovah declared through his prophets: “Plunder silver, you men; plunder gold; as there is no limit to the things in arrangement. . . . Emptiness and voidness, and a city laid waste! . . . Woe to the city of bloodshed.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/34:2:9-34:2:10" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Nahum 2:9, 10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/34:3:1-34:3:1" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> 3:1</a>) “He will make Nineveh a desolate waste, . . . and in the midst of her, droves will certainly lie stretched out.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/36:2:13-36:2:14" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Zephaniah 2:13, 14</a>.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><sup>8 </sup>How could this possibly occur? Nineveh was “the great city.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/32:1:2-32:1:2" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Jonah 1:2</a>) According to ancient historian Diodorus, Nineveh had a 100-foot (30-m) <span id="page12" class="pageNum" data-no="12" data-before-text="12"></span>wall, wide enough for three chariots abreast to travel upon it. In the prophet Jonah’s day (the ninth century B.C.E.), more than 120,000 men inhabited the city. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/32:4:11-32:4:11" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Jonah 4:11</a>) Was all of this to become a “desolate waste”?</p>
<p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu"> 9. How has Nineveh supplied further proof that Jehovah’s Word is sure?</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><sup>9 </sup>In 632 B.C.E., 16 or more years after Zephaniah’s prophecy, the Babylonians and the Medes besieged Nineveh. According to Diodorus (Book II, Chapter 27), “heavy and continuous rains” caused the Euphrates River to overflow its banks. It “both inundated a portion of the city and broke down the walls for a distance of twenty stades.” Nineveh was taken. “They carried off much spoil from the city and temple-area and turned the city into a ruin-mound and heap of debris,” states the ancient <em>Babylonian Chronicle. </em>Nineveh became a lost city for centuries. Its overthrow certainly was “good news” to God’s people, who were reassured that “Jehovah is good” and “is cognizant of those seeking refuge in him.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/34:1:7-34:1:7" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Nahum 1:7,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/34:1:15-34:1:15" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> 15</a>) Today, a visitor to Nineveh’s ruins in Iraq may see sheep grazing near its mounds, just as foretold.

<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><sup>10 </sup>In a prophetic vision, Daniel saw a two-horned ram killed by a male goat with “a conspicuous horn.” This horn was broken and four horns replaced it. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:8:1-27:8:8" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Daniel 8:1-8</a>) What could this mean? The angel Gabriel explained: “The ram that you saw possessing the two horns stands for the kings of Media and Persia. And the hairy he-goat stands for the king of Greece; and as for the great horn that was between its eyes, it stands for the first king. And that one having been broken, so that there were four that finally stood up instead of it, there are four kingdoms from his nation that will stand up, but not with his power.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:8:16-27:8:16" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Daniel 8:16,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:8:20-27:8:22" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> 20-22</a>.</p>

<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><sup>11 </sup>Mighty Babylon had been conquered by Medo-Persia, the envisioned two-horned ram. But God’s angel had foretold that “the hairy he-goat,” Greece, would kill the ram. This is exactly what occurred in the fourth century B.C.E., when Greek-speaking armies of Alexander the Great overthrew the Medo-Persian Empire. However, Alexander unexpectedly died at the age of 32 in 323 B.C.E., leaving behind no qualified successor. With Alexander’s <span id="page13" class="pageNum" data-no="13" data-before-text="13"></span>death, the “conspicuous horn” was broken. But what about the foretold ‘four horns that finally stood up instead of it’?</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><sup>12 </sup>Alexander had a number of generals, but four of them finally established themselves in power. So it was that the “conspicuous horn” was broken and eventually was replaced by ‘four horns,’ or “four kingdoms.” By 301 B.C.E., these generals had established themselves in power: Ptolemy Lagus (Egypt and Palestine); Seleucus Nicator (Mesopotamia and Syria); Cassander (Macedonia and Greece); and Lysimachus (Thrace and Asia Minor).<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> Again we see that Jehovah’s Word is sure.</p>

<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><sup>13 </sup>The book of Daniel also provides particularly outstanding evidence that Jehovah’s Word is sure. Centuries in advance, Daniel was inspired to pinpoint the time for the Messiah’s appearance on earth. This thrilling prophecy said, in part: “There are seventy weeks that have been determined upon your people and upon your holy city, in order to terminate the transgression, and to finish off sin, and to make atonement for error, and to bring in righteousness for times indefinite, and to imprint a seal upon vision and prophet, and to anoint the Holy of Holies. And you should know and have the insight that from the going forth of the word to restore and to rebuild Jerusalem until Messiah the Leader, there will be seven weeks, also sixty-two weeks.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:9:24-27:9:25" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Daniel 9:24, 25</a>.</p>

<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><sup>14 </sup>Were these “weeks” literal? No, for all the things prophesied here regarding the Messiah did not occur within 70 weeks, or less than a year and a half. These proved to be “weeks” in which each day counted for one year. (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:14:33-4:14:34" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Numbers 14:33, 34</a>.) “The word to restore and to rebuild Jerusalem” went forth in the 20th year of Persian King Artaxerxes (Longimanus).

This is to be attributed . . . not to an intensification of Roman persecution but to the prevalent belief induced <em>by the popular chronology of that day </em>. . .

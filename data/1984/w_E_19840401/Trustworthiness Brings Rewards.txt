Trustworthiness Brings Rewards
A chemist (pharmacist) in South Africa heard that Jehovah’s Witnesses were building a new printing complex in that country. He said to a Witness employee: “I know that your church is putting up a new building at Roodekrans and I know that you would like to contribute toward it. There are some lines in my store that I want you to sell and I am willing to give you R1 [92c, U.S.] commission on each item.” She agreed and in time was presented with R634. The chemist, who intends to continue this arrangement, later explained to an inquirer: “I have so much respect for this woman because of her hardworking example and trustworthiness. It is impossible for me to express my appreciation for her service in words, so I thought this would be a better way.”

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A youth attending school in Sierra Leone was asked by his teachers to attend church services. He answered that he already was attending religious meetings at the Kingdom Hall of Jehovah’s Witnesses and then related some of the things he had learned at such meetings. One teaching he explained was how God’s Kingdom will bring peace to the earth and eliminate sickness and death.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:3-66:21:4" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Revelation 21:3, 4</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“Do you know about these things?” he asked his teachers.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“No,” they answered.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">“These things and many more I have learned just by going to the Kingdom Hall,” he continued. “So I do not see any reason to attend church services where these things are not known.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:21:16-40:21:16" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matthew 21:16</a>.</p>

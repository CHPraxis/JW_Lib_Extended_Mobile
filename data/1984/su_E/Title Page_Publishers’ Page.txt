Survival Into a New Earth
Survival has become a major concern in our times. But what confronts mankind is far more awesome than a nuclear war. It is an accounting with the Creator himself. Astounding Bible prophecies show clearly that there will be survivors and that grand prospects await them right on this earth. This book has been published to help you to be among them.

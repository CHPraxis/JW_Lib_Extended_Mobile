<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn">● Brothers arranging bus or plane tours of the Society’s facilities in Brooklyn and at Watchtower Farms are requested to inform the Society of such tours at least one day in advance of the visit. We need to know where the tour is originating, how many are in the group, the language in which the tour should be conducted, the name of the group captain and the expected time of arrival. By having this information ahead of time, better planning can be given to arrangements for a sufficient number of tour guides to assist those wishing to see the Society’s facilities. Your cooperation in this regard will help assure that all visitors will enjoy a good tour.</p>

<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sn">● When new songs unfamiliar to the brothers are used at congregation meetings, it might be well to play the music through to the end of the first verse or chorus and return to the introduction before the singing begins. Also, music for the new songs may be played softly before and after the meetings. This will help acquaint the brothers with the new melodies.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sn">● There are still a considerable number of 1984 calendars in English and Spanish available. These may be obtained at the reduced rate of 25c each, as long as the supply lasts. Congregations may submit orders on the regular literature order form.</p>

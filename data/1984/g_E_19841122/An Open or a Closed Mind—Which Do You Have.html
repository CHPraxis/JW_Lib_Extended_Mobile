<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">PEOPLE do have difficulties getting along with one another, do they not? And although most of us like to think of ourselves as being open-minded, let us ask ourselves with complete honesty: Is the narrow-minded and bigoted person really always the “other fellow”?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">In reality your mind may be more closed than you imagine. Do you at times say: “Two things I never talk about are religion and politics”? Or do you turn up your nose at foods you have not eaten before? “Snails? Never!” Or how do you feel about unfamiliar types of medical treatment? “Acupuncture? Pure quackery!” Or do you “know”​—as, for example, “everyone” in Germany does—​that Gypsies are thieves, North Germans are stubborn, everyone from Berlin is a loudmouth, Swabians are stingy and foreigners are lazy? Of course, similar ideas are found everywhere​—yes, in your country too.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="ss"><strong><em>What Is an Open Mind?</em></strong></p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">An open mind is free from the fetters of prejudice, which by one dictionary is defined as follows: “A judgment or opinion, favorable or unfavorable, formed beforehand or without due examination; a mental decision based on other grounds than reason or justice; especially, a premature or adversely biased opinion.”</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">A necessary part of life is that we make decisions and reach judgments. But decisions made “without due examination” or judgments reached “on other grounds than reason or justice” are evidences of a closed mind.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Having an open mind, on the other hand, means to be receptive to new information <span id="page4" class="pageNum" data-no="4" data-before-text="4"></span>and ideas. It means being willing to examine and to evaluate information without a biased attitude. By retaining what is worthwhile and rejecting what is worthless, we can reach definite conclusions on a solid basis and still leave our minds open to further revision should additional information become available at a future time. He who feels he has learned it all can be sure that this attitude will prevent him from ever learning more.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="ss"><strong><em>Why People Have Closed Minds</em></strong></p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">A closed mind may indicate lack of knowledge. We may know so little about a subject, or have information so distorted or incomplete, that the facts necessary to reach proper conclusions are missing. For example, if you are living in Germany and are so sure that everyone from Berlin is a loudmouth, ask yourself just how many people from Berlin you know. Enough to judge several million people accurately? Perhaps more careful thought will lead you to the realization that you have met more loudmouths from Hamburg, Frankfurt or Munich than you ever have met from Berlin.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">A closed mind may betray a lack of interest in the subject or a reluctance to look into the matter. In fact, it could even be a sign of uncertainty or doubt. For example, if we are unable to defend our religious views, we may find ourselves lashing out against those who challenge our beliefs, not with logical arguments, but with slurs and innuendos. This smacks of prejudice and of a closed mind.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">A closed mind may also indicate a selfish desire to retain certain advantages that an open mind might cause us to lose. In some countries racial groups have been suppressed so that other groups can enjoy certain privileges. Unwilling to share these with others, the privileged groups retreat to the prejudicial position of “we are better than you,” closing their minds to all evidence to the contrary.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">Are you open-minded enough to consider the possibility that you may not be? It will pay to find out. Whereas an open mind can serve to your advantage, a closed one will almost certainly serve to your detriment.</p>

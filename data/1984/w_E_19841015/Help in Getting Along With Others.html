<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Good music can be such a help. A mother from Massachusetts, U.S.A., writes: “The pressures seem to be mounting. Not only do I get ‘world-weary,’ but it’s becoming easier to dwell on the faults and imperfections of others in the congregation. I’m beginning to really cherish these tapes​—they seem to get my mind ‘back on the right track.’ How could I be having contempt for a Christian brother or sister when I am singing in my heart about Jehovah?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“My favorite melody is Tape #2, Side A. I call it the ‘Kingly Beginning’​—how regal sounding! My six-year-old daughter likes to play Tape #1, Side B where there are soft and mellow songs played. Especially when she is not feeling well does she ask for this and we sit and rock in the chair and listen to them.”</p>

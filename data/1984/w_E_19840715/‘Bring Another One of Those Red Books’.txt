‘Bring Another One of Those Red Books’
During a regular congregation meeting of Jehovah’s Witnesses in the midwestern United States, the telephone rang. “No one can remember the last time the phone rang during a meeting,” one of those present wrote. A discussion was in progress on the use of the publication You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth in the field ministry. “Guess what the lady wanted!” the letter continued. “You guessed it​—‘another one of those red books’! She had received one earlier and wanted another one for her daughter who is grown and away from home.”
In the two years now since its release over 15 million copies of this beautifully illustrated Bible study aid have been printed in over 55 languages. Get your copy, and you will understand why it is so popular.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"><strong>▪ </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:4:10-54:4:10" data-bid="1-1" class="b"><strong>First Timothy 4:10</strong></a> <strong>calls God “a Savior of all sorts of men, especially of faithful ones.” So will any unfaithful ones be saved?</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">No. The point is that salvation is assured particularly for those exercising faith.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The apostle Paul advised Timothy that a benefit of godly devotion is that it “holds promise of the life now and that which is to come.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:4:6-54:4:8" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Timothy 4:6-8</a>) Then Paul wrote: “For to this end we are working hard and exerting ourselves, because we have rested our hope on a living God, who is a Savior of all sorts of men, especially of faithful ones.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:4:10-54:4:10" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Timothy 4:10</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">God holds out to all men the possibility of salvation. As Paul wrote: “There is one God, and one mediator between God and men, a man, Christ Jesus, who gave himself a corresponding ransom <em>for all.” </em>(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:2:5-54:2:6" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 Timothy 2:5, 6</a>) But who will respond to the ransom, choosing life rather than death? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:30:19-5:30:20" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 30:19, 20</a>) Some people reject the Christian message of salvation. In others, the ‘seed’ takes root and grows for a while, but later they let opposition, material interests or other concerns come between them and salvation.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:13:3-40:13:8" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Matthew 13:3-8</a>.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">So while the salvation God holds out is available potentially to everyone, the way things turn out will prove that salvation is particularly for “faithful ones.” The apostle Peter thus urged: “For this reason, brothers, all the more do your utmost to make the calling and choosing of you sure for yourselves; for if you keep on doing these things you will by no means ever fail.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:1:10-61:1:10" data-bid="7-1" class="b">2 Peter 1:10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:3:16-43:3:16" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> John 3:16</a>.</p>

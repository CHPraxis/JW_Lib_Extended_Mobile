<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">During a regular congregation meeting of Jehovah’s Witnesses in the midwestern United States, the telephone rang. “No one can remember the last time the phone rang during a meeting,” one of those present wrote. A discussion was in progress on the use of the publication <em>You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth </em>in the field ministry. “Guess what the lady wanted!” the letter continued. “You guessed it​—‘another one of those red books’! She had received one earlier and wanted another one for her daughter who is grown and away from home.”</p>

A True Help in Time of Need
That is what people have said about the book You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth. Wrote one appreciative reader: “I have done nothing but look at this book every spare minute since I bought it. It has beautiful pictures, and the information is very upbuilding for me. . . .
“I will know that when I am feeling down because of pressures and problems, I will be able to look through this book and find the right answers and advice from it to help me.”
You, too, will find real help from reading such chapters as “The Fight to Do What Is Right” and “How to Gain Help Through Prayer.” The book’s 256 pages, the same page size as in this magazine, are filled with over 150 teaching illustrations, most in beautiful color.

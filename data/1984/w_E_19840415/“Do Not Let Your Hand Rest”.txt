“Do Not Let Your Hand Rest”
In obedience to Jesus Christ’s command to preach “this good news of the kingdom,” Jehovah’s Witnesses regularly visit their neighbors. (Matthew 24:14) Some listen and respond favorably to the Kingdom message. Others do not. Nevertheless, Ecclesiastes 11:6 advises: “In the morning sow your seed and until the evening do not let your hand rest; for you are not knowing where this will have success, either here or there, or whether both of them will alike be good.”
Good can result from the regular sowing of Kingdom seed in the house-to-house ministry. For example, a certain woman moved from the city of Hamilton in Canada to Minneapolis, Minnesota, in the United States. There she was contacted by Jehovah’s Witnesses as they went about their public preaching activity. She writes:
To the Brothers and Sisters in Hamilton:
This is an open letter to all those witnessing in Hamilton. Over the years I have seen many of you in your ministry. You planted many seeds in my life and I thank all of you. When I moved to Minneapolis, a year ago, two more Witnesses came to my door. This time I was ready. I have come to know that your days in service can be discouraging, and for that reason I wanted you to know that you did touch the heart of at least one sheep. You helped to lay a foundation upon which others could build. I have a Bible study twice a week, but still have a long way to go.
I can tell you that my life is now filled with a sense of purpose that was not there before.
I thank all of you.

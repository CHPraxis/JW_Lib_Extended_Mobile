<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">That is what a Canadian couple said about the recent publication <em>United in Worship of the Only True God. </em>“My husband and I have already studied good portions of this book,” writes the wife, “and never have we meditated so much on the truth. Truly, this book helps us to discern the intentions of our heart. It moves us to action and helps us to see the importance of our conduct and service to Jehovah. In a word, it is the best instrument, personally, and helps one to progress toward Christian maturity. Words fail us to tell you how much we appreciate this book.”</p>

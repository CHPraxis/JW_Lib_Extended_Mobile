Do You Remember?
Have you enjoyed the recent issues of The Watchtower? Now see if you can recall:
□ Of what value is the book of Numbers to Christians today?
It provides a valuable link in the divine record leading to the establishment of God’s Kingdom. The animal sacrifices point to the sacrifice of Jesus Christ. (Numbers 19:2-9; Hebrews 9:13, 14) Also, the book helps Christians to avoid idolatry and sexual immorality, and it alerts them to the danger of murmuring against God, his appointees and his provisions.​—4/15, page 30.
□ What is the importance of the date 1914?
In the year 1914 events were set in motion that will result in a complete change in the world scene. Jesus began to rule in his heavenly Kingdom, Satan was thereafter cast out of heaven. Soon God’s Kingdom will crush the ruling systems. (Daniel 2:44)​—5/1, pages 5-7.
□ What are some key factors in maintaining spiritual balance?
(1) Staying spiritually healthy; (2) avoiding dangerous spiritual areas (such as subtle materialism); (3) knowing of and working on weak areas; (4) keeping busy in the ministry; (5) humbly accepting discipline through God’s organization, and (6) never isolating oneself from the congregation.​—5/15, pages 8-11.
□ Do the Scriptures classify marrow with blood?
Although red blood cells originate in the marrow, the Scriptures do not classify marrow with blood. Marrow is spoken of like any other flesh that could be eaten. (Isaiah 25:6)​—5/15, page 31.
□ What demonstrates that a person is seeking the truth?
If a person is willing to apply God’s Word in his life, he will find true faith. (Matthew 5:6; John 10:14, 27; 18:37) Also, faith is a fruit produced by God’s spirit. (Galatians 5:22, 23) So if one prays for faith, making a real effort to acquire it and live by it, then God will help that one. (Matthew 7:7)​—6/1, pages 5, 6.
□ How can Jehovah’s reminders benefit us today?
Divine reminders move us to search for Jehovah with all our heart. This brings much happiness, preventing us from going astray or pursuing some shameful course in God’s eyes. (Psalm 119:2, 31)​—6/15, pages 21-5.
□ What is the source of greediness?
Because of man’s inherited imperfection, greed is a wild outgrowth of the normal desire for material possessions and financial security. (Romans 5:12) It can spring from an excessive or insatiable desire for possessions, fame or wealth.​—7/1, pages 24-5.
□ In making disciples, what are some points to keep in mind if the heart of the listener is to be reached?
First, the right example must be set. (Luke 6:40) Second, ask questions to get the student to think and reason. (Matthew 17:24-27) Third, help the student to see the wisdom of obeying God’s laws. (Deuteronomy 10:12, 13) Fourth, assist the student to know Jehovah intimately. (John 17:3)​—8/1, pages 13-17.

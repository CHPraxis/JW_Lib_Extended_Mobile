<p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sn"><strong>15 min: </strong>Youths​—Do Not Be Deceived. Talk and demonstration. As pointed out at “Kingdom Increase” District Conventions, young ones are special target of Satan. He picks on less experienced, seducing them as he did Eve. Deceives youth by enticements, allurements, temptations. Promotes idea youth are missing out on something. Cultivates selfish desire to ‘do own thing,’ decide for self what is good, bad. We must beware of his “crafty acts.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:6:11-49:6:11" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Eph. 6:11</a>, <em>Int</em>) He makes ways of world, such as sexual immorality, smoking, drug abuse, association with nonbelievers and worldly entertainment, look attractive. Makes such appear harmless, as fruit on tree appeared to Eve. Jehovah makes provisions to protect youths from being deceived: <em>Youth </em>and <em>Great Teacher </em>books, <em>School </em>brochure, <em>Awake! </em>feature “Young People Ask,” meetings, assemblies, parents and elders. At this point introduce scene where teenage boy wanting to discuss a problem approaches an elder. His father will not let him participate in organized sports in school. He wants to know if it is really all that bad. Elder, in kind and understanding way, suggests that they speak to the father and set a time when they can review the information in <a class="xt" data-xtid="7" href="jwpub://p/E:1101976086/">chapter 16 of the <em>Youth</em></a> book. He shows boy the chapter and suggests he read it over beforehand. All agree. Conclude with comments on how much elders, parents and organization love our faithful young ministers. Our interest is in protecting them from Satan’s designs. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:11:3-47:11:3" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Cor. 11:3</a>) Encourage youth and parents to use and be guided by the counsel from the discreet slave.</p>

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn">● <em>1985 Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses: </em>Publishers and pioneers, please order your <em>Yearbooks </em>through your congregation. Congregations should begin collecting requests for these <em>Yearbooks </em>now. Then on November 1, 1984, or as soon as possible thereafter, send this order to the Society using the regular Literature Order form (S-14). The <em>Yearbooks </em>will be available in English as well as Dutch, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese and Spanish. Until the <em>Yearbooks </em>are available and shipments are made, these will appear as “Back Ordered” on congregation invoices. Congregations should order only the number of <em>Yearbooks </em>for which there are requests. Payment should not accompany the congregation order. The <em>Yearbooks </em>are controlled stock items and will be charged to the literature account at $1.50 each, which is the rate for publishers and the public. (See September <em>Our Kingdom Ministry, </em>page 4.) Regular and special pioneers on the list before July 1, 1984, may receive a free copy for which the congregation may request credit on the Remittance and Credit Request form (S-20). Pioneers may obtain additional copies at 75¢ each. (Note to presiding overseer: Please have announcement made to the congregation when the <em>Yearbooks </em>are received so that all who ordered can obtain their copies.)</p>

Outstanding New Publisher Peak for August​—690,830!
What striking evidence of Jehovah’s goodness! Surely, this is another indication of Jehovah’s favor in answering our prayers. Like the psalmist David, we say: “I will exalt you, O my God the King, and I will bless your name to time indefinite, even forever.” (Ps. 145:1) The total of 690,830 publishers exceeds the July peak by 20,435. The 29,764 regular pioneers for August is a new peak. Truly, the 1984 service year has been an outstanding year of increase in many respects! May it be our determination to continue sowing bountifully, confident in the promise that we will reap bountifully.​—2 Cor. 9:6.

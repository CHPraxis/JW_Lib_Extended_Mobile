<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn">● The Memorial celebration will be held Sunday, April 15, 1984. Although the talk may start earlier, please remember that the passing of the Memorial bread and wine <em>should not begin until after sundown. </em>You may need to inquire as to when sundown will occur on April 15 in your area. Since no other meetings are to be conducted on that date, appropriate adjustments should be made according to local circumstances. Circuit overseers will also adjust their schedule accordingly for that week so that only the Memorial celebration will be scheduled for April 15.</p>

<p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sn">● District convention badge cards for 1984 will be consigned and included with April literature shipments. It will not be necessary to order these. Consignments in lots of 25 will be made based on the size of each congregation, and the literature account will be billed at the rate of one cent per card. This new uniform arrangement will represent a considerable saving of work, time and expense for the Society. It should be more convenient for the congregations and ensure the availability of convention badge cards for all the publishers.</p>

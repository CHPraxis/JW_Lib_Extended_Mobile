Are You Making Good Use of Tracts?
1 Most congregations have a good supply of Kingdom News Nos.Â 30, 31 and 32; and if not, these can be ordered from the Society. Some congregations still have on hand a number of previous tracts that present a timely message. Are you using these tracts in your ministry?
2 Much good can be accomplished in the house-to-house ministry by discreetly leaving a tract where no one is found at home. Also a tract may be offered to a person who demonstrates a measure of interest but does not wish to accept a magazine or other publication offered on a contribution basis. Some have found it is often effective to begin their presentations by offering a free tract.
3 Since Kingdom News tracts are published from time to time, each on a timely subject, why not become thoroughly familiar with these tracts and make good use of them in fulfilling your Kingdom ministry?

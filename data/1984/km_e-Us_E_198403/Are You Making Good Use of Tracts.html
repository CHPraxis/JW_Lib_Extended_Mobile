<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>Most congregations have a good supply of <em>Kingdom News </em>Nos.Â 30, 31 and 32; and if not, these can be ordered from the Society. Some congregations still have on hand a number of previous tracts that present a timely message. Are you using these tracts in your ministry?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>Much good can be accomplished in the house-to-house ministry by discreetly leaving a tract where no one is found at home. Also a tract may be offered to a person who demonstrates a measure of interest but does not wish to accept a magazine or other publication offered on a contribution basis. Some have found it is often effective to begin their presentations by offering a free tract.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>Since <em>Kingdom News </em>tracts are published from time to time, each on a timely subject, why not become thoroughly familiar with these tracts and make good use of them in fulfilling your Kingdom ministry?</p>

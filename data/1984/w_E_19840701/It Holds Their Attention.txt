It Holds Their Attention
The following letter was received by the publishers of this magazine: “I am a first grade teacher and one of my students brought My book of Bible Stories for me to read to my class. This is the only Bible story book that I’ve found that is on a level and in story form that will keep the attention of a first grade student. They have really enjoyed the stories. . . . I’m enclosing a check, please forward me a copy.”
You, too, can receive this 256-page, beautifully illustrated book by filling in and mailing the accompanying coupon along with a contribution of $2.50.
Please send me, postpaid, the hardbound book My Book of Bible Stories, for which I enclose $2.50 (U.S.). (For price in other countries, please contact local Watch Tower Society office.)

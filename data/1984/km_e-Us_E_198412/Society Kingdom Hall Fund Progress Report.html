<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>Continued support of the Society Kingdom Hall Fund by the brothers has made it possible to start 22 Kingdom Hall projects in 15 states. Loans have been made available for large and small projects.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>Efforts are made to ensure that attractive and functional facilities are designed and built to serve the needs of the congregations now and for the future. During the design, construction and furnishing of the new Kingdom Halls, the brothers have endeavored to keep costs as low as possible. Keeping costs down has enabled more congregations to receive loans from the Society Kingdom Hall Fund.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>Evidence of Jehovah’s blessing upon his organization is manifest in many ways, including the present numerical increase. This means there is an ever greater need for more Kingdom Halls. The arrangement for the Society Kingdom Hall Fund allows each one in the organization to have a personal share in filling that need. Money contributed to the Society Kingdom Hall Fund is loaned out to assist the congregations. As congregations send in their loan payments, such funds, along with the regular Society Kingdom Hall Fund contributions received each month, make it possible for more loans to be made available for other Kingdom Hall projects. Our accelerated efforts to meet the need for more Kingdom Halls are based on such support from the brothers. The donations received are very much appreciated.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>In future issues of <em>Our Kingdom Ministry </em>there will be further information on the progress of building more Kingdom Halls. Meanwhile, we pray for Jehovah’s rich blessings upon this arrangement.</p>

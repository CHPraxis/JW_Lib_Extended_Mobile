Benefit Fully From the Theocratic Ministry School
1 By now all have received the schedule for the coming year’s Theocratic Ministry School. It would be well for you to read carefully the introductory material as well as to pay close attention when it is covered in the Service Meeting.
2 In this schedule the Bible books of 1 and 2 Samuel, 1 and 2 Kings, and 1 and 2 Chronicles will be covered. There will be instruction talks on each of these books before the reading begins. The talks on these books will not be based only on what appears in the book “All Scripture Is Inspired of God and Beneficial.” Supplementary information on these Bible books may be gleaned from articles in The Watchtower that will appear early enough so that those giving the instruction talks may include pertinent points. These articles should serve to give freshness to the instruction talks and should prove very informative.
3 School overseers will also want to pay special attention to the following points: First, they should make sure to cover the points appearing in the written reviews if this is not done by the program participants. Second, they should give constructive and practical counsel to the students before bringing out interesting points not mentioned in the student talk. Third, school overseers will be conscious of timing, not running overtime themselves, and privately counseling those giving the instruction talk who neglect to watch their timing.
4 In working out meeting schedules, it would be well for the presiding overseer and the school overseer to collaborate so that, where possible, one elder is not given an assignment for both meetings on the same evening. Also, where there is need, qualified ministerial servants may be used for instruction talks and Bible highlights.

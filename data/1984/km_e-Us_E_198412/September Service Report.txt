The total number of regular pioneers reporting for September is outstanding. From our previous peak of 29,764 last August, the regular pioneer ranks swelled, in one month, to 34,232 in September. What a remarkable manifestation of increase in this branch of our sacred service! The faith of these theocratic goal of regular pioneer service is commendable. May our efforts result in more people praising Jehovah.​—Ps. 113:1.

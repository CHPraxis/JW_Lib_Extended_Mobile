‘Wonderful Aid to Help Little Ones’
That is what parents are saying about the cassette recordings of My Book of Bible Stories. A mother from Florida, U.S.A., writes: “I have two little girls, one four years old and one two years old. The first time I played the tapes the four-year-old sat with her Bible Stories book, turned the pages and answered questions with the cassette for 25 chapters. The two-year-old’s attention does not last that long, but she does sit and listen. I certainly appreciate this wonderful aid to help our little ones.”

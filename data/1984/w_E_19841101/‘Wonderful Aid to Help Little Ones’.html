<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">That is what parents are saying about the cassette recordings of <em>My Book of Bible Stories</em>. A mother from Florida, U.S.A., writes: “I have two little girls, one four years old and one two years old. The first time I played the tapes the four-year-old sat with her <em>Bible Stories </em>book, turned the pages and answered questions with the cassette for 25 chapters. The two-year-old’s attention does not last that long, but she does sit and listen. I certainly appreciate this wonderful aid to help our little ones.”</p>

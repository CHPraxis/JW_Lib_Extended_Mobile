<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>In these last days, pressures upon the family arrangement continue to mount. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:1-55:3:5" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Tim. 3:1-5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:12:12-66:12:12" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Rev. 12:12</a>) Traditional family life has been disrupted as never before. How can we fortify our family life? What protection is there for Christians?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>The Founder of the family arrangement consistently demonstrates his interest in us. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:3:14-49:3:15" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Eph. 3:14, 15</a>) By means of his Word and organization he gives guidance and instruction that strengthen our families and the Christian congregation. The book <em>Making Your Family Life Happy </em>was published in 1978 and has proved its worth in helping us to apply Bible principles in a realistic and beneficial way. Now arrangements have been made for us to study it again at the Congregation Book Study, beginning the first week of September.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>To gain the greatest benefit from our discussions, each of us should prepare well. All of us need to benefit from the modest, straightforward counsel found in this publication.</p>

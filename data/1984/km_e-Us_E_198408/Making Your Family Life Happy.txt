Making Your Family Life Happy
1 In these last days, pressures upon the family arrangement continue to mount. (2 Tim. 3:1-5; Rev. 12:12) Traditional family life has been disrupted as never before. How can we fortify our family life? What protection is there for Christians?
2 The Founder of the family arrangement consistently demonstrates his interest in us. (Eph. 3:14, 15) By means of his Word and organization he gives guidance and instruction that strengthen our families and the Christian congregation. The book Making Your Family Life Happy was published in 1978 and has proved its worth in helping us to apply Bible principles in a realistic and beneficial way. Now arrangements have been made for us to study it again at the Congregation Book Study, beginning the first week of September.
3 To gain the greatest benefit from our discussions, each of us should prepare well. All of us need to benefit from the modest, straightforward counsel found in this publication.

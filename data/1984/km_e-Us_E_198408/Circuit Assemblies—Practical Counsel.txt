Circuit Assemblies​—Practical Counsel
1 The 1984 spring and summer circuit assembly program with the theme “Living No Longer for Ourselves” presented timely information to help us avoid selfish thinking. In order for life to be meaningful, one has to be interested first of all in doing Jehovah’s will and pleasing him. (2 Cor. 5:14, 15) We must be capable of distinguishing both right and wrong. (Heb. 5:14) Appreciating our place in Jehovah’s house, we may serve as vessels for an honorable use.​—Rom. 9:21.
2 The theme for the series of circuit assemblies starting in September is “Repudiate Ungodliness and Worldly Desires.” Why does the Bible instruct us to reject such? (Titus 2:12) How does such a course of action afford us protection, and why is it essential to our salvation? What are some of the specific areas of ungodliness and worldly desires that pose dangers to Jehovah’s people? Why should we view some of our own personal desires as suspect? These and many other vital questions will be answered in this new circuit assembly program.
3 Portions of the program such as “Pioneering Is Advantageous” and “Examining Our Motives” will help strengthen our determination to maintain ourselves active in Jehovah’s service as well as to remain clean and separate from the world. Be sure to make definite plans to attend this excellent circuit assembly program.

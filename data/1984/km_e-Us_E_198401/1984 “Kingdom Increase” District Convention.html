<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sa">“The little one himself will become a thousand . . .”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>Do not those prophetic words of Isaiah thrill and inspire us? They surely do! Jehovah’s prophet went on to say that ‘the small one will become a mighty nation. I myself, Jehovah, shall speed it up in its own time.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:60:22-23:60:22" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Isa. 60:22</a>) These are exciting times in view of the growth within Jehovah’s organization. Hence, the theme “Kingdom Increase” is most appropriate and sparks in us the desire to attend the 1984 district conventions. Last summer in the contiguous United States an all-time peak attendance of 1,124,070 was reached. Think of the privilege of being a part of the even larger attendance expected for over 100 “Kingdom Increase” District Conventions planned for this summer, and of hearing how Jehovah is speeding up the Kingdom work and about the share we each can have in it before the end comes. To assist you in making necessary arrangements to be in attendance, you will find a list of these conventions on page 6. The following information should help you to arrange to be there and to assist others, especially newly interested ones, to attend every session as well.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:6:10-48:6:10" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Gal. 6:10</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="ss"><strong>SELECTING YOUR CONVENTION</strong></p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>Listed on page 6 in date order, is each convention city and the circuits (or portions thereof) assigned to attend each convention. Unless there are extenuating circumstances, you should attend the convention to which your circuit is assigned. Where two or more conventions are being held at the same location, you should attend on the dates shown for your circuit or portion thereof.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>Those circuits in the chart marked with an asterisk (*) have some congregations located a little closer to another convention city, but it is preferred that you attend at the location indicated so as to prevent unnecessary crowding.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>Where the chart indicates that a portion of a circuit, such as 1<sup>⁄</sup>2 or 1<sup>⁄</sup>4, is assigned to a particular location, it simply means that those congregations in the part (of the circuit closest to that convention should attend where indicated and the rest of the circuit should attend the convention closest to them, as shown elsewhere on the list.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="ss"><strong>ROOMING ARRANGEMENTS</strong></p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>You should make your own rooming arrangements directly with the hotel or motel by using the information that will be provided by the convention through your congregation. In most cases you will pay less than the regular rates charged by the hotel or motel, since the convention has negotiated for a large number of good quality rooms to be set aside for this purpose. These rooms will be assigned by the hotel or motel only to those identifying themselves as Jehovah’s Witnesses or as delegates attending the Watchtower Convention. By the middle of December 1983, your congregation will have received a list of hotels and motels in the convention city that are cooperating closely with the Society’s rooming arrangement. It will show the address of the facility, its agreed-upon rates and the phone number to be used in making your reservations. PLEASE NOTE: The program will start at 1:30 p.m. on Thursday.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup><strong>WHAT YOU SHOULD DO: </strong>As soon as your congregation receives the list of hotels and motels from the convention organization you should IMMEDIATELY phone the hotel or motel of your choice, identifying yourself as one of <span id="page4" class="pageNum" data-no="4" data-before-text="4"></span>Jehovah’s Witnesses or as a delegate attending the Watchtower Convention. Doing so will qualify you for the agreed-upon rates listed. One night’s <em>deposit </em>will be required at all locations to hold the room and should be sent directly to the hotel or motel <em>as soon as </em>you make your reservations. Do not make rooming arrangements you do not intend to keep. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:5:37-40:5:37" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matt. 5:37</a>) <em>Motels or hotels are not obligated to hold the rooms or extend the special rates beyond the cutoff date without a deposit. </em>If you find it necessary for good reason to cancel your accommodations, you should write or phone the hotel or motel directly, doing so as far in advance as possible. This makes the room available to other delegates who need accommodations. The convention Rooming Department will monitor the arrangement and provide additional information through the congregation, such as which hotels or motels are filled after a month or two, as well as any additional ones it may find necessary to add to the list. If the hotel or motel you call first is filled, then call your next selection from the list, and so on.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb"><sup>7 </sup><strong>DORMITORIES: </strong>A few conventions use school dormitories in order to accommodate all those attending. Usually congregations will receive information on these a month or so after the first hotel or motel listing. Those needing accommodations of this type should follow through in accord with the instructions on the list that is sent to the congregations by the convention.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb"><sup>8 </sup><strong>SPECIAL NEEDS: </strong>Arrangements to care for those with special needs should be made by the congregation where these attend. Elders and others aware of such circumstances can lovingly extend help. This often involves taking others with them in their own group, for example, those in full-time service, the elderly, the infirm, the deaf or others who have the need. Also, they may care for such ones in other ways. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:20:35-44:20:35" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Acts 20:35;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:2:15-59:2:17" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Jas. 2:15-17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:3:17-62:3:18" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> 1 John 3:17, 18</a>) We are confident that loving concern will be shown to all who need our help. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:6:11-47:6:13" data-bid="5-1" class="b">2 Cor. 6:11-13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:13:35-43:13:35" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> John 13:35;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:6:10-48:6:10" data-bid="5-3" class="b"> Gal. 6:10</a>) However, the convention Rooming Department will endeavor to provide rooming accommodations for those with special needs who cannot be cared for by themselves or by those in the congregation where they attend. These may ask the convention coordinator in their congregation for a Special Needs Room Request Form, discussing their situation with him at that time. Those with special needs are the only ones that should use this form. They should fill it out and return it to the convention coordinator to be checked for completeness, accuracy and verification of circumstances. Even though the convention coordinator forwards it to the convention Rooming Department, the individual will be notified directly of the accommodations by the Rooming Department. This should be done well ahead of the convention. The publisher with special needs should NOT simply go to the convention and request a room when he arrives, because the convention Rooming Department needs the verification of the congregation’s convention coordinator.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb"><sup>9 </sup>Private home accommodations listed by the convention are usually set aside for those with limited funds who would experience real hardship if such accommodations were not available. They are not intended for those who want free or inexpensive rooms just to save money. Nor is it proper to presume upon the hospitality of our brothers by expecting them to accommodate delegates extra days so they can visit vacation spots or do other things before or after the convention. These rooms are for the convention period <em>only.</em></p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb"><span id="page5" class="pageNum" data-no="5" data-before-text="5"></span><sup>10 </sup><strong>DELEGATES ATTENDING FROM OUTSIDE THE ASSIGNED AREA: </strong>District conventions are arranged at many locations to reduce travel. In nearly every case, the location assigned for you to attend is the one nearest your congregation. Seating, literature, food orders, and so forth, are planned on the premise that the majority will attend the convention to which they are assigned. However, if a few for important reasons must attend a location other than the one assigned, they may ask the convention coordinator in their congregation for the address of the convention headquarters where they wish to attend. He will find these addresses listed on the back of the Special Needs Room Request Form. Unless these persons have special needs, they should <em>not </em>use the Special Needs Room Request Form. Rather, they should write to the convention headquarters where they wish to attend and request a copy of the hotel or motel listing for that location, sending a stamped, self-addressed envelope along with this request. Upon receipt of this listing of hotels and motels, they should proceed just as if they were using the list for their local area.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb"><sup>11 </sup><strong>YOUR COOPERATION APPRECIATED: </strong>The smoothness with which this rooming arrangement functions depends largely on the cooperation of everyone involved. For instance, if a number of delegates run ahead and make reservations on their own before the congregation receives the list of facilities that are cooperating with the convention Rooming Department, it could cause a major breakdown in negotiations. Also, it could result in difficulties if a large number of delegates choose, for one reason or another, to make their own arrangements with facilities not listed that have not cooperated with the convention rooming arrangement. The listing is broad enough to give a choice of good quality accommodations and yet give preference to the hotels or motels that cooperate. Our aim with this rooming arrangement is to help delegates to be accommodated as comfortably and economically as possible, so they will be refreshed and fully able to enjoy the fine spiritual program.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="ss"><strong>SIGN LANGUAGE SESSIONS</strong></p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb"><sup>12 </sup>As shown in the accompanying chart, sign language translation will be provided <em>only </em>at 16 specific convention cities. (<em>No </em>provisions will be made at any other conventions for sign language, We know this will prove to be a real blessing to those with this special need by providing good quality translating and larger groups with which to enjoy upbuilding fellowship. Those who are signers can do much to let the deaf in their congregation know of these arrangements and help them to attend where the sign language provision is made by the Society.</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="si">[NOTE TO THE BODY OF ELDERS: Upon receipt of this insert and the Recommended Lodging Locations list from the district convention committee, please announce at the next Service Meeting as well as at the following <em>Watchtower </em>Study the location and the dates assigned by the Society for the congregation. It would be good to underline on the circuit list the assigned convention city and the dates for the congregation and post that portion of the insert on the information board.</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="si">The elder serving as the convention coordinator should conduct the Service Meeting part covering this insert as scheduled, as well as handle other convention material and announcements on the meetings. When covering this insert, please read all cited scriptures and paragraphs 1, 6, 8-11. All elders will want to cooperate fully and offer suggestions to ensure the prompt, enthusiastic and effective handling of convention-related material.]</p>

Consideration of material in the <a class="xt" data-xtid="1" href="jwpub://p/E:1101983034/1-28"><em>School </em>brochure, pages 12-16</a>, under the subject of “Flag Salute, Anthems and Voting.” Have a well-prepared, qualified elder handle this. It is important for us to have our Scriptural position on these issues clearly in mind. Consider the opening portion of this section of the brochure by means of a talk. Jesus’ example and his teachings set the pattern for all Christians, including youths. Consider the significance of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:6:15-43:6:15" data-bid="1-1" class="b">John 6:15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:16-43:17:16" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 17:16 and</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:18:36-43:18:36" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> Joh 18:36</a>. Also, consider what the textbooks say about the neutral position of early Christians.</p>
<p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sn">Allow sufficient time to discuss the material under the subheadings “The Flag Salute,” “National Anthems and School Songs,” and “Elective Offices and Positions.” Draw attention to the sound Scriptural basis for not saluting and not singing in connection with patriotic services. Help the brothers to reason on whether it is Scripturally proper to stand or not to stand for patriotic services on certain occasions. Reason with the brothers as to why it is appropriate that Witness youths keep free from school politics. Loyalty to God’s organization is shown by such conformity. Highlight such matters in the discussion. The material, after the opening talk, could be handled principally by questions and answers.</p>

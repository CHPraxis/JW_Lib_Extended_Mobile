<p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="qu"> 1. What did Christ say about the need to keep on the watch?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb">JESUS Christ urged his followers to be watchful. For instance, he said: “You, then, watch out; I have told you all things beforehand. . . . And then they will see the Son of man coming in clouds with great power and glory. . . . Concerning that day or the hour nobody knows, neither the angels in heaven nor the Son, but the Father. Keep looking, keep awake, for you do not know when the appointed time is. It is like a man traveling abroad that left his house and gave the authority to his slaves, to each one his work, and commanded the doorkeeper to keep on the watch. Therefore keep on the watch, for you do not know when the master of the house is coming, whether late in the day or at midnight or at cockcrowing or early in the morning; in order that when he arrives suddenly, he does not find you sleeping. But what I say to you I say to all, Keep on the watch.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:13:23-41:13:37" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Mark 13:23-37</a>.</p>
<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu"> 2. Why does the model prayer imply watchfulness, but how have Christendom’s churches devitalized Kingdom expectation?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>The preceding articles have provided abundant evidence from neutral sources that Christendom’s churches have not ‘kept on the watch.’ According to <em>The Catholic Encyclopedia, </em>they have devitalized Kingdom expectation by claiming that “the kingdom of God means . . . the ruling of God in our hearts,” thereby taking all meaning out of the model prayer, or Lord’s Prayer. Yet <em>The New Encyclopædia </em><span id="page15" class="pageNum" data-no="15" data-before-text="15"></span><em>Britannica </em>states: “The petitions of the Lord’s Prayer presuppose the deeply distressing circumstance that God’s name and will are abused, that his Kingdom is not yet come.” Yes, the model prayer presupposes watchfulness. Specifically, for what things were Christians to stay on the watch?</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="ss"><strong>“On the Watch”​—For What?</strong></p>
<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu"> 3. Why could Christians not ignore the time element?</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>A close examination of Bible prophecies about the “Last Things” reveals the precise things for which Christians were to “keep on the watch.” First, they were not to lose sight of the time element, for Jesus Christ spoke of an “appointed time” known only to his Father. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:13:32-41:13:33" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Mark 13:32, 33</a>) In addition, Jesus told his disciples that Jerusalem would be “trampled on by the nations, until the appointed times of the nations [Gentiles] are fulfilled.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:21:24-42:21:24" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Luke 21:24</a>) Obviously, Jesus gave his followers this information in order to help them identify the time of the end, for it is a part of his answer to the question: “Teacher, <em>when </em>will these things actually be, and what will be the sign when these things are destined to occur?”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:21:7-42:21:7" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Luke 21:7</a>.</p>

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>In addition to their paying attention to the time element, Christians were to watch out for the requested “sign,” also mentioned in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:3-40:24:3" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Matthew 24:3 and</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:13:4-41:13:4" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> Mark 13:4</a>. This many-featured sign​—including international wars, famines, earthquakes, pestilences and persecution of true Christians—​would tie in with the fulfillment of time prophecies to identify the “generation” that would “by no means pass away” until all the things due to occur in the time of the end actually took place.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:21:10-42:21:12" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Luke 21:10-12,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:21:32-42:21:32" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 32</a>.</p>

<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><sup>8 </sup>We have just seen that Christians were to live in expectation of the end of “the appointed times of the nations.” They were to watch for ‘the sign of Christ’s presence and of the conclusion of the system of things.’ They were to expect the resurrection of anointed Christians who had died faithful and a clear identification of “the faithful and discreet slave” class who would be appointed over the earthly interests of Christ’s Kingdom. Finally, this “slave” would continue to supply spiritual food, while setting the lead in preaching “this good news of the kingdom . . . in all the inhabited earth” before “the end.” “The sign of the Son of man” would appear by his “coming” to destroy Satan’s wicked system of things.</p>
<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu"> 9. Who proved to be watching for the end of “the appointed times of the nations,” and how did <em>Zion’s Watch Tower </em>help Christians to keep spiritually alert?</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><sup>9 </sup>Who has proved to be “on the watch” for all these things? As early as 1876, Charles T. Russell of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, had been attentively watching for the end of “the appointed times of the nations,” or “times of the Gentiles.” (<em>King James Version</em>) That year he published an article entitled “Gentile Times: When Do They End?” In it he stated that “the seven times will end in A.D. 1914.” From 1880 on, that same information was published in the columns of <em>Zion’s Watch Tower. </em>The March 1880 issue stated: “‘The Times of the Gentiles’ extend to 1914, and the heavenly kingdom will not have full sway till then.” True, the Bible students who wrote those articles did not, at that time, enjoy the precise Biblical and historical <span id="page17" class="pageNum" data-no="17" data-before-text="17"></span>understanding of what the end of those “appointed times of the nations” would actually mean, as we understand these things today.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> But the important point is that they were “on the watch” and helped to keep fellow Christians spiritually alert.</p>

<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><sup>10 </sup>That same group of Bible students associated with Charles Russell and the magazine <em>Zion’s Watch Tower </em>also helped sincere Christians to understand that Christ’s “presence” should be understood to be invisible, and that he would not return to earth to reign as a fleshly king. They continually drew the attention of the Master’s “domestics” to world events in connection with “the sign” of Christ’s presence and “the time of the end.”</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:21:24-42:21:24" data-bid="36-1" class="b">Luke 21:24;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:4:16-27:4:17" data-bid="36-2" class="b"> Daniel 4:16, 17</a>) It was, therefore, understandable why efforts were made to use other Biblical time indications to try to find out when the long-awaited hopes might become a reality. Faithful servants of Jehovah in <span id="page19" class="pageNum" data-no="19" data-before-text="19"></span>the past cried out: “How long, O Jehovah?”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:6:11-23:6:11" data-bid="37-1" class="b">Isaiah 6:11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:74:10-19:74:10" data-bid="37-2" class="b"> Psalm 74:10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:94:3-19:94:3" data-bid="37-3" class="b"> 94:3</a>.</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="ss"><strong>Why “Keep Ready”?</strong></p>
<p id="p51" data-pid="51" class="qu">16. (a) Should <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:13:32-41:13:32" data-bid="45-1" class="b">Mark 13:32</a> be understood to mean that we must show no interest as to when the end comes? (b) What “sign” is in evidence, but what other “sign” do we await?</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><sup>16 </sup>Since Jesus clearly stated that no man could know “that day” or “the hour” when the Father will order his son to ‘come’ against Satan’s wicked system of things, some may ask: ‘Why is it so urgent to live in expectation of the end?’ It is urgent because practically in the same breath, Jesus added: “Keep looking, keep awake . . . keep on the watch.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:13:32-41:13:35" data-bid="38-1" class="b">Mark 13:32-35</a>) The “sign” of Jesus’ <em>parousia </em>has been in evidence since 1914. We now await “the sign of the Son of man,” when he ‘comes’ as Jehovah’s Executioner.</p>
<p id="p52" data-pid="52" class="qu">17, 18. (a) Why did Jesus order first-century Christians to flee from Jerusalem as soon as they saw the sign of its impending destruction? (b) Why would it be dangerous to rationalize about the urgency of our times?</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[52]" class="sb"><sup>17 </sup>When Jesus gave the first-century Judean Christians a sign whereby they would know that the time had come to flee from Jerusalem, he insisted on the need to act immediately. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:21:20-42:21:23" data-bid="39-1" class="b">Luke 21:20-23</a>) Why all the urgency, since nearly four years elapsed from the appearing of the sign in 66 C.E. and the actual destruction of Jerusalem in 70 C.E.? Because Jesus knew that if they delayed, they would keep putting off their flight and eventually be caught by the Roman armies.</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[52]" class="sb"><sup>18 </sup>Similarly today, it would be highly dangerous for Christians to rationalize about the urgency of our times and adopt a “cruising speed” attitude that reflects doubt about the nearness of the end.</p>
<p id="p53" data-pid="53" class="qu">19. What warning did Peter and Jesus give?</p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[53]" class="sb"><sup>19 </sup>The <em>parousia, </em>or presence, of Christ has now run for 70 years, and his “coming” for “Jehovah’s day” of execution against Satan’s world is fast approaching. The apostle Peter says that this day “will come as a thief,” and he adds that we should ‘await and keep close in mind the presence of the day of Jehovah.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:3:10-61:3:12" data-bid="40-1" class="b">2 Peter 3:10-12</a>) Jesus also warned us: “Pay attention to yourselves that your hearts never become weighed down with overeating and heavy drinking and anxieties of life, and suddenly that day be instantly upon you as a snare. . . . Keep awake.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:21:34-42:21:36" data-bid="41-1" class="b">Luke 21:34-36</a>.</p>
<p id="p54" data-pid="54" class="qu">20. For what should we be thankful, and how will proper Christian expectation safeguard us?</p>
<p id="p26" data-pid="26" data-rel-pid="[54]" class="sb"><sup>20 </sup>How happy and how thankful Jehovah’s Witnesses should be to have been kept spiritually awake by the faithful and vigilant “slave” class! Proper Christian expectation will safeguard us during these perilous “last days” and will prompt us to take part zealously in preaching “this good news of the kingdom.” Thereby we will be helping others to keep on the watch and survive into the new system of things wherein “righteousness is to dwell.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:1-55:3:5" data-bid="42-1" class="b">2 Timothy 3:1-5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:14-40:24:14" data-bid="42-2" class="b"> Matthew 24:14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:3:13-61:3:13" data-bid="42-3" class="b"> 2 Peter 3:13</a>.</p>

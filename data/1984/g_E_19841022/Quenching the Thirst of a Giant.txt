Quenching the Thirst of a Giant
By “Awake!” correspondent in Mexico
MEXICO CITY, with an estimated urban population of 17 million, may now be the largest city in the world. Supplying such a huge metropolitan area with ample water is a major task.
Each inhabitant uses, on an average, 360 litersa daily​—1,520 cupfuls! To complicate the picture, it is estimated that by the year 2000, Mexico City will have a population of 28 million. This has triggered an intense search for a source of water that can fill both present and future needs.
Up to 1982, Mexico City was supplied with water from numerous wells and springs, also from some rivers that come down from the southern and western mountains. However, the main source of drinking water for the metropolitan area was, and still is, the spongy soil under Mexico City. This subsoil is 85 percent water. But the city uses more water from the subsoil than is replenished by rainfall. The result has been a gradual sinking of the city. Some parts sink as much as 30 centimetersb a year.
To relieve the situation, Mexico City looked to the Cutzamala River and its tributaries. However, two obstacles had to be hurdled. One was the distance. The river is about 200 kilometersc from Mexico City. Yet, a greater barrier is that the water would have to be lifted 2,000 meters!d Imagine lifting water to a height equal to almost five times that of the tallest building in the world!e
The water from the Cutzamala River was already being funneled 900 metersf up into the Colorines reservoir. Still it had to be sent 1,100 metersg higher and increased in volume by water from smaller reservoirs until it reached Mexico City. Never before in the annals of waterworks has there existed a project that pumps so much water to such a height.
To date, the first of three stages has been completed. Already stage one is supplying 4,000 litersh per second from the Villa Victoria reservoir. It was expected that by October 1984, Mexico City would be receiving 2,000 litersi per second more, and it is hoped that the goal of 19,000 litersj per second will be reached in 1987.
The inhabitants of Mexico City have reason to be grateful not only to the engineers and laborers working on the “Cutzamala System” but also to the One who causes “rains from heaven” to supply water for all mankind.​—Acts 14:17.

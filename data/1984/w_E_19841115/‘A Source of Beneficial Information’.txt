‘A Source of Beneficial Information’
Such are the sentiments of a reader in Coimbra, Portugal, regarding Awake! He writes: “I take this occasion to express once again the great appreciation I have for Awake! magazine. It is, truthfully, marvelous. It is always with joy of spirit that I receive it and always with much satisfaction and spiritual joy that I read it. It always brings us good articles, varied, well written so that the reading is not boring. I greatly appreciate the magazine for its articles, its illustrations, and finally for the love it makes us have for the earth and, obviously, for God. It is true that there are doctrinal points on which I disagree, but I believe that the spirit is also with you. In terms of education, I can only say that Awake! is most educational and its reading is a source of much information that increases one’s general education. Congratulations!”

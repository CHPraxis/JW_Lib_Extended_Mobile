1H “The [true] Lord”—Heb., ha·ʼA·dhohnʹ

The title ʼA·dhohnʹ, “Lord; Master,” when preceded by the definite article ha, “the,” gives the expression ha·ʼA·dhohnʹ, “the [true] Lord.” The use of the definite article ha before the title ʼA·dhohnʹ limits the application of this title exclusively to Jehovah God.
In M the expression ha·ʼA·dhohnʹ occurs nine times, namely, in Ex 23:17; Ex 34:23; Isa 1:24; Isa 3:1; Isa 10:16, 33; Isa 19:4; Mic 4:13; Mal 3:1.
The plural of ʼa·dhohnʹ is ʼadho·nimʹ. In M the expression ha·ʼadho·nimʹ, “the lords,” occurs twice, namely, in De 10:17; Ps 136:3.

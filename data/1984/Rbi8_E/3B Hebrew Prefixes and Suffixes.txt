3B Hebrew Prefixes and Suffixes

A characteristic of Hebrew is its use of prefixes and suffixes to form compound words. For example, betsal·meʹnu, “in our image,” occurs in Ge 1:26. The Hebrew word for “image” is preceded by the prefix be, “in,” and followed by the suffix eʹnu, “our,” thus producing the compound expression “in our image.”
In the footnote apparatus you will encounter many prefixes (including conjunctions and articles) and suffixes attached to Hebrew basic words. Following are some of the more common ones found in the footnote apparatus of this Reference Bible.

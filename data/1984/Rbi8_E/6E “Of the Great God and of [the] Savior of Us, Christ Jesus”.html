<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">In this place we find two nouns connected by καί (<em>kai, </em>“and”), the first noun being preceded by the definite article τοῦ (<em>tou, </em>“of the”) and the second noun without the definite article. A similar construction is found in <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/61:1:1-61:1:2" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2Pe 1:1, 2</a>, where, in vs 2, a clear distinction is made between God and Jesus. This indicates that when two distinct persons are connected by καί, if the first person is preceded by the definite article it is not necessary to repeat the definite article before the second person. Examples of this construction in the Greek text are found in <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:13:50-44:13:50" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ac 13:50;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:15:22-44:15:22" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 15:22;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/49:5:5-49:5:5" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> Eph 5:5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/53:1:12-53:1:12" data-bid="3-4" class="b"> 2Th 1:12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/54:5:21-54:5:21" data-bid="3-5" class="b"> 1Ti 5:21;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/54:6:13-54:6:13" data-bid="3-6" class="b"> 6:13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/55:4:1-55:4:1" data-bid="3-7" class="b"> 2Ti 4:1</a>. This construction <span id="page1582" class="pageNum" data-no="1582" data-before-text="1582"></span>is also found in LXX. (See <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:24:21-20:24:21" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Pr 24:21</a> ftn.) According to <em>An Idiom Book of New Testament Greek, </em>by C. F. D. Moule, Cambridge, England, 1971, p. 109, the sense <em>“of the great God, and of our Saviour Jesus Christ . . . </em>is <em>possible </em>in κοινή [<em>koi·neʹ</em>] Greek even without the repetition [of the definite article].”</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23">A detailed study of the construction in <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/56:2:13-56:2:13" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Tit 2:13</a> is found in <em>The Authorship of the Fourth Gospel and Other Critical Essays, </em>by Ezra Abbot, Boston, 1888, pp. 439-457. On p. 452 of this work the following comments are found: “Take an example from the New Testament. In <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:21:12-40:21:12" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Matt. xxi. 12</a> we read that Jesus ‘cast out all those that were selling and buying in the temple,’ τοὺς πωλοῦντας καὶ ἀγοράζοντας [<em>tous po·lounʹtas kai a·go·raʹzon·tas</em>]. No one can reasonably suppose that the same persons are here described as both selling and buying. In Mark the two classes are made distinct by the insertion of τούς before ἀγοράζοντας; here it is safely left to the intelligence of the reader to distinguish them. In the case before us [<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/56:2:13-56:2:13" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Tit 2:13</a>], the omission of the article before σωτῆρος [<em>so·teʹros</em>] seems to me to present no difficulty,—not because σωτῆρος is made sufficiently definite by the addition of ἡμῶν [<em>he·monʹ</em>] (Winer), for, since God as well as Christ is often called “our Saviour,” ἡ δόξα τοῦ μεγάλου θεοῦ καὶ σωτῆρος ἡμῶν [<em>he doʹxa tou me·gaʹlou The·ouʹ kai so·teʹros he·monʹ</em>], <em>standing alone, </em>would most naturally be understood of one subject, namely, God, the Father; but the addition of Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ to σωτῆρος ἡμῶν [<em>I·e·souʹ Khri·stouʹ </em>to <em>so·teʹros he·monʹ</em>] changes the case entirely, restricting the σωτῆρος ἡμῶν to a person or being who, according to Paul’s <em>habitual use of language, </em>is distinguished from the person or being whom he designates as ὁ θεός [<em>ho The·osʹ</em>], so that there was no need of the repetition of the article to prevent ambiguity. So in <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/53:1:12-53:1:12" data-bid="8-1" class="b">2 Thess. i. 12</a>, the expression κατὰ τὴν χάριν τοῦ θεοῦ ἡμῶν καὶ κυρίου [<em>ka·taʹ ten khaʹrin tou The·ouʹ he·monʹ kai ky·riʹou</em>] would naturally be understood of one subject, and the article would be required before κυρίου if two were intended; but the simple addition of Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ to κυρίου [<em>I·e·souʹ Khri·stouʹ </em>to <em>ky·riʹou</em>] makes the reference to the two distinct subjects clear without the insertion of the article.”</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24">Therefore, in <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/56:2:13-56:2:13" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Tit 2:13</a>, two distinct persons, Jehovah God and Jesus Christ, are mentioned. Throughout the Holy Scriptures it is not possible to identify Jehovah and Jesus as being the same individual.</p>

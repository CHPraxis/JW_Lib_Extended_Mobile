<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">What a happy throng of united worshipers exalted God’s name together during July! (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:34:3-19:34:3" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ps. 34:3</a>) The total of 670,395 publishers is 7,875 more than the publisher peak that was reached in the United States last April. Truly, we have experienced the goodness of Jehovah in many ways. As we apply the things learned at our recent district conventions, may we continue to bubble over with joyful activity in our field ministry.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:145:7-19:145:7" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ps. 145:7</a>.</p>

Theocratic Ministry School Schedule for 1985
INSTRUCTIONS
During 1985 the following will be the arrangements when conducting the Theocratic Ministry School.
TEXTBOOKS: The New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures [bi12 and Rbi8], Bible Topics for Discussion [td], The Watchtower [w] and the books “All Scripture Is Inspired of God and Beneficial” [si], Theocratic Ministry School Guidebook [sg] and You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth [pe] will be the basis for assignments.
The school will begin with song and prayer and remarks of welcome, and then proceed as follows. [Alternate songs are from 1966 songbook.]
ASSIGNMENT NO. 1: 15 minutes. This should be handled by an elder or by a qualified ministerial servant. When based on the Theocratic Ministry School Guidebook, this should be delivered as a ten-minute instruction talk followed by a five-minute oral review. Since a part of a study is assigned from this book, the brother handling this assignment should be careful to cover only the portion of the material that is assigned. The objective should be not just to cover the material but to focus attention on the practical value of the information being discussed. All are encouraged to make careful advance preparation so as to benefit fully from this material.
When based on “All Scripture Is Inspired of God and Beneficial” or the Watchtower article on the Bible book(s) being considered, this assignment should be delivered as a 15-minute instruction talk with no oral review following. Once again, the objective is not just to summarize the material but rather to focus attention on the practical value of the information, highlighting what will be most helpful to the congregation.
All assigned this talk should be careful to keep within the time limit. The brother handling Assignment No. 1 may be given private counsel if that is necessary.
HIGHLIGHTS FROM BIBLE READING: 6 minutes. This should be handled by the school overseer or another qualified elder or ministerial servant assigned by him. This should not be just a summary of the assigned reading. After giving a brief overall view of the assigned chapters, help the audience to appreciate why and how the information is of value to us. The students will then be dismissed to their various classrooms by the school overseer.
TALK NO. 2: 5 minutes. This is a Bible reading of the assigned material to be given by a brother. This will apply in the main school as well as in the auxiliary groups. The reading assignments are usually short enough to permit the student to present brief explanatory information in the opening and concluding remarks, and even at intermediate points. Historical background, prophetic or doctrinal significance and application of principles may be included. All the assigned verses should actually be read. The material may also be presented by a boy reading it to a qualified older brother who may then use questions to draw comments from the boy on the value of the material.
TALK NO. 3: 5 minutes. This talk will be assigned to a sister, including younger ones, whenever possible. When delivering the talk, the student may be either seated or standing. One assistant will be scheduled by the school overseer, but additional assistants may be used. Settings could include situations arising at home, in the field ministry, in the congregation or elsewhere. The one giving the talk may either initiate the conversation to establish the setting or have her assistant(s) do so. Not the setting but the material should be given prime consideration. The student should use the theme shown.
TALK NO. 4: 5 minutes. Assigned preferably to a brother with some experience. This should be a talk to the entire audience. It will usually be best for the speaker to prepare his talk with the Kingdom Hall audience in mind, so that it will be truly informative and beneficial to those who actually hear it. However, if the material lends itself better to another practical and suitable setting, the speaker may choose to develop his talk accordingly. The student should use the theme shown. Numbers in parentheses refer to Bible Topics for Discussion found in the bi12 Bible, 1984 edition.
When assigned to a sister, the material should be presented as outlined for Talk No. 3.
COUNSEL AND REMARKS: After each student talk, the school overseer will give specific counsel, not necessarily following the program of progressive counsel outlined on the Speech Counsel slip. Rather, he should concentrate on those areas where the student needs to improve. If the student speaker merits solely a “G” and there is no other speech quality marked “I” or “W,” then the counselor should circle the box, where the “G,” “I” or “W” would normally appear, of the speech quality that the student should work on next. He will advise the student of this that evening as well as show this speech quality on the student’s next Theocratic Ministry School Assignment slip (S-89). Those giving talks should sit toward the front of the hall. This will save time and enable the school overseer to give his counsel directly to each student. As time allows, comments may be given by the counselor on informative and practical points not covered by the students. The school overseer should be careful to use no more than two minutes for counsel and remarks after each student talk.
PREPARING TALKS: Brothers assigned the first and second talks should choose a theme that will allow for the best coverage of the material. Students assigned the third and fourth talks should use the theme shown. Students will want to read over the School Guidebook material dealing with the speech quality being worked on next.
TIMING: No talk should go overtime. Neither should the counsel and remarks of the counselor. Talks Nos. 2 through 4 should tactfully be stopped when the time is up. The one assigned to give the “stop signal” should do so immediately. When brothers handling Assignment No. 1 go overtime, they should be given private counsel. All should watch their timing carefully. Total program: 45 minutes, not counting song and prayer.
WRITTEN REVIEW: Periodically a written review will be given. In preparation, review the assigned material and complete the scheduled Bible reading. The school overseer will already have made sure that he covers main points that should be highlighted and that were overlooked by the speakers. Only the Bible may be used during this 25-minute review. The balance of the time will be devoted to a discussion of the questions and answers. Each student will check his own paper. The school overseer will read off all answers and concentrate on the more difficult questions, helping all to understand the answers clearly. If, for some reason, local circumstances make it necessary, the written review may be used a week later than what is shown on the schedule.
LARGE AND SMALL CONGREGATIONS: Congregations with a school enrollment of 75 or more students may wish to arrange for additional groups of students to deliver the scheduled talks before other counselors. Of course, nondedicated persons who are leading lives that conform to Christian principles may also enroll in the school and receive assignments.
ABSENTEES: All in the congregation can show appreciation for this school by endeavoring to be present at every weekly session, by preparing their assignments well and by participating in question sessions. It is hoped that all students will view their assignments conscientiously. If a student is not present when scheduled, a volunteer may take the assignment, making whatever application he feels qualified to make on such short notice. Or, the school overseer may cover the material with appropriate audience participation.

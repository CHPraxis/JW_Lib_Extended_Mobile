<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">The minds of children are like sponges. They absorb what they hear, and they <em>repeat </em>what they hear. How fine it is when they <em>want </em>to listen to what is wholesome and beneficial! Parents who have obtained the cassette tapes of <em>My Book of Bible Stories </em>are now enjoying this experience. The tapes of this marvelous publication really hold young onesâ€™ attention.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Since the tapes of the 116 accounts in <em>My Book of Bible Stories </em>give the listener an idea of what the Bible is all about, what a truly marvelous way this is to teach young ones! The album with the four cassettes is only $8 (U.S.).</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Please send me, postpaid, the brown vinyl album with the four cassette tapes of <em>My Book of Bible Stories. </em>I enclose $8 (U.S.).</p>

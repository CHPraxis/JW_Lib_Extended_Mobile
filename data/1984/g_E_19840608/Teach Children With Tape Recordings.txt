Teach Children With Tape Recordings
The minds of children are like sponges. They absorb what they hear, and they repeat what they hear. How fine it is when they want to listen to what is wholesome and beneficial! Parents who have obtained the cassette tapes of My Book of Bible Stories are now enjoying this experience. The tapes of this marvelous publication really hold young onesâ€™ attention.
Since the tapes of the 116 accounts in My Book of Bible Stories give the listener an idea of what the Bible is all about, what a truly marvelous way this is to teach young ones! The album with the four cassettes is only $8 (U.S.).
Please send me, postpaid, the brown vinyl album with the four cassette tapes of My Book of Bible Stories. I enclose $8 (U.S.).

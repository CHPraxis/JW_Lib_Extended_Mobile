<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">NEIGHBORS called Peter a “nice guy . . . who was hooked on running and playing tennis.” A mere 33 years old, he could already boast a prestigious job and acclaim as an amateur athlete. But one morning he strangled his father. The provocation? According to the <em>Daily News, </em>Peter shouted, “The Devil made me do this!”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Criminals invoking the Devil-made-me-do-it alibi, however, often find themselves being rushed off for psychiatric examination rather than gaining acquittal. And in some circles merely expressing <em>belief </em>in the Devil is enough to bring one’s sanity into question. ‘A shadowy figure who runs around promoting murder and mayhem? Ridiculous!’ say many. A bit more palatable, perhaps, is the notion that the Devil is just a symbol of the evil in man himself.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Imperfect man, to be sure, does have an evil side. “The inclination of the heart of man is bad from his youth up,” says the Bible. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:8:21-1:8:21" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Genesis 8:21</a>) But decades of research by psychologists to find ‘the Devil within’ have produced little more than conflicting theories, often riddled with inconsistencies and problems. (See box.)</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Take, for example, those who attribute human violence to our supposed evolutionary inheritance from animals. In his book <em>The Anatomy of Human Destructiveness, </em><span id="page4" class="pageNum" data-no="4" data-before-text="4"></span>Erich Fromm argues that, contrary to popular opinion, violence is <em>not </em>an animal’s sole response to danger: “The impulse to flee plays . . . the same if not a larger role in animal behavior than the impulse to fight.” So even if one were to accept the problem-filled theory of evolution, the concept of man as an innately violent animal is suspect. But if man is not his own worst enemy, then who is?</p>

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sc"><strong>The Search for </strong>‘<strong>the Devil Within’</strong></p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sc">  Many have been the attempts to prove that man alone is the source of evil. Psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud saw man as driven by powerful life-and-death instincts. Freud’s former collaborator Carl Jung, however, saw the “Devil” in man as a “shadow” or animallike personality that emerges when man tries to repress his evil side. Konrad Lorenz said that aggression is innate, a leftover of man’s evolutionary past. Many biologists feel that genetic or organic abnormalities might be the triggers of human violence. Complicating the picture even further are those who say that <em>nurture​</em>—not <em>nature</em>—​is responsible for ‘the Devil’ in man. By this, behaviorists mean that environmental factors, such as family and friends, produce evil.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">“André Maurois [French novelist] has recounted an incident between soldiers who met in the trenches during World War I. A Portuguese soldier offered to teach a French soldier a thousand words of Portuguese in less than one minute for 100 francs. The French soldier accepted. ‘Look,’ said the Portuguese, ‘all the words you have in French that end in <em>-tion </em>are the same in Portuguese, except that they end in <em>-ção . . . </em>There are over a thousand of them and they are all feminine gender, just like French. That took less than a minute, didn’t it? One hundred francs, please.’”​—<em>Native Tongues, </em>by Charles Berlitz.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Often this same principle applies in converting English words into French, Spanish, Italian or Portuguese, and vice versa. Thus many words ending in <em>-tion </em>in English have the same spelling in French, but sometimes with accents added. In Spanish the <em>-tion </em>becomes <em>-ción; </em>in Italian <em>-zione; </em>in Portuguese <em>-ção</em>. Example: <em>nation: nation </em>(Fr.); <em>nación </em>(Sp.); <em>nazione </em>(It.); <em>nação </em>(Port.).</p>

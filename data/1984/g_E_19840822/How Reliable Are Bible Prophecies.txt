How Reliable Are Bible Prophecies?
IT IS natural for man to be interested in the future. But what human really knows what the future holds? Is it not true that human predictions often fail because of unforeseen occurrences or because of things that people desperately hope will not happen and so refuse to include in their calculations?
Does this mean that no one can foretell the future? What about the Bible’s numerous predictions? Are they reliable? Some of these prophecies concern the rise and fall of world empires. There are scores of prophecies regarding the birth, life and death of Jesus Christ. Others refer to conditions on this earth during the conclusion of the system of things and foretell that this marked time period is to be followed by a new order under the rule of God’s Kingdom.
Were Some Written After the Fulfillment?
This is the conclusion that atheists have come to. Take, for example, Jesus’ words regarding the destruction of Jerusalem and its temple, foretold to take place within the generation of those who heard him. Regarding this, The Great Soviet Encyclopedia, which promotes atheism, says: “On the basis of a number of allusions in the Gospels to the Jewish uprising of A.D. 66-70, it is apparent that they could not have been written before A.D. 70. Furthermore, a papyrus fragment of the Gospel of John, dating from around A.D. 125, has been preserved. Consequently, it seems reasonable to assume that the Gospels were written sometime around the turn of the second century A.D.”
It is true that the Gospel of John was written “around the turn of the second century,” about 98 C.E., but this is not so respecting the other three Gospels. The testimony of numerous early Christians and their catalogs of Bible books, all testifying that these accounts are genuine, is a matter of historical record. The Gospels of Matthew, Mark and Luke were written before the Roman attack on Jerusalem in 66 C.E., which was foretold in each one of them.​—Matthew 24:15, 16; Mark 13:14-20; Luke 19:41-44; 21:20-24.
Interestingly, museums the world over are full of Bible manuscripts containing prophecies written hundreds of years before their fulfillment. For example, The Great Soviet Encyclopedia says that the Dead Sea Scrolls “were written between the second century B.C. and A.D. 68.” To what conclusion would that lead a thinking person?
Well, one of the oldest of these Dead Sea Scrolls is the Isaiah manuscript (MS. 1). Respecting it, the renowned professor of archaeology Yigael Yadin recently said: “The scroll . . . has all the chapters of Isaiah from chapter one to sixty six . . . It is the oldest complete Biblical manuscript existing in the world today. Not more than about five or six hundred years elapsed between when the actual words of Isaiah were said and this scroll was copied in the 2nd century B.C. It is an amazing thing that although the original scroll in the museum is more than 2,000 years old how close it is to the Bible we read today either in Hebrew or in the translations which were made from the original Hebrew into English or other languages.”
Consider points 1, 10, 11 and 17 on the chart on pages 22 and 23. These are some examples of prophecies recorded by Isaiah and that were fulfilled long after the Isaiah Dead Sea Scroll was copied. These and other facts prove that Bible prophecies were indeed written in advance. But, you may ask:
Are They Vague or Specific?
Fortune-tellers, like Nostradamus, often use ambiguous words that can be taken in many different ways. This is done to protect themselves from embarrassment when their predictions fail. Can the same be said about Bible prophecies? Are they vague or are they specific?
In considering the chart, you will notice that the predictions made are specific. It was clearly foretold that Babylon and Edom would become permanently desolate, whereas the land of Judea would suffer a temporary desolation, in fact, for a specific time​—70 years. (Jeremiah 29:10) The very name of Babylon’s conqueror, Cyrus, was predicted by Isaiah over 190 years in advance. Regarding the Messiah, Isaiah prophesied that at his death he would be associated with the wicked ones and also with the rich class. The Gospel accounts clearly describe that Jesus was put to death with two criminals and later buried in a rich man’s tomb.​—Isaiah 53:9; Luke 23:32; John 19:38-42.
The reason why Bible prophecies are specific is that they come from a source higher than man. The Creator, Jehovah God, who inspired men to record these predictions, knows how humans are made and what motivates them to act the way they do. He can accurately foretell the outcome for people who obey his righteous commands and for those who try to ignore them. He knows what his own purpose is, and he has the power and wisdom to ensure its fulfillment. He says: “From the beginning I foretold the future, and predicted beforehand what is to be. . . . I will do whatever I choose.”​—Isaiah 46:9, 10, The Jerusalem Bible.
Points 14-17 on the accompanying chart direct attention to evidence that we are living in what the Bible terms “the last days.” “The last days” of what? The entire global system of things that rejects Jehovah’s universal sovereignty, either ignoring God or distorting his ways. The Bible shows that hypocritical and false religion will be the first to come to its end​—this by the hand of earth’s political powers at God’s appointed time. (Revelation 17:16, 17; 18:2-8) Following that, God’s Kingdom itself will crush all human governments​—all of which have a record of bloodshed and put their own desires ahead of God’s commands—​and will bring about a united world under God’s rule.​—Daniel 2:44; 7:13, 14.
Under God’s Kingdom, earth’s survivors will at last enjoy real peace and there will be an abundance of food, not just for some nations and social groups, but for all mankind. (Psalm 37:10, 11; Isaiah 25:6) Sickness and death will come to be things of the past. (Revelation 21:3, 4) Even those of the human dead whom God remembers will be resurrected.​—John 5:28, 29.
Will all these marvelous prophecies really come true? There is no valid reason for doubt. Hundreds of past prophecies have proved reliable, so we can have absolute confidence in the fulfillment of these too.
How can you survive the predicted destruction of this old system into God’s New Order? The prophet Zephaniah answers: “Seek Jehovah, all you meek ones of the earth . . . Seek righteousness, seek meekness. Probably you may be concealed in the day of Jehovah’s anger.”​—Zephaniah 2:3.

‘It Gets to the Hearts of Children’
Would you appreciate something that does that? A letter from England explains:
“I would like you to know that the pink book Listening to the Great Teacher really does manage to get to the hearts of young children. My daughter is always reading the Teacher book and quite often my son Paul reads his.
“I must congratulate you and your staff on how you have compiled the book. My two children, Paul 11 years old and Dawn Caroline 9 1⁄2 years old, are truly delighted with their books. It is also making my job easier, ours being a one-parent family, because the books are guiding them to the straight paths.”
You can receive this aid to child rearing by simply filling in and mailing the accompanying coupon along with 75 cents.
Please send, postpaid, the hardbound, 192-page book Listening to the Great Teacher. I enclose 75 cents (U.S.). (For price in other countries, please contact local Watch Tower Society office.)

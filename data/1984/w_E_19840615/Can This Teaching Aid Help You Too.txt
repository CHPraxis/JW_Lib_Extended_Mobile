Can This Teaching Aid Help You Too?
While in a doctor’s office, a member of the Board of Education picked up and read a copy of the book Your Youth​—Getting the Best out of It. When she was given a personal copy, she wrote in appreciation:
“I will use its wisdom a lot, I will also try to give some of it to the troubled little ones that I see every day at our school. . . . I wish to God that I had had it in my early years and the wisdom to listen and follow it. I will keep it close by so that maybe my grandchildren may also benefit from it.
You can obtain this fine teaching aid now by filling in and mailing the accompanying coupon.
Please send, postpaid, the hardbound, 192-page book Your Youth​—Getting the Best out of It. I enclose 75 cents (U.S.). (For price in other countries, please contact local Watch Tower Society office.)

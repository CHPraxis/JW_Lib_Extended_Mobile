<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sh">Beloved Brothers,</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">When you said that the book <strong>You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth </strong>was “a marvelous teaching aid” you were so very right.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">As I looked through my copy I was inclined to be one of those doubting Thomases. The book was beautiful and easy to read and understand, but would it appeal to those people it was meant for, everyone at the door, in the office and next door?</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The answer was yes! yes! yes! Most of my placements have been at the doctor’s office where I work, but the book placed itself next door.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">D​——​D​——​ lives next door to me. She is a bright, sweet, enterprising 13-year-old who goes nonstop with words and movement all her waking hours.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">One afternoon while visiting my daughter, she picked up that “little red book.” D​——​ has not been the same since. She has studied chapter one only and has attended all the meetings her father will let her, cleaned up her room, her mouth, her associations and her music. She has become quiet, submissive and a real pleasure to be with. She has changed so very much that her mother now wants to study that same book so that she can be as happy as her little girl.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">I do not know where this will end, but hopefully, no, prayerfully, it will be with two more who love Jehovah and his Son and share that “little red book” with others.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sj">With Deepest Love,</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sj">D. L. F.</p>

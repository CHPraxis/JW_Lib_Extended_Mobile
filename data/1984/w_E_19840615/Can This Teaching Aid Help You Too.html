<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">While in a doctor’s office, a member of the Board of Education picked up and read a copy of the book <em>Your Youth​—Getting the Best out of It. </em>When she was given a personal copy, she wrote in appreciation:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“I will use its wisdom a lot, I will also try to give some of it to the troubled little ones that I see every day at our school. . . . I wish to God that I had had it in my early years and the wisdom to listen and follow it. I will keep it close by so that maybe my grandchildren may also benefit from it.</p>

Adopted as School Textbooks
The small mountainous country of Lesotho forms an enclave in South Africa. School principals in the area of Maseru, the capital, were interviewed and each was presented with a set of the books Your Youth​—Getting the Best out of It, Making Your Family Life Happy and My Book of Bible Stories. As a result, one school took 50 Youth books, and in another the Bible Stories book was adopted as an official textbook. Seven classes, involving 260 pupils, began using the book.
We believe that you and your family will also benefit from the wholesome instruction in these publications. Each is hardbound; the Youth book and the Family book each has 192 pages. My Book of Bible Stories has 256 pages, the same page size as this magazine, and it is filled with over 125 large illustrations, most in beautiful color. Receive all three publications for only $4.
Please send me, postpaid, My Book of Bible Stories, Your Youth​—Getting the Best out of It and Making Your Family Life Happy. I enclose $4 (U.S.).

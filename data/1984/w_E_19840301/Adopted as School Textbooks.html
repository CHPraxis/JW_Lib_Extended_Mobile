<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">The small mountainous country of Lesotho forms an enclave in South Africa. School principals in the area of Maseru, the capital, were interviewed and each was presented with a set of the books <em>Your Youth​—Getting the Best out of It, Making Your Family Life Happy </em>and <em>My Book of Bible Stories. </em>As a result, one school took 50 <em>Youth </em>books, and in another the <em>Bible Stories </em>book was adopted as an official textbook. Seven classes, involving 260 pupils, began using the book.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">We believe that you and your family will also benefit from the wholesome instruction in these publications. Each is hardbound; the <em>Youth </em>book and the <em>Family </em>book each has 192 pages. <em>My Book of Bible Stories </em>has 256 pages, the same page size as this magazine, and it is filled with over 125 large illustrations, most in beautiful color. Receive all three publications for only $4.</p>

It is even high in the United States. Is there anything families can do to lessen its impact? What may help in finding a job? If no jobs are available, what other possibilities are there? Whether your family is currently affected by unemployment or not, the articles starting on page 3 will be of benefit to you. <em>The Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>are available for a contribution of 30c.” Father takes several recent issues of <em>Awake! </em>and shows how easy it is to use “Feature Articles” section on page 2 of each issue to develop brief, simple magazine presentations. He shows another family member how to develop a presentation from the August 1, 1984, <em>Watchtower: </em>“Many persons question the existence of God. Others believe in God and would like to be closer to him. This issue of <em>The Watchtower </em>raises the question ‘How Close Is God to You?’ It shows how young ones can be helped to be close to God. This vital information together with the <em>Awake! </em>is yours for 30c.”</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>The September 1983 <em>Our Kingdom Ministry </em>insert explained how congregations may contribute to the Society Kingdom Hall Fund. Since then, such contributions have been coming in to the Society’s office month by month. Your unselfish support of the Kingdom Hall expansion program is very much appreciated.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:9:7-47:9:7" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Cor. 9:7</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>During the early part of this service year, a committee of brothers in each circuit made a survey of congregations having the most pressing need for new Kingdom Halls. Based on these surveys, arrangements have been made to assist some of these congregations located in California, Colorado, Florida, Louisiana, New York, North Carolina and Wisconsin.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>However, it is quite apparent that hundreds of other congregations are also in need of assistance. The Society, therefore, is in the process of sending out questionnaires to congregations in areas where, according to the surveys, the greatest needs exist. Hence, it is suggested that congregations should not write to the Society regarding loans unless a questionnaire has been received requesting detailed information, or unless an emergency situation exists.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>As contributions to the Society Kingdom Hall Fund continue to be received month by month and those congregations already assisted begin repaying their loans, it will be possible to increase gradually the number of loans made. We are most thankful to Jehovah for the great increase of “other sheep,” which makes it necessary to obtain more Kingdom Halls, and for the share we can all have in support of this program.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:3:6-46:3:9" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Cor. 3:6-9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:9:8-47:9:12" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 2 Cor. 9:8-12</a>.</p>

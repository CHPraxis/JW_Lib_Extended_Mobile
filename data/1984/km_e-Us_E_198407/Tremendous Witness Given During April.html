<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The April report was truly outstanding! It gives strong evidence of Jehovah’s abundant favor and blessings upon our united efforts to make known his provisions for salvation. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:67:1-19:67:2" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ps. 67:1, 2</a>) We are thankful to our God for what has been accomplished as indicated below:</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="si">Total Publishers: 662,520. This surpasses our March peak by 10,202.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="si">Total Auxiliary Pioneers: 93,990. An increase of 9,705 over the peak in April of last year.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="si">Regular Pioneers: 29,098. This exceeds our March peak by 199.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="si">Total Hours: 12,954,379. This is over one million more hours than our peak in April a year ago.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="si">Return Visits: 4,395,110. Exceeds our previous peak by 346,629.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="si">Home Bible Studies: 450,658. This is 8,554 more than our peak last month.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">The above increases enhance, in a most fitting way, the theme of our conventions this summer. Along with hundreds of thousands who will attend the “Kingdom Increase” District Conventions this month, let us bless our God, Jehovah, and pray that the volume of praise to him may be greatly increased throughout all the earth.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:66:8-19:66:8" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ps. 66:8</a>.</p>

“They Have Affected My Life-Style”
A man from Ghana, West Africa, said this about The Watchtower and Awake! He wrote: “I can certainly say that these magazines have won my heart over for Christ. They give me more information one needs to know about Christ and salvation. When these magazines were first introduced to me by a bosom friend, I thought they would be boring. Strangely, the more I read them the more I enjoyed them. They have affected my life-style. I found them more interesting and very educative.
“Please,” the man concluded, “send me copies of these great magazines from month to month.” You, too, can have The Watchtower and Awake! delivered to your home. Send only $8 and you will receive both of these magazines (four copies a month) for one year.
Please send a year’s subscription for the Watchtower and Awake! magazines. I enclose $8 (U.S.) for 48 issues. (For price in other countries, please contact local Watch Tower Society office.)

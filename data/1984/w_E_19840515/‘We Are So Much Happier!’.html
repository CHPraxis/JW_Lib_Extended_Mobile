<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A woman said that this was true as a result of reading the book <em>Making Your Family Life Happy. </em>She explained:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“Friends gave my husband and me a copy of this book and it has made such a difference to our lives. We are both pensioners and I am disabled. Unfortunately we were having differences that made us unhappy. Since reading your book we have realized we both have many faults and we are trying hard to correct them. We are so much happier, but what a pity we did not know about this book years ago! It would be wonderful if every couple could be given a copy when they were first married. So much unhappiness would be avoided!”</p>

Could it be they don’t have God’s backing? Have they turned away from the high moral standard of the Bible? Let the facts presented in Is the Bible Really the Word of God? set straight a common misunderstanding about the relationship of the churches to the Bible. Read the chapter “Do Christendom’s Churches Represent the Bible?” Only $1.

Making “the Hardest Job” a Bit Easier
MANY letters have been received expressing appreciation for the Awake! series “Young People Ask . . . ,” as well as the series “God’s Word Is Alive” that appears in The Watchtower, also published by the Watchtower Society. Among them is a letter from a mother of four who has found a novel way to use these articles. She writes: “Raising children successfully, especially in this wicked old system, is the hardest job any of us will ever have. Children really appreciate it when there are ‘special’ things just for them such as these articles. However, all too often we [parents] read through the magazines ourselves but don’t make the time to share them with our children that aren’t able to read yet.
“We therefore devised a way to get the most out of these articles and make it fun, too. We had a party and invited some of the children in the congregation. They were told to bring older issues of The Watchtower that featured ‘God’s Word Is Alive’ and Awake! with ‘Young People Ask . . . ’ We provided them with plenty of construction paper, glue, markers, scissors, etc., and had everyone [cut out the articles and] make their own book! The teenagers used ‘Young People Ask . . . ’ and the little ones, even ones in kindergarten who do not read yet, used ‘God’s Word Is Alive.’ So after playing Bible games and enjoying refreshments, everyone left with his own book with a tailor-made cover and encouragement to read it at home. The books were put together in such a way that more articles can be added later.”
What has resulted from these efforts? She continues: “Our little ones now come up to us with their books, reminding us to read to them. Thank you again for these fine articles!”

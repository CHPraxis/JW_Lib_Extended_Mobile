Song 148
Exalting Our God the King
(Psalm 145:1)
1. O sing to Jehovah a song!
Exalt him, our God, all day long.
His name let us bring to the fore
And draw near to him more and more.
He opens his hand to us all,
Is ready to help lest we fall.
Be loyal to him we all should;
Jehovah is gracious and good.
2. So may we be loyal and true
And say ev’ry day: ‘I bless you.’
For righteous is God in his ways;
His greatness deserves all our praise.
All those loving him he will guard;
The going will not be too hard.
He helps us to bear all the stress.
Our Great King, Jehovah, we bless.
3. God’s Kingdom is now close at hand
To bring what is right, what is grand.
His Kingdom proclaim far and wide,
O you who have been satisfied.
Jehovah has set up on high
The King whom no man dare defy.
The wicked will soon be removed.
God’s sov’reignty then will be proved.

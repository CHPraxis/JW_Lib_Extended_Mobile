Song 135
Jehovah, Our Place of Dwelling
(Psalm 90:1)
1. O Jah, you’ve been our place of dwelling
In all our generations past.
Before you made the hills and mountains,
Your awesome majesty stood fast.
You are the God to time indef’nite;
To endless years you are the same.
And though you turned man to crushed matter,
Your boundless love did us reclaim.
2. A thousand years, so long in passing,
To you seem but as yesterday.
But man is like the grass that blossoms
In morning dew, then fades away.
Our years are seventy or eighty
If we have special mightiness;
Yet their insistence is on trouble,
And filled they are with hurtfulness.
3. O teach us how our days to number,
That we may evermore rejoice.
As we apply our hearts to wisdom,
Our lips praise you with thankful voice.
O may your pleasantness, Jehovah,
Upon your servants prove to be.
Establish all the work our hands do;
Establish our activity.

Song 188
The Gift of Prayer
(1 Timothy 2:8)
1. Pray’rs to God are truly heard
From all those who keep his Word.
And through Jesus Christ alone,
We can reach God’s holy throne.
2. Pray’rs that reach Jehovah’s ear
Earnest need to be, sincere.
Being heartfelt, they reflect
To our God all due respect.
3. But in praying to our God,
We have need ourselves to prod
Lest our words become mere rote.
Rather, may they warmth denote.
4. Yes, we must find time to pray
As we walk the narrow way.
Pray’r consoles and does uplift;
Truly it’s God’s gracious gift.

Song 50
Responding to God’s Love
(1 John 4:11)
1. Great God, there’s none above you; wholeheartedly we love you,
Jehovah, so deserving of praise.
We hail your name so famous, your Word by which you let us
Now learn the things about all your ways.
You show such tender feeling, yet just you prove in dealing;
You manifest such wisdom and pow’r.
By Scripture we can be sure that if we keep our hearts pure,
You’ll pour out blessings on us—a show’r.
2. You were the first to love us; your love through Christ does move us
To love you in return from our hearts.
To sanctify your name and reveal your love, Christ came;
And eternal life he thereby imparts.
No greater love had any than he who gave for many
His life, a gift at great sacrifice.
That we may never perish, his shepherding we cherish
And heed his counsel and his advice.
3. From faithful Kingdom service this world will never swerve us;
We’ll keep on telling out what is true.
In service free and willing, we would be e’er fulfilling
A love that gives to all what is due.
As we thus serve together, our love for one another
Discloses those who follow your Son.
His Kingdom values we take and of them proper use make;
We long to hear his promised “Well done.”

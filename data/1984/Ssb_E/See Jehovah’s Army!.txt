Song 166
See Jehovah’s Army!
(Joel 2:7)
1. See Jehovah’s army,
Loosed from Bab’lon’s chains,
Heralding the Kingdom
In which Jesus reigns.
Boldly they press forward,
Each a volunteer;
Flintlike are their faces,
With no hint of fear.
They trust God Jehovah,
Follow Christ his Son,
Joyfully proclaiming:
“God’s rule has begun.”
2. See Jehovah’s servants
Searching for the sheep,
Whom in Bab’lon’s bondage
The false shepherds keep.
These they try to rescue
With repeated calls;
These they keep inviting
To their Kingdom Halls.
When a sheep they get free,
How they follow through
And persist in teaching
Truths both old and new.
3. See the great crowd marching
Under Christ’s command,
With the faithful remnant,
A courageous band.
Cautious just like serpents,
Dovelike, free from guile,
They brave persecution,
Keep true under trial.
They delight to honor
God their Lord and King;
So in their pure worship,
They are prospering.

Song 157
Worship Jehovah During Youth
(Ecclesiastes 12:1)
1. Out of the mouth of babes, God once brought praise;
They, to hail Jesus, their voices did raise.
Yes, even babes can their God magnify,
Join with their elders and him sanctify.
2. To Christian parents who love what is true,
Godly fear is by their own children due.
Standing for God, they to teach have the right.
Children, obey them and bring them delight.
3. O Christian youths, strive to keep your way clean;
Learn while you’re young on Jehovah to lean.
But to be popular never do toil,
For bad companions good habits will spoil.
4. If you remember your God in your youth
And serve Jehovah in spirit and truth,
As you grow older, more joy you will know
And make God’s own heart with gladness to glow.

Song 140
Waiting on Jehovah
(Lamentations 3:22-27)
1. O God, your loving-kindnesses
Have spared us to this day!
O may your goodness never end
T’ward us who tread your way!
2. Your mercies, O Jehovah God,
Are made each morning new.
Abundant is your faithfulness
T’ward all who trust in you.
3. It’s good for able-bodied man
To bear the yoke in youth,
To wait in silence on his God
While serving him in truth.
4. Jehovah God, you are our share.
O may we ever show
A teachable, meek attitude
While learning you to know!

Song 189
Proclaiming Jehovah’s Day of Vengeance
(Isaiah 61:2)
1. The trumpets now are sounding;
The call is loud and clear.
Jehovah’s day of vengeance
Is drawing ever near.
We tell it out with boldness,
Though men may frown and scorn.
The warning must be given;
God’s Kingdom has been born.
2. The battle is Jehovah’s.
His Son directs the fight.
Victorious is the finish,
Exalting truth and right.
All strategy of Satan
Will surely come to naught.
To carry out our warfare,
Our hands by God are taught.
3. God’s watchmen must give warning.
As one, they raise their voice.
Each stands in his position
According to God’s choice.
Jehovah times all matters;
The time is getting short
For us to preach God’s Kingdom
And make a good report.

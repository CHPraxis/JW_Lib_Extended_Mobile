Song 153
Jehovah, the God of Our Salvation
(Psalm 85:7)
1. Our Lord Jehovah, God above,
Our sins forgive in your great love.
We were in error all conceived,
And of God’s truth we were bereaved.
Please save us with your helping hand.
Lead us, O Lord, to your own land.
Into your favor do us bring.
Of your salvation we shall sing.
Of your salvation we shall sing.
2. Gathered we are, Lord, to your fold,
As sheeplike ones whom Christ foretold.
Now your salvation can be found
For straying mankind earth around.
We know the peace that you impart
To ev’ry humble, grateful heart.
How wise are those that do you fear.
For them salvation now is near.
For them salvation now is near.
3. Your truth and kindness, how they sprout!
Reason we have with joy to shout.
Wonderful things we see today,
Since o’er the earth your Son holds sway.
This is the time of Kingdom pow’r,
When truth and peace among us flow’r.
May we proclaim it far and wide.
Our grand salvation you provide.
Our grand salvation you provide.

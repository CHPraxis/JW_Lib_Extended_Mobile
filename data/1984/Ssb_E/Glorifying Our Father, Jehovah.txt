Song 96
Glorifying Our Father, Jehovah
(John 17:4)
1. Jehovah, your creation sings
Of honor, pow’r, and glory.
You willed, so all created things
Exist and tell their story.
Rich blessings flow from your great hand,
Good gifts, all perfect presents.
You’ve made prophetic patterns grand,
Fulfilled now in Christ’s presence.
At birth child Jesus was adored
By your angelic chorus.
How good you are, through Christ our Lord,
Providing ransom for us!
2. With joy we note just how your Son
Fulfilled his sacred mission,
How he on earth the vict’ry won
And changed mankind’s condition,
And how as King upon the throne,
He carries out your orders.
Your name and purpose he makes known
To all the nations’ borders.
Why, we your people find delight
In crying out with gladness:
‘The Lord Jehovah, God of light,
Will soon wipe out all sadness!’
3. Should we not, then, your praises sing,
E’er seek to give you pleasure,
Our lives in dedication bring,
And serve you in full measure?
Your name we ever must uphold,
Your work bring to its finish.
May we ne’er let our love grow cold
Nor let our zeal diminish.
But with our heart and mind and soul,
We choose to serve you ever.
To bring great honor to your name
Will e’er be our endeavor.

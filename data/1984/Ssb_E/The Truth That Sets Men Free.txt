Song 121
The Truth That Sets Men Free
(John 8:32)
1. Mosaic Law and prophecies of cent’ries long ago
Were pointing to a precious truth that we have come to know.
It is the truth that sets men free, the truth about God’s Seed
—How through Christ Jesus men can gain the life that’s life indeed.
2. ‘I am the way, the truth, the life,’ Christ Jesus rightly said.
He came to earth our sins to bear, for men his blood to shed,
To vindicate his Father’s name and prove that God is true
And, now in this time of the end, God’s enemies subdue.
3. It is through God Jehovah’s Son that truth has come to be.
And it assures us that all sin will end eternally.
He is the Seed, the Promised One, who magnifies God’s name.
As King and Priest, he’s reigning now; this fact we all proclaim.
4. With faith-inspiring truth, we preach about the Son of God.
We are equipped to tell good news; our feet with peace are shod.
God’s Messianic Kingdom is the truth we must uphold.
Let’s raise it high for all to see and work for it whole-souled.

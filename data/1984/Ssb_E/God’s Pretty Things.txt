Song 25
God’s Pretty Things
(Ecclesiastes 3:11)
1. Each pretty thing God made
In its appointed time.
To eat and drink and work,
This is a gift sublime.
And time indefinite
Deep in our hearts he placed.
So hope of endless life
We rightly all embraced.
2. Jehovah’s will it is
Upon mankind to pour
Rich blessings so that they
May love him all the more.
With his delightful things,
Men will be occupied;
And for eternity
God will with them reside.
3. An occupation grand
That we have come to learn
Is that of witnessing;
It is our high concern.
This is a gift of God
And brings us happiness.
It is a pretty thing
That we today possess.
4. With wisdom let us all
Live each day as we should
And make God’s purpose known
And seek to do what’s good.
This is our precious lot
That we so gladly take,
And all these things we do
For God Jehovah’s sake.

Song 196
Jehovah’s Dedicated Ones
(John 10:16)
1. There’s a nation set apart,
Dedicated in the heart.
Living by Jehovah’s law,
Sheeplike ones to him they draw.
2. A great crowd does now appear.
To the Shepherd they are dear.
Dedicated and baptized,
They by him are greatly prized.
3. Forth they go to preach the Word,
Bold and fearless, undeterred.
Serving with God’s remnant few,
They resemble drops of dew.
4. Little flock and other sheep
Bounteous blessings now do reap.
Imitating Christ their King,
Joy to God’s own heart they bring.

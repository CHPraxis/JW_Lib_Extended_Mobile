Song 110
Be Forgiving
(Ephesians 4:32)
1. Lovingly our God, Jehovah,
For our sins provision made,
Sent his Son to be our ransom,
Thus extending needed aid.
When we really are repentant,
His forgiveness we can claim
On the basis of Christâ€™s ransom,
Asking pardon in his name.
2. But God only grants forgiveness
To those who like him would be,
Who, forgiving freely others,
Show true love and empathy.
O since we are so imperfect,
We all frequently transgress
By some thoughtless word or action.
Hence we all need forgiveness.
3. Surely, days of bitter sorrow
Our forgiving can prevent;
By it we show loving-kindness
That indeed is heaven-sent.
Our forgiving others freely
From the heart proves us mature,
Shows a depth of understanding,
And helps them peace to secure.
4. True forgiveness is a virtue
That we all should cultivate.
It will keep us from resentment,
From the bitterness of hate.
When we truly are forgiving,
We resemble God Most High,
Who takes pleasure in forgiving,
And his grace we magnify.

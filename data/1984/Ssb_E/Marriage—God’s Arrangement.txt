Song 117
Marriage—God’s Arrangement
(Matthew 19:4-6)
1. Marriage is God’s arrangement.
By him it was designed.
It forms a bond of union,
Brings blessings to mankind.
Yoking a man and woman
In this most sacred state
Helps them serve God together
—Each one with his own mate.
2. God has an ancient guidebook
With counsel good and wise.
It tells of godlike headship,
Which husbands exercise.
‘Love her as your own body.’
This God requires of them.
She who respects her husband
Is like a precious gem.
3. Cords of three strands are stronger
Than those of only two.
When God is in a marriage,
Then problems will be few.
There’s greater joy in giving.
This truth we all must learn.
So as we serve Jehovah,
To give is our concern.

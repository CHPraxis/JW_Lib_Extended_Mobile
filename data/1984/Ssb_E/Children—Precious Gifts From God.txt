Song 164
Children—Precious Gifts From God
 (Psalm 127:3, 4)
1. Precious gifts from God our children are,
A possession to train and to teach.
Like the arrows of a mighty man,
We must aim them the target to reach.
They are gifts from God;
He says: ‘Use the rod.’
Yet with tenderness and loving care,
Make their training a matter of prayer.
2. The real feelings in a youthful heart
To draw up will require all our skill.
But by starting at an early age,
Kingdom truth we can deeply instill.
We can reach the heart
If we early start.
Look to God for help, on him rely,
As his words we sincerely apply.
3. By communicating ev’ry day,
Then our children will always feel free
To express themselves without restraint;
Their true friends and companions we’ll be.
Do not them berate.
Just communicate.
We ourselves must strive to keep from blame
As these arrows we carefully aim.
4. An inheritance our children are,
But to God they do truly belong.
They’re a fruitage that brings rich rewards
If we teach them the right from the wrong.
How we hope and yearn
That they’ll really learn.
Trust in God child-rearing to repay.
With our children let’s praise him each day.

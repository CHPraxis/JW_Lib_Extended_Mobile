Rejoicing With God’s Nation
(Psalm 106:5)
1. Through our work of Kingdom preaching,
All mankind we are beseeching:
‘Come and hear the Bible’s teaching,
And for present Kingdom truth be reaching.’
God all men is calling,
From a fate that is appalling
To a prospect so enthralling,
To a grand new world that he’s installing.
(Chorus)
2. See! There is a holy nation
That Jehovah God did station
In his fold through dedication,
To declare his message of salvation.
God will show his favor
If we act with right behavior,
Imitating Christ our Savior;
From this godly course may we ne’er waver.
(Chorus)
3. In a land so good and spacious,
Free from strife and things vexatious,
Look! a happy crowd, vivacious
In God’s service that is efficacious.
They’re no longer sighing.
Truth from God they are now buying,
In their lives his Word applying,
And his name they keep on glorifying.
(CHORUS)
So come, you peoples, rejoice!
With God’s nation give voice
To this life-giving message so grand.
Bow down to God on his throne.
Make his worship your own.
On the side of his Kingdom take your stand.

Song 11
The Shulammite Remnant
(Song of Solomon 6:13)
1. ‘Dear Shulammite maiden, so lovely and fair,
Your spiritual virtues are many and rare.
Your speaking is pleasant, your charms a delight.
Your fellowship holds me, beloved Shulammite.’
2. Thus speaks her Fine Shepherd, Christ Jesus her Lord.
He wants her to share his eternal reward.
And how does the fair one, so firm as a wall,
Reply to her Lord, as a model for all?
3. ‘Exclusive devotion is not up for hire,
Since blazings of love are like blazings of fire.
Unyielding as Sheol all true love will be.
Like flame of Jehovah is your love for me.’
4. Fair Shulammite remnant, temptations resist.
Stay clean for your Bridegroom; on virtue insist.
Your virgin companions that walk in your train
Rejoice at your course and the prize you will gain.

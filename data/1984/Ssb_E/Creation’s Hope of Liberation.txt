Song 142
Creation’s Hope of Liberation
(Romans 8:21)
1. Now all creation has tribulation;
Mankind is reaping what it’s sown.
God is rejected; men are subjected
To hurtful things that make them groan.
2. In expectation of true salvation,
Men must now look to God Most High.
He is befriending, help he is sending
To all those who now groan and sigh.
3. To liberation and restoration
The human fam’ly will attain.
God’s Son, anointed, has been appointed
To help men God’s kind favor gain.
4. Association with God’s new nation
Brings blessings to those who are meek.
They are awaiting, anticipating,
The Kingdom joys of which they speak.

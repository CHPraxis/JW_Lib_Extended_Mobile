Song 18
Bless Our Christian Brotherhood
(1 Peter 2:17)
1. Christ Jesus with kindness
And patience ever taught,
Instructing disciples
To whom God’s peace he brought.
He showed love in real brotherhood,
With zeal for righteousness,
Set patterns of humility,
Of love and faithfulness.
(Chorus)
2. How happy are Christians,
Who listen to God’s Word!
How blest are these meek ones,
Who act on what they’ve heard!
Disciples of Christ Jesus, known
For loving brotherhood,
Proclaim God’s Kingdom rule with joy
And do their brothers good.
(Chorus)
3. Let’s take to all lovers
Of truth the Kingdom news,
Help them see their priv’lege
The side of God to choose.
Yes, help them e’er to search for God,
While yet he may be found,
And join with our dear brotherhood,
That their joy may abound.
(CHORUS)
We praise you, Jehovah;
You truly are so good.
Lord Jehovah, heav’nly Father,
Do bless our Christian brotherhood.

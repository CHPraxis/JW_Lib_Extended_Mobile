Song 67
Store Up Treasures in Heaven
(Matthew 6:20)
1. How we ought to love Jehovah,
Father of celestial lights!
All good gifts, all perfect presents,
Come from him, all pure delights.
He gives clothing, food, and shelter,
Soil and seed and sun and rain.
Let’s give thanks to our Provider
That our lives he does sustain.
2. O what folly to be spending
All our time in selfish strife,
Heaping up mere transient treasures,
Which can never give us life!
Rather, let us be contented
With the things we really need,
And by good deeds, let’s take firm hold
On the life that’s life indeed.
3. So let’s use our time and riches
And our strength to feed the poor,
Giving hungry ones the good news
Of the Kingdom hope so sure.
For by kind, unselfish service,
Friends of God and Christ we’ll be,
Thereby storing up in heaven
Treasures for eternity.

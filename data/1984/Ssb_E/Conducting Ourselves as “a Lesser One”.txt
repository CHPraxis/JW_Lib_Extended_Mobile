Song 122
Conducting Ourselves as “a Lesser One”
(Luke 9:48)
1. Most favored are those who today
Will heed divine instruction.
The work of those who look to God
Is blessed with fine production.
But since we are afflicted by
Inherent imperfection,
We need to learn with humbleness
To give our God subjection.
2. ‘Conduct yourselves as lesser ones,’
Christ Jesus recommended.
It makes for peace and unity,
And this, indeed, is splendid.
A fine example he did set.
It was his greatest pleasure
To be submissive to his God
And serve him in full measure.
3. We wisely then should take the lead
In hon’ring one another
And keep in mind that Jesus died
For him who is our brother.
To God our brothers all belong;
To each one he gives talents.
So let us act as lesser ones
And keep our spir’tual balance.
4. The principle of headship is
An aid to recognizing
How we should keep self out of sight
And love be emphasizing.
God’s spirit is available
To help us, lest we stumble.
Our good relationship with God
Will keep us ever humble.

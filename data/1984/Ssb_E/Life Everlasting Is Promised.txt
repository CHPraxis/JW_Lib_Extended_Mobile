Song 109
Life Everlasting Is Promised
(Psalm 37:29)
1. Life everlasting is promised
By God Almighty, supreme,
Here on this earth in perfection.
All this is no mere dream.
(Chorus)
2. True is the promise God made us,
Soon to be grandly fulfilled:
‘Meek ones the earth will inherit.’
This is what God has willed.
(Chorus)
3. Our God, Jehovah, assures us
That he will make all things new.
Down from the heavens will trickle
His rich blessings, like dew.
(Chorus)
4. Jesus has fully confirmed it;
Paradise will be restored.
Then, in the new earth, Jehovah
Will be ever adored.
(CHORUS)
We can live forever.
It’s worth all endeavor.
God’s promise is faithful.
His Word will come true.

Song 217
Gaining Jehovah’s Friendship
(Psalm 15:1, 2)
1. Who will, Jehovah God, your loyal friendship gain?
Who in your tent as guest will you forever let remain?
’Tis he who faultlessly does serve God fearlessly,
Yes, he who’s pure in heart and speaks and acts most truthfully.
To whom, Jehovah God, do you your friendship give?
Who will in your great holy mountain with you really live?
The one whose speech reflects that he e’er checks his neighbor never to vex.
(Chorus)
2. O who, Jehovah God, will with you e’er reside?
Who can become your friend, the one with whom you will abide?
Yes, he who keeps his word, despite all pains incurred,
In love does walk uprightly, and with truth his loins will gird.
We do, Jehovah God, your friendship so desire.
Your Word informs and clearly states what you of us require.
We must our ways now mend, your rules ne’er bend so as to keep you as Friend.
(Chorus)
3. With you, Jehovah God, we ever want to dwell.
Your peace surpasses ev’rything; all thought it does excel.
Through Jesus Christ, our Lord, you have to us restored
Your true pure worship. Hence by multitudes you’re now adored.
And so, our God Most High, we lovingly will guard
Your precious friendship and thus keep our very lives unmarred.
As one united band, we take our stand on your high mountain so grand.
(CHORUS)
Jehovah, may we be your friends eternally.

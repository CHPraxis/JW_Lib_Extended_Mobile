The Bible’s Hope for Mankind
(Romans 12:12)
1. Dark days are here; man lives in fear,
With dire expectation as to all creation.
Having no hope, blindly they grope
As the system nears its end.
But the Bible gives us a reason for cheer,
Due to all the proofs that the Kingdom is near.
From the eyes of men God will wipe ev’ry tear.
Raise yourselves erect; you have nothing to fear.
2. Life’s darksome night, filled with much fright,
None can be denying, for all men are dying.
None from the grave his life can save;
All man’s work is vanity.
But the Bible holds out a hope for the dead,
That a resurrection for these lies ahead.
To refreshing fountains of life they’ll be led.
This is the good news that Jehovah has said.
3. Puffed up with pride, men God deride
With blasphemous slander, in sin’s ways meander.
Satan holds sway o’er earth today;
Wickedness is all around.
But the Bible tells us that soon there will be
Judgment from Jehovah, and then all will see
Blotting out of wicked ones eternally
And the meek ones filling the earth joyously.

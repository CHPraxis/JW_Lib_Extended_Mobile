Song 206
“Rejoice in the Hope”
(Romans 12:12)
1. To God O let us thanks e’er give
Because in joyful hope we live.
For hope serves as an anchor sure,
It helps us steadfast to endure.
Our hope is like a helmet too,
Keeps Satan’s sword from cutting through;
It helps us ward off wickedness
And strengthens us for righteousness.
2. How we enjoy our hope ahead
That even those who now are dead
Will duly from their tombs arise
And help make earth a paradise!
Ah, then to time indefinite,
All men on earth will benefit
From God’s provision, rich and kind,
And thus in him full joy they’ll find.
3. To keep our hope e’er bright and strong,
Our hearts we must keep free from wrong,
But daily feed upon God’s Word
And let our pray’rs by him be heard.
That others may have joy as we,
This hope let’s not keep selfishly
But make it known both far and wide,
Help yearning ones come on God’s side.

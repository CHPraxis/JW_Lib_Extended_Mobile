Song 57
Jehovah’s Happy People
(Psalm 89:15)
1. Happy are all those who the joyful shouting know,
To whom the truth you show, to whom your blessings flow.
For they will ever walk in the brightness of your face;
Happiness they find as each serves in his place.
(Chorus)
2. Satan and his legions are pressing all around,
So let our works abound. Make earth with praise resound.
Jehovah has provided a refuge for the meek;
He will all those shield who his righteousness seek.
(Chorus)
3. May we not lose courage, though many turn away,
Though they the truth gainsay. We’ll watch and fight and pray,
For we must stand the test and keep our integrity;
Since our God is pleased, we can serve faithfully.
(CHORUS)
Your loving-kindness, O God, you express
To all who publicly your name now confess.
With your Word and spirit, the truth they discern,
Show faith by works and act on what they learn.

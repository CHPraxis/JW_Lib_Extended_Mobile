Song 36
“Happy Are the Mild-Tempered”
(Matthew 5:5)
1. God blesses those who are mild-tempered;
Their happiness is truly great.
Though they may suffer, they’re not chafing;
But patiently on God they wait.
The wicked do not make them fret,
Who proudly set themselves on high.
They know such won’t get life eternal
But will, like green grass, fade and die.
2. ‘There was a time when I was youthful,
But now I’m old,’ King David said.
‘Yet never have I seen the righteous
Forsaken or his seed beg bread.’
Hence, walk uprightly, trust in God,
And deal with men in faithfulness.
If you take pleasure in Jehovah,
Your service he will greatly bless.
3. From earth the wicked soon will vanish;
There’ll be no place for them to stand,
While peace meek ones will be enjoying
And evermore possess the land.
Until that time may we maintain
That God’s Word is inspired and true
And prove ourselves both meek and lowly
In all we think and say and do.

Song 224
“Take My Yoke”
(Matthew 11:28-30)
1. You who toil so wearily,
Loaded down oppressively,
Jesus calls you tenderly:
‘For relief do come to me.’
2. ‘I am mild, of lowly heart,
And of this world am no part.
Learn of me the loving art,
Thus escape from hatred’s dart.’
3. ‘For my load is light, you’ll find,
And my yoke is truly kind.
I give rest for heart and mind
To all righteously inclined.’
4. Be to Christ, your Master, true.
He will guide and strengthen you.
In the yoke he’ll work with you
That you thus God’s will may do.

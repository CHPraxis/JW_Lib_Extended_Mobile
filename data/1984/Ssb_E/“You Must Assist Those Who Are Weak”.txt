Song 116
“You Must Assist Those Who Are Weak”
(Acts 20:35)
1. Many are the weaknesses
That we all possess.
But Jehovah God, indeed,
Loves us nonetheless.
He is so merciful,
His ways commendable.
May we imitate his love,
Help those in distress.
2. Rather than condemn the weak,
We should bear in mind
That much good can be obtained
By our being kind.
May we be diligent,
Give them encouragement.
Lending them our full support,
Comfort they will find.
3. ‘Who is weak and I’m not weak?’
Paul did emphasize.
We should feel what others feel,
With them sympathize.
Those stronger we exhort:
‘Give weak ones your support.’
With Christ’s blood they all were bought,
Life to realize.
4. That we should assist the weak,
God’s Word makes this plain.
Helping them in deed and truth,
Blessings we’ll obtain.
They to our God belong.
Hence they should all be strong.
If the weak we do assist,
God will us sustain.

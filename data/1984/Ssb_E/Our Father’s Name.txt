Song 52
Our Father’s Name
(Matthew 6:9)
1. Great Jehovah, heav’nly Father,
Let your name be sanctified.
Thus fulfill your sacred purpose,
Never more to be defied.
Soon will come the vindication,
By your own victorious deed.
Magnify your reputation;
To it may all men give heed.
(Chorus)
2. We seek ways that we may also
Sanctify your matchless name;
With all boldness we keep speaking
Of your purpose, of your fame.
Exercising faith and courage,
We will honor to you give.
Holy Father, for your name’s sake,
May we faithfully e’er live.
(Chorus)
3. O Divine One, Lord Jehovah,
You alone are the Most High.
There is nothing more important
Than your name to glorify.
In your name we lift our banners;
We desire to manifest
That you are a God of purpose
And forever will be blest.
(CHORUS)
Sov’reign Lord, you are our Maker;
All creation comes from you,
For you are a God of purpose,
Making all your thoughts come true.
O Jehovah, God Almighty,
You who gave your firstborn Son,
True to him, now, through your Kingdom,
Let your will on earth be done.

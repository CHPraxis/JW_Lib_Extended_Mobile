Song 49
Great God, Jehovah!
(Psalm 95:3)
1. Great God, Jehovah, Most High, Eternal,
We so gladly sing your praise, humbly tread your righteous ways.
You are our Father, Judge, King, Lawgiver.
We’re accountable to you through all our days.
O God, you are good; yes, you truly are good.
Help us to serve you the way that we should.
Your name we would honor, your sheeplike ones feed,
And serve with contentment wherever the need.
You are our Maker, our Life-Sustainer.
All good things do come from you.
2. Great God, Jehovah, Holy, Almighty,
In your service joy we find as we work where we’re assigned.
You are our Tower, Source of our power.
And we do confide in you with heart and mind.
O God, you are strong, yes, both loving and strong.
With your helping hand, we will ne’er go wrong.
Your cause we must cleave to, your purpose make known,
And render our service to you, you alone.
You are our Stronghold, our Shield and Helper.
We can always trust in you.
3. Great God, Jehovah, Shepherd, Instructor,
Since you are a God who cares, you’re concerned with our affairs.
You are our Savior, Rock, and Redeemer.
We can always come to you with heartfelt pray’rs.
O God, you are gracious, so gen’rous and kind.
To you we draw close and comfort do find.
Your name we hold precious, and soon may we see
How you will become what you purpose to be.
O Lord Jehovah, lofty Divine One,
There’s no other God but you.

Song 91
Being Taught by Jehovah
(Isaiah 54:13)
1. Jehovah sends out light and truth;
He is our Grand Instructor.
He leads his sheep so patiently
As their Divine Conductor.
His time has come for all to learn
That he is the Supreme One,
Who lovingly provides instruction
That the meek ones does bestir.
His Master Worker, Jesus Christ,
Was greatest of earth’s teachers.
He spoke the things his Father taught,
Explaining Kingdom features.
As chicks are gathered by a hen,
He seeks in love to help all men.
Today he teaches, just as then,
The sheeplike ones within his pen.
2. Jehovah gives us shepherds too,
Who strive to teach with insight.
Their educated tongue reflects
That in their heart they’re upright.
The weary ones they seek to help.
Unruly ones they counsel
By teaching what is true and right;
In this Jehovah takes delight.
Taught by Jehovah now we are;
His Son directs the teaching.
A priv’lege we indeed do have
As truth our hearts is reaching.
If fondness in our hearts will burn
For those who for the truth do yearn,
It’s by proclaiming all we learn,
They may to God in worship turn.
3. “Come, learn about Jehovah God,”
That is our invitation.
A teaching work is under way
That promises salvation.
By printed page and word of mouth,
The good news of God’s Kingdom
Is being preached throughout the earth
To ev’ry tribe and nation.
As fellow workers, we have need
In faith to be progressing
And keep in step with present truth,
His Kingdom to be stressing.
And soon through Christ’s Millennial Reign,
The resurrected ones will gain
Instruction so they may attain
To perfect life in earth’s domain.

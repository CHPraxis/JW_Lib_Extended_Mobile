Song 168
Recognizing Earth’s New King
(Psalm 2:12)
1. See yonder through the breadth of earth
The sight my heart entrances
—Jehovah’s band of warriors
In unity advances.
Their helmets, bright against the sky,
Bid ignorance and error fly.
They shout aloud their battle cry:
“Christ reigns! O earth, receive him.”
(Chorus)
2. The King, Christ Jesus, leads the way;
His leadership they follow.
He speaks the word, and they obey
And thus expect no sorrow.
They wield their sword, the Word of God.
Their feet are with the good news shod.
They walk the way their Master trod;
Clear to the death they follow.
(Chorus)
3. For, see, the time has come at last
For Christ to reign in power.
Soon all his foes shall lick the dust;
Before him they must cower.
His God, Jehovah, bares his arm.
His trumpet sounds a loud alarm.
Be wise, you rulers, do no harm;
You judges, own Christ’s power.
(CHORUS)
Kiss the Son, lest God be angry
And you perish in the way.
Happy are all they that put
Their trust in him today!

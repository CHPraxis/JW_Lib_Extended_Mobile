Song 198
Getting to Know Our God
(John 17:3)
1. Truly we can tell, for we know well,
How God now feels.
He so graciously has set us free
And with us deals.
2. He is merciful and lovable;
This we do find.
In him we can trust; we are mere dust,
But he is kind.
3. Much we have to learn, we do discern,
About our God.
So we strive each day to walk the way
Christ Jesus trod.
4. May we imitate his love, so great,
In all we do.
And Jehovahâ€™s name we must acclaim,
For he is true.

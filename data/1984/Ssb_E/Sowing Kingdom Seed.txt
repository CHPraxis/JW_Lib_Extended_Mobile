Song 133
Sowing Kingdom Seed
(Matthew 13:4-8, 19-23)
1. O come, all you slaves of Jehovah Most High,
Who’ve given your heart to your God.
Come out to the work he’s entrusted to you;
Walk pathways your Master has trod.
The seed of God’s truth you’ve been given to spread
On soil that is able to yield
Fine fruit to God’s praise if you faithfully work
And you do your full share in the field.
2. True, some of your seed by the wayside may fall,
Which Satan’s birds likely will eat,
While other seed often on rocky soil lands,
To wither from enemy heat.
Both worries and greed are like thorns that can choke
Your seedlings before they mature.
However, some seed is quite likely to fall
On the soil that is good, fine, and pure.
3. How much of your seed falls on soil that is fine
May often depend much on you.
With patience and love you can thwart Satan’s birds,
Reduce persecution’s heat too.
By being alert you may ward off the thorns,
By measures some gentle, some bold.
And thus with rejoicing you can hope to reap
At least thirty if not hundredfold.

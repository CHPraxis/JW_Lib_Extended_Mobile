Song 208
A Song of Rejoicing
(Revelation 11:15)
1. Trumpets are sounding. Joy is abounding.
God’s royal Son is enthroned on high.
Cymbals are clashing; bright garments flashing.
Throughout the earth now is heard the cry:
(Chorus)
2. Through Kingdom preaching and Christian teaching,
Many are drawn to Jehovah’s side.
These too are voicing songs of rejoicing,
Sounding them out, O so far and wide!
(Chorus)
3. May we keep dealing in fellow feeling
With all God’s people, our brotherhood.
And may our singing ever be bringing
Praise to Jehovah, for he is good.
(CHORUS)
This is Jehovah’s day. (Come rejoice.)
His Kingdom here shall stay. (Be glad.)
Let ev’ry living thing (leap for joy)
Praises to God now bring and sing:
“To you, our God, we owe our salvation
And to Christ Jesus, who’s now our King.”

Song 59
Appreciating God’s Reminders
(Psalm 119)
1. Happy are those heeding God’s reminders,
Who search for him with all the heart,
Who his statutes carry out so promptly
And from his laws do not depart.
God’s commandments they appreciate,
And his loving-kindness they relate.
For his laws they manifest a fondness,
For on him they have learned to wait.
2. Wondrous is Jehovah’s loving-kindness;
It reaches far beyond the skies!
His judicial rulings do preserve us,
Though all the proud smear us with lies.
Those who love God’s law have perfect peace;
Never will their blessedness decrease.
Just as one exults when finding great spoil,
Our joy in God’s Word will increase.
3. May our pleadings come before Jehovah
That we his Word may understand.
May he hear our pray’r and grant us favor
And rescue us with his strong hand.
May our hearts to God keep ever true,
That what he says we may always do.
Loyal, righteous is our God, Jehovah.
Daily, our strength he does renew.

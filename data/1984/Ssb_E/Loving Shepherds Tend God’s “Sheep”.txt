Song 184
Loving Shepherds Tend God’s “Sheep”
(1 Peter 5:2)
1. Sov’reign Lord, we are so grateful,
O great Shepherd of your sheep.
Us you lovingly keep guarding.
Safe your one flock you do keep.
2. Christ gave gifts in men as shepherds,
Who for us show real concern.
They expend themselves in service,
Helping all God’s truth to learn.
3. Shepherds of Jehovah’s sheepfold,
Seek its welfare, not your own.
Aid it in its growth to stature
So that it may be full-grown.
4. As we preach good news together,
What encouragement we feel!
We’ll serve God in this way ever,
With his loyal ones show zeal.

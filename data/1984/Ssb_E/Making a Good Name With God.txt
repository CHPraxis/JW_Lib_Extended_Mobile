Song 37
Making a Good Name With God
(Ecclesiastes 7:1)
1. For God’s approval
With all our hearts we yearn.
Always to please him
Will be our main concern.
To him a name that’s good,
As we have understood,
We can be making;
And this we should.
2. Through words and actions,
A name we will acquire.
And this we’re making,
For it’s our heart’s desire.
If we to God incline,
We’ll make a name that’s fine,
And for his blessings,
We’ll be in line.
3. A name we’re making
By giving God due heed.
Yes, while we’re living,
This is our vital need.
If we his Word defend
And all our efforts bend
To glorify him,
He’ll be our Friend.
4. The days are wicked,
And steps we all must take
A very good name
With Jah, our God, to make.
May we do what is right,
Walk ever in the light,
And preach the Kingdom
With all our might.

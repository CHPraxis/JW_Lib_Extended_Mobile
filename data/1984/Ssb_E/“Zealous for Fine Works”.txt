“Zealous for Fine Works”
(Titus 2:14)
1. For fine works we ever must be zealous
As we preach the Kingdom news worldwide.
Well we know Jehovah’s name is Jealous.
In his house we ever will abide.
2. May our love reflect a deep sincereness
As our Christian brothers we now serve.
In the face of Armageddon’s nearness,
From such service may we never swerve.
3. Zeal for God should mark our ev’ry action.
Faith, hope, love, these truly play their part.
Such wholeheartedness brings satisfaction,
Just like fire that burns within the heart.
4. Steadfast e’er through trial and tribulation,
Let us keep our love from growing cold.
Burning zeal for God’s own vindication
Spurs us onward, serving him whole-souled.

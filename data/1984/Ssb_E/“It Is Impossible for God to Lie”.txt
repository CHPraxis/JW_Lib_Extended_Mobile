“It Is Impossible for God to Lie”
(Hebrews 6:18)
1. Our God promised Abraham he would be blest,
For Abraham proved himself true under test.
This blessing he long foresaw by his faith’s eye;
He knew it’s impossible for God to lie.
2. Since God, to show his word’s unchangeableness,
Stepped in with an oath when he Abraham blest,
We have a strong hope and can God glorify,
For it is impossible for Him to lie.
3. To anchor our faith in a hope that’s secure,
Our God by an oath made his promise more sure.
So we all attacks on our faith can defy;
We know it’s impossible for God to lie.
4. Jehovah, the Most High, is faithful and true;
He never fails those who give him his just due.
On two things, his word and oath, we can rely
—Yes, it is impossible for God to lie.

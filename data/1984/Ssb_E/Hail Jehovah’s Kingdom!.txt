Song 21
Hail Jehovah’s Kingdom!
(Revelation 11:17)
1. Come, you Christians, hail God’s Kingdom,
Now established with his Son
In the heavens where, as Michael,
He o’er Satan vict’ry won.
Soon the Devil, Dragon, Serpent,
With his demons will be bound.
Then the Christ will make God’s praises
Ev’rywhere on earth resound.
2. In the forefront let the remnant
Of the faithful little flock
Hail Jehovah’s glorious Kingdom,
Which they’ll share with Christ the Rock.
Let all those whose earthly hope is
To inhabit Paradise
Help the remnant to bear witness,
Yes, God’s Kingdom advertise.
3. Hail with joy Jehovah’s Kingdom!
Preach with zeal, and teach with skill;
Help the meek and honesthearted
To become men of goodwill.
Hail Jehovah’s wondrous Kingdom;
Its grand virtues now proclaim.
It will bring eternal blessings,
Vindicate Jehovah’s name.

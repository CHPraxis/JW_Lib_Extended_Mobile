Song 41
Praise Jehovah, the Rock
(Deuteronomy 32:4)
1. ‘Give ear, O you heav’ns; O earth, let me speak.
To all of my words give ear, all you meek.
My teachings will trickle like dew on the plain,
My copious showers of truth like the rain.’
2. O let us declare Jehovah’s great name
And let all men know of his mighty fame.
Let all whom he shepherds give praise to our Rock.
His perfect activity laud, all his flock.
3. He’s faithful and just; to him we give praise.
So loving, so wise, are all of his ways.
Personification of truth, righteousness,
Jehovah, our Rock, manifests faithfulness.
4. Let’s fear the true God and do what is right;
His righteous commands let’s make our delight.
May we not act ruinously on our part
But ever serve Jah with a pure, steadfast heart.

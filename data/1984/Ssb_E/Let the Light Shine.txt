Song 63
Let the Light Shine
(Matthew 5:16)
1. God has now commanded
That there should be light
Banishing the darkness
Of mankind’s long night.
From God’s holy temple,
Lightnings flash and shine
That we may be guided
By his light divine.
2. With the Kingdom message,
We go forth to spread
Comfort for the mourners,
Hope for e’en their dead.
All our strength to witness
Comes from God alone.
He makes our commission
To us clearly known.
3. Faithful in his service
God helps us to be,
Keeping firm, unbroken,
Our integrity.
We, his favored people,
Joyfully proclaim
Glory, praise, and honor
To his holy name.

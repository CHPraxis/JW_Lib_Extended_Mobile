Song 185
The Resurrection—God’s Loving Provision
(John 11:25)
1. The resurrection of mankind
Spells mercy from above,
Made certain by Christ’s sacrifice
In proof of God’s great love.
First will be raised the little flock;
A crown of life they’ll gain.
For faithfulness until their death,
A thousand years they’ll reign.
2. Upon the cloud of witnesses,
Life too will be conferred.
A better resurrection grand
They’re promised in God’s Word.
And we can hope that other sheep
Who now may chance to die
Will waken early from the tomb
Their God to magnify.
3. All those in dark memorial tombs
Will hear Christ Jesus’ voice
And, like the thief with Christ impaled,
In Paradise rejoice.
With close of Christ’s Millennial Rule,
There’ll be the final test;
Then all avoiding Satan’s snare
Will be forever blest.
4. O remnant of the little flock
And other sheep ’mong men,
Tell those who lost dear ones in death
They’ll see them once again.
So keep abounding in good works
Commanded by our Lord,
For well you know death can’t prevent
Your reaping your reward.

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="st">(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:3:11-61:3:11" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Peter 3:11</a>)</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sl">1. The great day of Jehovah God we keep close in mind.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sz">To him and to his reigning Son, our hearts are inclined.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sp">The night is well along, and the day’s drawn near;</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sz">All things of Satan’s world will soon disappear.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sp">To our great need of praying may we e’er be alert.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sz">In pray’r the need is great, indeed, ourselves to exert.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sp">By praying to our God with all our soul and heart,</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sz">We will find the peace of mind that only he can impart.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sl">2. Our joy and peace unnoticed by the world does not go.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sz">A spectacle we’ve come to be that all men may know.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sp">What sort of persons, then, ought we all to be?</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sz">What holy acts of conduct for all to see?</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sp">With confidence we seek to tell of the Kingdom’s birth</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sz">And talk about God’s promise of new heav’ns and new earth</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sp">And how in these his righteousness will come to dwell.</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sz">In the telling forth of this good news may we e’er excel.</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sl">3. Our actions and our course of life we strive to maintain</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sz">In harmony with principles that bring greatest gain.</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sp">Christ Jesus washed us clean from the stain of sin,</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sz">And peace of God we joyously now take in.</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sp">Unspotted and unblemished we would e’er want to be;</p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sz">As servants of Jehovah God, we have been set free.</p>
<p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sp">If we stay close to him and let him be our Friend,</p>
<p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sz">He will help us and provide for us right down to the end.</p>

Song 132
Guard Your Heart
(Proverbs 4:23)
1. O guard your hearts, you sons of God,
If you would win life’s prize.
Keep taking counsel from his Word,
And always realize
That wholesome acts performed by us
Preceded are by thoughts.
So guard your thinking process well,
Your mind, as Christians ought.
2. A pow’rful help to guard your heart
God gives to us in pray’r.
Come oft to him with praise and thanks;
Come with each need and care.
Likewise, the study of God’s Word
Helps keep the mind aright,
And so will fellowship with those
Who walk on in the light.
3. Yes, always strive to keep your mind
On serious things and true,
On things both chaste and lovable,
On things praiseworthy too.
And if you keep considering
These things, you will have peace,
A heart well guarded, and the hope
Of life that will not cease.

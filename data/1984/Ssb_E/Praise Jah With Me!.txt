Song 165
Praise Jah With Me!
(Psalm 145:21)
1. Praise Jah with me, our God and King.
Let all who have breath to him honor bring.
From morn’ till night, his name we’ll bless,
Tell all mankind of his almightiness.
Yes, tell to men of his almightiness.
2. Praise Jah with me. He’s loving, kind,
And slow to anger to all humankind.
Wondrous is he and truly great;
His mighty acts it’s a joy to relate.
Yes, his great acts it’s a joy to relate.
3. Praise Jah with me. He satisfies
All who to him look for daily supplies.
He gives support to all the weak.
Why should not all men of his goodness speak?
Yes, let all mankind of his goodness speak.
4. Praise Jah with me, for he is near;
Our calls for succor he quickly will hear.
All wicked ones he will destroy,
But he preserves all who love him with joy.
Yes, he preserves all who love him with joy.

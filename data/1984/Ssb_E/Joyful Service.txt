Song 130
Joyful Service
(Psalm 32:11)
1. Let us serve with joyfulness our God and King
As our gifts and talents to his work we bring.
Though but small our service, yet thereby we prove
Our heart’s full devotion and express our love.
2. In Jehovah’s service there is work for all,
Since for harvest workers there’s a constant call.
Sacred the commission we’ve received from heav’n;
Yes, to us rich blessings through the work are giv’n.
3. Even though deceitful men the truth deny,
We know it’s impossible for God to lie.
Therefore, let us preach the Word with diligence,
For in it we have the utmost confidence.
4. While we share with gladness in his service sweet
And we try to witness to all those we meet,
For our God, who grants us favor here below,
Making us his servants, our high praises flow.

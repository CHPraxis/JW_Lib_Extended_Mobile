Song 169
The New Song
(Psalm 98:1)
1. Sing to God the Lord a song of gladness that is new;
Tell of all the great things heâ€™s done and yet will do.
Praise his holy arm and his right hand for victory.
In the sight of all men, he has judged righteously.
(Chorus)
2. Make a joyous shout to God Jehovah, all the earth;
Sing to God your praises with jubilance and mirth.
Praise Jehovah God, yes, sing aloud before the Lord.
Harp and horn and trumpet sound praise in full accord.
(Chorus)
3. Let the mighty sea and all that therein is roar praise.
Let those on the earth now exulting voices raise.
Let the floods rejoice, and let the rivers clap their hands.
Hills and mountains also sing praises in all lands.
(CHORUS)
Sing! Sing! Sing!
Loud let the new song ring.
Sing! Sing! Sing!
Jehovah now is King.

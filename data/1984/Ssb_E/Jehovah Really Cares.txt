Song 44
Jehovah Really Cares
(1 Peter 5:7)
1. God’s loving care is heartwarming.
It comforts us when we’re upset.
And e’en the hairs of our head he’s numbered.
Why should we worry or fret?
2. Though tests and trials befall us,
We’ll never have cause to despair.
If God takes note of a fallen sparrow,
Surely for us he will care.
3. Now various kinds of affliction
Do come upon Christians earth wide.
Through these Jehovah refines and trains us;
Help he will always provide.
4. God’s care, so loving and certain,
He loyally will us afford.
As we press on in his sacred service,
Sure we are of his reward.

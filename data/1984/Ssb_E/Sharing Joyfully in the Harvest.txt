Song 211
Sharing Joyfully in the Harvest
(Matthew 9:37, 38)
1. We live in the time of the harvest,
A priv’lege beyond all compare.
The angels are serving as reapers,
And with them we too have a share.
Christ Jesus has set things in motion
By sowing the seed in the field.
The crops are all ready for harvesting;
Let’s joyfully bring in the yield.
2. The wheat class is now in the storehouse.
The weeds have been clearly defined.
These latter ones try to impede us,
And weeping, their teeth they do grind.
Jehovah’s clean people are busy.
From sunrise to sunset they serve,
For great is the harvest of sheeplike ones;
From helping them may we ne’er swerve.
3. Our love for our God and our neighbor
Impels us to speed up the pace.
The work of ingath’ring is urgent,
For now the conclusion we face.
This harvesttime is one of action,
Assisting all those that would learn.
What joys we can have in the field each day
As new ones the wheat class discern.
4. Christ Jesus, the Harvester, sees how
To ripeness the grain has been brought.
How white are the fields that we work in!
So many there are to be taught!
The joys we receive are surpassing.
As God’s fellow workers we share.
Keep active we must with all joyfulness;
To him and the harvest be fair.

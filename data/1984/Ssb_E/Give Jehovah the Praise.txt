Song 48
Give Jehovah the Praise
(1 Corinthians 3:7)
1. Give praise to Jehovah.
By his love divine,
You have this commission
His truth to let shine.
You have nothing worthwhile
You did not receive
From God, your Provider;
To him honor give.
2. Set him e’er before you;
Keep self out of sight.
Thus for him you can shine
With heav’n’s radiant light.
Walk e’er in his presence;
Keep seeking his face
And always assigning
His work the first place.
3. Go forth with rejoicing
God’s service to do;
Give thanks for each priv’lege
He offers to you.
Give praise to Jehovah,
His Kingdom proclaim,
Till all on earth living
Will honor his name.

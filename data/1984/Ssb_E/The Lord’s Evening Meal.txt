Song 87
The Lord’s Evening Meal
(1 Corinthians 11:23-26)
1. Jehovah, our Father in heaven,
O this is a most sacred night!
’Twas Nisan fourteen when your glory was seen,
Your justice, love, wisdom, and might.
The Passover lamb was then eaten,
And Israel’s twelve tribes went forth free.
Cent’ries later our Lord his own lifeblood outpoured
To fulfill this divine prophecy.
2. We’re gathered together before you,
As sheep of your pasture we came,
To praise the great love that brought Christ from above
And honor your most holy name.
Before us there stands a spread table
Of wine and of unleavened bread.
They are symbols, we know; as reminders they show
With what nourishment we must be fed.
3. The bread stands for Jesus Christ’s body
He gave on behalf of us all.
The cup of red wine is a symbol divine,
His blood which redeems from man’s fall.
Let’s keep this Memorial occasion
Fixed firmly in heart and in mind.
Thus we’ll walk ev’ry day as Christ showed us the way,
And so life everlasting we’ll find.

Song 32
“From House to House”
(Acts 20:20)
1. From house to house, from door to door,
Jehovah’s Word we spread.
From town to town, from farm to farm,
Jehovah’s sheep are fed.
This good news that God’s Kingdom rules,
As Jesus Christ foretold,
Is being preached throughout the earth
By Christians young and old.
2. From house to house, from door to door,
Salvation we proclaim.
It comes to those who choose to call
Upon Jehovah’s name.
But how can they call on the name
Of One they do not know?
So to their houses and their doors
The sacred name must go.
3. Of course, it’s not at ev’ry door
We find a hearing ear;
At times there is a scolding tongue
And those who will not hear.
’Twas just the same in Jesus’ day;
Not all would hear his word.
He said his sheep would hear his voice;
Hence, we are not deterred.
4. Then let us go from door to door
To spread the Kingdom news.
And to be sheep or to be goats,
We’ll let the people choose.
At least we’ll name Jehovah’s name,
His glorious truth declare.
And as we go from door to door,
We’ll find his sheep are there.

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="st">(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:68:11-19:68:11" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 68:11</a>)</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sl">1. Jehovah himself gives the saying.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sz">The women who go out to preach</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sp">All form a large army to witness;</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sz">Humanity they want to reach.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sp">It means getting started right early,</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sz">To look to one’s household with care.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sp">By planning and diligent forethought,</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sz">In service they have a fine share.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sl">2. On these fellow workers, our sisters,</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sz">Jehovah’s rich blessing we pray.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sp">For much they accomplish in preaching,</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sz">The menfolk with pride justly say.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sp">But many are widows, old-timers,</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sz">And all have their problems to face.</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sp">From meetings they seldom are absent;</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sz">Endurance they show in life’s race.</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sl">3. We must give them all due attention</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sz">As mothers and daughters and wives.</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sp">They share in the joys of the harvest,</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sz">Attempting to save precious lives.</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sp">This army of women is worthy.</p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sz">Their efforts result in great gain.</p>
<p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sp">Look after these with fellow feeling.</p>
<p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sz">God’s saying was not said in vain.</p>

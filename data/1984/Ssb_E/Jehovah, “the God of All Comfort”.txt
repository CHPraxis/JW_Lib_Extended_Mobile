Song 58
Jehovah, “the God of All Comfort”
(2 Corinthians 1:3-7)
1. Great indeed the comfort God supplies;
For us he has affection.
We must comfort others with his Word,
Under his Son’s direction.
2. Suff’ring and affliction now abound;
Of them we all are sharers.
But Jehovah God will warm our hearts,
Since we’re his witness bearers.
3. Blessed be the God who comfort gives;
We find it so assuring.
Yes, he will sustain and nourish us
If we keep on enduring.
4. Strength and peace of mind we all can have
As hardships we keep facing.
Christ our Lord and King taught us the truth:
God’s love is all-embracing.

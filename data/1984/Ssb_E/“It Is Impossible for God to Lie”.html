<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="st">(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:6:18-58:6:18" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Hebrews 6:18</a>)</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sl">1. Our God promised Abraham he would be blest,</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sz">For Abraham proved himself true under test.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sp">This blessing he long foresaw by his faith’s eye;</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sz">He knew it’s impossible for God to lie.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sl">2. Since God, to show his word’s unchangeableness,</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sz">Stepped in with an oath when he Abraham blest,</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sp">We have a strong hope and can God glorify,</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sz">For it is impossible for Him to lie.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sl">3. To anchor our faith in a hope that’s secure,</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sz">Our God by an oath made his promise more sure.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sp">So we all attacks on our faith can defy;</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sz">We know it’s impossible for God to lie.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sl">4. Jehovah, the Most High, is faithful and true;</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sz">He never fails those who give him his just due.</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sp">On two things, his word and oath, we can rely</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sz">—Yes, it is impossible for God to lie.</p>

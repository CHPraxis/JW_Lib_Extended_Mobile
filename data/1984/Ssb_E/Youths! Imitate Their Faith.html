<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sl">1. Young Samuel to Shiloh when weaned had to go</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sz">To serve in God’s temple, and there he did grow.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sp">A prophet in Israel is what he became,</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sz">And as a true Naz’rite, he honored God’s name.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sp">The high priest called Eli had sons that were bad.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sz">Would they corrupt Samuel, who was just a lad?</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sp">No, Samuel was faithful; obedience he’d learned.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sz">Away from Jehovah he would not be turned.</p>

<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sp">He put into practice the things he was taught.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sz">To ever be faithful he constantly sought.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sp">In his congregation so good his repute,</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sz">He was recommended without a dispute.</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sp">He had the rare priv’lege of trav’ling with Paul;</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sz">His mission’ry service brought blessings to all.</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sl">3. Young sisters, remember the Israelite girl</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sz">Whose faith in Jehovah was like a fine pearl.</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sp">Although taken captive, her faith stayed intact;</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sz">Her zeal and devotion caused others to act.</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sp">To Naaman’s wife she did come and inform:</p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sz">‘Jehovah’s true prophet a cure can perform.’</p>
<p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sp">The Syrian chieftain decided to heed.</p>
<p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sz">Rich blessings it brought him, this little maid’s deed.</p>
<p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sl">4. Young brothers, young sisters, we urge all of you</p>
<p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="sz">To imitate these grand examples so true.</p>
<p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="sp">We have a great trust in this time of the end.</p>
<p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="sz">Jehovah has chosen the ones he will send.</p>
<p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="sp">So, all you dear young ones, come join in the fight</p>
<p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="sz">With all of God’s servants, who love what is right.</p>
<p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="sp">Let’s sound out the warning and speak of his praise</p>
<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="sz">And share the reward at the end of the days.</p>

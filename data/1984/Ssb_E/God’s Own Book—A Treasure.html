<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="st">(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:2:1-20:2:1" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Proverbs 2:1</a>)</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sl">1. There is a book that, by its many pages,</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sz">Brings peace and joy and hope to humankind.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sp">Its wondrous thoughts are charged with such great power;</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sz">It brings life to the “dead,” sight to the “blind.”</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sp">That precious book is God’s own Holy Bible.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sz">’Twas written long ago by men inspired,</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sp">By men who truly loved their God, Jehovah;</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sz">And by his holy spirit they were fired.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sl">2. They wrote a record true of God’s creations,</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sz">How by his might this universe appeared.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sp">They also tell how man at first was perfect</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sz">But how his Paradise then disappeared.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sp">They further tell about a certain angel</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sz">Who challenged God Jehovah’s sov’reignty.</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sp">That challenge led to sin and man’s great sorrow,</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sz">But soon will come Jehovah’s victory.</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sl">3. Today we live in times of joy unbounded.</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sz">God’s Kingdom has been born with Christ as Lord.</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sp">This is the day Jehovah grants salvation</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sz">To all who come with him in full accord.</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sp">Within his book are found these cheerful tidings;</p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sz">It’s not to be compared with finest gold.</p>
<p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sp">It offers hope beyond all human thinking;</p>
<p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sz">It is the grandest story ever told.</p>

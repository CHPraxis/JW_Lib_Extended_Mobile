Song 56
Bravely Press On
(1 Timothy 1:12)
1. He that is faithful, he that is loyal,
Never will give way to fear
But gives the witness of truth with all boldness,
Showing the Kingdom is here.
(Chorus)
2. Faith is the force that moves us to action;
Love prompts to faithfulness now.
Zeal for our King keeps us active in service;
Selfish ambition must bow.
(Chorus)
3. Daily Jehovah, mighty in battle,
Exhorts us faithful to be
Till Armageddon destroys this old system
And he has gained victory.
(CHORUS)
Then let’s go forth, bravely press on.
Advancing truth be our light.
Thus says Jehovah: ‘I’ll strengthen and help you;
Battle for truth and for right.’

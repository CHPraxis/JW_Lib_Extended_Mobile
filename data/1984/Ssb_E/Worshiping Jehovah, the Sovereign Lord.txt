Worshiping Jehovah, the Sovereign Lord
(Isaiah 2:3)
1. Jehovah God, our Sovâ€™reign Lord,
Your truth to us has been restored.
Down from your throne, your light does beam,
So millions to your worship stream.
2. Your time has come to give increase
To those that serve with you in peace.
These honor you as God alone
And worship you before your throne.
3. A people that learns war no more
Puts sacred service to the fore;
They bow down low in godly fear
And to your righteous laws adhere.
4. How we rejoice in this your day,
When Kingdom rule has come to stay!
Your Royal Son now rules as King;
Because of this, we gladly sing.

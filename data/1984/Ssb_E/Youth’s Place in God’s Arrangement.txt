Song 183
Youth’s Place in God’s Arrangement
(Psalm 148:12, 13)
1. There’s a place for ev’ryone in God’s arrangement.
He invites the young and old to praise his name.
The response of all the young ones is impressive
As earth wide the Kingdom message they proclaim.
How effective is the witness they are giving!
They are neat and well prepared and so polite!
To Jehovah they are precious as they serve him;
To the older ones, they also bring delight.
2. So all youngsters who have come to know Jehovah,
What a happy, joyful day it then will be!
Just imagine what awaits them in the future
—Life in Paradise for all eternity!
In the meantime we are living under pressure
From this system that is soon to lick the dust.
We must fight with all our might to overcome it;
Kingdom loyalty maintain—it is a must.
3. They can find good friends among Jehovah’s people.
Why should they seek friendship with the wicked world?
Let them get involved with things that are upbuilding,
That on God’s own sacred pages lie unfurled.
When in trouble let youths seek out those that love them,
Tell these all the things that weigh upon their mind.
Yet their greatest Friend of all is God Jehovah;
Understanding, merciful, him they will find.
4. We are members of the Christian congregation,
Where Christ Jesus now supplies our ev’ry need.
So in loyalty let’s take our place beside him;
All the counsel that he offers let us heed.
Never let the world into its mold now squeeze us;
Let Jehovah, through his Word, our minds keep clean.
And together, young and old, may we be faithful,
Praising him, for life eternal this will mean.

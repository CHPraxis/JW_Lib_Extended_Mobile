Song 31
Zeal for Jehovah’s House
(John 2:17)
1. For Jehovah’s house Christ Jesus
Showed a zeal beyond compare.
Like a fire it burned within him
As wrongdoing he laid bare.
And he came to preach salvation,
Kingdom truths to men reveal.
For his Father’s reputation
He was eaten up with zeal.
2. The apostles and disciples
For fine works were zealous too.
With the help of holy spirit,
How their congregations grew!
They did not hold back from preaching,
And from house to house they went.
Ev’rywhere they preached salvation,
Telling men they should repent.
3. And today we see a people
With a zeal for righteousness.
Nothing dampens their fine spirit
In this world of lawlessness.
They are spurred on by Jehovah;
It’s for him they work whole-souled.
They advance with Kingdom preaching,
Ever zealous, ever bold.

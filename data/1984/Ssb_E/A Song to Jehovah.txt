Song 190
A Song to Jehovah
(Psalm 92:1, 2)
1. This song with joy we sing today
To God, who leads us on our way.
Our thanks to him we do convey
And praise him with our song.
In loving-kindness great is he.
So close to him we’ve come to be.
His truth has really set us free.
To him we now belong.
2. We thank God for his splendid light
That guides us through this world’s dark night.
O how it shines so clear and bright
With rays that comfort bring!
We thank him for the Kingdom hope;
No more in darkness need we grope.
With each day’s cares we now can cope.
Our hearts rejoice and sing.
3. We sing with our melodious tone
And worship God upon his throne
And through Christ Jesus now make known
Our humble, heartfelt pray’r:
“Jehovah God, so loving, true,
Accept our thanks for all you do.
Hear our entreaties, praises too,
For all your loving care.”

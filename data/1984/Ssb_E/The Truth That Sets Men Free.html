<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="st">(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:8:32-43:8:32" data-bid="1-1" class="b">John 8:32</a>)</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sl">1. Mosaic Law and prophecies of cent’ries long ago</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sz">Were pointing to a precious truth that we have come to know.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sp">It is the truth that sets men free, the truth about God’s Seed</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sz">—How through Christ Jesus men can gain the life that’s life indeed.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sl">2. ‘I am the way, the truth, the life,’ Christ Jesus rightly said.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sz">He came to earth our sins to bear, for men his blood to shed,</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sp">To vindicate his Father’s name and prove that God is true</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sz">And, now in this time of the end, God’s enemies subdue.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sl">3. It is through God Jehovah’s Son that truth has come to be.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sz">And it assures us that all sin will end eternally.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sp">He is the Seed, the Promised One, who magnifies God’s name.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sz">As King and Priest, he’s reigning now; this fact we all proclaim.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sl">4. With faith-inspiring truth, we preach about the Son of God.</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sz">We are equipped to tell good news; our feet with peace are shod.</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sp">God’s Messianic Kingdom is the truth we must uphold.</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sz">Let’s raise it high for all to see and work for it whole-souled.</p>

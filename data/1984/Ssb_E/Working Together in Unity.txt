Song 213
Working Together in Unity
(Ephesians 4:3)
1. We must act together as one.
Independence wisely we shun.
Harmony and oneness of mind
Bring peace of rarest kind.
Unity brings blessings.
This we’ll surely find.
If with talents we are endowed,
There’s no reason e’er to be proud.
Modestly, with genuine love,
Let’s praise our God above.
2. Rivalry and envy are rife
In this world of hatred and strife.
Peace we seek and ever pursue.
It’s like refreshing dew.
Peace is so refreshing.
It is like the dew.
Disagreements sometimes arise;
We’re imperfect, we realize!
Quickly settling them is great gain.
Unity we’ll maintain.
3. As we work together each day,
Unity e’er may we display.
It is sweet and pleasant and good.
Cherish it well we should.
Unity we cherish,
For it is so good.
Unity rewards us so well
—With Jehovah God we thus dwell.
Peace to us he now has restored,
Under our Sov’reign Lord.

God’s Own Book—A Treasure
(Proverbs 2:1)
1. There is a book that, by its many pages,
Brings peace and joy and hope to humankind.
Its wondrous thoughts are charged with such great power;
It brings life to the “dead,” sight to the “blind.”
That precious book is God’s own Holy Bible.
’Twas written long ago by men inspired,
By men who truly loved their God, Jehovah;
And by his holy spirit they were fired.
2. They wrote a record true of God’s creations,
How by his might this universe appeared.
They also tell how man at first was perfect
But how his Paradise then disappeared.
They further tell about a certain angel
Who challenged God Jehovah’s sov’reignty.
That challenge led to sin and man’s great sorrow,
But soon will come Jehovah’s victory.
3. Today we live in times of joy unbounded.
God’s Kingdom has been born with Christ as Lord.
This is the day Jehovah grants salvation
To all who come with him in full accord.
Within his book are found these cheerful tidings;
It’s not to be compared with finest gold.
It offers hope beyond all human thinking;
It is the grandest story ever told.

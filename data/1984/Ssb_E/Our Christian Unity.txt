Song 158
Our Christian Unity
(Ephesians 4:13)
1. O who’s like our Father, Jehovah,
The center of true unity!
He sent forth his Son to teach us the truth
And give his life, setting us free.
The basis of Christian oneness
God laid in Christ Jesus our Lord.
To bind in a family union as one
All those who adhere to God’s Word.
2. What rests on us now as a duty,
Who with Jesus have been made one?
Our thinking, our conduct—all must agree,
That by us God’s will may be done.
Though works of the flesh spread sorrow,
The fruit of God’s spirit brings joy.
We know greater happiness giving can bring
When we God’s example employ.
3. See! God’s theocratic arrangement
Serves as our protection and guide.
Accepting his truth and molding our lives,
In unity we will abide.
What, then, is our God requiring?
What qualities must we display?
That we practice justice, his kindness express,
Walk modestly in his right way.

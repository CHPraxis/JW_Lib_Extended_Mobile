Song 66
The Power of Kindness
(Romans 2:4)
1. How thankful we to God should be,
Who loving-kindness shows
To undeserving fallen men,
As ev’ry Christian knows!
Though he’s so great and powerful,
He shows exceeding thoughtfulness.
His kindness both draws us to him
And moves to faithfulness.
2. As Jesus daily taught the truth,
He was both calm and meek,
With kindness taught the lowly ones,
Was mindful of the weak.
His teaching gently, lovingly,
Refreshed and blessed the weary soul,
Caused sinful men to turn to God
With hearts and minds made whole.
3. Such kindness God’s Word shows to be
A fruit that we must bear
If we would be like God and Christ
And Kingdom blessings share.
When faced with problems that perplex,
Quite likely we will often find
That their solution simply lies
In being mild and kind.
4. What good we ministers can do
If we appreciate
That Christian kindness has a force
That lasting is and great!
Not only are receivers blessed
But even more are those who give.
Through kindness we bring praise to God,
By whom we move and live.

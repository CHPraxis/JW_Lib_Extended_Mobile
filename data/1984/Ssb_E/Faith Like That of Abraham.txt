Song 64
Faith Like That of Abraham
(Genesis 22:1-18)
1. How happy is the man that seeks
God’s Word to comprehend;
For God, the great Omniscient One,
Knows from the start the end.
Thus, for our comfort and strong hope,
By faithful men of old
He made prophetic dramas grand;
Their meanings now unfold.
2. O see now Abraham of old,
With Isaac by his side,
Ascending Mount Moriah’s height;
His faith is being tried.
Jehovah asked of Abraham
To offer his dear son
In loving sacrifice to God
That God’s will might be done.
3. Yet Abraham met that great test
And by obedience made
A picture of how, through God’s love,
His Son our ransom paid.
Would you gain life from that grand gift?
Submissive you must be
And have a faith like Abraham
And act obediently.

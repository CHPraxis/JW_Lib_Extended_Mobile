Song 13
Christian Dedication
(Exodus 39:30)
1. Because Jehovah created
The universe so grand,
To him belong the earth and sky,
The works of his own hand.
The breath of life he has given
And to his creatures shown
That worthy is he to have the praise,
The worship of all his own.
2. The ancient nation of Israel,
At Sinai they did say:
‘The Law Jehovah’s given us
We gladly will obey.’
He was their husbandly owner;
He bought them from the sea.
A nation of dedicated ones
They always should prove to be.
3. In water Jesus was baptized
To righteousness fulfill,
And humbly he did there present
Himself to do God’s will.
When he came up from the Jordan
As God’s anointed Son,
Obedient and loyal he would serve
As God’s consecrated One.
4. We come before you, Jehovah,
To praise your name so great.
Disowning self, with humble hearts,
Our lives we dedicate.
You gave your only-begotten,
Who paid the price so high.
No longer as living for ourselves,
For you we shall live or die.

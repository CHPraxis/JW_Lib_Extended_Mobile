Song 6
Declare the Everlasting Good News
(Revelation 14:6-8)
1. Around the earth with urgency God’s angel flies
With everlasting good news, high amid the skies.
He says: ‘Give glory and fear him upon the throne.
Yes, worship God Jehovah and serve him alone.
For now has come the Most High’s awesome judgment hour;
Soon all the wicked ones will feel his mighty pow’r.’
Accordingly, God’s Kingdom preachers must not fear
But speak out boldly this good news both far and near.
2. And then what does a second angel loud declare
That we, Jehovah’s Witnesses, therein may share?
He tells about the fall of Babylon the Great,
That soon destruction by our God will be her fate.
And so Jehovah God commands that we proclaim
His vengeance and the vindication of his name.
The field in which we preach and teach is great indeed;
But God’s own angel in midheaven takes the lead.
3. The Son of man with all his angels in array
Begins his work of judging nations in this day.
Hate what is bad. Apply the good, you faithful sheep.
Fear God alone, and his commandments fully keep.
The obligation laid upon us by our Lord
Is, ‘Preach the good news, teach the whole truth of God’s Word.’
As ministers, we do exhort courageously,
“Come, worship God Jehovah; serve him joyfully.”

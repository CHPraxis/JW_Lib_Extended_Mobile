Song 51
Making Jehovah’s Heart Glad
(Proverbs 27:11)
1. Great God, we’ve vowed to do your will;
In wisdom your work we’ll fulfill.
For then we know we’ll have a part
In making glad your loving heart.
2. May we from your side never move;
A liar the Tempter we would prove.
Your principles and laws so right
We would make daily our delight.
3. Your slave, so faithful and discreet,
Helps us know what is wise and meet,
Feeds us with nourishment when due,
Thus strengthens us your will to do.
4. Impart to us your active force
That we may keep a faithful course
And bring forth fruitage to your praise
And thus make glad your heart always.

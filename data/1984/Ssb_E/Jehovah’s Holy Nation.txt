Song 141
Jehovah’s Holy Nation
(Isaiah 66:8)
1. On a newborn land was a nation
Born to Jehovah in this our day.
There it stands in holy adornment,
Letting pure worship hold full sway.
(Chorus)
2. Joyfully, this new holy nation
Makes known Jehovah’s most worthy name.
As a sign among all the peoples,
His glorious Kingdom they proclaim.
(Chorus)
3. Jubilant is God’s chosen nation
As other sheep now flock to its side.
Loyally, they serve all together
And in God’s favor now reside.
(CHORUS)
Highly exalted, ne’er to be halted,
Is God’s worship on Zion’s height.
There his nation and the great crowd
Now to Jehovah bring great delight.

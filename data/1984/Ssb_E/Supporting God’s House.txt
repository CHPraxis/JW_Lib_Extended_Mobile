Song 118
Supporting God’s House
(Malachi 3:10)
1. May we of God’s household ever reflect
That he has a place we dare not neglect,
A house upon which he did so decide
That there his grand name would come to reside.
Just like Nehemiah, who with great care
True worship restored in God’s house of prayer,
We too may Him honor with all our tenth parts,
Thus show that we love Him with all of our hearts.
(Chorus)
2. God’s fam’ly today in unity lives,
A household to which attention he gives.
His steward, so faithful, serves him so well,
And as a result, there peace does now dwell.
Let’s bring to God’s house our valu’ble things;
The giving of firstfruits him honor brings.
He blesses his household in such a fine way,
Thus making us serve him with joy ev’ry day.
(CHORUS)
God’s house deserves our full support.
‘Come worship there,’ we do exhort.
His household is his family;
He’ll dwell among them eternally.

Song 119
Holding Fast to “the Happy Hope”
(Titus 2:13)
1. Men have been groping for centuries in darkness.
Vain is their striving for what is merely wind.
Wickedness now is exposed in its starkness.
What a sad climax to men who’ve sinned!
(Chorus)
2. Truly we’re glad now to learn Jehovah’s reason
Why he’s permitted gross wickedness so long.
It will be dealt with by Christ in due season.
Those on his side will break forth in song.
(Chorus)
3. In this our day can be heard a proclamation.
Men need no longer to live in doubt and dread.
God will set free all the groaning creation.
So we do urge all to look ahead.
(CHORUS)
Be of good cheer, for God’s Kingdom draws near.
His Son’s glorious reign will bring freedom from fear.
Now, at long last, all man’s woes will have passed.
To this happy hope may we ever hold fast.

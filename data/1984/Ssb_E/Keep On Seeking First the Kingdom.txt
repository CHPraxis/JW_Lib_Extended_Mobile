Song 172
Keep On Seeking First the Kingdom
(Matthew 6:33)
1. Something dear to God Jehovah,
Bringing him such keen delight,
Is his Kingdom by Christ Jesus,
Which will set all matters right.
Prophets saw by faith that Kingdom
And to hope of it held true.
And today our Leader, Jesus,
Urges us the same to do.
(Chorus)
2. What a favor have God’s servants
In that Kingdom work to share!
Since we’re granted that fine service,
Let us give it greatest care.
Why be anxious for tomorrow
Lest we hunger, lest we thirst?
For our God will make provision
If we seek his Kingdom first.
(Chorus)
3. Soon this system will be ending;
Then God’s new one will arise.
And all men will praise Jehovah;
Earth will be a paradise.
Let’s proclaim the Kingdom good news,
Help the sheeplike ones to see
That their hope is in Jehovah
And in his Theocracy.
(CHORUS)
Keep on seeking first the Kingdom
And Jehovah’s righteousness.
Put first his own vindication,
And serve him in faithfulness.

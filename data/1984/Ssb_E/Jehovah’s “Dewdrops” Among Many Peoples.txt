Song 17
Jehovah’s “Dewdrops” Among Many Peoples
(Psalm 110:3)
1. Beauteous like the dew at morning
Is the remnant of Christ’s bride.
In his eyes they are so precious
As they gather to his side.
2. In the midst of many peoples,
God’s true servants are like dew.
They are gentle and refreshing.
With all men they peace pursue.
3. Fine companions aid the remnant
In this day of Kingdom might.
Other sheep, who are like dewdrops,
Serve with them in sheer delight.
4. Many are those volunteering,
Fighting for Jehovah’s fame.
May we all be just like dewdrops
As the Kingdom we proclaim.

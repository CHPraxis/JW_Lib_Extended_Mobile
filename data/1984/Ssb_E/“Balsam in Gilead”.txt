Song 182
“Balsam in Gilead”
(Jeremiah 8:22)
1. There’s balsam in fair Gilead;
This from God’s Word we hear.
It comfort brings to troubled hearts
And helps grief disappear.
It soothes us when we’re sorely tried
Or deeply are distressed,
Or we have lost some loved dear one,
Who in death’s sleep does rest.
2. Just call to mind that God is love,
Is wise, almighty, true.
Whate’er his providence now sends
Can work out well for you.
So on this God of comfort call
In frequent, earnest pray’r.
Pour out your soul; hold nothing back;
Tell him your ev’ry care.
3. And call to mind that many things,
Which long ago occurred,
Were written for our comfort, hope,
In God’s own holy Word.
And humbly, too, accept the aid
That brothers, wise, mature,
Would gladly, lovingly extend
To help you to endure.
4. And have you thought that others, too,
Depress’d like you might be?
That many more are likewise tried
As to integrity?
Seek out such ones, and comfort them,
And make their hearts to glow.
In all such ways, the healing pow’r
Of Gilead’s balm you’ll know.

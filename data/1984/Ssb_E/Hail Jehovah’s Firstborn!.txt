Song 105
Hail Jehovah’s Firstborn!
(Hebrews 1:6)
1. Let’s hail Jehovah’s Firstborn
—God’s Heir he has been made—
Who since he was created,
His Father’s voice obeyed.
He made all things existing
In heaven and on earth,
And he, as God’s own Spokesman,
Made known Jehovah’s worth.
2. Although he was in God’s form,
He did not selfishly
Endeavor to be equal
To God, in rivalry.
But humbly he descended
And took the form of men
To vindicate Jehovah
And give men life again.
3. For this Christ was exalted
And set by God on high
To be Jehovah’s Agent,
His name to sanctify.
He will at Armageddon
God’s worshipers defend,
Destroy foes of God’s Kingdom,
Bring peace that will not end.
4. So hail Jehovah’s Firstborn!
Make known his Kingdom reign.
From house to house keep preaching,
The cause of truth maintain.
With personal attention
Show others what to do.
And stimulate our brothers
To hail God’s Firstborn too.

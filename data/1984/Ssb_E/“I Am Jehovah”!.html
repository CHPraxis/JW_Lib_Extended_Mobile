<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sl">1. Hear now, the kings of pagan empires</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sz">Ignore Jehovah, God Most High.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sp">They choose not to recognize his sov’reignty,</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sz">And his mighty power they defy.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sp">But who was the One that overthrew their hosts,</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sz">That they perished ignominiously?</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sp">Yes, whose was the arm that silenced all their boasts</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sz">And gave his chosen people victory?</p>

<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sz">While the poor of earth in anguish groan.</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sp">Ah! Who will destroy the proud oppressor’s yoke</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sz">And deliver all the meek of the earth?</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sp">And who will establish them in righteousness</p>

<p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sp">I’ve set my King upon my holy mountain;</p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sz">Bow to his rule! My Son begins his reign.</p>

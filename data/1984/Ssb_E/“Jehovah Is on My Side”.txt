Song 125
“Jehovah Is on My Side”
(Psalm 118:6)
1. My heart upon Jehovah God
Is steadfast, firm, reliant.
It’s my desire to walk his ways
And always be compliant.
Along life’s path there may appear
Distressing circumstances,
But God is ever on my side.
His love my heart entrances!
(Chorus)
2. I know that in this crucial hour
My faith will yet be tested.
Around me swarms the Devil’s crowd
Like bees that were molested.
But I can ever beat them off
Beneath divine protection.
On those who love to bear his name,
God sets his deep affection.
(Chorus)
3. Jehovah God has now enlarged
His holy nation’s borders.
For many flock to do his will
And keep his laws and orders.
He gives support to all such ones;
In them he takes great pleasure.
May I, with them, e’er zealous be
In overflowing measure.
(CHORUS)
Jehovah God is on my side;
I’ll praise and exalt him forever.

Song 80
Walking in the Name of Our God
(Micah 4:5)
1. Great Sov’reign in heav’n, Jehovah our God,
For all of your love, you we want to laud.
You pardon our sins; you show us life’s way.
Lord, here in your service we choose to stay.
2. Our foes now abound. They make up a host.
And in their false gods they make loud their boast.
We loathe their false gods; the truth we proclaim
And worship Jehovah, walk in his name.
3. From small Bethlehem comes God’s Ruler grand,
The Shepherd who saves with strength from God’s hand.
And now, with great joy, your remnant restored
Exalts your true worship, O Sov’reign Lord.
4. Come worship Jehovah. Serve him as one.
Do learn of his ways; his will let be done.
All swords and all spears we yield up for peace.
With joy we will serve him, never to cease.

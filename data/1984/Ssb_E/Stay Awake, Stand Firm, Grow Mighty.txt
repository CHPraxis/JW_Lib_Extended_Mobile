Song 174
Stay Awake, Stand Firm, Grow Mighty
(1 Corinthians 16:13)
1. Stay awake, stand firm, grow mighty,
In the warfare that is right.
Carry on as men undaunted,
For the vict’ry is in sight.
Under Christ, the Greater Gideon,
We’re around the camp of Midian.
Soon the battle cry will be given,
Putting enemies to flight.
2. Stay awake and keep your senses,
Always ready to obey.
In his place each one be heeding
What Christ Jesus has to say.
From his fine example, we discern
How Jehovah’s favor all can earn.
So, as one, we serve as an army,
Ever loyal to God’s way.
3. Stay awake, always be patient;
On Jehovah learn to wait.
For his hand controls all matters;
He will never act too late.
As with Gideon’s three hundred men,
Our Commander soon will tell us when.
So obey his rules for the battle.
It will God’s name vindicate.
4. Stay awake, remain united
As the good news we defend.
And to theocratic order
It is vital to attend.
Let us shout with all God’s loyal ones:
‘Look! Jehovah’s sword and Gideon’s!’
Stay awake, stand firm, and grow mighty!
Carry on right to the end!

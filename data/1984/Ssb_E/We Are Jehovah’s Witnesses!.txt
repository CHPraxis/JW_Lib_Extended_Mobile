Song 113
We Are Jehovah’s Witnesses!
(Isaiah 43:10-12) 
1. Men make gods of wood and stone,
But the true God they’ve not known.
He is God Almighty,
As he’s often shown.
Other gods just cannot see
What in future days will be.
For witnesses they look all in vain,
Since none their godship can maintain.
(Chorus)
2. ‘You’re my witnesses,’ God said.
‘Other gods you need not dread.
I am God Jehovah,
Sov’reign Lord and Head.
I both saved and showed to you
When no other gods you knew.
Keep publishing my name near and far;
Prove that my witnesses you are.’
(Chorus)
3. Witnessing exalts God’s name,
Lifts therefrom reproach and shame.
But it warns the wicked,
Who God’s name defame.
Pardon it holds out to men
If they turn to God again.
Thus bearing witness brings joy and peace
And hope of life that will not cease.
(CHORUS)
We’re Jehovah’s Witnesses;
We speak out in fearlessness.
Ours is the God of true prophecy;
What he foretells comes to be.

Song 129
Now’s the Time!
(Mark 13:10)
1. Now’s the time to preach God’s Word,
Time to let the truth be heard.
Never be by threats deterred;
Show why God’s rule is to be preferred.
Let’s warn men before it is too late.
Help them flee from Babylon the Great
And escape in sharing in her fate.
Zeal for God’s house let them demonstrate.
Now’s the time our zeal to demonstrate!
2. Now’s the time to prove we’re true,
Showing love in all we do,
Helping brothers old and new,
Whether we be many or be few.
Yes, we must serve God unselfishly,
Daily love the truth that makes us free
If his smile of favor we would see
And maintain our full integrity.
Now’s the time to keep integrity!
3. Soon will come the final fight,
Victory for truth and right.
Then will end earth’s darksome night.
Till then each must be a shining light.
In due time we’ll welcome back the dead,
Help them feed on Christ, the Living Bread.
No more evils will there be to dread.
Yes, all these things are what God has said.
Now’s the time to preach what God has said!

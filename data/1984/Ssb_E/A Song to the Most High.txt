Song 104
A Song to the Most High
(Psalm 47:2)
1. Let’s sing to Jehovah a song;
To him praise and thanks do belong.
With a glad cry to the Most High,
We proclaim that he’s mighty and strong.
(Chorus)
2. Rejoice with the sound of the horn:
The Kingdom of God has been born.
Our behavior t’ward the Savior,
May it ever his teaching adorn.
(Chorus)
3. We live in the time of the end;
True worship we all must defend.
God is glorious and victorious;
Hence our praises to him now ascend.
(CHORUS)
Jehovah God is reigning,
Grand victories attaining.
By his dear Son, the Worthy One,
The Kingdom has begun.

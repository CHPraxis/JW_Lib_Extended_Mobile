Song 159
Our Possession of Peace
(John 14:27)
1. Peace have not the godless kind,
None of Satan’s crowd;
Neither those who have his mind,
Who are bad and proud.
Peace through Christ comes from above,
From a source divine,
To all men of faith and love
Who t’ward God incline.
2. Praise Jehovah, God of peace,
God of equity.
He will make all wars to cease,
Bring in harmony.
Prince of Peace is Christ his Son,
Friend of all the meek.
When the fight for right he’s won,
Peace to them he’ll speak.
3. We have left off bitter words,
Left off selfish fears.
We have made from spears and swords
Plows and pruning shears.
So that this peace we may keep,
Quickly let’s forgive.
Lovingly, as Jesus’ sheep,
May we work and live.
4. As a fruit of righteousness,
Peace we all must bear,
Proof of wisdom from above,
Which we gain through pray’r.
We would recommend our way
By our peacefulness,
Till the light of perfect day
Brings full happiness.

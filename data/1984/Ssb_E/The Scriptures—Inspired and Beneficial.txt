Song 46
The Scriptures—Inspired and Beneficial
(2 Timothy 3:16, 17)
1. God’s Word is a shining light,
Guides our feet through earth’s dark night.
It’s the torch of liberty;
Yes, its truth will set us free.
2. By these Scriptures from above,
We have come to know God’s love.
Faith in them will make us wise,
Show us how to gain life’s prize.
3. That divine Word is inspired,
Teaches us what is required.
It helps us to set things straight,
For God’s discipline to wait.
4. It is beneficial, true,
Gives reproof, instruction too,
That the man of God may be
Well equipped, yes, perfectly.

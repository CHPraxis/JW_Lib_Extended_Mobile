Song 93
Jehovah’s Lovely Place of Worship
(Psalm 84:1)
1. How lovely is your temple grand,
With courtyards where your servants stand!
My soul and heart for them do long,
That there I might lift up my song,
That there I might lift up my song.
2. Jehovah, when we come to you
For help our powers to renew,
We’re made to feast on love and truth,
So we can serve with strength of youth,
So we can serve with strength of youth.
3. A day within your courtyards fair
Excels a thousand spent elsewhere.
We’d rather at your house be found
Than with the wicked move around,
Than with the wicked move around.
4. Jehovah is a sun and shield
To all who righteous fruitage yield.
There’s no good thing he does withhold
From faultless ones within his fold,
From faultless ones within his fold.

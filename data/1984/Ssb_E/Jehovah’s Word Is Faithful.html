<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sl">1. Just as the rain that falls from the heavens</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sz">Causes the earth to bring forth its yield,</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sp">So is the word Jehovah has spoken;</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sz">It will succeed, yes, its truth be revealed.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sl">2. Joshua told the nation of Israel</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sz">How God’s great goodness to them was shown.</p>

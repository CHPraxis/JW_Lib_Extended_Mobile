Song 103
Throw Your Burden on Jehovah
(Psalm 55:22)
1. Let my prayer be heard by you, Lord;
Do not hide yourself from me.
Pay attention, give me answer,
That concerned I may not be.
(Chorus)
2. Had I wings just as a dove has,
Iâ€™d fly far off to reside
In a place safe from the wicked,
Whose bad tongues, O God, divide.
(Chorus)
3. I will call upon Jehovah,
Him who thrones on high, supreme.
He gives peace midst opposition,
And my soul he will redeem.
(CHORUS)
Throw your burden on Jehovah;
He himself will you sustain.
He will never let you totter
But will help you firm remain.

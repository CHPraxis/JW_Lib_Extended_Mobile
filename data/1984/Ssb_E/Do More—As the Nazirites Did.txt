Song 128
Do More—As the Nazirites Did
(Numbers 6:8)
1. Nazirites—O can we be like them?
Can we act like them today?
Singled out, they could serve Jehovah
In a unique, special way.
Analyze! Let’s give it attention.
Time indeed fast is running out.
Can we do more in the service,
Raising a mighty shout?
2. Nazirites—their life-style was simple.
Self-denial was their role.
Close to God it surely did bring them.
Could we too have such a goal?
They accepted certain restrictions;
That was part of their sacred vow.
Many of our Christian brothers
Lead such a life right now.
3. Nazirites—they truly were diff’rent.
Why, they had a crowning sign.
They did more by being submissive;
Closer to God they’d incline.
So today, as God’s fellow workers,
By submission our faith we show.
May Jehovah bless our efforts,
Setting our hearts aglow.
4. Nazirites—they set an example.
Care they took with holiness.
Undefiled, then, let us be like them;
Their life our God e’er did bless.
Count the cost, and trust in Jehovah.
Those he cares for he will sustain.
Doing more, right in the forefront,
Deep-seated joy we’ll gain.

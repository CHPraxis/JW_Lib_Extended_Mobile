Song 100
Laud Jehovah Our God!
(Jeremiah 33:11)
1. Laud our God! Laud Jehovah God!
Make his greatness known! Make it known!
Shout for joy! Sing a joyful song!
For the heav’ns and earth to him belong.
All things he made both seen and unseen.
Pow’r and love all his works reveal.
His wisdom, justice also abound;
How they blend with his might and zeal!
Laud our God! Laud Jehovah God!
Make his greatness known! Make it known!
2. Laud our God! Laud Jehovah God!
Make his goodness known! Make it known!
Cry aloud! O how kind is he!
Let all flesh his loving-kindness see.
Though fear-inspiring, manly in war,
To the meek he is gentle, kind.
Those who now seek him he will protect.
Loving-kindness in him they’ll find.
Laud our God! Laud Jehovah God!
Make his goodness known! Make it known!
3. Laud our God! Laud Jehovah God!
Make his Kingdom known! Make it known!
Sound his worth! Sound Jehovah’s worth
To the far-flung corners of the earth!
The time is here! And Christ reigns as King.
To Jehovah all praise must go.
So our triumphant song we can sing
And to God our allegiance show.
Laud our God! Laud Jehovah God!
Make his Kingdom known! Make it known!

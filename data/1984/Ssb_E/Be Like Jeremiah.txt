Song 70
Be Like Jeremiah
(Jeremiah 1:7, 18)
1. In service of God’s Kingdom,
There is joy beyond compare.
While rendering such service,
We have God’s own loving care.
But as the Bible warns us
—And the Bible’s words are true—
Besides the joys of serving God,
We will have some perils too.
2. Remember Jeremiah,
Who was called when young in years
To take up sacred service,
How Jehovah stilled his fears?
‘Though they will fight against you,
Using all their wicked pow’r,
They’ll not prevail against you, for
You will be a mighty tow’r.’
3. For years then Jeremiah
Proved Jehovah to be true.
He had success in service,
Though he had some perils too.
Let’s be like Jeremiah,
Trust in God implicitly.
Do bold and fearless witnessing
To Jehovah’s sov’reignty.

Song 79
Creation Reveals Jehovah’s Glory
(Psalm 19)
1. Jehovah God, my soul is well aware,
The brilliant heav’ns your glory do declare.
From day to day and night to night they speak
And without words bring knowledge to the meek.
From day to day and night to night they speak
And without words bring knowledge to the meek.
2. For you have made the sun and moon and stars,
And for the oceans you have set their bars.
Man can but look and see what you have done
And give you praise as the Deserving One.
Man can but look and see what you have done
And give you praise as the Deserving One.
3. Your laws are perfect; your commands are true.
Reminders, orders, also come from you.
They make us wise, are better than fine gold.
O may we keep them, always to them hold!
They make us wise, are better than fine gold.
O may we keep them, always to them hold!

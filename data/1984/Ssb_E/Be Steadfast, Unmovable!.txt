Song 10
Be Steadfast, Unmovable!
(1 Corinthians 15:58)
1. As the last days move along to the end,
Wisely in service ourselves we expend.
Firm and unmovable we want to be,
Serving our God faithfully.
(Chorus)
2. Pleasures from Satan’s old system abound.
Great is the need for our mind to keep sound.
If we keep steadfast, to God ever true,
Safely he’ll carry us through.
(Chorus)
3. Let us serve God with real vigor and vim.
Care let us take lest our vision grow dim.
To the good news may we always hold fast.
Soon these last days will have passed.
(CHORUS)
Steadfast we all need to be; far from this world we keep free,
As we feed on God’s truth and keep integrity.

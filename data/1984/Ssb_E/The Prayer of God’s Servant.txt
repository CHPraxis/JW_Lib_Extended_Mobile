The Prayer of God’s Servant
(James 3:17)
1. Heav’nly Father, Sov’reign Lord,
Be your glorious name adored;
For your mercies will endure,
Ever faithful, ever sure.
Ever faithful, ever sure,
Yes, your mercies will endure.
2. As our service we pursue,
Teach us, God, your will to do.
Your commands we want to keep,
Staying close to your dear sheep.
Staying close to your dear sheep,
Your commands we want to keep.
3. Give us wisdom from above,
Pure and gentle, full of love.
Help us merciful to be
As we serve impartially.
As we serve impartially,
Help us merciful to be.
4. May the joy to have a part
In your service fill our heart.
Never may our prayers cease
That your Kingdom may increase.
That your Kingdom may increase,
Never may our prayers cease.

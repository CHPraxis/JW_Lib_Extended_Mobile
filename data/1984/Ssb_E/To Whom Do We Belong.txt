Song 207
To Whom Do We Belong?
(1 Corinthians 6:20)
1. To whom do you belong?
Which God do you obey?
For just the one to whom you bow
Your master is; you serve him now.
You cannot serve two gods;
Both masters cannot share
The love of your heart in its ev’ry part.
To neither you’d be fair.
2. To whom do you belong?
Which God will you obey?
For one is false and one is true,
So make your choice; it’s up to you.
Shall Caesar of this world
Claim your allegiance still?
Or will you obey the true God today
And vow to do his will?
3. To whom do I belong?
Jehovah I’ll obey.
This God of truth I’ll gladly serve;
From paying my vow I’ll not swerve.
He bought me at great cost;
I’ve ceased from serving men.
The death of his Son my ransom has won;
I’ll not turn back again.
4. To God we do belong!
There’s no uncertainty.
The unity that he foretold
We now experience in his fold.
Just like the fragrant oil
Upon the high priest’s head,
We find it so sweet together to meet
And with his truth be fed.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="st"><strong>Declare the Everlasting Good News</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="st">(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:14:6-66:14:8" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Revelation 14:6-8</a>)</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sl">1. Around the earth with urgency God’s angel flies</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sz">With everlasting good news, high amid the skies.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sp">He says: ‘Give glory and fear him upon the throne.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sz">Yes, worship God Jehovah and serve him alone.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sp">For now has come the Most High’s awesome judgment hour;</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sz">Soon all the wicked ones will feel his mighty pow’r.’</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sp">Accordingly, God’s Kingdom preachers must not fear</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sz">But speak out boldly this good news both far and near.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sl">2. And then what does a second angel loud declare</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sz">That we, Jehovah’s Witnesses, therein may share?</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sp">He tells about the fall of Babylon the Great,</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sz">That soon destruction by our God will be her fate.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sp">And so Jehovah God commands that we proclaim</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sz">His vengeance and the vindication of his name.</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sp">The field in which we preach and teach is great indeed;</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sz">But God’s own angel in midheaven takes the lead.</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sl">3. The Son of man with all his angels in array</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sz">Begins his work of judging nations in this day.</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sp">Hate what is bad. Apply the good, you faithful sheep.</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sz">Fear God alone, and his commandments fully keep.</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sp">The obligation laid upon us by our Lord</p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sz">Is, ‘Preach the good news, teach the whole truth of God’s Word.’</p>
<p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sp">As ministers, we do exhort courageously,</p>
<p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sz">“Come, worship God Jehovah; serve him joyfully.”</p>

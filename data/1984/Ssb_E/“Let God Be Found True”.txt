“Let God Be Found True”
(Romans 3:4)
1. The God of truth Jehovah is;
He never tells a lie.
On him we always can depend;
Himself he can’t deny.
He’ll true be found, though ev’ry man
A liar proves to be.
His truth is pure and will endure
Throughout eternity.
2. When God his Firstborn sent to earth
His Father’s will to do,
Then Jesus, by his words and deeds,
Let God be e’er found true.
Jehovah’s will was law for him;
His precepts he did keep.
He took delight in what is right
And led his Father’s sheep.
3. Though men God’s Word have ridiculed
And falsehoods have preferred,
We, like our Lord, let God be true;
We stand firm on his Word.
For us who preach that truthful Word,
It has the final say.
Its truth we seek, since we are meek,
And God’s Word we obey.

Song 192
Making Known the Kingdom Truth
(Acts 20:20, 21)
1. There was a time we did not know
The way a Christian ought to go.
But then Jehovah sent the light,
His Kingdom truth so clear and bright.
2. Our privilege we then did see
To serve the grand Theocracy,
To make well-known Jehovah’s fame,
Thus glorifying his great name.
3. We witness now to all we meet,
From door to door and on the street.
With Bible studies, patiently
We teach the truth that sets men free.
4. And as we strive in ev’ry land
True worship widely to expand,
May we serve faithfully as one,
Until God says the work is done.

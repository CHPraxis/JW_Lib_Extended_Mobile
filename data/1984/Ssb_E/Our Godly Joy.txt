Song 186
Our Godly Joy
(Philippians 4:4)
1. The spirit’s fruit of godly joy
We need if we’d endure.
To have this joy in full, it takes
A faith that’s strong and sure.
This joy is no mere passing mood;
It always is required.
That’s why we read, “Rejoice!” “Rejoice!”
In words by God inspired.
2. We’ve many reasons for our joy:
We know God and his Son;
We’re honored as their Witnesses;
With them we are at one.
There’s joy in knowing that some day
All men our God will praise,
That even those in Hades will
Return and walk God’s ways.
3. This joy to deepen we must serve
Our God contentedly,
Must carefully safeguard our hearts
And keep from malice free.
We also want to be alert
To praise God all day long,
Keep thinking on upbuilding things,
Avoiding all that’s wrong.
4. Though cramped and lowly be our lot
While walking in his light,
This godly joy is our reward
For serving him aright.
It marks us as Jehovah’s slaves
As we his Word declare.
To overflow with it, we must
This joy with others share.

Song 220
Our Paradise: Present and Future
(2 Corinthians 12:4)
1. Wondrous Jehovah, God, we praise you
For our spir’tual paradise,
Where we by study, pray’r, and meetings
Get assistance to be wise.
O let us give thanks for
How greatly we’re blest
And how in your service
We have joy and rest!
True love for you and for our neighbor
Is the strongest bond of all.
How it unites us in your service
So that we may never fall!
2. Administration of your justice
You have given Christ the King.
At your right hand since his enthronement,
He rules over ev’rything.
We praise you, Jehovah,
For having made known
Your wonderful purpose
To gather your own.
O may our conduct e’er prove worthy
Of the good news that we preach,
So that at no time we will stumble
Sheeplike ones we seek to teach!
3. After the battle of the great day
Of Jehovah has been fought
And both the Devil and his demons
To the deep abyss are brought,
Then your ancient servants
From tombs will arise
To serve you with gladness
In earth’s Paradise.
They will help all men reach perfection
Through the priesthood of your Son;
Then here on earth, to time indef’nite,
Lasting joys from you will come.

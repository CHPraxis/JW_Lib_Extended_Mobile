“The Scene of This World Is Changing”
(1 Corinthians 7:31)
1. Though men now cause ruination
To earth, God’s lovely creation,
Still we live in expectation
That God such evils will cure.
(Chorus)
2. Our foes, like dogs, keep on snapping.
Our strength they want to keep sapping.
But hands with joy we are clapping;
We know our vict’ry is sure.
(Chorus)
3. Though foes may put in appearance
And try to cause interference,
To God’s Word we give adherence
And seek to keep our hearts pure.
(Chorus)
4. The Devil’s system is ending;
Restraint for him is impending.
Such good news we are defending
—Our God helps us to endure.
(CHORUS)
Though the scene of this world is now changing,
Our God is kindly arranging
All things to keep us secure.

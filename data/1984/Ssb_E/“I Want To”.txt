Song 156
“I Want To”
(Luke 5:13)
1. O what love God’s Son for us showed,
For he left his heav’nly abode
That with men he might live, to whom truth he could give.
Yes, God’s truth from his lips ever flowed.
Greatly he did comfort mankind,
Healed the sick, the lame, and the blind.
To his royal commission, he proved true
And so lovingly said: “I want to.”
2. O what help Jehovah God gave
When he sent the faithful, wise slave,
With whom we serve with joy, as our pow’rs we employ
That the needy and weak we might save!
Truly these most surely can tell
When we love them ever so well.
So when widows and orphans would ask you,
Will you readily say: “I want to”?
3. Love for God impels us to preach,
To call back and patiently teach
Those who sigh and who mourn and who feel so forlorn;
All such seekers of truth we must reach.
O what joy when these understand
Bible truths and promises grand,
When God’s service they earnestly will do!
All this, since we have said: “I want to.”

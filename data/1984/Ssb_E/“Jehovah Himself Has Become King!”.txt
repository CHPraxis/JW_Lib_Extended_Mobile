Song 33
“Jehovah Himself Has Become King!”
(Psalm 97:1)
1. Give thanks, you people, to Jehovah.
Make his deeds known among all the nations.
Gladly sing to our God, melodies make to him,
And concern yourselves with his great acts.
(Chorus)
2. Tell out his glory ’mong the nations.
The salvation he gives, tell from day to day.
For Jehovah is great, very much to be praised,
To be feared more than all other gods.
(Chorus)
3. Renown and strength to God attribute.
Give him thanks for his Son, Jesus Christ the King.
And in holy adornment, bow down to our God;
Speak exultingly Jehovah’s praise.
(CHORUS)
Let the heavens rejoice, let the earth joyful be,
For Jehovah God has become the King!
Let the heavens rejoice, let the earth joyful be,
For Jehovah God has become the King!

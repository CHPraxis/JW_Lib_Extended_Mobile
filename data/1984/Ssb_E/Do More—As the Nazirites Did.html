<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="st"><strong>Do More—As the Nazirites Did</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="st">(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:6:8-4:6:8" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Numbers 6:8</a>)</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sl">1. Nazirites—O can we be like them?</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sz">Can we act like them today?</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sp">Singled out, they could serve Jehovah</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sz">In a unique, special way.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sp">Analyze! Let’s give it attention.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sz">Time indeed fast is running out.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sp">Can we do more in the service,</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sz">Raising a mighty shout?</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sl">2. Nazirites—their life-style was simple.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sz">Self-denial was their role.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sp">Close to God it surely did bring them.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sz">Could we too have such a goal?</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sp">They accepted certain restrictions;</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sz">That was part of their sacred vow.</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sp">Many of our Christian brothers</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sz">Lead such a life right now.</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sl">3. Nazirites—they truly were diff’rent.</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sz">Why, they had a crowning sign.</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sp">They did more by being submissive;</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sz">Closer to God they’d incline.</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sp">So today, as God’s fellow workers,</p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sz">By submission our faith we show.</p>
<p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sp">May Jehovah bless our efforts,</p>
<p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sz">Setting our hearts aglow.</p>
<p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sl">4. Nazirites—they set an example.</p>
<p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="sz">Care they took with holiness.</p>
<p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="sp">Undefiled, then, let us be like them;</p>
<p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="sz">Their life our God e’er did bless.</p>
<p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="sp">Count the cost, and trust in Jehovah.</p>
<p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="sz">Those he cares for he will sustain.</p>
<p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="sp">Doing more, right in the forefront,</p>
<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="sz">Deep-seated joy we’ll gain.</p>
<p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="sb"></p>

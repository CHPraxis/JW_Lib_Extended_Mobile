Song 62
Happy, the Merciful!
(Matthew 5:7)
1. How happy are the merciful!
In God’s eyes they are beautiful.
They tell to all who love the right
That God in mercy takes delight.
At Calv’ry mercy God displayed,
Provision for our ransom made.
He offers mercy to the meek
Because he knows our frame is weak.
2. Those merciful like God are blest;
Through sins forgiven they have rest.
They benefit by mercy shown
Since Christ appeared before God’s throne.
This mercy they would gladly share
By preaching God’s Word ev’rywhere,
By telling men: Be of good cheer
Because the Kingdom now is here.
3. The merciful need have no dread
When up before God’s judgment led;
For mercy he’ll cause them to know,
Since they, like him, do mercy show.
O merciful may we e’er be
And show that tender quality
By using each occasion giv’n
To imitate our God in heav’n.
(POSTLUDE)
How happy are the merciful!
In God’s eyes truly beautiful.

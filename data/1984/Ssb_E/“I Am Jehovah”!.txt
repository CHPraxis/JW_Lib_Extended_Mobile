Song 61
“I Am Jehovah”!
(Isaiah 42:8)
1. Hear now, the kings of pagan empires
Ignore Jehovah, God Most High.
They choose not to recognize his sov’reignty,
And his mighty power they defy.
But who was the One that overthrew their hosts,
That they perished ignominiously?
Yes, whose was the arm that silenced all their boasts
And gave his chosen people victory?
(Chorus)
2. See now the pow’rs of earth combining
In counsel ’gainst Jehovah’s Son!
Yet fear seizes hold upon their mighty men,
While the poor of earth in anguish groan.
Ah! Who will destroy the proud oppressor’s yoke
And deliver all the meek of the earth?
And who will establish them in righteousness
And turn their sorrow into songs of mirth?
(CHORUS)
I am the Lord; there is no other.
I am the Lord; Jehovah is my name.
I’ve set my King upon my holy mountain;
Bow to his rule! My Son begins his reign.

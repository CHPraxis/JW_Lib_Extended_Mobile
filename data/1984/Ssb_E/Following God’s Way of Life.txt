Song 214
Following God’s Way of Life
(Proverbs 9:10, 11)
1. What a fine gift, a most precious possession,
Is life through Christ! May we use it aright.
To you, Jehovah, we make this confession:
Your way, to us, brings exquisite delight.
2. Rightly, Jehovah, it’s you we are fearing.
Knowledge and wisdom we thus do acquire.
Into your law we find pleasure in peering;
In it we walk, in pure godly attire.
3. Life has a purpose, and you are so gracious.
Through your dear Son, we now learn how to live.
Love not the world or its things ostentatious.
Seek greater happiness, learning to give.
4. Help us apply in our lives all your teaching,
Now that your Kingdom is near at the doors.
May we to meek ones of earth now be preaching,
As Christ our King your true worship restores.

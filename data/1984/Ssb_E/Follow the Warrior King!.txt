Song 209
Follow the Warrior King!
(Ephesians 6:16, 17)
1. We have a song to sing for Jehovah God;
We have a song of his reign and glory.
We have a message clear for all men to hear
And a commission to tell the story.
(Chorus)
2. Warriors of God, arise, join the fighting force
Under the Captain of God’s free nation.
Take up the shield of faith and the spirit’s sword;
Put on the helmet of his salvation.
(Chorus)
3. Not in our own might can we be conquerors;
Not of ourselves can we be victorious.
But in the strength of God can we all prevail,
Making the name of Jehovah glorious.
(CHORUS)
Forward go! (Yes, go!)
Fearlessly go! (Fearlessly go!)
As an army, let us go
To combat the wicked foe;
Follow the Warrior King, who can never fail.
Following him, we shall prevail!

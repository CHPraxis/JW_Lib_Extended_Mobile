<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sl">1. May we of God’s household ever reflect</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sz">That he has a place we dare not neglect,</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sp">A house upon which he did so decide</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sz">That there his grand name would come to reside.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sp">Just like Nehemiah, who with great care</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sz">True worship restored in God’s house of prayer,</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sp">We too may Him honor with all our tenth parts,</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sz">Thus show that we love Him with all of our hearts.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sp">(Chorus)</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sl">2. God’s fam’ly today in unity lives,</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sz">A household to which attention he gives.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sp">His steward, so faithful, serves him so well,</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sz">And as a result, there peace does now dwell.</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sp">Let’s bring to God’s house our valu’ble things;</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sz">The giving of firstfruits him honor brings.</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sp">He blesses his household in such a fine way,</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sz">Thus making us serve him with joy ev’ry day.</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="se">(CHORUS)</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sp">God’s house deserves our full support.</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sz">‘Come worship there,’ we do exhort.</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sp">His household is his family;</p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sz">He’ll dwell among them eternally.</p>

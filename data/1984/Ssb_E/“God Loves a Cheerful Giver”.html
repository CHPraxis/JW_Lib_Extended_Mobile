<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="st">(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:9:7-47:9:7" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 9:7</a>)</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sl">1. As we serve our dear Father, we should ever keep in mind</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sz">That he’s happy and gen’rous, yes, loving and kind.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sp">As a Giver, he’s matchless; e’en his Son for us he gave,</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sz">For all sorts of mankind he most truly wants to save.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sl">2. His example in giving we do well to imitate.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sz">When our giving is cheerful, goodwill we create.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sp">All our time and resources, to Jehovah they belong.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sz">If to him we do give them, we never will go wrong.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sl">3. Yes, the giving that’s cheerful, to Jehovah brings delight.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sz">It adorns all his teaching, to love does incite.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sp">Great indeed is its value when it wells up from the heart;</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sz">Happiness and great joy to us then it will impart.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sl">4. So to God and Christ Jesus we are grateful for this joy.</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sz">While advancing true worship, our pow’rs we employ.</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sp">May our heart ever move us to be cheerful as we give</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sz">And to please God Jehovah as long as we will live.</p>

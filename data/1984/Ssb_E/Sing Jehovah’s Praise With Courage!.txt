Song 107
Sing Jehovah’s Praise With Courage!
(2 Chronicles 20:21)
1. Let us sing Jehovah’s praise with courage,
In whose strength we face a mighty foe.
Never let the enemy dismay us.
Fear them not. But forward let us go!
(Chorus)
2. Let us sing Jehovah’s praise with courage
And give warning loud for all to hear,
For our King will soon destroy the wicked.
False religion’s end is very near.
(Chorus)
3. Let us sing Jehovah’s praise with courage
As we teach the lowly and the true,
Showing them their privilege to serve God,
Helping them his will on earth to do.
(CHORUS)
Herald forth the good news of salvation!
Help men see the need of dedication.
Let us sing Jehovah’s praise with courage,
Magnify his great and holy name.

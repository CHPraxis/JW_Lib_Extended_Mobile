Song 68
Godly Compassion
(Colossians 3:12)
1. If we truly would be Christians,
Real compassion we must show
Both to loved ones and to strangers,
Yes, to those we do not know.
Jesus, our Great Teacher,
Forcefully made this so clear
With an illustration.
Happy are the ears that hear!
2. A Samaritan was trav’ling
Down to Jericho one day.
On the road a Jew lay helpless;
Robbed he had been on the way.
Helping that poor victim,
He prejudice set aside.
Love came to the rescue.
God’s commandments were applied.
3. This makes clear who is our neighbor.
He is one that needs our aid.
God is good t’ward men of all kinds,
Gives them rain and sun and shade.
Great is God’s compassion!
He surely is our best Friend.
Bounteous is his kindness.
On this fact we can depend.
4. There are times when food and clothing
To our neighbor we might give.
But a need there is more urgent
That for all time they might live.
Knowledge of God’s Kingdom,
God’s truth, and his righteousness
We will bring to neighbors
That, in turn, they may God bless.

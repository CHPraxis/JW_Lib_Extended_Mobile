Song 14
“Be Glad, You Nations”!
(Romans 15:10)
1. Be glad, you nations, with his people!
God’s Kingdom is at hand.
Christ Jesus reigns upon Mount Zion;
Rejoice in ev’ry land!
The seven Gentile Times have ended;
Their kings have had their day.
Be glad, you nations, with his people!
Jehovah’s King holds sway.
2. Be glad, you nations, with his people!
This system nears the brink
Of Armageddon’s coming battle;
It’s nearer than they think.
While men praise their disgusting image
And spurn the Prince of Peace,
We hail that One with jubilation;
His rule will e’er increase.
3. Be glad, you nations, with his people!
Go tell from door to door
The good news of Jehovah’s Kingdom;
Proclaim from shore to shore
That Christ as King will rule in wisdom,
In love and righteousness.
Be glad, you nations, with his people!
Serve God in faithfulness.

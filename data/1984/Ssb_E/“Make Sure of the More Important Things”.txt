“Make Sure of the More Important Things”
(Philippians 1:10)
1. We gladly serve our God, Jehovah;
He’s the one we love.
For love’s the all-important thing;
It comes from God above.
May love abound yet more and more as we all make sure
Of things that are righteous and true.
And may we ever be flawless,
Having in God’s work much to do.
2. The things that count so much with God
Are that we grateful be,
Obey him with a joyful heart,
And keep integrity.
And with all men peaceably live as we to them give
The hope of the Kingdom so grand
—Working good, causing no stumbling,
Giving to all a helping hand.
3. It is important that we strive
God’s teaching to adorn,
Conduct ourselves as lesser ones,
His counsel never scorn.
With righteous fruit may we be filled, with good news be thrilled
In service that praise to God brings.
In this way we will be making sure
Of the more important things.

Song 136
Loyal Worshipers Bless Jehovah
(Psalm 18:25)
1. Loyal ones bless you, Lord, praising in full accord;
So may you, please, afford prosperity.
You’re worthy of our praise; righteous are all your ways.
With works we’ll fill our days in loyalty.
2. We seek to honor you—may our thanks ne’er be few—
Careful in all we do, with chastity.
Please help us all to know how best in faith to grow.
Lord, each day may we show integrity.
3. Grant us to understand your Kingdom purpose grand
In which you take a hand so gloriously.
Keep showing good to all that none may ever fall.
Do hear us when we call, unceasingly.
4. Help us, our Father dear, to overcome all fear
As we spread Kingdom cheer and praise your name.
To us may peace abound as we your praises sound
In all the world around, to your great fame.

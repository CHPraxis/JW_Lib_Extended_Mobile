Song 114
God’s Loyal Love
(Isaiah 55:1-3)
1. Loyal love! God is love.
This truth cheers us from above.
Love caused God to send his Son,
Who for us the ransom won,
That we might gain righteousness,
Life eternal, happiness.
(Chorus)
2. Loyal love! God is love.
All his works give proof thereof.
Love for us he’s further shown,
Giving Christ a heav’nly throne
To fulfill his cov’nant sworn.
See! His Kingdom has been born.
(Chorus)
3. Loyal love! God is love.
Peace he sent us like a dove.
Us he gave the faithful slave,
Him a grand commission gave,
That Jehovah’s name he bear,
In its vindication share.
(Chorus)
4. Loyal love! God is love.
May God’s love move us to love.
Loyally let’s help the meek
As God’s righteousness they seek.
May we preach from door to door,
Comfort spread the whole world o’er.
(CHORUS)
Hey there, all you thirsty ones,
Come and drink life’s water free.
Yes, come drink, you thirsty ones;
God’s loving-kindness see.

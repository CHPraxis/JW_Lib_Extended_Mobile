<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="st"><strong>Youth’s Place in God’s Arrangement</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="st">(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:148:12-19:148:13" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 148:12, 13</a>)</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sl">1. There’s a place for ev’ryone in God’s arrangement.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sz">He invites the young and old to praise his name.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sp">The response of all the young ones is impressive</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sz">As earth wide the Kingdom message they proclaim.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sp">How effective is the witness they are giving!</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sz">They are neat and well prepared and so polite!</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sp">To Jehovah they are precious as they serve him;</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sz">To the older ones, they also bring delight.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sl">2. So all youngsters who have come to know Jehovah,</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sz">What a happy, joyful day it then will be!</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sp">Just imagine what awaits them in the future</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sz">—Life in Paradise for all eternity!</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sp">In the meantime we are living under pressure</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sz">From this system that is soon to lick the dust.</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sp">We must fight with all our might to overcome it;</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sz">Kingdom loyalty maintain—it is a must.</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sl">3. They can find good friends among Jehovah’s people.</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sz">Why should they seek friendship with the wicked world?</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sp">Let them get involved with things that are upbuilding,</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sz">That on God’s own sacred pages lie unfurled.</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sp">When in trouble let youths seek out those that love them,</p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sz">Tell these all the things that weigh upon their mind.</p>
<p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sp">Yet their greatest Friend of all is God Jehovah;</p>
<p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sz">Understanding, merciful, him they will find.</p>
<p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sl">4. We are members of the Christian congregation,</p>
<p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="sz">Where Christ Jesus now supplies our ev’ry need.</p>
<p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="sp">So in loyalty let’s take our place beside him;</p>
<p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="sz">All the counsel that he offers let us heed.</p>
<p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="sp">Never let the world into its mold now squeeze us;</p>
<p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="sz">Let Jehovah, through his Word, our minds keep clean.</p>
<p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="sp">And together, young and old, may we be faithful,</p>
<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="sz">Praising him, for life eternal this will mean.</p>

Song 40
Making Our Way Successful
(Joshua 1:8)
1. God Jehovah told Joshua:
‘From my Law do not stray.
Read each day in an undertone,
Then take care to obey.
Let it guide you in all you do,
From your mouth not depart.
Then successful will be your way
As the truth guides your heart.
Then successful will be your way
As the truth guides your heart.’
2. When the kings ruled in Israel
And obeyed God’s command:
‘Ev’ry king for himself must write
God’s Law in his own hand
And must read in it all his days
That he humble might be.’
Then Jehovah would bless his realm;
Lengthened days he would see.
Then Jehovah would bless his realm;
Lengthened days he would see.
3. In the Bible we find the way
God would have us to live.
Since we cannot direct our step,
Help to us he must give.
If we’re feeding on his own thoughts,
We’ll come to know his will.
When our thinking is trained by God,
His commands we’ll fulfill.
When our thinking is trained by God,
His commands we’ll fulfill.

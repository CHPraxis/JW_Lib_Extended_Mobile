Song 179
On Jehovah We Must Wait
(Romans 8:19)
1. There’s a faithful little flock.
On Jehovah it must wait.
And its heav’nly kings will reign;
This their hope is truly great.
Christ Jesus is reigning;
His right he’s maintaining.
He will give a grand reward
To all who are his own,
Who make the Kingdom known.
2. As companions they now have
A great crowd of other sheep.
And with them their one desire
Is integrity to keep.
As light keeps increasing,
They wait without ceasing
The revealing of God’s sons,
Which will bring lasting peace,
Yes, will bring lasting peace.
3. God has promised to mankind
A new heaven and new earth.
In these righteousness will dwell,
Following the Kingdom’s birth.
For this we are yearning,
As truth we are learning.
In Jehovah we do trust;
On him we all must wait.
Yes, on him we must wait.

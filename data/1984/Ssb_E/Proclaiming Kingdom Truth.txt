Song 126
Proclaiming Kingdom Truth
(Matthew 10:7)
1. Kingdom truth is what we hold so dear,
For to sheeplike ones it brings good cheer.
Urgently, we preach it without fear,
For, indeed, the Kingdom now is here.
2. Constantly, from house to house we go;
It’s the Kingdom truth we want to sow.
That we have God’s backing, this we know.
May his spirit set us all aglow.
3. With a fine commission we are blessed.
May we ever seek to do our best,
Bringing hope to those who are distressed.
Surely, Kingdom truth will bring them rest.
4. So in all the earth we must proclaim
That earth’s promised Ruler Christ became.
Soon his Kingdom will make known the fame
Of the Sov’reign Lord Jehovah’s name.

Song 123
Move Ahead!
(Hebrews 6:1)
1. Move ahead, move ahead to maturity!
It’s the will of our God that we gain ability.
Try your best to improve in your ministry,
And then our God your work will bless.
There is a place in the service for all;
It is the work Jesus did, you’ll recall.
Look to God that you thus at no time may fall.
Keep standing firm for righteousness.
2. Move ahead, move ahead, boldly witnessing!
Everlasting good news to all sorts of people bring.
Joyfully praise Jehovah, our God and King,
By witnessing from door to door.
Though wicked foes tend to cause you to fear,
Do not shrink back, but let ev’ryone hear
Gladsome news that the Kingdom of God is near.
Declare the truth yet more and more.
3. Move ahead, move ahead; always follow through
And improve in your skills, for there’s so much work to do!
Let God’s spirit keep on motivating you
And make you know joy that’s divine.
Love all the brothers for God’s own name’s sake;
With them in weekly assemblies partake.
And assist them good progress each day to make,
Together letting your lights shine.

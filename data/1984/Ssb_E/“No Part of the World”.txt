Song 24
“No Part of the World”
(John 17:16)
1. Because our God set us apart,
It is to him we give our heart.
No part of Satan’s world are we;
Like Christ, our Lord, we choose to be.
2. All worldly trends we must avoid,
In God’s own work to keep employed.
From fleshly things we must abstain
If we forever would remain.
3. Those who God’s friendship cultivate,
This wicked world will surely hate.
Yes, persecution we expect,
But God, through Christ, will us protect.
4. So we take courage, undismayed.
For us, our Lord to God once prayed:
‘Watch over them for your name’s sake.’
Hence of his care may we partake.

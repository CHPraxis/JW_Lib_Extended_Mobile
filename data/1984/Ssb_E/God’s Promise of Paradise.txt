Song 4
God’s Promise of Paradise
(Luke 23:43)
1. A paradise our God has promised,
By means of Christ’s Millennial Reign,
When he’ll blot out all sin and error,
Removing death and tears and pain.
(Chorus)
2. Soon here on earth, for God so purposed,
His Son will cause the dead to rise.
It was the promise of Christ Jesus:
‘You’ll be with me in Paradise.’
(Chorus)
3. O joy of joys! What grand reunion
When billions dead return to life!
’Twill be a time of fine instruction,
Completely free from hateful strife.
(Chorus)
4. Yes, Paradise our Lord did promise.
And he is now earth’s rightful King.
So let us thank our God, Jehovah.
Do leap for joy; his praises sing.
(CHORUS)
A paradise the earth will be.
With eyes of faith this we can see.
This promise Christ shall soon fulfill,
For he delights to do God’s will.

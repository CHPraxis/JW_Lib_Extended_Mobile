Song 72
The Joys and Fruits of Kingdom Service
(Matthew 5:12)
1. In the service of our God, Jehovah,
We have joys that are beyond compare,
For unselfishly we preach the good news
So that others may our comfort share.
It is just as Jesus Christ assured us:
Giving reaps the greater happiness.
And what better thing could we be giving
Than the truth that leads to life and righteousness.
2. Even when from house to house we’re preaching
We meet ridicule or apathy,
We maintain our strong determination
And hold fast to our integrity.
Should we meet with bitter persecution
For upholding God Jehovah’s name,
Jesus said for joy we should be leaping,
For the ancient prophets suffered just the same.
3. O what joys there are in sacred service
As we take the path our Master trod:
Preach God’s day of vengeance, warn the wicked,
And bring honor to Jehovah God!
Also, we bring hope to all those yearning
For a world that’s free from sin and strife.
This gives us both joy and satisfaction,
Yes, our blessed hope of everlasting life.

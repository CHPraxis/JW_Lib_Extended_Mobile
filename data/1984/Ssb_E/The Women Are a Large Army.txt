Song 82
The Women Are a Large Army
(Psalm 68:11)
1. Jehovah himself gives the saying.
The women who go out to preach
All form a large army to witness;
Humanity they want to reach.
It means getting started right early,
To look to one’s household with care.
By planning and diligent forethought,
In service they have a fine share.
2. On these fellow workers, our sisters,
Jehovah’s rich blessing we pray.
For much they accomplish in preaching,
The menfolk with pride justly say.
But many are widows, old-timers,
And all have their problems to face.
From meetings they seldom are absent;
Endurance they show in life’s race.
3. We must give them all due attention
As mothers and daughters and wives.
They share in the joys of the harvest,
Attempting to save precious lives.
This army of women is worthy.
Their efforts result in great gain.
Look after these with fellow feeling.
God’s saying was not said in vain.

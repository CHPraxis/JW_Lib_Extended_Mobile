Song 84
Godâ€™s Great and Wondrous Works
(Revelation 15:3)
1. Jehovah God, Almighty One,
How great and wondrous your works are!
Earth, moon, and stars and shining sun
Your glories tell, both near and far.
2. How righteous, true, are all your ways,
Our Judge and our eternal King!
Since all creation sings your praise,
Why should not we thanksgiving bring?
3. Who will not fear and honor you
And magnify your holy name?
You are the Loyal One and true,
The God Most High of endless fame.
4. Your wise decrees, how vast their sum!
How they show forth your righteousness!
Let all the nations to you come
And worship you, your name confess.

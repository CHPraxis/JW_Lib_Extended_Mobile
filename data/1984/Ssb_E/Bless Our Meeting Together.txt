Song 28
Bless Our Meeting Together
(Hebrews 10:24, 25)
1. Bless us as we meet together,
Great Jehovah, we now pray.
For our meetings we do thank you;
May your spirit with us stay.
2. Of our spir’tual need we’re conscious;
With your Word, please, do us fill.
Train our minds and tongues to witness,
Love within our hearts instill.
3. Yes, this meeting is for worship;
Holiness is what we seek.
We desire to know you better
And keep ever humble, meek.
4. So, dear Father, bless our meetings;
Grant us peace and unity.
For our part we want to serve you,
Magnify your Sov’reignty.

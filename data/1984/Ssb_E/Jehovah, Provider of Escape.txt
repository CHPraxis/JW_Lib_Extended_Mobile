Song 74
Jehovah, Provider of Escape
(Psalm 18:1, 2)
1. In this our day, the prophecy is now fulfilled.
The Devil was hurled down; it’s woe for earth and sea.
Our God enthroned Christ Jesus as Lord and King. So we sing:
‘Jah will provide escape.’
(Chorus)
2. Now each day pressures come to test our loyalty;
The spirit of this world attacks us tauntingly.
Our thinking and our conduct we must keep pure to endure
And, in the end, escape.
(Chorus)
3. Soon Christ will crush the Devil in the final war,
And mourning, outcry, pain, and death will be no more.
As God renews the heavens and earth below, all will know
By Jah we have escaped.
(CHORUS)
Jehovah provides escape for the loyal.
Our enemies will see what a mighty Crag is he.
So, with courage, as servants of God, we give acclaim
To Jehovah, our Source of escape, and praise his name.

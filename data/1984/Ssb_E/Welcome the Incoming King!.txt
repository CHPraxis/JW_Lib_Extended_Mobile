Song 176
Welcome the Incoming King!
(Psalm 24:7)
1. The due time has come to extend a grand welcome
To Almighty God, to whom all things belong.
For he and his Son now assemble all nations,
And the heavens are resounding with a stirring battle song.
So ‘lift up your heads, O you gates,’ with rejoicing;
The grand King of glory the vict’ry will gain.
The time has drawn close for Jehovah of armies
To bring to all mankind Christ’s Thousand Year Reign.
His pow’r he’ll display through his incoming Kingdom,
O’er earth his wide dominion extending once again.
2. The great Sov’reign Lord, the Supreme One, Jehovah,
Has brought forth a Kingdom that never will end.
Deserving is he of a real heartfelt welcome;
Let our great incoming King know that his cause we do defend.
O be lifted up, lofty gates! We bring good news.
Hence, great is our joy as together we sing:
‘Jehovah is strong and is mighty in battle.’
We do well to listen and gifts to him bring,
For his time has come to bless those whom he favors.
So may we cry out “Welcome!” to this incoming King.

Song 143
Take Sides With Jehovah!
(Exodus 32:26)
1. Once with confusion our sad hearts were filled,
Drinking the cup false religion distilled;
But with what happiness our hearts were thrilled
When of God’s Kingdom we heard (we first heard).
(Chorus)
2. Now with our whole hearts we will serve our God
And share in spreading his truth all abroad,
Helping our brothers God’s virtues to laud,
Praising his great worthy name (his great name).
(Chorus)
3. We will not fear what the Devil can do,
For God Jehovah will carry us through.
Though they be many and though we be few,
God is our strength and our might (and our might).
(CHORUS)
Take sides with Jehovah;
Make him your delight.
He’ll never forsake you;
Walk e’er in his light.
Tell, tell the glad tidings
Of freedom and peace.
His rule by Christ Jesus
Will ever increase.

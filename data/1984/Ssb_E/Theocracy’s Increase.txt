Song 53
Theocracy’s Increase
(Isaiah 9:6, 7)
1. Hail the Theocracy, ever increasing!
Wondrous expansion is now taking place.
Praise to Jehovah is sung without ceasing
By those who walk in the light of his face.
Long years ago saw the humble beginning
As our Redeemer a lowly way trod.
Now a great crowd join the remnant in bringing
Praises to him at the right hand of God.
2. Christ on his judgment throne sits and is reigning;
Nations and peoples before him appear.
God’s sov’reignty he will soon be maintaining,
Crushing his enemies both far and near.
Wonderful Couns’lor and Father Supernal,
Yes, Mighty God is he and Prince of Peace.
Zeal of Jehovah will bring peace eternal
And make his princely rule ever increase.
3. O what a favor we now have in living!
Does not this increase bring joy to your heart?
Share in the joy that gets greater by giving,
And in the witness work gladly take part.
Boldly warn those who are God’s name defaming;
Tell all such men Armageddon is nigh.
And all the while zealously keep proclaiming
Kingdom good news to the meek ones who sigh.

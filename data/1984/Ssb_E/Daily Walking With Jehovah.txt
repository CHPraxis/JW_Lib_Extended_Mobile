Song 55
Daily Walking With Jehovah
(Micah 6:8)
1. Hand in hand with God Jehovah,
We would humbly walk each day.
O how undeserved this kindness
That he grants to men of clay!
Since it’s only by appointment
That we thus can take God’s hand,
We begin with dedication;
On God’s side we take our stand.
2. Walking with our heav’nly Father
Is the safe course, truly wise.
We’re beset by adversaries,
Who would rob us of the prize.
There are Satan and his demons
And the snares of fallen flesh
And this world’s materialism;
How they would our feet enmesh!
3. Help to us God has provided
Through his spirit and his Word,
Through his Christian congregation,
And through prayers that are heard.
As we walk with God Jehovah,
May we justly do what’s right.
May we love sincerely kindness
And be modest in his sight.

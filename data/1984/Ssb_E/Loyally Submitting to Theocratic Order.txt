Song 8
Loyally Submitting to Theocratic Order
(1 Corinthians 14:33)
1. As Jehovah’s people sound throughout the earth
Truths about the Kingdom, of such priceless worth,
Theocratic order they must all obey
And remain united, loyalty display.
(Chorus)
2. Jesus Christ, our Leader, is in full control;
He equips the soldiers that he does enroll.
’Tis a spir’tual warfare, so we have to act
As a group, united, close-knit, and compact.
(Chorus)
3. Then we have God’s steward and His active force.
These will ever guide us in our Christian course.
So may we be steadfast, seeking God to please,
Loyally proclaiming all his wise decrees!
(CHORUS)
Loyal submission in recognition,
This to our God we owe.
He gives protection, tender affection.
Loyalty to him we show.

Song 137
The Appointed Time Nears
(Habakkuk 2:3)
1. O Jehovah, Holy One,
The Rock from long ago,
Out of Zion soon you’ll roar;
Your judgment is not slow.
Even if it should delay,
We know it won’t be late. See!
Panting on, the end draws near;
Hence patiently we wait.
2. Not much longer will it be
Until you draw your sword.
Here on earth we see, at last,
True worship now restored.
Wicked men may rant and rave
And seek to cause us harm, but
Your appointed time is here
To bare your mighty arm.
3. God Almighty, Sov’reign Lord,
Jehovah is your name.
Silence let all people keep
And learn of your great fame.
Through your Son you rule as King
In such a mighty way. Yes,
Seated on the throne, O God,
You over earth hold sway.
4. Joyfully, we raise our voice;
To you, our God, we sing.
Forth you go with Christ our Lord
Salvation now to bring.
O Majestic One above,
It’s your appointed time. So,
We await expectantly
Your victory sublime.

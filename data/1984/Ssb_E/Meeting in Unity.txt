Song 65
Meeting in Unity
(Psalm 133)
1. How pleasant to see brothers
All dwell in unity,
Who truly love each other
And work in harmony!
Jehovah’s blessing on it rests;
It’s like Mount Hermon’s dew
That fell upon Mount Zion’s slopes
And made them fresh and new.
2. Let’s meet with one another;
To fine works let’s incite,
Make public declaration
Of our hope, true and bright.
To that end let’s be diligent
For meetings to prepare
So that we may be well equipped
With others truth to share.
3. Jehovah God is faithful;
His Word is ever sure.
Let’s study it together
To make our hope secure.
And ne’er forsake assembling with
Our brotherhood so dear,
But do so all the more as we
See God’s day drawing near.

<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sl">1. Great God, there’s none above you; wholeheartedly we love you,</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sz">Jehovah, so deserving of praise.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sp">We hail your name so famous, your Word by which you let us</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sz">Now learn the things about all your ways.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sp">You show such tender feeling, yet just you prove in dealing;</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sz">You manifest such wisdom and pow’r.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sp">By Scripture we can be sure that if we keep our hearts pure,</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sz">You’ll pour out blessings on us—a show’r.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sl">2. You were the first to love us; your love through Christ does move us</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sz">To love you in return from our hearts.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sp">To sanctify your name and reveal your love, Christ came;</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sz">And eternal life he thereby imparts.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sp">No greater love had any than he who gave for many</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sz">His life, a gift at great sacrifice.</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sp">That we may never perish, his shepherding we cherish</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sz">And heed his counsel and his advice.</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sl">3. From faithful Kingdom service this world will never swerve us;</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sz">We’ll keep on telling out what is true.</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sp">In service free and willing, we would be e’er fulfilling</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sz">A love that gives to all what is due.</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sp">As we thus serve together, our love for one another</p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sz">Discloses those who follow your Son.</p>
<p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sp">His Kingdom values we take and of them proper use make;</p>
<p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sz">We long to hear his promised “Well done.”</p>

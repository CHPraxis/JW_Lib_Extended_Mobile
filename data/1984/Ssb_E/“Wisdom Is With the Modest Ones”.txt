Song 73
“Wisdom Is With the Modest Ones”
(Proverbs 11:2)
1. If we would walk with our one God,
We need to show true modesty,
Appreciate how great God is
And how so very small are we!
2. What good-for-nothing slaves we are!
As sinful men this we admit.
If we will but show modesty,
How much we then will benefit!
3. ‘Conduct yourselves as lesser ones,’
So taught our Lord by word and deed.
But should we brag or get puffed up,
Christ’s counsel we do fail to heed.
4. With fear and trembling, we should serve
Because Jehovah God we love.
To walk with him in modesty
Shows wisdom that is from above.

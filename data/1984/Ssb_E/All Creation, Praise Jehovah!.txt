Song 5
All Creation, Praise Jehovah!
(Psalm 148)
1. All creation, praise Jehovah;
Bless his matchless, precious name.
Day and night his holy angels
Joyously do him acclaim.
2. Sun and moon and starry heavens
God’s grand qualities display.
They obey his regulations;
Never will these pass away.
3. From the earth is praise ascending.
Other sheep now make their choice.
To serve God, their Grand Creator,
In his courtyards they rejoice.
4. Let a great crowd from all nations
To Jehovah’s temple stream.
He is worthy to be worshiped.
He alone is God Supreme.

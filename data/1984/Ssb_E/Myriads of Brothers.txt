Song 127
Myriads of Brothers
(Revelation 7:9)
1. Myriads on myriads of brothers
Stand at my side to be,
Each one a faithful witness,
Keeping integrity.
Myriads there are on myriads,
Truly a mighty crowd.
In all the nations of the earth,
They sing God’s praise aloud.
2. Myriads on myriads of brothers,
All clad in raiment white,
Stand in Jehovah’s temple,
Serving him day and night.
Myriads there are on myriads.
Gladly they let men know
That to Jehovah and his Lamb
They their salvation owe.
3. Myriads on myriads of brothers
—They preach both far and near
God’s everlasting good news,
Letting all peoples hear.
And as they keep on preaching,
Though sometimes they’re oppressed,
Christ to the pastures green leads them,
Where they find peace and rest.

<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sl">1. Happy are all those who the joyful shouting know,</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sz">To whom the truth you show, to whom your blessings flow.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sp">For they will ever walk in the brightness of your face;</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sz">Happiness they find as each serves in his place.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sp">(Chorus)</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sl">2. Satan and his legions are pressing all around,</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sz">So let our works abound. Make earth with praise resound.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sp">Jehovah has provided a refuge for the meek;</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sz">He will all those shield who his righteousness seek.</p>

<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sl">3. May we not lose courage, though many turn away,</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sz">Though they the truth gainsay. We’ll watch and fight and pray,</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sp">For we must stand the test and keep our integrity;</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sz">Since our God is pleased, we can serve faithfully.</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="se">(CHORUS)</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sp">Your loving-kindness, O God, you express</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sz">To all who publicly your name now confess.</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sp">With your Word and spirit, the truth they discern,</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sz">Show faith by works and act on what they learn.</p>

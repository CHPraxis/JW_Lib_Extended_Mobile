Zion’s Reason for Rejoicing
(Isaiah 66:8)
1. Jehovah has a nation;
In our day it was born.
A land was also brought forth
Where we need never mourn.
Jehovah’s heav’nly Zion
—She suddenly gave birth
To many sons, who sounded
God’s name throughout the earth.
(Chorus)
2. The birth of this new nation
Brought joy beyond compare.
It serves the Kingdom int’rests
And of God’s flock takes care.
Yes, Zion’s faithful children
Are trembling at God’s word.
They preach and teach with boldness.
By nothing they’re deterred.
(Chorus)
3. It is Jehovah’s purpose
The nations now to rock.
The choice ones of such nations
To Zion’s height do flock.
They deem it a rare priv’lege
To elevate God’s fame,
And bowing down before him,
They call upon his name.
(CHORUS)
Rejoice, exult with Zion high above!
How great for her is God Jehovah’s love!
Her sons on earth are serving as a sign,
And at Jehovah’s table they recline.

Song 173
Love—A Perfect Bond of Union
(Colossians 3:14)
1. The love of many has grown cold
In this time of the end.
But let us keep our first true love
And thus avoid that trend.
If we our God would imitate,
To all we will impart
The love our God himself displayed
That wells up from the heart.
2. A love without hypocrisy,
A love that is intense,
We really need to cultivate
And freely it dispense.
Let’s broaden out to reach the hearts
Of all our brothers true.
Thus love the ones that God does love,
And render them their due.
3. As this old system falls apart,
Our love must us unite.
The bond of union that we have
We must keep holding tight.
Affection, warm with tenderness,
Is vital for each one.
As brothers it will keep us close,
Until our work is done.
4. A fine relationship with God
Will help us to succeed
In loving others as ourselves
In this dire time of need.
So let our love be deep and strong
In all sincerity.
A perfect bond of union now
Love proves itself to be.

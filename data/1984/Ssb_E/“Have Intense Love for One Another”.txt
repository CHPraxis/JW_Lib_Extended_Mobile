Song 115
“Have Intense Love for One Another”
(1 Peter 4:8)
1. Love that is intense and pure
Helps us all things to endure
And God’s favor to secure,
Serving him aright.
Through such love our God did send
Jesus Christ, our loyal Friend,
Our relationship to mend
And with Him unite.
We who fear Jehovah God
Let our feet with love be shod
As we walk the way Christ trod,
Showing heartfelt love.
In this hateful world today,
Love intense we must display.
It is the surpassing way
—Copies God above, copies God above.
2. Love that is no mere pretense
Gives no reasons for offense,
Helps us show true deference
To our brothers dear.
It is patient, gentle, kind,
To ourselves is not confined,
Puts all grievances behind
T’ward those who God fear.
Since the end is near at hand,
How we need to understand
That our love must e’er expand
T’ward humanity!
One another we must love
With true wisdom from above.
May we copy God in love
For eternity, for eternity.

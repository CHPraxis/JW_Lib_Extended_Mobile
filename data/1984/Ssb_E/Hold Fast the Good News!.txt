Song 71
Hold Fast the Good News!
(1 Corinthians 15:2)
1. In service we must keep steadfast
As nears the final hour.
Like brothers let us labor on,
Depending on God’s pow’r.
The light of truth, how bright it shines,
And there is much to do.
Our work, indeed, is not in vain
—To us will joy accrue.
2. The resurrection hope for man
Can saddened hearts revive,
Helps them to faith unmovable.
From it they joy derive.
Believers in God’s promises
We ever want to be.
Stand firm, be strong, with steadfastness;
Press on to victory.
3. As we work hard, exert ourselves,
And strive to reach our goal,
May we seek good associates
That will upbuild the soul.
The good news fortifies our hope
Of Paradise restored.
Hence, to our God we do give thanks
Through Jesus Christ, our Lord.

Song 54
We Must Be Holy
(1 Peter 1:15, 16)
1. God has commanded that we must be holy,
Since through Christ Jesus we have been made clean.
As a cleansed people, humble and lowly,
By all observers may we thus be seen.
2. We’re set apart as Jehovah’s possession,
His holy nation and his other sheep.
By all our conduct, we make confession
That his right laws we are anxious to keep.
3. As we move forward, it’s truly impressive
How by our God we are being refined.
He gives his people truth that’s progressive,
So there’s no need to be looking behind.
4. All opportunities let us be seizing,
Growing in holiness, walking in light,
Praising Jehovah, him always pleasing.
He is the Holy One, faithful, upright.

Song 69
Godly Devotion With Contentment
(1 Timothy 6:6)
1. If we would have God’s blessing,
Contentment be possessing,
We surely need God’s Word to heed
And godliness be stressing.
Great gain is godly devotion,
Protects us from sin’s promotion.
From day to day in God’s right way,
It keeps our zeal in motion.
2. Content with God’s provision,
We make this our decision:
Serve God alone, his truth make known,
And hold the Kingdom vision.
We heed our Lord’s invitation
To walk the way of salvation.
With joy so great, we contemplate
God’s coming vindication.
3. To God we’re truly grateful,
Although the world is hateful,
For he does bless our godliness
In these last days so fateful.
Give God’s truth our full attention,
Dismissing all apprehension.
Let’s be intent to be content,
With Christian comprehension.

Song 160
Walking in Integrity
(Psalm 26:1)
1. Please, judge me, Lord, my Lord Jehovah God.
In you I trust, and in integrity Iâ€™ve trod.
Examine me, and put me to the test;
My mind and heart refine that my soul might be blest.
(Chorus)
2. I do not sit with wicked men of lies.
I hate the company of those who truth despise.
With evil men take not away my life,
My soul, with those whose hands are full of bribes and strife.
(Chorus)
3. For I have loved the dwelling of your house.
Your worship, O so pure, I daily will espouse.
And I will march around your altar grand
To make thanksgiving heard aloud throughout the land.
(CHORUS)
But as for me, determined I shall be
To walk eternally in my integrity.

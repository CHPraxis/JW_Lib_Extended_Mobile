Song 216
“Have Tender Affection”
(Romans 12:10)
1. What tender affection Jehovah God is showing
To those that now seek his face!
His mercy and goodness bring joy that’s overflowing;
In him we have a sure resting place.
2. In brotherly love we must have sincere affection
As in God’s household we serve.
Of him all our conduct should be a fine reflection
And peaceful unity thus preserve.
3. Since we as true Christians belong to one another,
Our feelings must be intense.
Due honor, respect, and concern for ev’ry brother
Will help us never to give offense.
4. To tender affection we wisely give attention,
As Jesus taught us to do.
Our goodness of heart and our loving comprehension
Bring joy for many, likewise us too.

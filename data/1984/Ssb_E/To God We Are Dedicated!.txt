To God We Are Dedicated!
(Exodus 39:30)
1. To Christ, by our God, Jehovah, we have been drawn.
He sent us his truth like beams of dawn.
Down from his heav’nly throne,
His light has clearly shone.
Our faith in him has grown,
And now we ourselves do disown.
To God we are dedicated. We’ve made the choice.
In him and his Son, we do rejoice.
2. All those who make this decision are duly trained;
As God’s ministers they are ordained.
They join their voices strong
To sing the Kingdom song,
In one united throng,
Since now to their God they belong.
By water immersion they’ve supported their vow
And preach God’s own Kingdom message now.
3. Through our dedication may God grant our request
To have a good conscience and be blest.
A joy beyond compare
Is what we now can share
—Jehovah’s name to bear.
To him we have access in pray’r.
To God we are dedicated; may we be wise
And this favored standing always prize.

Song 7
The Hope of Mankind’s Jubilee
(Leviticus 25:10)
1. Creation groans, weighed down in sin.
It seems a hopeless plight.
A sabbath day is soon to dawn.
Relief is now in sight.
2. A Jubilee of peace and rest,
To set creation free,
Christ Jesus is to usher in;
This is by God’s decree.
3. By means of Christ’s Millennial Reign,
Man’s lot God will amend.
The glorious Jubilee will bring
All bondage to an end.
4. Jehovah’s people sound aloud
This joyous hope of theirs.
With beaming eyes they look ahead
For answers to their pray’rs.

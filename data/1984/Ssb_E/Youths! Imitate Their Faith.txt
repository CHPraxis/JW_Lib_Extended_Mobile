Song 221
Youths! Imitate Their Faith
(Hebrews 6:12)
1. Young Samuel to Shiloh when weaned had to go
To serve in God’s temple, and there he did grow.
A prophet in Israel is what he became,
And as a true Naz’rite, he honored God’s name.
The high priest called Eli had sons that were bad.
Would they corrupt Samuel, who was just a lad?
No, Samuel was faithful; obedience he’d learned.
Away from Jehovah he would not be turned.
2. Young Timothy also from infancy grew
To be a fine elder; the Scriptures he knew.
He put into practice the things he was taught.
To ever be faithful he constantly sought.
In his congregation so good his repute,
He was recommended without a dispute.
He had the rare priv’lege of trav’ling with Paul;
His mission’ry service brought blessings to all.
3. Young sisters, remember the Israelite girl
Whose faith in Jehovah was like a fine pearl.
Although taken captive, her faith stayed intact;
Her zeal and devotion caused others to act.
To Naaman’s wife she did come and inform:
‘Jehovah’s true prophet a cure can perform.’
The Syrian chieftain decided to heed.
Rich blessings it brought him, this little maid’s deed.
4. Young brothers, young sisters, we urge all of you
To imitate these grand examples so true.
We have a great trust in this time of the end.
Jehovah has chosen the ones he will send.
So, all you dear young ones, come join in the fight
With all of God’s servants, who love what is right.
Let’s sound out the warning and speak of his praise
And share the reward at the end of the days.

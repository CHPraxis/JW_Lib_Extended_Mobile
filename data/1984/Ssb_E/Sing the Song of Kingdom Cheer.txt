Song 20
Sing the Song of Kingdom Cheer
(Psalm 96:1, 10)
1. Come, sing the song of Kingdom cheer,
You people of the earth.
Sing out the new song loud and clear;
Make known the Kingdom’s birth.
How comely are the feet of those
That with good news are shod!
Among the nations they disclose,
‘Salvation is by God.’
2. In this our song of Kingdom cheer,
Jehovah we acclaim.
We worship him with all due fear
And bless his holy name.
The idol gods that people serve
Are valueless to them.
But from God’s worship we’ll not swerve;
From him all truths do stem.
3. Join in the song of Kingdom cheer:
‘Jehovah now is King.’
His reigning by his Son is here;
With joy the heavens ring.
Jehovah comes to judge the earth,
And with his righteousness,
He’ll bless all those who prove their worth
Through all their faithfulness.

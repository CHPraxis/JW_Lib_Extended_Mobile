Song 195
This Is Jehovah’s Day
(Psalm 118:24)
1. This is Jehovah’s day. His rule is here to stay.
He’s laid in Zion his Chief Cornerstone.
Let all lift up the voice and thank God and rejoice,
For in Jehovah’s Kingdom we put faith alone.
(Chorus)
2. Christ now in pow’r is here, and Armageddon’s near.
Satan’s old order will soon pass away.
Fearlessly preach the Word; God’s message let be heard.
Help all the meek ones God’s commandments to obey.
(Chorus)
3. God’s reigning King we prize; he’s wondrous in our eyes.
He comes in God’s name; his rule we accept.
Enter the temple gate! God’s favor supplicate,
That we may ever in his ministry be kept.
(CHORUS)
What will you bring, Jehovah’s Kingdom?
Triumph of truth and righteousness.
And bring what else, Jehovah’s Kingdom?
Eternal life and happiness.
Praise the Universal Sov’reign
For his love and faithfulness.

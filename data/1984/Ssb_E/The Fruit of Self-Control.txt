Song 124
The Fruit of Self-Control
(Galatians 5:23)
1. O Christian, safeguard well your soul;
Be strong for truth and right.
Keep exercising self-control
That you may win the fight.
2. Just as we strive to show true love
And wisdom ev’ry day,
So we must be like God above
And self-control display.
3. The body we must keep our slave;
We dare not yield to lust.
If we would self and others save,
Control ourselves we must.
4. We must be calm when being tried
And when we’re under stress;
Stand firmly on Jehovah’s side,
And cleave to righteousness.

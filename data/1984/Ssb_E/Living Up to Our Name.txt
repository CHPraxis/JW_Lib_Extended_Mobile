Song 34
Living Up to Our Name
(Isaiah 43:10-12)
1. Glorious Jehovah, almighty, eternal,
Perfect in justice and matchless in love,
Source of all truth and of infinite wisdom,
You rule as Sov’reign in heaven above.
Myriads of angels delight in your service;
Creation’s wonders your glories proclaim.
Your favored Witnesses is what you’ve named us;
O may we ever live up to our name!
2. Help us, Jehovah, to use each occasion
Your name to honor and your sheep to feed,
Following closely in Christ Jesus’ footsteps
As his instructions we faithfully heed.
We would be careful of our daily conduct,
Lest some reproach should detract from your fame.
Being your Witnesses, great is our priv’lege;
O may we ever live up to our name!
3. As we continue in your precious service,
Working together in love and in peace,
Godly contentment is our daily portion;
Joy fills our hearts as your praises increase.
Up to our name may we ever be living;
Life-giving truth to all men we would bring;
And best of all, thereby we would bring gladness,
Joy to your heart, O Jehovah, our King!

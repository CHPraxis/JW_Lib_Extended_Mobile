Song 95
The Fruit of Goodness
(Galatians 5:22)
1. Jehovah, the Sov’reign of eternity,
Personification of goodness is he.
In mercy his Son from the heavens he sent
To lead sincere men from their sins to repent.
2. The goodness of God, how it helps men get free
From Babylon’s bondage of iniquity.
The goodness of God gives us increasing light,
That we can distinguish between wrong and right.
3. Such goodness of God we would all imitate;
This fruit of his spirit we would cultivate.
We need to be gen’rous, pure, noble, and just
And always in God and Christ Jesus to trust.
4. To grow in this goodness, just what can we do?
Engage in much study, field service, pray’r too.
Nor may we neglect with our brothers to meet
If we as to goodness would be made complete.

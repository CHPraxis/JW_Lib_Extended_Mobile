God’s Unfolding “Eternal Purpose”
(Ephesians 3:11)
1. Keep ever marching forward,
Each one in his own place.
For all his servants on the earth,
Jehovah sets the pace.
He has restored true worship
And made his words come true.
Great is the crowd that has appeared
And seeks his will to do.
2. Our Sov’reign Lord, Jehovah,
Gives us a living hope.
In mental darkness, filled with fear,
No longer do we grope.
It’s his eternal purpose
That men should live in peace.
Soon by the rule of Christ, his Son,
He will make wars to cease.
3. As God unfolds his purpose,
We must ourselves exert
And march along the road to life
And keep our minds alert.
Our God Jehovah’s purpose
Will meet with sure success.
Wisely we act and move ahead
And seek his name to bless.

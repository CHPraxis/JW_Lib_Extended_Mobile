<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sl">1. The due time has come to extend a grand welcome</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sz">To Almighty God, to whom all things belong.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sp">For he and his Son now assemble all nations,</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sz">And the heavens are resounding with a stirring battle song.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sp">So ‘lift up your heads, O you gates,’ with rejoicing;</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sz">The grand King of glory the vict’ry will gain.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sp">The time has drawn close for Jehovah of armies</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sz">To bring to all mankind Christ’s Thousand Year Reign.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sp">His pow’r he’ll display through his incoming Kingdom,</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sz">O’er earth his wide dominion extending once again.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sl">2. The great Sov’reign Lord, the Supreme One, Jehovah,</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sz">Has brought forth a Kingdom that never will end.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sp">Deserving is he of a real heartfelt welcome;</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sz">Let our great incoming King know that his cause we do defend.</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sp">O be lifted up, lofty gates! We bring good news.</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sz">Hence, great is our joy as together we sing:</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sp">‘Jehovah is strong and is mighty in battle.’</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sz">We do well to listen and gifts to him bring,</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sp">For his time has come to bless those whom he favors.</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sz">So may we cry out “Welcome!” to this incoming King.</p>

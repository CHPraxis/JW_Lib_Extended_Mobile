Song 38
Displaying Loyalty
(Psalm 18:25)
1. God Jehovah has a people
Who delight to bear his name
As a loyal congregation
Dedicated to his fame.
At its bounteous spir’tual table,
Thankfully they daily feed,
For to him they would be pleasing
In each thought and word and deed.
2. To God’s loyal congregation,
We too will show loyalty,
Give it our steadfast allegiance,
Even in adversity.
Faithfully we’ll guard its int’rests,
Never let them suffer harm;
Should we see that they are threatened,
We will quickly sound alarm.
3. Loyally we’ll help our brothers,
Whether new ones or the weak,
Both in study and in service,
With assistance kind and meek.
And as in a fam’ly circle,
We will never rouse distrust
But show that in each relation
Loyalty will be a must.
4. In this world that’s so disloyal,
Loyalty we will display
T’ward all those to whom it’s owing
As we walk the Christian way.
Satan we thus prove a liar,
But Jehovah we prove right.
Loyalty wins us his favor,
And to him it gives delight.

Song 29
Forward, You Witnesses!
(Luke 16:16)
1. Firm and determined in this time of the end,
Prepared are God’s servants the good news to defend.
Though Satan against them has vaunted,
In God’s strength they keep on undaunted.
(Chorus)
2. Justice and truth have been pushed aside by man.
The name of Jehovah the wicked seek to ban.
These must be restored to their places
By Christians with bold, beaming faces.
(Chorus)
3. Soldiers of Jah do not seek a life of ease.
The world and its rulers they do not try to please,
Unspotted at all times remaining,
Integrity always maintaining.
(CHORUS)
Then, forward, you Witnesses, ever strong of heart!
Rejoice that in God’s work you too may have a part!
Go tell far and wide God’s new order is near,
That e’er long its rich blessings will be here!

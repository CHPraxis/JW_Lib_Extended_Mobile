Song 150
The Bread From Heaven
(John 6:51)
1. Our Father in the heavens,
To time indefinite the same,
We gladly sing your praises
And sanctify your holy name.
Once, as a loving Shepherd,
How faithfully you led
Your ancient sheeplike people,
Sent manna as their bread.
You quenched their thirst with water,
Which issued forth from flinty rock.
To Canaan’s land you brought them,
A well-fed and a happy flock.
2. The manna that you fed them
Foreshadowed your beloved Son,
Who left his heav’nly glory
To save mankind that was undone.
He is the bread from heaven;
His flesh he freely gave
In sacrifice for all men
That thus he them might save.
By faith let’s be partaking
Of bread that only God can give;
Yes, daily let us eat it,
That we in purity may live.
3. This news of bread from heaven
From starving men we dare not keep,
But as we have occasion,
Use it to feed Christ’s hungry sheep.
Help others in their efforts
To seek God’s righteousness,
Help them to gain salvation
That thus God them might bless.
Then after the great battle
Of Armageddon has been fought,
We’ll sing God’s praise forever,
Rejoice in all that he has wrought.

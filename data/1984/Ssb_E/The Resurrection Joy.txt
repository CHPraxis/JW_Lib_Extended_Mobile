Song 102
The Resurrection Joy
(Revelation 20:13)
1. Lazarus lay sleeping
In a cold stone grave.
How his sisters mourned him!
None there him could save.
If his friend Christ Jesus
Had but come before,
That good man would not have
Passed through Hades’ door.
At the grave Christ Jesus
Then did give a shout,
Calling to the dead one:
‘Lazarus, come out!’
Though wrapped up in graveclothes,
Laz’rus did obey.
O what great rejoicing
Filled his friends that day!
2. Those who hoped in Jesus
Thought release was nigh,
So they felt dejected
When he had to die.
Sadly, friends of Jesus
Laid him in a tomb.
How their hearts and spirits
Were immersed in gloom!
But the gates of Hades
Could not God defy.
In three days God raised him,
Seated him on high.
With joy his disciples
Him they saw and heard.
Keys of death and Hades
On him are conferred.
3. Adam’s sin in Eden
Brought death on our race;
But return of dead ones
Shall through Christ take place.
Those in death and Hades
Will hear his own voice
And come forth in due time
In life to rejoice.
Before God’s great white throne
They’ll be judged aright
By the deeds committed
In the Kingdom’s light.
Those whose names are written
In God’s book of life
Will live on his new earth
Ever free from strife.

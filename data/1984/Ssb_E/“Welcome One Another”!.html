<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="st"><strong>“Welcome One Another”!</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="st">(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:15:7-45:15:7" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Romans 15:7</a>)</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sl">1. O welcome one another as Christ Jesus welcomed you!</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sz">Since Christ died for your brother, surely he is welcome too.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sp">So let those who are strong, mature, support those who are weak,</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sz">Help them to make their hope secure as righteousness they seek.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sp">For things aforetime written by God’s prophets long ago</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sz">Can through our firm endurance cause our comfort, hope to grow.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sp">Then let us always try to please not just ourselves alone</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sz">But view our brother’s interests as though they were our own.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sl">2. Jehovah God is gath’ring men who will learn war no more.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sz">The time has come for his dear Son peace earth wide to restore.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sp">From ev’ry nation, tribe, and tongue, all sorts of men he draws,</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sz">And in their hearts and minds, he plants delight to keep his laws.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sp">With glory to our God in view, a welcome we extend</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sz">To all, without distinction, and all sorts of men befriend.</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sp">To copy God’s largeheartedness it is our priv’lege grand.</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sz">As imitators of his Son, we should our hearts expand.</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sl">3. So let us urge all peoples that they too laud Jah our King,</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sz">Rejoicing with his nation and, as one, his praises sing.</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sp">To that end we must e’er proclaim, in homes and on the street,</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sz">The good news of Jehovah’s fame to all whom we may meet.</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sp">This honor thus to sing God’s praise will never come again.</p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sz">These truly are the final days for all unrighteous men.</p>
<p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sp">So let us love our brothers, always letting God be true;</p>
<p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sz">Yes, welcome one another, as God’s Word tells us to do.</p>
<p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sb"></p>

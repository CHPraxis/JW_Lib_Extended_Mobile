Song 218
With Christ in Paradise
(Luke 23:43)
1. ‘With me in Paradise you’ll be,’
Christ said to one hung on a tree.
This promise to one who had erred
Has caused us to be stirred
To faith in God’s own Word.
It gives the resurrection hope,
For God with death can fully cope.
His Kingdom truth we now discern.
In Bible light we learn
How we God’s favor earn.
2. The glorious hope of Paradise
The great crowd has before their eyes.
No longer do they live in fear.
God’s Word is O so clear!
And to it they adhere.
To God our prayers we humbly raise
That we may serve him all our days
And praise him everlastingly,
In faithful constancy,
With heartfelt ecstasy.
3. These other sheep who win the prize
Will be with Christ in Paradise.
These now have come to understand
God’s wonders O so grand,
From his own gracious hand!
Good news they’ll preach in all the earth
And fill men’s hearts with joy and mirth.
This is the course that’s truly wise;
Thus, life they’ll realize,
With Christ, in Paradise.

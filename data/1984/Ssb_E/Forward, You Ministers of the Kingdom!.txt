Song 43
Forward, You Ministers of the Kingdom!
(2 Timothy 4:5)
1. Go forward in preaching the Kingdom
To people of ev’ry land.
With love in our hearts for our neighbor,
Help meek ones to take their stand.
To glorify our sacred service,
We must consider how we dress.
Our ministry is very precious;
Jehovah we e’er seek to bless.
(Chorus)
2. New ministers, keep stretching forward,
With God’s prize of life in view.
Forgetting the things you’ve abandoned,
From God’s Word your strength renew.
And as clean bearers of God’s message,
From this world diff’rent may you be.
Befitting it is for God’s servants
From ways of the old world to flee.
(Chorus)
3. Together we press ever forward,
God’s remnant and other sheep.
The old and the young, men and women,
In step with the truth do keep.
We have a ministry so sacred
That we desire to dignify.
To lovers of truth, it brings comfort
And honors our God, the Most High.
(CHORUS)
Forward going,
Preach the Kingdom message ever far and wide.
Forward moving,
Keeping ever loyal on Jehovah’s side.

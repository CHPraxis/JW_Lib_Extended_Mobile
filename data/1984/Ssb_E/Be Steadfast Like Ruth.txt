Song 120
Be Steadfast Like Ruth
(Ruth 1:15-17)
1. Naomi encouraged Ruth to leave,
Even though the parting would her grieve.
But to Moab Ruth just won’t return,
Since her heart for Naomi does yearn.
2. ‘No, I never will abandon you.
Where you will be, there I would be too.
And where you lie down, there I would lie.
And where you die, there please let me die.
3. ‘For your people shall my people be,
And your God my God eternally.
May our God do so and add thereto
Should aught separate my soul from you.’
4. O what faith and love fair Ruth displayed!
She a noble pattern for us made.
May we ever show like steadfastness.
Firmly cleave to God and righteousness.

<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sl">1. God has commanded that we must be holy,</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sz">Since through Christ Jesus we have been made clean.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sp">As a cleansed people, humble and lowly,</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sz">By all observers may we thus be seen.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sl">2. We’re set apart as Jehovah’s possession,</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sz">His holy nation and his other sheep.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sp">By all our conduct, we make confession</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sz">That his right laws we are anxious to keep.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sl">3. As we move forward, it’s truly impressive</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sz">How by our God we are being refined.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sp">He gives his people truth that’s progressive,</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sz">So there’s no need to be looking behind.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sl">4. All opportunities let us be seizing,</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sz">Growing in holiness, walking in light,</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sp">Praising Jehovah, him always pleasing.</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sz">He is the Holy One, faithful, upright.</p>

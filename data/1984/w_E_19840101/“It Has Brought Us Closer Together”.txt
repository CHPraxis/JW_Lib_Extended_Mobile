“It Has Brought Us Closer Together”
That is what a wife wrote regarding the book You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth. “I’ve read quite a bit,” she said, “but never have I enjoyed a publication as much as this one. After my husband has breakfast and leaves, I get my book and read for an hour. It’s great! My husband comes home for lunch, waiting to know what new things I’ve read. It has brought us closer together!”

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">That is what a wife wrote regarding the book <em>You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth. </em>“I’ve read quite a bit,” she said, “but never have I enjoyed a publication as much as this one. After my husband has breakfast and leaves, I get my book and read for an hour. It’s great! My husband comes home for lunch, waiting to know what new things I’ve read. It has brought us closer together!”</p>

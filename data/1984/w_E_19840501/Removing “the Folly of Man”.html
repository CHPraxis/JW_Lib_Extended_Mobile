<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Former U.S. Secretary of State Dean Rusk was quoted recently as saying: “Before we pollute the wondrous heavens with the folly of man, surely we should put our heads together to try to find some way to avoid this dismal prospect.” But can humans solve the problem? Actually we today are witnessing the fulfillment of Jesus’ prophecy of “signs in sun and moon and stars, and on the earth anguish of nations,” showing “that the kingdom of God is near.” That Kingdom alone will remove “the folly of man.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:21:25-42:21:25" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Luke 21:25,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:21:31-42:21:31" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 31;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:2:44-27:2:44" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> Daniel 2:44</a>.</p>

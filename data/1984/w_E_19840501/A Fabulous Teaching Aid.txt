A Fabulous Teaching Aid
The cassette recordings of My Book of Bible Stories are just that. A grandmother from California, U.S.A., writes:
“When the fabulous tapes came out, my daughter allowed her son Michael to play them on their tape recorder. Michael is now four years old and he knows not just one story but many stories by heart. I am sending with this letter a tape of some of the stories he knows. He pronounces very clearly and correctly words such as Israelites, Philistines, Samson, Delilah, Dagon, Jezebel, Naboth, Othniel, Ehud, Shamgar, Sisera, Barak and many others.
“Michael said he would tell me the story of Samson and Delilah, so when I was looking for the story in My Book of Bible Stories, he said: ‘Samson was a judge, and the judges come before the kings.’ I was amazed. At age 4 he knows the stories of the Bible and where to find them better than I do. My son-in-law Karl told me: ‘Never underestimate the power of these tapes.’”

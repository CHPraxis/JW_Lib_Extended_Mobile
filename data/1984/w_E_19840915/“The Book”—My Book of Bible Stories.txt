“The Book”​—My Book of Bible Stories
A letter from Belize, Central America, reports: “In one village, Otoxha, a little boy ran to us, spied into one of our briefcases, reached in and pulled out what he called ‘THE book.’ After making sure that is was THE book (My Book of Bible Stories), he pulled  out a little pouch filled with small change. For months he had been saving coins in keen anticipation of the one day out of the year that Jehovah’s Witnesses visit his village.”
The letter continues: “One of the most stirring scene in our minds was when the only English-speaking male in the village sat on the dirt floor of the cabildo (community guest house) and translated the Bible Stories book into Kekchi while the other men sat in a circle around him, soaking in every word and intently inspecting the beautiful illustrations.”

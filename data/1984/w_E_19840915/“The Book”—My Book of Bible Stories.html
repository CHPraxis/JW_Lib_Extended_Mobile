<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A letter from Belize, Central America, reports: “In one village, Otoxha, a little boy ran to us, spied into one of our briefcases, reached in and pulled out what he called ‘THE book.’ After making sure that is was THE book (<em>My Book of Bible Stories</em>), he pulled  out a little pouch filled with small change. For months he had been saving coins in keen anticipation of the one day out of the year that Jehovah’s Witnesses visit his village.”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The letter continues: “One of the most stirring scene in our minds was when the only English-speaking male in the village sat on the dirt floor of the <em>cabildo </em>(community guest house) and translated the <em>Bible Stories </em>book into Kekchi while the other men sat in a circle around him, soaking in every word and intently inspecting the beautiful illustrations.”</p>

Centennial Annual Meeting
This historic meeting of the members of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania promises to be one of the outstanding theocratic events of 1984. It will be held in the city where the Society was first incorporated, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on Saturday, October 6, from 10:00 a.m. to 12:00 noon, to be followed by a further program from 2:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. Jehovah’s Witnesses around the earth have been showing great interest in this meeting. Hence, we are happy to announce that the Society has been successful in engaging larger facilities for this important event. The Annual Meeting location has been changed to Three Rivers Stadium, 420 Stadium Circle, Pittsburgh. Since the stadium has seating for 60,000, invitations to attend are being sent to many congregations within a convenient radius of Pittsburgh. Assembly halls in the United States and Canada will be tied in, as already planned. Admission at all locations, including Pittsburgh, will be by previously assigned ticket only. A rich spiritual feast is anticipated.

Honey Heals
A letter to the editor of JAMA (The Journal of the American Medical Association) from Dr. Robert Blomfield of Chelsea, London, in the British Isles, presented this unusual report about honey: “I have been using pure natural honey for the past few months in the accident and emergency departments where I work, and I have found that, applied every two or three days under a dry dressing, it promotes the healing of ulcers and burns better than any other local applications I’ve used before.”
Dr. Blomfield continued that “it can also readily be applied to any other surface wounds, including cuts and abrasions, and I can recommend it to all doctors as a very inexpensive and valuable cleansing and healing agent. It even has a delicious taste!”

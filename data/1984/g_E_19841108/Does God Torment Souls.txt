Does God Torment Souls?
Religions have long taught that the souls of the wicked are tormented in a fiery hell. But what does the Bible teach?
Learn what hell is and what the Bible says about the condition of the dead. Read the chapters “What Happens to Us When We Die” and “God Does Not Torment Souls” in the book Good News​—To Make You Happy. Hardbound, 192 pages.
Please send, postpaid, the book Good News​—To Make You Happy. I enclose $1 (U.S.). (For price in other countries, please contact local Watch Tower Society office.)

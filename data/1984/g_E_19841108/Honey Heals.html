<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A letter to the editor of <em>JAMA </em>(<em>The Journal of the American Medical Association</em>) from Dr. Robert Blomfield of Chelsea, London, in the British Isles, presented this unusual report about honey: “I have been using pure natural honey for the past few months in the accident and emergency departments where I work, and I have found that, applied every two or three days under a dry dressing, it promotes the healing of ulcers and burns better than any other local applications I’ve used before.”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Dr. Blomfield continued that “it can also readily be applied to any other surface wounds, including cuts and abrasions, and I can recommend it to all doctors as a very inexpensive and valuable cleansing and healing agent. It even has a delicious taste!”</p>

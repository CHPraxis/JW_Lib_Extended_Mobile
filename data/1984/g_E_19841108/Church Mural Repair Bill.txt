Church Mural Repair Bill
Centuries ago the church in Telscombe in southern England had its wall paintings repaired. As usual, the murals featured some unscriptural and false doctrines. However, the ancient bill presented to the church officials itemizing the work done is rather interesting.
“To renovating heaven and adjusting the stars; washing servant of the high priest and putting carmine on his cheeks; and brightening up the flames of hell, putting a new tail on the devil and doing odd jobs for the damned, and correcting the Ten Commandments.”
And how much did all of this cost? A whopping $23!

Gestapo Persecution Overcome!
Read the thrilling account of how God protected his people in the face of determined opposition from the Gestapo! The efforts of the Nazis to stop Kingdom preaching in Belgium failed.
Send for your copy of the 1984 Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
Included in the Yearbook is a report about Alaska and the Yukon, telling how the Witnesses endure cold, snow and ice to reach people with the good news. A further account deals with Fiji and neighboring islands. It tells the remarkable story of how the Kingdom work was opened up in many of the remote islands of the South Pacific.
Please send me, postpaid, the 1984 Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses; I enclose $1 (U.S.).

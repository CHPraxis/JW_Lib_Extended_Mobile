‘Selling Souls’
According to the Swedish newspaper Stockholms Tidningen, during the last few decades a certain company in Sweden has thoroughly studied church registers, state archives, records of court proceedings, and so forth, to collect as many names of deceased people as possible, about 15 million, some dating back to the 16th century. The records holding such names have been microfilmed and the films sold to the Mormons in the United States. To help the deceased generations, and especially their own forefathers, to get saved, the Mormons get baptized on behalf of the dead ones. The Swedish company involved, called Recolid, is said to have made nearly a million dollars by this productive ‘selling of souls.’

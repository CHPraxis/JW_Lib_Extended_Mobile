<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>As this world’s system of things totters toward its destruction, all of us are affected by its instability. The Society, too, is affected by the rising costs of shipping, of paper and of other supplies. Therefore, it has become necessary to increase the prices on a number of the Society’s publications.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>Beginning September 1, 1984, the new prices listed below will go into effect. After that date, please have the new prices in mind when ordering or placing these items.</p>

<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>After receipt of your September 1 Literature Inventory form (S-18), your literature account will be charged an amount equal to the increase in value of the literature you have on hand. This charge, which will appear on one of your monthly statements shortly thereafter, will not create a deficit in your account, as it is offset by the increased value of literature you have on hand. When completing the September 1 Literature Inventory form, please calculate the value of literature on hand at the prices listed on the form. DO NOT write in price changes or alter the form in any way.</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>Beginning with the September 1984 issues, the price of distributors’ magazines to the congregation and public will increase from 15¢ to 20¢ each. The price to pioneers will increase from 5¢ to 10¢. The September 1 and September 8 issues should be charged and placed at the new rates, even though received and distributed in August. There will be no change in the requesting of pioneer credit for magazines, as the amount of credit per magazine remains the same.</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>The above price increases will help the Society meet the higher production and shipping costs for these items and still make it possible for interested persons to receive the publications for a small contribution.</p>

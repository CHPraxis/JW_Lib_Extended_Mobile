Looking Ahead to the December Campaign With the Bible
The Society is preparing a 1984 edition of the bi12 (regular-size) Bible in English with marginal references for use in the December Bible campaign. In addition to placing it in the field, no doubt publishers would like to have a copy of this edition for their own use. Having this in mind, congregations may place their orders beginning SeptemberÂ 1, 1984. No more of the 1981 edition Bible will be sent to congregations. Congregations that have a stock of Bibles with either black or green covers should endeavor to move them off their shelves before the new stock is received. If you have an excess stock of any of these Bibles, please contact nearby congregations who may be in need of Bibles and arrange a transfer of some of your stock to them.
The cost for the various Bibles will be as follows:
1971 edition in English (green cover) (Congregation and public: $2.50; pioneers: $1.25)
1981 edition (black cover) (Congregation and public: $3.00; pioneers: $1.50)
1984 edition (Congregation and public: $3.50; pioneers: $1.75)

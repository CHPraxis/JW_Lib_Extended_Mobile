<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">THE Kingdom unity of Jehovah’s Witnesses​—how it contrasts with the disunity of this old world! Although Jehovah’s people are over 2,650,000 strong in more than 200 lands, they are united in sacred service to God under the Fine Shepherd, Jesus Christ. True, the Witnesses speak many tongues. But they have in common the “pure language” that enables them to serve Jehovah God unitedly “shoulder to shoulder.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/36:3:9-36:3:9" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Zephaniah 3:9</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Bearing eloquent testimony to the oneness of Jehovah’s people were the four-day “Kingdom Unity” District Conventions. At these, the theme of Kingdom unity was highlighted in at least four ways: (1) A number of talks developed the theme of Kingdom unity; (2) certain program features, such as the baptism talk and the Bible dramas, stressed unity; (3) reports by missionaries underscored this theme; and (4) most conventions were linked with key cities by telephone hookups for some talks given by members of the Governing Body of Jehovah’s Witnesses. For instance, during July 7-10, 1983, by these hookups 48 conventions were tied together in the contiguous United States, Canada, Bermuda and Hawaii​—a superb display of Kingdom unity!</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Never before has the Watch Tower Society received such an avalanche of letters regarding a convention. Both young and old have found the program heartwarming and faith strengthening and have made such comments as these: “The counsel was plain and clear, just what was needed.” ‘A banquet of well-oiled dishes.’ “Thank you for encouraging us to draw close to our heavenly Father and be united in pure worship.” More often than ever before, conventioners could be heard to exclaim: ‘The best yet!’</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="ss"><strong>Fellow Workers for the Kingdom of God</strong></p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">From the first day, bearing the above theme, it was evident that appreciative remarks truly were warranted. During the opening talk, all those assembled were urged to listen attentively, get <span id="page26" class="pageNum" data-no="26" data-before-text="26"></span>the sense of what they heard and apply the counsel. The chairman’s talk, “We Are Guests of Jehovah, the God of Unity,” highlighted the need to show deep appreciation for all the spiritual food provided at the convention. To be God’s guests we must, among other things, keep our word and never say or do anything that would reflect unfavorably on our fellow believers. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:15:0-19:15:5" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Psalm 15</a>) During the feature “Some Longtime Guests Testify,” how thrilling it was to hear from some who had been Jehovah’s ‘guests’ for 60 years or more! They surely could testify that God blesses and sustains his people.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Next, Jehovah’s servants were urged to “Keep On Preaching the Kingdom.” Among the compelling reasons are these: Kingdom-preaching is part of the “sign” Jesus gave, people are being judged on the basis of their response to the message, and unless we keep preaching we ourselves will lose sight of the Kingdom issue. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:3-40:24:3" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matthew 24:3,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:14-40:24:14" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 14</a>) A later series of demonstrations showed how we can effectively deal with questions often encountered in the ministry. Then it was a pleasant surprise to receive <em>Kingdom News </em>No. 32, entitled “A United, Happy Family. What Is the Key?” Conventioners eagerly obtained supplies, used by many in the field service that very afternoon.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Particularly outstanding was the announcement made during the talk “Music That Praises Jehovah.” The Society is preparing a new songbook, to be ready in the near future! Especially was this appreciated because 17 years had passed since Jehovah’s Witnesses received their last one. Guitar notations will appear with the 225 songs in the new book, and it will be published in a large as well as a small edition. Three groups of melodies were played as samples, and all music heard before each morning and afternoon session will be found in the new songbook.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="ss"><strong>Fitly United in the Same Line of Thought</strong></p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">The second convention day had that theme and focused attention on our congregational responsibilities and family obligations. The talk “Unitedly Imitating Devoted Overseers” emphasized the need to imitate the strong faith, unselfish love and burning zeal manifested by fine elders. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/53:3:7-53:3:9" data-bid="4-1" class="b">2 Thessalonians 3:7-9</a>) In another talk ministerial servants were impressed with the fact that they must meet exacting requirements. Congregations function more smoothly when these men serve humbly in a fine manner, giving all credit to Jehovah God.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">The talk “Our Supportive Role in the Congregation” made it evident that the <span id="page27" class="pageNum" data-no="27" data-before-text="27"></span>spirit of the congregation is what we make it. So how can we be supportive? Why, by such actions as upholding the elders’ judicial actions, maintaining the Kingdom Hall and sharing fully in the witnessing work! As an aid in our ministry, how well we will be able to use the new release! Yes, indeed, <em>Good News for All Nations, </em>a booklet containing a witness in 59 languages, will be a boon to our Kingdom-preaching work.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">Then came the drama “Maintaining Family Unity.” It touched the hearts of all, bringing forth tears in many cases. How effectively this drama showed the need for close communication between parents and their children! Were we not impressed with the need for parents to understand how their children think and feel about matters?</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">What fine admonition there was in the talk “Encourage One Another as the Day Draws Near”! Let us never yield to the Devil, who tries to discourage us so that we will quit. All of us should work at encouraging one another. We can impart joy and comfort by making thoughtful, encouraging comments, either in person, by telephone or through letters.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">In these days, the family is being attacked by the Devil and his world. Very helpful, then, were three talks on the family. The first pointed out that husbands, wives and children should study together, sit together at the Kingdom Hall and share in the field ministry together. In the second talk, parents were impressed with the need for a home atmosphere of faith and love. Yes, and in their children’s early life, godly parents should begin setting before them such fine goals as Bethel and missionary service. In the third talk, “Youths, Uphold Christian Principles in School,” our young people were encouraged to let others know that they are Jehovah’s Witnesses and upholders of Bible principles. It was made clear that worldly religious holidays are not for Christian youths, nor are time-consuming extracurricular activities.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">The talk “How Jehovah Has Kept Us United” stressed the role that ever-increasing spiritual light has played in unifying Jehovah’s people. In most lands two older brothers were interviewed. They were able to point to ways that Jehovah has safeguarded his people in the face of persecution and has kept them spiritually clean and united through the years. It may be added that in the United States and Canada this part of the program featured a new provision, the Society Kingdom Hall Fund. At the end of this talk a resolution was presented and enthusiastically <span id="page28" class="pageNum" data-no="28" data-before-text="28"></span>adopted. In this “Declaration of Unity,” Jehovah’s Witnesses resolved to remain united, maintain fine conduct and keep making known the good news of God’s Kingdom.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">The keynote address, “Kingdom Unity a Reality Today,” contrasted the disunity of Satan’s world with the grand unity of Jehovah’s people. At the conclusion of this talk, the beautiful brochure <em>School and Jehovah’s Witnesses </em>was released. Containing a thorough discussion of questions that may arise in school because we are Witnesses, it promises to be a great aid and blessing.</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">The closing talk of the day minced no words in dealing with a trap in which some of God’s people have let themselves be caught. This talk, entitled “Beware of Greediness in a Materialistic World,” spelled out the dangers of greed and showed that some individuals have been disfellowshipped for dishonesty that has brought financial harm to others.</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="ss"><strong>Observing the Oneness of the Spirit</strong></p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">This was the theme for the third day. One way to observe the oneness of the spirit is by acting in harmony with the talk “Carry On Prayer for One Another.” For instance, we can pray that those directing the work may be granted wisdom and that God’s spirit will uphold our persecuted brothers and sisters. Are we not drawn into greater unity by praying for one another and by realizing that fellow believers pray for us?</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">Searching questions were asked in the talk “Are You Building Your Future With God’s Organization?” It was made very clear that this world has no future. Indeed, the best way to build for the future is by full-time ministerial activity, as it helps to equip us well for service in the new system of things. Naturally, looking to the future also involves “Setting and Reaching Proper Goals.” In this talk it was shown that we can fittingly set short-range goals involving study, participation in meetings, field service, and so forth. Of course, a long-range goal for which to strive is everlasting life. The heartwarming baptism talk that concluded the morning session had special meaning for those who had reached the goal of dedication to Jehovah God.</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">“Are You Tolerating Secret Faults?” How this talk made us think! It forcefully showed that whether we are observed by humans or not, God sees us and rewards faithfulness. Particularly dealt with were the secret faults of <span id="page29" class="pageNum" data-no="29" data-before-text="29"></span>masturbation, excessive use of alcohol and yielding to pressure in the matter of blood transfusion on being assured that this sin would be kept secret. But all such tolerating of secret faults results in a bad conscience and Jehovah’s disfavor.</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">“How Different Are We From the World?” was a hard-hitting talk that elicited many favorable comments. Jehovah’s Witnesses definitely must differ from the world, for it is under the control of Satan and the demons! But what are some ways in which we must be different? Why, in our view of worldly education and of making a lot of money, in our choice of recreation and in the way we groom ourselves! Significant, indeed, is the disciple James’ warning that our merely <em>wanting </em>to be friends of the world makes us enemies of God.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:4:4-59:4:4" data-bid="5-1" class="b">James 4:4</a>.</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">Another highlight was “Gilead School​—Its Accomplishments (1943-1983).” This talk, marking Gilead’s 40th anniversary, revealed that the majority of the school’s more than 6,000 students have been sent abroad to over a hundred lands. Such missionaries were the first Witnesses to preach the Kingdom message in some of these countries. It was most enjoyable to hear the experiences of missionaries, proving that this service protects one, promotes love of people and is truly satisfying.</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">One talk sent over the telephone hookup was “The Fine Shepherd and His Two Folds.” It clarified the point that <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:10:1-43:10:6" data-bid="6-1" class="b">John 10:1-6</a> refers to the Law covenant fold, whereas <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:10:7-43:10:16" data-bid="7-1" class="b">John 10:7-16</a> pertains to the new covenant fold. Particularly since 1935 have the “other sheep” been joyfully serving with those in the new covenant fold as one flock under the “fine shepherd,” Jesus Christ.</p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">Another hookup talk was “United in Worship of the Only True God.” During this part of the program, conventioners were overjoyed at the release of a book bearing the same title. Prepared chiefly <span id="page30" class="pageNum" data-no="30" data-before-text="30"></span>for congregational use and as a second study book for those recently baptized or approaching baptism, it deals with such unifying factors as God’s Word, “the faithful and discreet slave,” and the united worship of Jehovah.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:45-40:24:47" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Matthew 24:45-47</a>.</p>
<p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="ss"><strong>Glorifying God With One Accord</strong></p>
<p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb">How well this fourth-day theme suited the objective of the “Kingdom Unity” District Convention! Thought-provoking, indeed, was the talk “The Challenge of Maturity​—Are You Meeting It?” Clearly, it showed that if we are mature we will be active in teaching others and will diligently apply the full range of Bible truth in our life. Highly appreciated, too, was the talk “Blessings of Kingdom Unity Foretold.” This consideration of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:32:1-23:32:20" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Isaiah chapter 32</a> was followed by the release of <em>Kingdom Melodies </em>No. 4, a cassette consisting solely of some delightful music that will appear in the new songbook.</p>
<p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sb">The unity theme continued as conventioners enjoyed the Bible drama “Unitedly Getting God’s Work Done Despite Opposition.” In spite of intense opposition, Nehemiah and fellow Jews courageously rebuilt Jerusalem’s walls. Similarly, opposers have not succeeded in stopping the work of Jehovah’s Witnesses in our time.</p>
<p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="sb">The public talk “Who Are United in This Strife-Torn World?” left no doubt that Jehovah’s Witnesses alone are united today. Replete with pertinent scriptures, striking quotations and sound argumentation, this convincing <span id="page31" class="pageNum" data-no="31" data-before-text="31"></span>presentation doubtless was another reason why many felt that this was the best convention yet.</p>
<p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="sb">Very warm counsel followed as Jehovah’s people were urged to “Have Intense Love for One Another”​—something indispensable if we individually are to make it into the New Order. Moreover, Kingdom unity must prevail as emphasized in the final talk, “In Unison Keep Crying Out Joyfully.”</p>
<p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="ss"><strong>Fruitage of Kingdom Unity</strong></p>
<p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="sb">Doubtless you realize why so many consider the “Kingdom Unity” convention the best yet. But just how effective was the program?</p>
<p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="sb">Well, one youth had made plans to go to a university, but he changed his mind after hearing the talk about building your future with Jehovah’s organization. The young man now intends to make full-time preaching as a pioneer his career.</p>
<p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="sb">Two Christian elders said that this convention program gave them the impetus needed to make the final decision to sell their homes and businesses and make themselves available for greater privileges of service. And one elderly overseer has found greater joy in life because he now is more alert to seize opportunities to offer encouragement.</p>
<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="sb">This rewarding convention has truly furthered our understanding and appreciation of Kingdom unity. Such unity was manifested by the activities of Jehovah’s people during the four days of happy assembly. Now, may all of us give convincing evidence that we are unified in this divided and dying world. With one accord, may all of Jehovah’s loyal witnesses continue to glorify the incomparable God of Kingdom unity.</p>

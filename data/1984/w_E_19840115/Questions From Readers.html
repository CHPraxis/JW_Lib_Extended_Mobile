<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"><strong>■ Is there any Scriptural reason why Jehovah’s Witnesses should not accept blood substitutes or “artificial blood”?</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">It is well known that for religious reasons Jehovah’s Witnesses do not accept blood transfusions. Since Noah’s time true worshipers have refused to eat blood. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:9:3-1:9:4" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Genesis 9:3, 4</a>) Blood removed from a creature was to be disposed of; it was not to be stored. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:12:22-5:12:25" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 12:22-25</a>) Christians are commanded to ‘abstain from blood.’ So Jehovah’s Witnesses do not accept transfusions of donor blood; nor do they permit their own blood to be withdrawn, stored and later transfused back into their veins.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:15:28-44:15:29" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Acts 15:28, 29</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">However, Jehovah’s Witnesses have no religious objection to replacing lost blood with nonblood solutions. Some of these more commonly used are saline solution, Ringer’s lactate, dextran and Hespan.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Doctors recognize that such plasma-volume expanders have advantages, a major one being that these do not expose the patient to the numerous diseases and other risks of blood transfusions. Furthermore, evidence shows that most patients can accommodate a much lower blood count than once was thought possible.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">In recent years there has been experimentation with a fluorinated blood substitute (so-called artificial blood) that seems to be able to transport oxygen to body cells. There is a calculated risk in using this until such time as it has been fully tested. But it is not made from blood and so its use would not conflict with a Christian’s Bible-trained conscience.</p>

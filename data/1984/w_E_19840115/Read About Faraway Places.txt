Read About Faraway Places
You can do so in the 1984 Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses. Read the remarkable story of the opening up of Kingdom preaching in the South Pacific islands of Fiji, Tonga, Tahiti, New Caledonia and Samoa. Learn how courageous Kingdom proclaimers endured cold, snow and ice to reach people in Alaska and the Yukon with the good news. Regarding the Yearbook of last year a reader wrote:
“It enabled me to travel to faraway places on the earth and associate with fellow Christians, experiencing with them in a small way their persecutions and blessings. . . . I read the report with mixed emotions, sorrowing with them during trouble, and rejoicing with them when Jehovah’s blessing was richly upon them.”

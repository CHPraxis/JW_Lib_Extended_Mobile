A mother from Italy writes regarding My Book of Bible Stories:
“My eight-year-old son, Emanuele, took his copy of the book to school to show the teacher. She was very struck by its contents and said: ‘I am going to keep this book.’ That same morning she read the account of the Ten Plagues to the class and the children laughed about the frogs getting into the houses, and they liked the picture. Then, for homework, the class had to write a brief version of what had been read.
“Emanuele and I were quite surprised because this teacher is a fervent Catholic and is opposed to Jehovah’s Witnesses. A few days afterward she showed the book to the priest who comes to teach religion, asking him whether she should continue to read it to the children since it is published by Jehovah’s Witnesses. After leafing through the book, the priest said it was very nice and really suitable for children. He told the teacher she could continue to use it in her lessons. So, almost every day the teacher reads the children a story and then has them write about it or discuss it orally.”

The “Kingdom Increase” District Conventions
JEHOVAH GOD has truly blessed the worldwide work of Kingdom preaching. How evident this is from the thrilling report appearing in the 1984 Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses! And how appropriate, then, is the theme of the 1984 district conventions—”Kingdom Increase”!
The past service year saw an increase of 6.8 percent in the average number of publishers of the good news. There were increases in total hours spent in preaching, total return visits made and the average number of home Bible studies, as well as a striking increase in the number of auxiliary and regular pioneers. The Memorial attendance rose to 6,767,707. That is 8.2 percent higher than the previous year! Indeed, the activity of God’s people has moved ahead on all fronts, and this calls to mind the prophetic words about Jehovah’s King: “Of the increase of his government and peace there will be no end.”​—Isaiah 9:7, New International Version.
What a contrast this is to what is being experienced in Christendom’s churches! Not only is church attendance dwindling in many places but there is also a deadly lack of life-giving spiritual food and a growing laxity in adherence to godly rules of conduct.
But shall we as Jehovah’s Witnesses rest on our laurels and take it easy? Far from it! Rather, we are determined to do our utmost to increase the Kingdom interests. To that end, a most upbuilding spiritual feast is being prepared for us at the forthcoming district conventions. The fine program will begin on Thursday afternoon and will continue through Sunday afternoon. Check the following list of convention locations and dates, and make plans now to be present from the very beginning to the very end.

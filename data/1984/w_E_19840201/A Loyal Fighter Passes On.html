<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><em>THE WATCHTOWER </em>of September 1, 1983, in the article entitled “Moving Ahead With God’s Organization,” carried the life story of a valiant fighter for Jehovah’s Kingdom​—Grant Suiter. At the conclusion of this article it was stated that Brother Suiter had suffered a critical injury to his spine. This was on May 30. Though he was almost completely paralyzed, Brother Suiter fought to keep alive for almost six months. Severely handicapped as he was, and without the power of speech, he continued to show great interest in the forward movement of Jehovah’s organization on earth, for which he had served as corporate secretary-treasurer for 36 years. However, he finished his earthly course the morning of November 22, and announcement of this was made to the Bethel family at Brooklyn and Watchtower Farms following morning worship and breakfast that morning.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">On Wednesday evening, November 23, a memorial service was held at the Brooklyn Bethel Kingdom Hall, being relayed by closed-circuit television to the dining rooms and by telephone tie-in to Watchtower Farms. Thus most of the Bethel family of 3,123 members, including Gilead students, and also many guests, were able to hear talks by several family members. These were not eulogies. Rather they encouraged all present to profit by the loyal life course of Brother Suiter, who had indeed proved to be a ‘big tree of righteousness’ and a conqueror in fighting for Kingdom interests.

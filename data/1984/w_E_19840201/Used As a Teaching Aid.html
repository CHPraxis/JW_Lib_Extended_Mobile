<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A high school student who gave her health class teacher the book <em>Your Youth​—Getting the Best out of It </em>reports:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“She took it home and read it in its entirety that night. The next day she asked if she could have 50 more books for the class, but that their use would have to be approved by the school board.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“It was not until the next semester that I was able to discuss the subject with her again. I asked if she still wanted the books. She said yes, and would take 15 for starters. She uses them with a youth group in Freemont, Michigan, as well as with a child abuse center.”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Later the teacher wrote: “Thank you for sharing the book <em>Your Youth </em>with me. The guidelines in it are Biblical and true. Our world would be a better place to live in if everyone followed the path so clearly defined in the Bible.”</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Included in this publication’s 24 chapters are: “Your Clothes and Appearance Talk​—About <em>You,” </em>“Why Study in School?” “Should You Drink Alcoholic Beverages?” “The Music and Dancing You Choose,” “Does Sexual Morality Make Sense?” and “Dating and Courtship.” You can obtain this fine aid for successful living by simply filling in and mailing the accompanying coupon along with a remittance of only 75 cents.</p>

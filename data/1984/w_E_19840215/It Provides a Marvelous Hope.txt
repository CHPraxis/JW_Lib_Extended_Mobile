It Provides a Marvelous Hope
A man who had three young children died a little over a year ago in the Sloan-Kettering cancer hospital in New York City. The minister conducting the memorial service explained in his talk that just hours before he died the man had his wife hold the book You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth up in front of him so he could again read the part about the hope of the resurrection. At the end of the service the minister said that the congregation of Jehovah’s Witnesses desired that members of the man’s family have a copy of the book that gave their relative such strong hope. A number, including the local undertaker, eagerly came forward and asked for a copy. A total of 20 books were placed with those in attendance.

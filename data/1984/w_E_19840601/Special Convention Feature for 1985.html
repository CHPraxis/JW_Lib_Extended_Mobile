<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">IN VARIOUS parts of the earth there will be a unique feature connected with and in addition to the regular 1985 district conventions. Particular attention will be given to having special conventions in certain regions throughout the world where it is desirable to give a greater witness.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Chosen delegations will be invited to a number of cities in Europe, the Caribbean and Mediterranean areas, Africa, South America, the Far East and the South Pacific. In some of these regions, there will be two or three convention locations to which these delegations will be directed. Suitable cities, where a limited number of visitors can be accommodated, will be selected. Certain branches will be asked to recommend those who may be invited to attend in specific convention locations, so it will not be practical to give an open invitation to everyone. Nevertheless, it will be most advantageous to have in attendance a limited delegation representing different countries. Announcement concerning this arrangement is being made now to let Jehovah’s people know that there will be opportunity for some to visit other lands.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The delegates that are eventually selected will be limited to dedicated and baptized Witnesses who will be a fine example to the local brothers and a source of encouragement by their deportment and attendance at the conventions to which they are invited. So it is expected that such ones will view their visit primarily as an opportunity to advance the Kingdom interests and not as a mere sightseeing holiday.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Various aspects of this arrangement have yet to be worked out. Hence, the Society would like to request that you do not write or make inquiries about this matter at this time. At a later date, further details concerning this arrangement will be supplied by the Society’s branches that are invited to send delegates to a particular country or countries.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">District conventions for the year 1985 will be arranged in most countries as usual. This will afford everyone an opportunity to enjoy the blessings of assembling together theocratically. The conventions will emphasize our responsibilities in regard to Kingdom service in this time of the end. Meanwhile, as we look forward to sharing in the “Kingdom Increase” Conventions during this current year, may Jehovah’s rich blessings be upon the great ingathering work that is now in progress.</p>

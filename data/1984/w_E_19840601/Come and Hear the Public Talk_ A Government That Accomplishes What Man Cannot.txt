Come and Hear the Public Talk: A Government That Accomplishes What Man Cannot
What government is this?
Over what will it govern?
Who will be its rulers?
How will it be set up?
Why can it accomplish what governments of men have not been able to accomplish?
These and other questions will be answered in the important public talk that will be featured at the four-day “Kingdom Increase” District Convention of Jehovah’s Witnesses. You can hear this talk at any one of more than a hundred such conventions being held this summer in scores of cities in the United States, the British Isles and Canada. The convention program also features helpful Bible discussions on practical matters of life, and two instructive Bible dramas.
Contact the local Kingdom Hall of Jehovah’s Witnesses for the time and place of the convention nearest to you, or write the publishers of this magazine.

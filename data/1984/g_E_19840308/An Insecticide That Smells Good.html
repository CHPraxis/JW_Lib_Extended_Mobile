<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Insecticides are not noted for their pleasant smell. Moreover, they can often be downright hazardous to your health. But according to the magazine <em>Science News, </em>scientists at the University of Georgia recently announced that they had found one that was both safe and easy on the nostrils.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The insecticide is found in the skin of fruits such as oranges and lemons. Preliminary studies, says <em>Science News, </em>have revealed that oil from these citrus peels “killed all insects tested​—fire ants, houseflies, stable flies, black soldier flies, paper wasps and grey crickets.” It goes on: “Citrus peels seem to be non-toxic to humans and other vertebrates in our everyday contacts and are used as flavorings in soft drinks and baking.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Scientists are now trying to determine exactly what it is in the fruit peels that so effectively kills insects.</p>

An Insecticide That Smells Good
Insecticides are not noted for their pleasant smell. Moreover, they can often be downright hazardous to your health. But according to the magazine Science News, scientists at the University of Georgia recently announced that they had found one that was both safe and easy on the nostrils.
The insecticide is found in the skin of fruits such as oranges and lemons. Preliminary studies, says Science News, have revealed that oil from these citrus peels “killed all insects tested​—fire ants, houseflies, stable flies, black soldier flies, paper wasps and grey crickets.” It goes on: “Citrus peels seem to be non-toxic to humans and other vertebrates in our everyday contacts and are used as flavorings in soft drinks and baking.”
Scientists are now trying to determine exactly what it is in the fruit peels that so effectively kills insects.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Is there such a thing as “passive smoking”? In other words, can children be harmed by the cigarettes that their parents smoke? This question is hotly debated, but, according to <em>Science News, </em>additional evidence now available suggests that over a period of time they can.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The magazine refers to a study, conducted by scientists in Boston, of 1,156 children who spent more time around their mothers than around their fathers. Some of the mothers smoked, and some did not. The result: “After five years, the lungs of non-smoking children with mothers who smoke grow at only 93 percent of the rate of growth in non-smoking children with mothers who do not smoke.” Their conclusion? “Passive exposure to maternal cigarette smoke may have important effects on the development of pulmonary [lung] function in children.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">According to <em>Science News, </em>the scientists had previously reported that children of smokers had an overall poorer lung function than did children of nonsmokers.</p>

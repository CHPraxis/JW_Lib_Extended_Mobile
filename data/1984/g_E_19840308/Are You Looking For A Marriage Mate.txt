Are You Looking For A Marriage Mate?
What qualities in a mate will contribute most to a happy marriage? A young woman who was wondering about this wrote in a letter of appreciation:
“I really didn’t have anywhere I could go to for information on choosing a mate or what questions to ask yourself when considering marriage. I have been praying continually to Jehovah for help in choosing my mate . . . I could hardly believe it when the book Making Your Family Life Happy was released. It was truly an answer to my prayers. And I know it will help me to become a good wife, one my husband will be proud of. I thank you for publishing the new book. It is greatly appreciated by me.”

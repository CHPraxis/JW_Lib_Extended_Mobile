Unity in Worship​—What Should It Mean for You?
As we draw closer and closer to the end of this system, pressures and tensions mount.
So it is more difficult, and yet more urgent than ever, to stay on the road leading to life, a road that requires unity in worship.
The new book United in Worship of the Only True God lovingly helps us to help ourselves and others through this critical period.
Please send me, postpaid, the 192-page, hardbound, illustrated book United in Worship of the Only True God. I enclose 75 cents (U.S.).

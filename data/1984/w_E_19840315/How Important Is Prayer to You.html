<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="st"><strong>How Important Is Prayer to You?</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sa">Darius, the king of the Medes about 2,500 years ago, made Daniel one of the highest officials in his kingdom. Darius appreciated the work of Daniel so much that the Bible says he “was intending to elevate him over all the kingdom.” The other officials became jealous and hatched a scheme to get Daniel into trouble. The scheme had to do with prayer, and this raises the question, How important is prayer to you today?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">THE enemies of Daniel go to King Darius and ask him to sign an interdict, or decree, “that whoever makes a petition to any god or man for thirty days except to you, O king, should be thrown to the lions’ pit.” Not realizing its purpose, Darius signs the decree. If you had been a servant of Jehovah God back then, would you have stopped praying to Him? Upon learning about the decree, Daniel immediately goes into his house and prays to God. As usual, he prays three times a day.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">At that his enemies go off to report to Darius that Daniel has not obeyed. This makes Darius sorry that he signed the decree and he tries to figure out how he can save Daniel. But that evening Daniel’s enemies come to Darius and say: “Take note, O king, that the law belonging to the Medes and the Persians is <span id="page25" class="pageNum" data-no="25" data-before-text="25"></span>that any interdict or statute that the king himself establishes is not to be changed.” So Darius is forced to give the command for Daniel to be thrown into the lions’ pit.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Darius is so upset that he cannot sleep that night. The next morning he is up early and hurries to the lions’ pit. As he gets near, he cries out with a sad voice: “O Daniel, servant of the living God, has your God whom you are serving with constancy been able to rescue you from the lions?” Right away, Daniel answers: “O king, . . . My own God sent his angel and shut the mouth of the lions, and they have not brought me to ruin.”</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">How glad Darius is! ‘Lift Daniel out of the pit,’ he commands. Then, what does the king do to those who schemed to have Daniel fed to the lions? Why, he has those wicked men thrown into the lions’ pit! Even before they reach the bottom of the pit, the lions grab them. Afterward, Darius writes to all the people in his kingdom, telling them that they should respect Daniel’s God because He performs great miracles. Yes, Jehovah rescued Daniel from the lions.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:6:1-27:6:28" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Daniel 6:1-28</a>.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sd">Do you have the kind of faith in Jehovah God that Daniel had? Do you believe that when God brings the end of this wicked system of things he will rescue you if you remain faithful to him? If so, you will not let any law or threat that humans may make cause you to stop serving him.</p>

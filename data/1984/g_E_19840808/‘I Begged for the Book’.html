<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">That is what a youth in Zimbabwe wrote. A friend had a copy of <em>My Book of Bible Stories, </em>yet refused to part with it despite fervent begging on the part of his friend. However, he did provide the address to which to write for the book, saying: “Go and buy yours.” So the youth wrote:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“I have no money, but please, sir, tell me the price so that I can borrow from my rich stepfather. Please, sir, hear my prayer. How I wish you can send me this book. I think I will never be cruel to my friends like that boy who I saw with that book. I will wait every day for your reply. I am twelve years old.” He received his book.</p>

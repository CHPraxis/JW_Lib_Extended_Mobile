‘I Begged for the Book’
That is what a youth in Zimbabwe wrote. A friend had a copy of My Book of Bible Stories, yet refused to part with it despite fervent begging on the part of his friend. However, he did provide the address to which to write for the book, saying: “Go and buy yours.” So the youth wrote:
“I have no money, but please, sir, tell me the price so that I can borrow from my rich stepfather. Please, sir, hear my prayer. How I wish you can send me this book. I think I will never be cruel to my friends like that boy who I saw with that book. I will wait every day for your reply. I am twelve years old.” He received his book.
Around the world this book has been in tremendous demand. Already it is available in over 40 languages, and nearly 20 million copies have been distributed.
My Book of Bible Stories has big type and over 125 large pictures, most of them multicolor. Its 116 Bible accounts give the reader an idea of what the Bible is all about. These stories appear in the order in which events occurred in history. You will find this really helpful to learning when, in relation to other events, things happened in history.

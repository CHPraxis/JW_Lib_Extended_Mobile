<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">That is what a <em>Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses </em>proved to be for a young girl in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. She explains:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“When I was a youth my family opposed my efforts to study the Bible with Jehovah’s Witnesses. One day, when I was about 16, I was given a <em>Yearbook, </em>which I began reading with great interest. From that time on my goal was to be a missionary and to teach the Bible to people in distant places, just as the missionaries did about whom I was reading.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">This young girl, now grown up, recently was graduated in the 77th class of the Gilead missionary school, and received a missionary assignment to Honduras. We encourage you to obtain the <em>1985 Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses. </em>It could well prove to be an inspiration in your life. You will read exciting experiences from around the world, including the faith-strengthening reports about the modern beginning and development of the Kingdom preaching activity in Jamaica, in the Bahamas and in the African land of Zimbabwe.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Please send the <em>1985 Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses. </em>I enclose $1.50 (U.S.). (For price in other countries, please contact local Watch Tower Society office.)</p>

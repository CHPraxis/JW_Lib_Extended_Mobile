An Inspiration for Life
That is what a Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses proved to be for a young girl in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. She explains:
“When I was a youth my family opposed my efforts to study the Bible with Jehovah’s Witnesses. One day, when I was about 16, I was given a Yearbook, which I began reading with great interest. From that time on my goal was to be a missionary and to teach the Bible to people in distant places, just as the missionaries did about whom I was reading.”
This young girl, now grown up, recently was graduated in the 77th class of the Gilead missionary school, and received a missionary assignment to Honduras. We encourage you to obtain the 1985 Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses. It could well prove to be an inspiration in your life. You will read exciting experiences from around the world, including the faith-strengthening reports about the modern beginning and development of the Kingdom preaching activity in Jamaica, in the Bahamas and in the African land of Zimbabwe.
Please send the 1985 Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses. I enclose $1.50 (U.S.). (For price in other countries, please contact local Watch Tower Society office.)

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">This magazine originally bore the title <em>The Golden Age. </em>The first issue was dated October 1, 1919. This was a magazine that reported on many fields of human endeavor. It alerted people to what was going on in the world and showed them that the real solution to mankind’s problems is Christ’s Millennial Reign, which will truly usher in a “golden age” for humankind. The cover design of the magazine underwent changes, but the message remained the same. <em>The Golden Age </em>was designed for public distribution, and for many years its circulation was far in excess of that for <em>The Watch Tower.</em></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Beginning with the issue of October 6, 1937, the title was changed to <em>Consolation.</em> This was very appropriate in view of the oppression that many were experiencing and the turmoil in which <span id="page725" class="pageNum" data-no="725" data-before-text="725"></span>the world became embroiled in World War II. The consolation that the magazine offered, however, was the sort that appeals only to those who have genuine love for truth.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">As of the issue of August 22, 1946, the title <em>Awake! </em>was adopted. Emphasis was placed on awakening people to the significance of world events. The magazine used conventional news sources, but it also had its own correspondents around the globe. The balanced, practical in-depth articles in <em>Awake! </em>that discuss a wide range of subjects encourage readers to give consideration to this magazine’s most important message, namely, that world events fulfill Bible prophecy, which shows that we live in the last days and that soon God’s Kingdom will bring eternal benefits to those who learn and do God’s will. This magazine has been an effective instrument in the global proclamation of the good news of the Kingdom of God and a bridge to deeper study material as set forth in <em>The Watchtower </em>and bound books.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">By early 1993, <em>Awake! </em>was being printed in 67 languages, 13,240,000 copies per issue.</p>

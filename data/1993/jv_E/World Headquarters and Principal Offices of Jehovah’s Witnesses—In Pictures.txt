In these factory buildings (in Brooklyn, New York), Bibles, books, and brochures in 180 languages are produced for global distribution
[Pictures on page 356]
Millions of audiocassettes of Biblical material are produced in this factory in Brooklyn each year. From here, shipping is also coordinated. Upwards of 15,000 tons of Bible literature and other material per year is shipped to all parts of the world
[Pictures on page 356]
In this factory at Watchtower Farms, near Wallkill, New York, hundreds of millions of copies of “The Watchtower” and “Awake!,” in 14 languages, are printed each year
Jehovah’s Witnesses and the legal corporations that they use have offices and printeries in many parts of the world. Pictures on the following pages show many, though not all, of these facilities. Where new buildings were being constructed in 1992, architectural renderings are shown. Statistics given apply as of 1992.

The Society first established a branch office in Costa Rica in 1944. Since the 1950’s, Costa Ricans sharing in true worship have numbered in the thousands.
DOMINICAN REPUBLIC
[Pictures on page 359]
Watch Tower literature was distributed here as early as 1932. But personal instruction of interested people began in 1945, when the missionaries shown at the left arrived. In recent years, when tens of thousands of people became eager to study the Bible with the Witnesses, these branch facilities became necessary.
EL SALVADOR
[Pictures on page 359]
Some witnessing was done here in 1916. However, it was first in 1945 that at least one person in El Salvador was ready to undergo Christian water immersion (shown here). Since then, thousands more have become servants of Jehovah.
GUADELOUPE
[Pictures on page 359]
The publisher-to-population ratio in territory served by this branch office is one of the best in the world. Many people in Guadeloupe appreciatively receive the good news.
CANADA
[Picture on page 360, 361]

HONDURAS
[Pictures on page 362]
Since 1916, well over 23,000,000 hours have been devoted to teaching the Bible to inhabitants of this land. At times, Jehovah’s Witnesses have also had to teach people how to read and write (as you see here) to enable them to study God’s Word themselves.
JAMAICA
[Pictures on page 362]
Hundreds in Jamaica became devoted servants of Jehovah during the time when prospective heirs of the heavenly Kingdom were being gathered. Since 1935, thousands more have joined in preaching the Kingdom message. This branch office is being built to help care for their spiritual needs.
LEEWARD ISLANDS (ANTIGUA)
[Picture on page 362]
As early as 1914, the good news was being preached in the islands now cared for by this office. Again and again since then, people in this part of the earth have been invited to “take life’s water free.”—Rev. 22:17.

[Pictures on page 365]
The good news was already being intensely proclaimed in Trinidad as early as 1912. Many Witnesses, including these three trained at Gilead School, have devoted their full time to this work.
SOUTH AMERICA
ARGENTINA
[Pictures on page 366]
A Kingdom proclaimer was first sent to this country in 1924. Much help was later given by Gilead-trained missionaries, including Charles Eisenhower (shown here), who arrived with his wife in 1948. By 1992, general supervision, as well as Bible literature, was being provided from these facilities for upwards of 96,000 of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Argentina. Literature was also being sent from here to supply the more than 44,000 Witnesses in Chile.
BOLIVIA
[Pictures on page 367]
Bolivians have been hearing the Kingdom message since 1924. Thousands receive Bible literature appreciatively and benefit from regular home Bible studies.
CHILE
[Pictures on page 367]
By 1919, Watch Tower literature had reached Chile. The preaching supervised by this office now extends from windblown sheep ranches in the south to remote mining camps in the north, from the Andes Mountains to the ocean.
ECUADOR
[Pictures on page 367]
A major contribution to the preaching of the good news in Ecuador was made by upwards of 870 Witnesses (such as the two shown here) who left their homelands to serve where the need was greater. This branch now provides help for more than 22,000 zealous praisers of Jehovah.
BRAZIL
[Pictures on page 368, 369]
In 1992, when the Society’s branch office, printery, and Bethel Home were being enlarged to this size, Jehovah’s Witnesses in Brazil numbered upwards of 335,000 and were baptizing more than 27,000 disciples each year. The printery here also provides literature for distribution in Bolivia, Paraguay, and Uruguay.

The Society has had a branch office in Guyana since 1914. The Witnesses have reached deep into the interior and endeavored to give everyone opportunity to hear the good news. Although the country’s population even now is less than a million, the Witnesses have devoted more than 10,000,000 hours to preaching and teaching in this land.
PARAGUAY
[Pictures on page 369]
Preaching of the good news was under way in Paraguay by the mid-1920’s. Since 1946, 112 Gilead-trained missionaries have helped to give the witness. To reach language groups apart from the local Spanish and Guarani, other Witnesses have also volunteered to move in from various lands.

In the face of constant hostility from the Roman Catholic Church, Jehovah’s Witnesses in Italy have devoted more than 550,000,000 hours since 1946 to personal calls on their neighbors to discuss the Bible with them. As a result, 194,000 people in Italy are now active worshipers of Jehovah
FINLAND
[Picture on page 378]
Bible truth reached Finland from Sweden in 1906. Since then, it has been carried to every corner of the country, even far above the Arctic Circle. Scores from here have attended Gilead School to be trained for service wherever they were needed in the world field. Others have moved out on their own to serve in lands where the need was greater.
ICELAND
[Picture on page 379]
In Iceland, which has a population of only about 260,000, over 1,620,000 pieces of Bible literature have been distributed in order to help people to choose life. Now over 260 persons here serve Jehovah, the true God.

GREECE
[Picture on page 380]
The apostle Paul was one of the first to declare the good news in Greece. (Acts 16:9-14; 17:15; 18:1; 20:2) Although the Greek Orthodox Church has intensely persecuted Jehovah’s Witnesses for many years, there are now upwards of 24,000 faithful servants of Jehovah in this land. The branch shown here is some 40 miles north of Athens.

POLAND
[Picture on page 381]
These facilities are being used to provide assistance to the more than 100,000 Witnesses in Poland. From 1939 to 1945, their worship was banned, but their numbers increased from 1,039 in 1939 to 6,994 in 1946. When banned again in 1950, they numbered 18,116; but shortly after that ban was lifted in 1989, reports showed that there were over 91,000.

LUXEMBOURG
[Picture on page 382]
Luxembourg is one of the very small nations of Europe. But for some 70 years, the Kingdom message has been preached here too. Especially before World War II, help was given by Witnesses who came in from France, Germany, and Switzerland.
NETHERLANDS
[Pictures on page 382]
From this branch in Emmen, supervision is provided for the activity of over 32,000 zealous Witnesses in the Netherlands. Translation of all publications into Dutch is done in these facilities. Much of the reproduction of Bible-based videocassettes in European languages is also handled from here.
NORWAY
[Pictures on page 383]
A hundred years ago, a Norwegian who had moved to America and learned Bible truths there brought that good news back to his hometown. Since then, Jehovah’s Witnesses have visited every part of Norway again and again to talk to the people about God’s Kingdom.
PORTUGAL
[Picture on page 383]
For decades after the government signed a concordat with the Vatican, the police arrested Witnesses and deported their missionaries. But the remaining Witnesses continued to meet for worship, to preach to others, and to multiply. At last, in 1974 they were granted legal recognition.
This office supervises the activity of more than 40,000 Witnesses in Portugal. It has also given much help to African lands that had strong ties with Portugal

SWEDEN
[Picture on page 383]
For over 100 years, Jehovah’s Witnesses have been preaching in Sweden. Within the past ten years, they have devoted over 38,000,000 hours to this activity. Many congregations in Sweden now speak any of a dozen languages other than Swedish.
[Picture on page 383]
To help people of all sorts in Sweden, publications are stocked here in 70 languages
SPAIN
[Picture on page 384]
This branch cares for upwards of 92,000 Witnesses in Spain. It prints “The Watchtower” and “Awake!” for both Spain and Portugal. In spite of unrelenting efforts of the Catholic clergy to use the State to stop Jehovah’s Witnesses, the Witnesses have shared Bible truths with the Spanish people since 1916. Finally, in 1970, when Jehovah’s Witnesses in Spain numbered over 11,000, they were granted legal recognition. Since then, their numbers have increased some eightfold.

AFRICA
BENIN
[Picture on page 385]
Benin is made up of some 60 ethnic groups speaking 50 dialects. When thousands of these people broke free from their former religions, fetish priests and the clergy of Christendom alike became infuriated. But repeated waves of persecution did not stop the growth of true worship in this land.

CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC
[Picture on page 385]
As early as 1947, the Kingdom message began to reach people here. A man who had attended some Witness meetings elsewhere shared with others what he had learned. Soon there was a study group, the ones attending quickly began to witness, and those worshiping Jehovah increased in numbers.
CÔTE D’IVOIRE
[Pictures on page 386]
Gilead-trained missionaries helped to introduce true worship in this West African land in 1949. More than a hundred of such missionaries have served here. Each year, well over a million hours are now being devoted to searching out truth-hungry people in the area cared for by this branch office.
GHANA
[Picture on page 386, 387]
The preaching of the good news in Ghana got under way in 1924. Now this office in Accra supervises more than 640 congregations in Ghana. It has also cared for translating Bible literature into Ewe, Ga, and Twi and printing it in these languages.

KENYA
[Map/Picture on page 387]
In 1931, two of Jehovah’s Witnesses traveled from South Africa to preach in Kenya. Since 1963 the Society’s office in Kenya has, at various times, provided supervision for evangelizing in many other countries in East Africa (as shown below). International conventions in Kenya in 1973, 1978, and 1985 have contributed to the witness given.

Those who have become Jehovah’s Witnesses here have faced numerous tests of their faith—when breaking away from local superstitions, when forsaking polygamy, when persecuted by officials to whom they had been misrepresented, and when surrounded by political and ethnic groups at war. Yet, true worship continues to unite people of all sorts in this land.
MAURITIUS
[Pictures on page 389]
As early as 1933, zealous Witnesses from South Africa visited this island in the Indian Ocean. There are now upwards of a thousand Witnesses in Mauritius who urge their neighbors to seek Jehovah so that they might be viewed by him with favor when he destroys the present wicked system.—Zeph. 2:3.
SOUTH AFRICA
[Picture on page 390]
For over 80 years, the Watch Tower Society has had a branch office in South Africa. Zealous evangelizers from here have done much to spread the Kingdom message into other countries in southern and eastern Africa. In the territory that was formerly under this branch (where there were 14,674 Kingdom proclaimers in 1945), there are now more than 300,000 active Witnesses of Jehovah.
[Pictures on page 391]
More than 110 translators work under the direction of this branch to prepare Bible literature in 16 African languages
[Picture on page 391]

SENEGAL
[Pictures on page 390]
Though the number of Witnesses here is small, the branch office has endeavored to see to it that each city, each ethnic group, and the people of every religion, not only in Senegal but also in surrounding countries, have opportunity to hear the Bible’s heartwarming message.
SIERRA LEONE
[Picture on page 391]
Preaching of the good news in Sierra Leone got started in 1915. Growth has at times been slow. But when those who did not hold to Jehovah’s high standards were removed and those who did not serve with right motives withdrew, the ones loyal to Jehovah prospered spiritually.
ZAMBIA
[Picture on page 392]
This branch office supervises the activity of more than 110,000 Witnesses in south-central Africa. The Society’s first office here was established in 1936. Since then, Jehovah’s Witnesses in Zambia have made upwards of 186,000,000 return visits to give added help to interested ones. They have also taught many to read so they could study the Bible personally and share it with others.

ZIMBABWE
[Pictures on page 392]
Jehovah’s Witnesses have been active in Zimbabwe since the 1920’s. During the following years, they were confronted with bans on their literature, prohibitions of assemblies, and denial of permission for missionaries to preach to the African population. Gradually, obstacles were overcome, and this office now looks after upwards of 20,000 Witnesses.
THE ORIENT
HONG KONG
[Pictures on page 393]
Watch Tower publications are translated here into Chinese, which, in its many dialects, is spoken by more than a billion people. In Hong Kong itself, the preaching of the good news began when C. T. Russell lectured at city hall in 1912.
INDIA
[Picture on page 393]
This branch supervises the proclamation of the Kingdom message to over one sixth of the earth’s population. At present, this office directs translation into 18 languages and printing in 19. Among these is Hindi (spoken by 367 million people) also Assamese, Bengali, Gujarati, Kannada, Malayalam, Marathi, Nepali, Oriya, Punjabi, Tamil, Telugu, and Urdu (each spoken by tens of millions).

MYANMAR
[Pictures on page 395]
When the Watch Tower Society established a branch office here in 1947, there were only 24 of Jehovah’s Witnesses in the country. The more than 2,000 Witnesses now active in Myanmar endeavor to reach not only inhabitants of the cities but also the more numerous rural population.
PHILIPPINES
[Picture on page 396]
In 1912, C. T. Russell spoke in Manila’s Grand Opera House on the subject “Where Are the Dead?” Since that time Jehovah’s Witnesses here have devoted upwards of 483,000,000 hours in witnessing to the people found on the approximately 900 inhabited islands of the Philippines. General supervision of more than 110,000 Witnesses in 3,200 congregations is provided from this branch. Printing is done here in eight languages to fill local needs.

Some witnessing was done here in the 1920’s. But it got under way on a more consistent basis in the 1950’s. Now these new branch facilities are being constructed to provide a center for increased activity in this part of the earth.

During the 1930’s, pioneer Witnesses came from Britain, Germany, Australia, and New Zealand to share Bible truth with the people of Thailand (then known as Siam). Delegates from many lands attended international conventions here in 1963, 1978, 1985, and 1991 to encourage local Witnesses and to stimulate spread of the Kingdom message.

A special challenge faces Jehovah’s Witnesses in this land—the people speak some 700 distinct languages. Witnesses from at least ten other lands have moved here to share in the work. They have worked hard to learn local languages. Interested ones translate for those who speak another tongue. Pictures are also effectively used as aids in teaching.
SOLOMON ISLANDS

A Bible study conducted internationally by mail brought the Kingdom message to the Solomon Islands by the early 1950’s. In spite of severe obstacles, Bible truth spread. This branch office and the spacious Assembly Hall are results of local ingenuity, international cooperation, and an abundance of Jehovah’s spirit.
TAHITI

By the early 1930’s, Jehovah’s Witnesses had reached Tahiti with the Kingdom message. Here, in the midst of the Pacific Ocean, a thorough witness is being given. During just the past four years, the witnessing done amounts to more than five hours of talking, on an average, to every man, woman, and child on the island.
WESTERN SAMOA

Western Samoa is one of the smallest nations of the world, but Jehovah’s Witnesses have a branch office here too. This facility was being built in 1992 to care for activity on these and other nearby islands, including American Samoa.

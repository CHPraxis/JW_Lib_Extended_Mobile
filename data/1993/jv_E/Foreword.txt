Foreword
Jehovah’s Witnesses are a people widely known. Their preaching and way of worship have penetrated national and racial groups worldwide and have been embraced by people young and old, at every economic and educational level. Their zeal as proclaimers of God’s Kingdom has impressed even their critics. Their love toward one another makes some non-Witnesses wish that more people acted that way.
Yet, many still wonder, ‘Who really are Jehovah’s Witnesses?’ Others have written about them, not always impartially. Probably they were not aware of all the facts. Certainly, no one knows their modern-day history better than they themselves do. The editors of this volume have endeavored to be objective and to present a candid history. To all who are aware of what the Bible foretells for the last days, this history of a people who intensely believe and preach what the Bible says will be especially enlightening.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Last year Jehovah’s Witnesses published a small six-page tract on the above subject. Very concisely, it provides the type of help that depressed ones need. The tract shows that the Bible is the best source of comfort. It cites dozens of pertinent Scripture texts on the subject of depression, including ones that can be used to assist depressed persons.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Last fall the branch office of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Rome, Italy, received a phone call during which the caller said: “I want to thank you for the tract on depression. I have just received it, and I felt compelled to call to thank you. I have never read anything so encouraging in any medical publication. I want to compliment you because you succeed in saying so much in so little space.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“When I read the tract, I was moved to tears. I want to encourage you to continue your work. It is important; you should do it all over Italy and all over the world.”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">If you would like to have a copy of this tract, <em>Comfort for the Depressed, </em>or further information, please write to Watchtower, 25 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn, New York 11201, or to the appropriate address listed on page 5.</p>

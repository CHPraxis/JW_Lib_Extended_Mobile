The Book That Provides True Guidance
1 The world has changed dramatically during the past century. Although there have been advances in the fields of communication, medicine, and transportation, the quality of family life has steadily declined. Millions allow themselves to be guided by the constantly changing philosophy of men.
2 In this rapidly changing world scene, Jehovah’s people have benefited greatly by adhering to his Word. The Bible has remained unchanged for thousands of years, and its counsel is still the most practical for coping with problems we face today. How can we help interested people come to appreciate that the Bible provides true guidance for our modern day?
3 If you left the tract “Why You Can Trust The Bible” on the initial call, you may return and say:
▪ “Since the Bible clearly says that it is a message from God himself and that he offers us eternal life if we believe and live by what it says, do you feel it would be worthwhile to find out more about these statements? [Allow for comment.] Notice what the Bible foretells concerning the present world system of things. [Read 2 Timothy 3:1-5 directly from page 5 of the tract.] Do you think this description fits the world today? [Allow for comment.] Is there sound reason to expect better conditions in the future?” You can then lay the groundwork for another visit by discussing the last two paragraphs of the tract or by using page 161 of the book The Bible​—God’s Word or Man’s?, highlighting the wonderful hope that the Bible holds out for mankind.
4 If the householder was interested in the practical value of the Bible and you pointed out specific principles in chapter 12 of the book “The Bible​—God’s Word or Man’s?,” you may say:
▪ “We are interested in things that are practical for us today, aren’t we? Would you agree that putting an end to war would be practical? [Allow for comment.] If people learned to live together in peace with those of other nations, this would be a good start, would it not? [Allow for response.] The Bible has foretold exactly that. [Read Isaiah 2:2, 3.] Have you ever wondered how and when this will come about?” Explain that you would like to discuss this question further at a time convenient for the householder.
5 If you left the “New World Translation,” you may return and say:
▪ “In reading the Bible I left with you, you may have noticed that it uses God’s personal name throughout. This is an important improvement over many other Bible translations. Although some people may hesitate to use the name Jehovah, we must keep in mind that he revealed his name long ago and encouraged his servants to use it to identify him as the true and living God. Notice what the psalmist wrote at Psalm 83:18.” Read the scripture, and allow the householder to comment. According to the interest manifested, you may use additional information found under the heading “Jehovah,” beginning on page 191 of the Reasoning book.
6 Only the Bible provides the guidance that man needs. (Jer. 10:23) Studying God’s Word is the only way to learn about His purposes and gain His favor. Therefore, let us earnestly invite others to benefit from its wise counsel and practical advice.

A Special Month for Field Service
1 Can December be a special field service month for you? It may be necessary to make some adjustments in your usual routine, but wouldnâ€™t the rewards make it worthwhile?
2 Some of the younger baptized publishers will have extra days off from school and would like to enroll as auxiliary pioneers for the month. How encouraging it would be for them to have some of the elders, ministerial servants, and other publishers working in the field with them! If personal circumstances do not allow you to pioneer during the month, is it possible for you to spend just a few extra hours in service with those who will be pioneering? This certainly would be mutually encouraging.
3 If all the publishers put forth added effort, the elders may be able to arrange for group witnessing each day during the holiday season so that those who can pioneer will always have someone to work with in field service.
4 Now is the time, individually and as family groups as well as on the congregation level, to plan to make December a special month for field service in your congregation.

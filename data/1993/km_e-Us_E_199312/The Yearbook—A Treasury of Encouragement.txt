The Yearbook​—A Treasury of Encouragement
1 Reports and experiences concerning Jehovah’s wonderful works have always been refreshing to God’s servants. (Job 38:4, 7; Prov. 25:25; Luke 7:22; Acts 15:31) That is why the Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses is a treasury of encouragement.
2 Each Yearbook presents upbuilding reports from around the world on the activities and accomplishments of Jehovah’s Witnesses. Faith-​strengthening experiences highlight Jehovah’s guidance, protection, and blessing of his people. The Yearbook tells of stalwart men and women who left family, friends, and homeland to bring Bible truths to peoples on all continents and most of the islands of the sea.
3 The Yearbook has moved many readers to increase their service to God. One reader wrote: “I can’t read it fast enough. What I’ve read so far has been very encouraging. It makes me feel that I could do more in preaching the good news when I see what others are doing under pressure.”
4 Every year since 1927, the Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses has been a real treasury of inspiring reports and experiences. Are you benefiting fully from this unique source of encouragement? To do so, be sure to read the Yearbook when you first get it. Then throughout the year, review specific portions of it for the encouragement you and your family need.

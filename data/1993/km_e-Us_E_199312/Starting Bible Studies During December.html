<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>Jesus commanded his disciples to be teachers of the good news. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:28:19-40:28:20" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matt. 28:19, 20</a>) Our primary means of teaching others is by conducting Bible studies. Are you sharing in this work? If not, how can you start a study so that you can enjoy a greater share in teaching others?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>Perhaps we gave the householder a tract and promised to return to discuss its contents.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn"><strong><em>When calling back on a householder with whom we left the tract </em>“<em>Will This World Survive?,” we might say:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn">▪ “When I was here a few days ago, we discussed the urgency of our times and that Jesus accurately described the conditions that exist in our day. I’d like to spend a few minutes and briefly consider some information from the tract that I left with you. Note what’s stated under the subheading ‘The Sign.’” Turn to page 3 of the tract, and discuss the first two or three paragraphs under that subheading, reading the cited scriptures as time permits. Highlight how Jesus’ prophecy is being fulfilled today. Arrange to return and go over the other paragraphs under this subheading. Encourage the householder to read the material before you return.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup><strong><em>Or you could say something like this:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sn">▪ “The last time that we talked, I left you the tract entitled <em>Will This World Survive? </em>At that time we talked about the role of Jesus Christ in world affairs. We read his words recorded in the Bible at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:3-43:17:3" data-bid="2-1" class="b">John 17:3</a>. [Read.] Since it’s essential that we learn about God and Jesus if we want everlasting life, it’s worth our while to do what we can to take in such knowledge. When Jesus was on earth, he reflected the many wonderful qualities of God. Isn’t it reasonable to believe that the more we come to know about Jesus and his ministry, the more we come to know about his Father? [Allow for response.] Notice what this book, <em>The Greatest Man Who Ever Lived, </em>says.” Read the first and second paragraphs on the tenth page of chapter 116. Emphasize that this book contains all the information in the four Gospel accounts about Jesus and puts this material in the order the events occurred. Point out specific chapter titles, illustrations, and the map at the beginning of the book. If the person is genuinely interested, offer the publication.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sn"><sup>4 </sup><strong><em>After greeting a householder who accepted the “Greatest Man” book, we might say:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sn">▪ “As I mentioned on my previous visit, the <em>Greatest Man </em>book is designed for Bible study. I’d like to demonstrate briefly how it can be most effectively used.” Open the book to chapter 1, “Messages From Heaven.” Draw the householder’s attention to the printed questions. Read the first question, then consider the opening paragraphs. Tie in the illustration on the second page. Take up the remaining questions, and highlight the answers as time allows. Before concluding the call, arrange to return and continue the conversation.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>By maintaining a positive attitude, preparing well, and taking advantage of every opportunity, we will be well equipped to start a Bible study during December.</p>

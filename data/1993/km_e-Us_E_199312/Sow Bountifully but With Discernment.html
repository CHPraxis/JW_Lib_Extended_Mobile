<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>Every farmer knows that if he sows his seed bountifully, he will likely reap a bountiful harvest, but if he sows sparingly, he will assuredly reap sparingly. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:9:6-47:9:6" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Cor. 9:6</a>) Farmers are careful not to waste seed by sowing where no growth is possible. Similar discernment is needed when we offer our literature in the field. Our desire is to leave literature with those who are interested in reading it. We want to give deserving ones the opportunity to learn of Jehovah’s undeserved kindness and the Kingdom hope.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>Do you find that magazines, brochures, and other publications are accumulating on a shelf at home when they could be used to bring deserving ones in your territory to a knowledge of the truth? (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:25:25-40:25:25" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matthew 25:25</a>.) Do you sometimes hold back from offering magazines or other literature on the first call simply because you find it awkward to mention how the Kingdom preaching work is supported? Experienced publishers have found that appreciative householders respond to a simple, direct statement when they are told how donations to the Kingdom work are handled.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup><strong><em>You might say:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn">▪ “You may be wondering how we can offer literature without charge. It is a part of a worldwide educational work supported by voluntary contributions. If you would like to make a small donation toward the work, I would be very glad to accept it.”</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>Many householders will ask how much the literature costs.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sn"><strong><em>You could reply:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sn">▪ “There is no charge for the literature because our work is supported by voluntary donations. If you would like to make a small donation today, we would be happy to see that it is used in the worldwide preaching work.”</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sn"><strong><em>Or you could say:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sn">▪ “We make our literature available to all who are interested in learning more about the Bible. If you would like to make a small donation toward this worldwide work, I would be pleased to forward it for you.”</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup><strong><em>In magazine work some publishers show the inside page of a magazine and say:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sn">▪ “As you see here, our work is supported by voluntary donations. If you would like to make a small donation to help with this work, I am in a position to handle it.”</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sn"><strong><em>Here is another simple expression:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sn">▪ “Although our literature is offered without charge, we do accept modest donations for our worldwide work.”</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup>We should never hold back from sowing Kingdom seed because we are reluctant to mention how the work is financed. At the same time, discernment is needed so that our literature is not wasted on ‘rocky soil.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:4:5-41:4:6" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Mark 4:5, 6,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:4:16-41:4:17" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 16, 17</a>) Those who appreciate the good news we bring are glad to have the opportunity to contribute to its material support.​—Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:10:42-40:10:42" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Matthew 10:42</a>.</p>

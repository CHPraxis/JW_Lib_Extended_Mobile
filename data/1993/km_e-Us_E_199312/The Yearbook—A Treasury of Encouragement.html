<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>Each <em>Yearbook </em>presents upbuilding reports from around the world on the activities and accomplishments of Jehovah’s Witnesses. Faith-​strengthening experiences highlight Jehovah’s guidance, protection, and blessing of his people. The <em>Yearbook </em>tells of stalwart men and women who left family, friends, and homeland to bring Bible truths to peoples on all continents and most of the islands of the sea.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>The <em>Yearbook </em>has moved many readers to increase their service to God. One reader wrote: “I can’t read it fast enough. What I’ve read so far has been very encouraging. It makes me feel that I could do more in preaching the good news when I see what others are doing under pressure.”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>Every year since 1927, the <em>Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses </em>has been a real treasury of inspiring reports and experiences. Are you benefiting fully from this unique source of encouragement? To do so, be sure to read the <em>Yearbook </em>when you first get it.

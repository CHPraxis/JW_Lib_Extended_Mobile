Announcements
▪ Literature offer for December: The Greatest Man Who Ever Lived. January: Any 192-​page book printed on paper that yellows or discolors or any published prior to 1980. Congregations that do not have a supply of such books may offer Mankind’s Search for God. February: You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth. March: Revelation​—Its Grand Climax At Hand! NOTE: Congregations that will need the above-​mentioned campaign items should request them on their next monthly Literature Request Form (S(d)-14). Older publications referred to above are not available in Brooklyn, but congregations should use any they may already have in stock.
▪ The presiding overseer or someone designated by him should audit the congregation’s accounts on December 1 or as soon as possible thereafter. Make announcement to the congregation when this has been done.
▪ The Memorial for 1995 will be Friday, April 14, after sundown. This advance notice of the date for the 1995 Memorial celebration is given so that brothers may make necessary reservations or contracts for available halls when there are too many congregations using the Kingdom Hall and they must find other facilities.
▪ Congregations should begin requesting bound volumes of The Watchtower and Awake! for 1993 on their December literature request. (See the Watchtower Publications List, paragraphs 6-8, 10.) The bound volumes will be available in Dutch, English, French, German, Greek, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, and Spanish. Until the bound volumes are available and shipments are made, these will appear as “Pending” on congregation packing lists. Bound volumes are special-​request items. (See the Watchtower Publications List, paragraphs 24 and 25.)

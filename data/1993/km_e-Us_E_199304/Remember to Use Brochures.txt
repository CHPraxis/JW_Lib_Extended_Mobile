Remember to Use Brochures
When witnessing from house to house or informally, the conversation frequently turns toward a subject covered by one of our attractive brochures. Everyone should especially have this in mind while featuring The Watchtower and Awake! during April and May. By always having several different brochures along with the magazines you will be featuring in the ministry, you will be equipped to offer just what is needed to give an effective witness. During April and May, feel free to use any one of the brochures (except the School brochure) along with or instead of the magazines you will be featuring.​—Compare Proverbs 15:23.

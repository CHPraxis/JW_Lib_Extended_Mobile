Rejoice in the Clean Earth Ahead!
HOW happy we can be that Jehovah, a God of order and cleanliness, will fulfill his original purpose to make the earth into a global paradise! (Isaiah 11:6-9) He promises: “My word that goes forth from my mouth . . . will not return to me without results, but it will certainly do that in which I have delighted.” “It is impossible for God to lie,” so these are not empty words.​—Isaiah 55:11; Hebrews 6:18.
We can be relieved that Jehovah will lovingly intercede before humans have gone to the point of no return, beyond which point total ecological breakdown would be unavoidable!​—Revelation 11:18.
Jehovah will remove unrepentant, wanton polluters and persons rebelliously ignoring his principles of order and cleanliness. No one will be permitted to jeopardize the restored Paradise.​—Proverbs 2:20-22.
During God’s Kingdom rule, under the direction of Christ Jesus, humans will be taught how to root out any remaining causes of physical pollution. Then​—not now—​is when it will be imperative that all of God’s servants get actively involved in personal and collective measures that will contribute to an unprecedented global cleanup.​—Compare Ezekiel 39:8-16.
Survivors of the end of the present wicked system of things will support this physical clean-up program with the same dedication and enthusiasm with which they participate in the spiritual clean-up campaign of today.​—Psalm 110:3.
A cleansed earth is bound to come, spearheaded by the greatest clean-up campaign of all times, accomplished by God’s Kingdom. All traces of pollution will be removed. Nowhere any graffiti. No more discarded bottles, cans, plastic bags, chewing-gum and candy wrappers, newspapers, and magazines to clutter any beach or paradisaic spot.
Rejoice in the clean earth ahead!

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">HOW happy we can be that Jehovah, a God of order and cleanliness, will fulfill his original purpose to make the earth into a global paradise! (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:11:6-23:11:9" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Isaiah 11:6-9</a>) He promises: “My word that goes forth from my mouth . . . will not return to me without results, but it will certainly do that in which I have delighted.” “It is impossible for God to lie,” so these are not empty words.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:55:11-23:55:11" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Isaiah 55:11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:6:18-58:6:18" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Hebrews 6:18</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">We can be relieved that Jehovah will lovingly intercede before humans have gone to the point of no return, beyond which point total ecological breakdown would be unavoidable!​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:11:18-66:11:18" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Revelation 11:18</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Jehovah will remove unrepentant, wanton polluters and persons rebelliously ignoring his principles of order and cleanliness. No one will be permitted to jeopardize the restored Paradise.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:2:20-20:2:22" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Proverbs 2:20-22</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">During God’s Kingdom rule, under the direction of Christ Jesus, humans will be taught how to root out any remaining causes of physical pollution. Then​—not now—​is when it will be imperative that all of God’s servants get <em>actively involved </em>in personal and collective measures that will contribute to an unprecedented global cleanup.​—Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:39:8-26:39:16" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ezekiel 39:8-16</a>.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Survivors of the end of the present wicked system of things will support this physical clean-up program with the same dedication and enthusiasm with which they participate in the spiritual clean-up campaign of today.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:110:3-19:110:3" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Psalm 110:3</a>.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">A cleansed earth is bound to come, spearheaded by the greatest clean-up campaign of all times, accomplished by God’s Kingdom. All traces of pollution will be removed. Nowhere any graffiti. No more discarded bottles, cans, plastic bags, chewing-gum and candy wrappers, newspapers, and magazines to clutter any beach or paradisaic spot.</p>

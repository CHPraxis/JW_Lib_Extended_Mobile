<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Parents who work hard to raise their children to be responsible and God-fearing adults are gratified when their efforts are successful. They are also very pleased when their children express appreciation for that good upbringing.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Following is a letter sent by a son and his wife, after their wedding, to his parents:</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sh">“Dear Dad and Mom:</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">“Oh, where do we begin? Let’s start by saying how much we appreciated your love, support, and generosity on our wedding day. It truly was a special day, and your presence was invaluable. Additionally, as if that weren’t enough, you assisted us in making our honeymoon so enjoyable. All the above is further evidence of what outstanding, loving, reasonable, and fun-loving parents you are and have always been!</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">“Have you ever wondered why I have been able to stay on the straight and narrow? Because, besides my love for Jehovah God, I have always had great respect for you both. This respect has been so strong that coupled with your discipline, it has caused me always to think twice when doing things and making decisions. The success of my life in doing God’s will is indeed due in large part to your consistent love and discipline of me and your undying devotion to Jehovah and his organization.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">“If I were to take all the memories of my childhood about the two of you and were to combine them, they would say that although I may not remember everything you said, I do remember your outstanding conduct, especially your love for others and for Jehovah.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sj">“We love you very, very much.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sj">“Your son and daughter-in-law,</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sj">“L. and W.”</p>

<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Intriguing questions, aren’t they? They appear on the cover of a brochure published by Jehovah’s Witnesses. Have you read it? Already it has given comfort and hope to many. A woman from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, U.S.A., writes concerning this brochure:</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">“I didn’t know it was possible to bring words together so beautifully and in such a heart-touching way. It’s as if I were in a dark room and suddenly someone turned on a light; I realized: ‘God <em>does </em>care!’</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">“I was always a scientifically oriented person. Therefore, discourses, articles, or films with a scientific slant have renewed my spirits if ever I became discouraged. However, not only has this brochure renewed me but also it’s touched me in a soft, loving way.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">“The first thing that catches your eye is the cover. It’s effective because those are <em>real </em>people. Each of their faces reflects concern about the question in bold black print, ‘Does God Really Care About Us?’ These people have facial expressions that mirror the way everyone feels these days.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">“The material is very easily understood. It’s simple, to the point, and it makes sense. It’s reasonable. It’s so pleasant and so easy to read that once you start reading it, you can’t put it down.”</p>

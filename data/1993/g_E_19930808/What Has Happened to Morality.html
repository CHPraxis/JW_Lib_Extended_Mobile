<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">GOVERNMENT officials. Political candidates. Religious leaders. We expect men of such stature to be models of behavior. In recent times, though, men from these ranks have served as the leading players in a series of shocking scandals. Their misconduct has run the gamut of vices​—from adultery and brazen lying to devious financial dealings and embezzlement.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Laments the book <em>The Death of Ethics in America: </em>“While the nation has been preoccupied with the deadly disease . . . Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome, another kind of AIDS [Acquired <em>Integrity </em>Deficiency Syndrome] seems to have become epidemic. Yet it has not prompted similarly urgent calls for a cure.” (Italics ours.) <em>Time </em>magazine claims that the United States is “wallowing in a moral morass.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The moral morass is hardly confined to the United States. In recent times China, Germany, Greece, France, India, Indonesia, Israel, and Japan have also been rocked by scandals involving prominent men. And it should come as no surprise that the unethical conduct of society’s leaders simply mirrors that of the general public. Thailand’s prime minister called corruption in his country “cancerous.” He added that all of society is suffering from a malady rooted in greed and distorted social values.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">People rightfully wonder: ‘What is behind this global drifting of morals? More important, where is it all heading?’</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="ss"><strong>When ‘Stealing Isn’t Stealing’</strong></p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">In Columbus, Ohio, U.S.A., the rear door of an armored truck flew open, and two bags of money fell out. As an estimated two million dollars fluttered in the wind and littered the highway, dozens of motorists dashed from their cars to stuff their pockets and purses with bills. Some motorists summoned others by CB radio to join in the pilfering.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Official pleadings and a 10-percent reward offered for return of any of the money were virtually ignored. Most opted to play “finders keepers.” Only a fraction of the money was ever recovered. One man even justified the theft by saying the money was “a gift from God.” Incidents like this are not isolated, though. Passersby displayed similar greed when money spilled from armored cars in San Francisco, California, and in Toronto, Canada.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">That normally honest and upright people so easily stoop to thievery has disturbing implications. At the very least, it indicates how skewed the popular concepts of morality are. Thomas Pogge, an assistant professor of philosophy at Columbia University in New York, argues that while most people see it as immoral to steal from an individual, they somehow view stealing from an institution as far less reprehensible.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="ss"><strong>Sexual Mores Adrift</strong></p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">A skewed view of morals is seen on the sexual front too. A recent survey showed that people are surprisingly tolerant of political candidates who indulge in adultery. One writer <span id="page4" class="pageNum" data-no="4" data-before-text="4"></span>suggests that such voters may hesitate to condemn adultery because ‘they are so busy trying it themselves.’</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">Indeed, recent statistics reveal that 31 percent of all married people in the United States have had or are currently having an extramarital affair. A majority of Americans, 62 percent, “think that there’s nothing morally wrong” with doing so. Views toward premarital sex are equally permissive. A survey in 1969 showed that 68 percent of the U.S. public then disapproved of premarital sex. Today, only 36 percent disapprove. In the 1960’s, about half of the women surveyed were virgins on their wedding day. Today, only 20 percent are.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="ss"><strong>What Is Ethical?</strong></p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Moral drift is also apparent in the business sector. Two decades ago, only 39 percent of college freshmen surveyed thought that “financial success was important or essential.” By 1989 the figure virtually doubled. Clearly, making money dominates the thinking of many young people​—with alarming moral consequences.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">When 1,093 high school (secondary school) seniors were surveyed, 59 percent said they would be willing to negotiate an illegal deal worth ten million dollars​—even at the risk of six months of probation! Further, 67 percent said they would pad a business expense account; 66 percent said they would lie to achieve a business objective. Yet, youths are merely responding to the ethical tone set by their elders. When 671 business managers were asked their view of business ethics, nearly a quarter contended that ethics can impede their quest for a successful career. More than half admitted to bending the rules to get ahead.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">In an attempt to stem this disturbing trend, some colleges offer courses on ethics. But many are skeptical as to the effectiveness of such efforts. “I just don’t see how ethics classes are going to help,” stated one prominent Canadian businessman. “Students with sound values won’t learn much that is new to them, and the students who don’t have integrity to begin with may just use the insights they gain to find another way of dealing with immoral acts they are going to commit anyway.”</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">Along similar lines, many businesses have established official codes of ethics. Experts claim, though, that such codes are mere window dressing and are rarely given much attention​—except in the wake of a damaging scandal. Ironically, a recent survey revealed that firms with written codes of ethics were charged with unethical conduct more frequently than firms without them!</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">Yes, on all fronts morals are clearly adrift, and no one seems to know where they are heading. Says one business executive: “The landmarks that told us right from wrong aren’t there anymore. They’ve been hammered away.” Why have such moral landmarks vanished? What is replacing them? These issues will be examined in the following articles.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A school in Berlin, Germany, displayed on a huge wall a painting that depicted how apelike creatures supposedly evolved into modern man. Upon coming to school one day, students found that the picture had been covered over with white paint. What had happened?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A 16-year-old student named Natalie, one of Jehovah’s Witnesses, asked her biology teacher why the picture had been obliterated. The teacher explained that a student had given her a copy of <em>Life​—How Did It Get Here? By Evolution or by Creation? </em>The book impressed her so much that she showed it to other teachers on the school’s biology staff. The book fascinated them too.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The teachers, therefore, made the decision to paint over the image, as they said, ‘to prevent manipulating the minds of students in advance.’ So rather than teaching students only the theory of evolution, the teachers planned on also teaching creation, using material from <em>Life​—How Did It Get Here? By Evolution or by Creation?</em></p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">This fascinating publication is published by Jehovah’s Witnesses, an international organization of over four million Bible students who are devoted to helping people learn more about God’s purposes.

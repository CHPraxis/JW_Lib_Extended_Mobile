A Timely Message
As announced in the January 1993 issue of Our Kingdom Ministry, the special public talk for the Memorial season this year will be presented in most congregations on March 28. Its timely message is entitled “‘Acts of God’​—How Do You View Them?” A special effort should be made to invite all interested persons. Those who attend can be encouraged to attend the Memorial celebration on April 6.

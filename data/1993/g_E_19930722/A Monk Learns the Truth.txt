A Monk Learns the Truth
In Djibouti, Africa, a Catholic monk named Louis Pernot obtained from one of Jehovah’s Witnesses the book Your Youth​—Getting the Best Out of It. Louis, who was headmaster of a Catholic school, had often wondered why his religion presented no clear-cut information to help youngsters with their problems.
That very evening Louis began reading the Youth book. In fact, he was so interested in it that he could not put it down. He thought that the true religion should give sound guidance to people without compromising the teachings of the Bible, and now he had found such a book!
The next day Louis told the Witness who had given him the book that he had found the truth. During the same week, he resigned not only as a monk but also as a Catholic. He became one of Jehovah’s Witnesses and began teaching the Bible truths he had learned.
Jehovah’s Witnesses are an international organization of over four million Bible students who are devoted to helping people learn more about God’s purposes. If you would like to have further information or a free home Bible study with one of Jehovah’s Witnesses, please write to Watchtower, 25 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn, New York 11201, or to the appropriate address listed on page 5.

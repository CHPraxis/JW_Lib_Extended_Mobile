People Who Care
JEHOVAH’S WITNESSES are an international organization of over four million Bible students who are organized into over 69,000 congregations worldwide. Not only are the Witnesses devoted to helping people learn more about God’s purposes but they also love one another as Jesus Christ commanded. (John 13:34, 35) This love is manifested in practical ways.
For example, some time ago nearly 30 Witnesses from the East San Marcos, California, Congregation gathered for breakfast at six o’clock one Saturday morning. They had a special project in mind​—helping those in the congregation who needed assistance in caring for their homes.
Some of those in need were single parents, widows, and older couples. The needs of these included roof repairs on their houses, sealing driveways, installing security lights, hanging a garage door, painting, trimming trees, and other jobs. Preparation for the work started more than a month before when needs were identified and materials were secured.
On the appointed Saturday, final preparations were made during breakfast. Work teams were organized, and each received specific assignments. The women arranged refreshments, including a noon meal. The day’s activity had a wonderful effect not only on those whose homes were repaired but on everyone in the congregation.

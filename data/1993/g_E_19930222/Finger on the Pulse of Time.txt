Finger on the Pulse of Time
The Germany branch office of Jehovah’s Witnesses received a letter from a 77-year-old Catholic monk. He explained:
“Since my monastery closed 25 years ago, I have been living in a home for the aged. I do not agree with all your beliefs, but what I read today in The Watchtower makes me admit that you have your finger on the pulse of time. You are truly a watchtower, doing what page two promises, ‘keeping watch on world events as these fulfill Bible prophecy.’
“You courageously and legitimately explain Paul’s words at 1 Thessalonians 5:3: ‘Whenever it is that they are saying: “Peace and security!” then sudden destruction is to be instantly upon them.’ Nowhere in our church do I find such explanations. A person cannot dispute the workings of holy spirit upon Jehovah’s Witnesses. . . . I will be happy to read your magazines regularly.”
By following the example of this Catholic monk, you too can learn more about how world events fulfill Bible prophecy and how God’s Kingdom will soon destroy wickedness and create a global paradise.
If you would like to have further information or a free home Bible study with one of Jehovah’s Witnesses, please write to Watchtower, 25 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn, New York 11201, or to the appropriate address listed on page 5.

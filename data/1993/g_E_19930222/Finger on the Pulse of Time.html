<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">The Germany branch office of Jehovah’s Witnesses received a letter from a 77-year-old Catholic monk. He explained:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“Since my monastery closed 25 years ago, I have been living in a home for the aged. I do not agree with all your beliefs, but what I read today in <em>The Watchtower </em>makes me admit that you have your finger on the pulse of time. You are truly a watchtower, doing what page two promises, ‘keeping watch on world events as these fulfill Bible prophecy.’</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“You courageously and legitimately explain Paul’s words at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/52:5:3-52:5:3" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Thessalonians 5:3</a>: ‘Whenever it is that they are saying: “Peace and security!” then sudden destruction is to be instantly upon them.’ Nowhere in our church do I find such explanations. A person cannot dispute the workings of holy spirit upon Jehovah’s Witnesses. . . . I will be happy to read your magazines regularly.”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">By following the example of this Catholic monk, you too can learn more about how world events fulfill Bible prophecy and how God’s Kingdom will soon destroy wickedness and create a global paradise.</p>

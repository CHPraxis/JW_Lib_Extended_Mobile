<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">UNEMPLOYMENT. Rising prices. Poverty. Economic depression. These words appear with increasing frequency in the news bulletins. And they reflect the difficulties that millions face as they try to feed and clothe their families and keep a roof over their heads.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Believers and unbelievers alike are affected. But believers are not left to themselves in facing those problems. Jesus, speaking to humble people of the first century, said: “Observe intently the birds of heaven, because they do not sow seed or reap or gather into storehouses; still your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not worth more than they are?”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:26-40:6:26" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matthew 6:26</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Jesus also said: “Take a lesson from the lilies of the field, how they are growing; they do not toil, nor do they spin; but I say to you that not even Solomon in all his glory was arrayed as one of these. If, now, God thus clothes the vegetation of the field, . . . will he not much rather clothe you?”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:28-40:6:30" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matthew 6:28-30</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Does this mean that a Christian does not need to work for a living? By no means! A Christian works as hard as necessary to pay his bills. The apostle Paul said: “If anyone does not want to work, neither let him eat.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/53:3:10-53:3:10" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2 Thessalonians 3:10</a>) Nevertheless, the Christian is conscious of God’s loving care and has faith that his heavenly Father watches over him. Thus, he is not thrown off balance by the anxieties of life. Even in difficult times, he puts first things​—spiritual things—​first. He believes Jesus’ words: “Keep on, then, seeking first the kingdom and his righteousness, and all these other things will be added to you.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:33-40:6:33" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Matthew 6:33</a>.</p>

<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn">We should change the subject mentally, go for a walk, do some reading, or perform some household chore. Prayer is also a powerful aid in such a situation. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:62:8-19:62:8" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 62:8</a>)​—4/15, page 17.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn">▫ <strong>Why should young people be careful as to the kind of music they listen to?</strong></p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn">Music has the power to move, to enthrall, and to influence.

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sn">▫ <strong>What is meant by the expression “the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ”? (</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/52:5:23-52:5:23" data-bid="2-1" class="b"><strong>1 Thessalonians 5:23</strong></a><strong>)</strong></p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sn">This refers to the invisible royal presence of the Lord Jesus Christ as King, from 1914, and following his enthronement in heaven. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:110:1-19:110:2" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Psalm 110:1, 2</a>)​—5/1, page 11.</p>

<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sn">Jehovah wanted his temple to be in a clean condition so that when large numbers of worshipers with earthly hopes were brought there, they would find a place where his universal sovereignty is respected, where his divine name is sanctified, and where his righteous laws are obeyed.​—5/1, page 16.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sn"><strong>▫ What are the “belongings” that Christ Jesus gives to his appointed slave? (</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:45-40:24:47" data-bid="5-1" class="b"><strong>Matthew 24:45-47</strong></a><strong>)</strong></p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sn">These “belongings” refer to all the spiritual assets on earth that have become Christ’s property in connection with his authority as heavenly King.

<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sn">A Christian elder who cares for the sheep will perform his shepherding willingly, of his own free will, under the direction of the Fine Shepherd, Jesus Christ. Serving willingly also means that a Christian shepherd submits to the authority of Jehovah and manifests respect for the theocratic arrangement.​—5/15, page 20.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sn"><strong>▫ What did Jesus mean when he said that anyone following him had to “disown himself”? (</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:16:24-40:16:24" data-bid="8-1" class="b"><strong>Matthew 16:24</strong></a><strong>)</strong></p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sn">To ‘disown yourself’ means that you relinquish ownership of yourself to Jehovah.

<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sn">One reason was that Abraham was God’s friend. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:2:23-59:2:23" data-bid="12-1" class="b">James 2:23</a>) Further, Jehovah was aware of Abraham’s distressed feelings. God knew that Abraham’s nephew Lot lived in Sodom and that Abraham was very concerned about Lot’s safety.

<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sn"><strong>▫ Did the Protestant Reformation of the 16th century mark a return to true Christianity?</strong></p>

<p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sn">Though free to enjoy pleasure within his own marriage, David let illicit sexual desire grow.

The same can happen to any one of God’s servants if he does not shun this form of greed. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:1:14-59:1:15" data-bid="17-1" class="b">James 1:14, 15</a>)​—8/1, page 14.</p>

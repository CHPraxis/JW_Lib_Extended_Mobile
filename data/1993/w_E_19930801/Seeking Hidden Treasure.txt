Seeking Hidden Treasure
IN 1848 gold was discovered at Sutter’s Mill in California, U.S.A. By 1849 thousands were converging on the area hoping to strike it rich, and the greatest gold rush in the history of the United States was under way. In a year’s time, the nearest port, San Francisco, grew from a small town to a city of 25,000. The prospect of sudden wealth proved to be a powerful lure.
King Solomon of ancient Israel knew how energetically men dig for hidden treasure, and he referred to this when he wrote: “If, moreover, you call out for understanding itself and you give forth your voice for discernment itself, if you keep seeking for it as for silver, and as for hid treasures you keep searching for it, in that case you will understand the fear of Jehovah, and you will find the very knowledge of God.”​—Proverbs 2:3-5.
You can do many things with gold and silver, but you can do more with understanding and discernment. These will help you to make right decisions, solve problems, succeed in marriage, and find happiness. (Proverbs 2:11, 12) Similarly, true knowledge and wisdom will help you to know your Creator, understand his purposes, and obey and please him. Gold can give you none of these things.
The Bible’s words are true: “Wisdom is a shelter as money is a shelter, but the advantage of knowledge is this: that wisdom preserves the life of its possessor.” (Ecclesiastes 7:12, New International Version) While many dream of sudden riches, how much wiser it is to open the Bible and dig for the discernment, understanding, knowledge, and wisdom that are true wealth.

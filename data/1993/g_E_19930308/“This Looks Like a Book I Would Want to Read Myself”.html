<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Jessica, a 16-year-old student at a New York City high school, wrote to <em>Awake!: </em>“I have a history teacher that nobody, I mean <em>nobody, </em>likes. He assigned the class group projects on ‘The Great Religions.’ My group got Islam. I was not worried because I knew I would be well equipped with the book <em>Mankind’s Search for God. </em>I mustered up the best report that I could.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“The day came when our group had to give our oral report. The teacher was interrupting and yelling at the students, so I was a little nervous. When it was my turn, I told the class about the unique features of Islam. I passed the <em>Search </em>book around, instructing the students to look at the pictures on pages 286 and 289. When the teacher looked through the book, he interrupted me saying, ‘Excuse me, is this your book? Can I hold on to it?’ I answered, ‘I can get you your own copy if you’d like.’ His face lit up, and he said: ‘That would be excellent. This looks like a book I would want to read myself.’ My heart was beating so hard with excitement and surprise, I just stumbled through the rest of my report.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“He gave me one of the highest grades in the class (95) on that report. I thank Jehovah God and you brothers for giving us such a valuable tool as <em>Mankind’s Search for God.”</em></p>

1993 Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses
Containing Report for the Service Year of 1992
No matter how long we have served the true God, may we always be determined to focus our heart entirely upon Jehovah and thus echo the prayer of King David, our 1993 yeartext: “Instruct me, O Jehovah . . . Unify my heart to fear your name.”​—PSALM 86:11.

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">JESUS says he knows his sheep. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:10:14-43:10:14" data-bid="1-1" class="b">John 10:14</a>) If a person has a good heart and a love for peace and righteousness, that one will be drawn to Jesus’ followers. Such an individual will find a purpose in life, as did one woman in Belgium. This is her story:</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“When Jehovah’s Witnesses knocked on my door, I was very depressed and thinking of putting an end to my life. I liked what the Witnesses said about the solution to the problems of this sick world but did not like the idea that God had a part to play. I had stopped going to church eight years before, as I hated the hypocrisy I saw there. With the Witnesses, though, I recognized the ring of truth in what they said and came to realize that, after all, it is hard to live without God.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">“Unhappily, after a few visits, contact with the Witnesses was lost. I felt miserable. I smoked two packs of cigarettes a day and even turned to drugs. Wanting to communicate with my deceased grandfather, I dabbled in spiritism. How frightened I was when alone at night I experienced demon attacks as a result! This lasted for months. Each evening I was terrified at the thought of being alone.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">“Then, one day I went for a walk, taking a route different from my usual one, and I came to a huge building site. To my surprise I saw a great crowd there. Coming closer, I saw it was Jehovah’s Witnesses in the process of constructing a Kingdom Hall. I remembered the visits the Witnesses had made at my home, and I thought how wonderful it would be if the whole world could live as these people did.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">“I really wished that the Witnesses would come back to my home, so I spoke to some of those working on the hall. I prayed to God, and ten days later the man who had first contacted me was at my door. He suggested that we continue the Bible study, and I gladly agreed. Right away he invited me to the meetings at the Kingdom Hall. I accepted. Never had I seen such a sight! I had searched so long for people who loved one another and were happy. And here they were at last!</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">“Thereafter I went to all the meetings. After about three weeks, I stopped the bad habit of smoking. I threw away my books on astrology and my records with satanic music, and I could feel that the demons were losing their grip on me. I put my life in order according to Jehovah’s Bible standards, and after three months I started preaching the good news. After six months I was baptized. Two days after my baptism, I started auxiliary pioneering.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">“I thank Jehovah for all the good things he has done for me. My life has a purpose at last. Yes, Jehovah’s name is a strong tower in which I found refuge and protection. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:18:10-20:18:10" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Proverbs 18:10</a>) I really feel as did the psalmist when he wrote <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:84:10-19:84:10" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Psalm 84:10</a>: ‘A day in your courtyards is better than a thousand elsewhere! I have chosen to stand at the threshold in the house of my God rather than to move around in the tents of wickedness.’”</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">This meekhearted woman found a purpose in life. So can anyone who searches for Jehovah with a good heart.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Why so? The event was the death of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">It served to vindicate God’s sovereignty and proved that a human could keep perfect integrity to God. It opened to mankind the prospect of attaining everlasting life in paradise conditions. Jesus himself instituted a memorial of his death on the night before he died.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">It was a simple ceremony. During it, Jesus told his disciples: “Keep doing this in remembrance of me.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:22:19-42:22:20" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Luke 22:19, 20</a>) Will you remember? Jehovah’s Witnesses invite you to join them in commemorating this most important event in history. This year the date is Tuesday, April 6, after sundown.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Please check at a Kingdom Hall near you for the exact time and place. No collections will be taken, and visitors are invited to listen to an instructive talk and observe the simple proceedings.</p>

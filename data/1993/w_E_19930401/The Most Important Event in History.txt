The Most Important Event in History
Why so? The event was the death of Jesus Christ.
It served to vindicate God’s sovereignty and proved that a human could keep perfect integrity to God. It opened to mankind the prospect of attaining everlasting life in paradise conditions. Jesus himself instituted a memorial of his death on the night before he died.
It was a simple ceremony. During it, Jesus told his disciples: “Keep doing this in remembrance of me.” (Luke 22:19, 20) Will you remember? Jehovah’s Witnesses invite you to join them in commemorating this most important event in history. This year the date is Tuesday, April 6, after sundown.
Please check at a Kingdom Hall near you for the exact time and place. No collections will be taken, and visitors are invited to listen to an instructive talk and observe the simple proceedings.

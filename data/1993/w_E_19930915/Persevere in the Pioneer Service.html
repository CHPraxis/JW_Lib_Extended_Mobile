<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">SOME 4,500,000 Witnesses of Jehovah are declaring the good news worldwide. Among them are over 600,000 pioneers, or full-time Kingdom proclaimers. Those in this army of pioneers range in age from preteens to retirees in their 90’s. They come from all backgrounds and walks of life.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Doubtless, all these full-time preachers want to succeed in the pioneer ministry. Many wish to make it their lifetime career. Some are unable to do so for certain reasons. Yet, others have been able to continue pioneering despite financial difficulties, poor health, discouragement, and other problems. So how can full-time preachers cope with such problems and still persevere in the pioneer service?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="ss"><strong>Meeting Financial Needs</strong></p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">In general, pioneers work secularly to cover their expenses, as did the apostle Paul. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/52:2:9-52:2:9" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Thessalonians 2:9</a>) In most parts of the world, they face skyrocketing prices for food, clothing, shelter, and transportation. Often it is difficult to obtain the part-time secular work they need. If available, such jobs frequently offer only minimum wages, without health insurance benefits.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">If we ‘keep on seeking first God’s Kingdom and his righteousness,’ we can have faith that Jehovah will provide for our material needs. When under financial pressure, therefore, pioneers need ‘not be anxious about the next day.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:25-40:6:34" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matthew 6:25-34</a>) While they make earnest efforts to resolve such problems, strong faith in Jehovah will spare them undue anxiety.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">When a person is faced with financial difficulties, perhaps expenses can be reduced. With some budget changes, it may be possible to meet needs, though not mere wants of a material sort. To reduce expenses, some pioneers share an apartment with other Christians. In assisting their children to pioneer, parents sometimes provide lodging free or at a minimal cost. Others help pioneers with food and transportation costs. But pioneers would not want to be a burden <span id="page29" class="pageNum" data-no="29" data-before-text="29"></span>to others, for they have a Scriptural duty to support themselves.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/53:3:10-53:3:12" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2 Thessalonians 3:10-12</a>.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Transportation costs can be reduced by sharing expenses with other pioneers. If two pioneers own cars, they might engage in the preaching work together in the same area, using one car and eliminating the expense of operating two vehicles. Pioneers who do not own automobiles may be able to team up with those who do and share in covering the transportation costs. Travel expenses can be reduced further by covering nearby territories mainly by walking. In many countries pioneers use economical public transportation.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Among those who overcame financial problems and persevered in full-time service were Newton Cantwell and his wife. They sold their farm and began pioneering with six of their seven children in 1932, during the Great Depression. “It was not long before we had spent all that we received from the sale of our farm​—mainly on doctor bills,” wrote Brother Cantwell. “We recall that when we moved to our second assignment, we had just enough to pay two weeks’ rent in advance, with five dollars to spare. Nevertheless, we knew that Jehovah would provide as long as we diligently carried out our service. . . . We learned to economize in various ways. On moving into a new territory, I would, for example, speak to some of the gas station owners and explain that we had three cars on the road each day in connection with our Christian work. This usually resulted in our obtaining gasoline at a discount. Our sons soon learned to take care of our auto repairs, saving us much in garage bills.” The Cantwells thus coped successfully with financial challenges and persevered in full-time service. Brother Cantwell was still on the pioneer list when he died at the age of 103.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="ss"><strong>Obtaining Part-Time Work</strong></p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Many pioneers support themselves financially by means of part-time jobs. To sustain himself in the ministry at Corinth, Paul worked as a tentmaker along with his fellow believers Aquila and Priscilla. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:18:1-44:18:11" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Acts 18:1-11</a>) Today, spiritual brothers are often happy to offer pioneers part-time secular work. Other pioneers obtain such work through employment agencies that offer temporary jobs. Faith in God is essential, and so is earnest prayer for his guidance in making employment decisions.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:15:29-20:15:29" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Proverbs 15:29</a>.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">“After drawing much strength from prayerful consideration,” said one pioneer, “I notified my supervisor that my ministerial work is a serious personal responsibility and that I would not be able to accept the full-time position. The following Wednesday, I was asked if I would reconsider the job but on a part-time basis. I gladly accepted.” Do not underestimate the power of prayer, and follow up your prayers with actions.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Pioneers may find it advisable to tell prospective employers that their purpose in seeking part-time work is to sustain themselves in the ministry. They might mention the days they are available and the number of hours a week they can devote to a job. Two fleshly sisters were able to split a full-time job in a legal firm, allowing each of them to work two and a half days a week. This sustained them as pioneers until they attended the Watchtower Bible School of Gilead and received missionary assignments.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Various types of Scripturally acceptable work can be found by talking with fellow believers and others or by consulting newspaper advertisements. Humility is helpful, for it can keep pioneers from being too selective about the type of work they would do. (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:4:10-59:4:10" data-bid="6-1" class="b">James 4:10</a>.) To continue pioneering they may need to do secular work that some people consider lowly or menial. If <span id="page30" class="pageNum" data-no="30" data-before-text="30"></span>such work is accepted but something different is desired, a change in employment may eventually be possible.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="ss"><strong>Poor Health and Discouragement</strong></p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">Some must discontinue their pioneer service because of serious health problems. If pioneers are not hasty in this regard, however, they may find that a sickness can be cured or health can improve sufficiently for them to continue pioneering. Many can pioneer despite health problems because they get medical treatment, stick to a diet suitable for them, and get needed rest and exercise. A traveling overseer observed one pioneer sister so afflicted with arthritis that she needed help to walk from house to house in the ministry. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:20:20-44:20:20" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Acts 20:20</a>) Yet, she and her husband conducted 33 home Bible studies and had helped 83 people to accept God’s truth. Her health improved in time, and she attended the Pioneer Service School 11 years later.</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">Discouragement may cause some to leave the pioneer ministry. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:24:10-20:24:10" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Proverbs 24:10</a>) One pioneer told a traveling overseer: “I’m going to stop pioneering. . . . I have bills to pay.” He needed eyeglasses that cost 20 dollars. “Are you going to quit pioneering because of a 20-dollar need?” asked the overseer. It was suggested that the pioneer work in the local coffee plantation for a day, earn the 20 dollars, buy the glasses, and keep on pioneering. Further conversation revealed that the basic problem was discouragement over expensive car repairs. It was recommended that the pioneer reduce expenses by driving each day within a radius of a few miles instead of over a large area. He was also advised to maintain his spirituality. The pioneer applied the advice and six months later received his call to attend Gilead School. After graduation he was assigned to a foreign country and served there faithfully for many years until his death. Yes, great blessings often result if we do not succumb to discouragement but bear in mind that Jehovah is with us.</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="ss"><strong>Treasure Your Privilege of Service</strong></p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">Despite trials, such as cases of need and times without food, Paul viewed his ministry as a treasure. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:4:7-47:4:7" data-bid="9-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 4:7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:6:3-47:6:6" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 6:3-6</a>) In the face of hardship and persecution today, many of Jehovah’s servants in Africa, Asia, Eastern Europe, and elsewhere have held on to their privilege of pioneering. When trials are encountered, therefore, make every effort to persevere in this privileged service, to Jehovah’s praise.</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">Most pioneers were able to enter the full-time preaching work only because they simplified their life-style. Like Paul, they resisted materialistic enticements and cultivated contentment with “sustenance and covering.” To persevere in the pioneer service, they need to remain contented with the necessary things. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:6:8-54:6:8" data-bid="10-1" class="b">1 Timothy 6:8</a>) Joy results from treasuring our God-given privileges, placing them above material possessions.</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">To illustrate: Anton Koerber was privileged to represent Kingdom interests to government officials in Washington, D.C. He served as a pioneer for some time and was a circuit overseer in the 1950’s. Some of his former business associates once approached him with a proposition that would enable him to clear a million dollars for himself. To do so, however, it would have been necessary for him to devote all his time to business affairs for about a year. After praying for guidance and the spirit of a sound mind, he said: “It is not possible for me to give up my wonderful privileges of serving Jehovah here for even just one year, no, not for all the money in the world. Serving my <span id="page31" class="pageNum" data-no="31" data-before-text="31"></span>brothers here in Washington is more precious to me, and here I know I have Jehovah’s blessing. I no doubt would make a million dollars, but at the end of the year of that kind of life, what would I be like spiritually, or even physically?” He therefore declined the offer. Treasuring their privileges in a similar way helps many to persevere in the pioneer service.</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">What grand blessings pioneers enjoy! It is a blessing to spend many hours speaking about Jehovah’s glorious kingship. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:145:11-19:145:13" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Psalm 145:11-13</a>) Because of devoting so much time to the ministry, pioneers have the blessing of bringing spiritual comfort to the poor and oppressed, sick or bereaved, and others sorely distressed and in need of a sure hope. Hence, if circumstances permit us to engage in the full-time preaching work, we will indeed enjoy many blessings. It is ‘the blessing of Jehovah that makes rich.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:10:22-20:10:22" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Proverbs 10:22</a>) And it is with his help and blessing that the many Kingdom proclaimers joyfully persevere in the pioneer service.</p>

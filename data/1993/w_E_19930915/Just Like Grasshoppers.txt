Just Like Grasshoppers
HAVE you ever strolled across a meadow in summer and seen countless grasshoppers leap out of your path? They seemed to be everywhere, though you may have paid them scant attention. After all, they appear harmless and insignificant.
Yet, the virtual insignificance of grasshoppers makes them a suitable symbol of mankind. Although some prominent men may consider themselves highly important, our Creator thinks otherwise. His prophet Isaiah said: “There is One who is dwelling above the circle of the earth, the dwellers in which are as grasshoppers.”​—Isaiah 40:22.
Jehovah God’s grandeur, might, and wisdom elevate him far above the realm of mere humans, just as man is far superior to the grasshopper in intellect and power. However, God’s supreme quality is love. And his matchless love impels him to take notice of us, help us, and save us​—if we love and obey him. Jehovah deals with us lovingly, even though we are like insignificant grasshoppers. The psalmist said: “Who is like Jehovah our God, him who is making his dwelling on high? He is condescending to look on heaven and earth, raising up the lowly one from the very dust.”​—Psalm 113:5-7.
As this psalm explains, Jehovah lovingly extends help to the lowly one. Yes, He helps those who humbly ‘seek God that they may really find him.’ (Acts 17:27) Those who do find God​—and serve him—​even become precious in his eyes. (Compare Isaiah 43:4, 10.) The humble grasshopper thus serves to remind us of our own insignificance and of the love of our almighty Creator, who grants obedient humans his friendship and undeserved kindness. Are you showing appreciation for God’s love?

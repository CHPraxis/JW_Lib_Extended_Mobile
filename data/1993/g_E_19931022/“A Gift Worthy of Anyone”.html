<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">That is what an 82-year-old man in Switzerland wrote regarding the book <em>The Greatest Man Who Ever Lived. </em>The book, which was first published in 1991, presents within 133 chapters every event in Jesus’ earthly life as set out in the four Gospels. Why was the reader so thrilled?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“The book makes for good reading,” he wrote. “It has legible type and excellent grammar, which is not the case with many other books.” The man also marveled at the more than 200 color illustrations, which “are so true to life.” He added: “The gestures, the facial expressions, and the gentle colors are so realistic.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The elderly gentleman suggests that people give the book to others as a present. He considers this “marvelous and instructive book . . . a gift worthy of anyone.” So do we.</p>

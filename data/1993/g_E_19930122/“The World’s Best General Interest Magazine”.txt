“The World’s Best General Interest Magazine”
THAT is how a letter last year to the Nigeria branch office of Jehovah’s Witnesses described Awake! The writer explained:
“I work with Eko magazine, a city publication of Newswatch, Nigeria’s most widely read international magazine. I have been a subscriber to Awake! since 1985, though not a Witness. The other day while we were at the production of the next edition of Eko, I left the Awake! I was reading [April 22, 1991] on the table to attend to a minor task.
“One of my colleagues picked it up for a quick browse, but she spent the time reading the entire series of articles on divorce. Another person got the magazine from her, and yet another, and yet another. One of them, a practicing Orthodox Christian, told me that she used to ignore Awake! and never thought you could feature ‘such interesting, amazingly educational articles,’ and she immediately asked me how to go about subscribing. Another asked me to make my magazines available to him whenever I receive them.
“Indeed, I have no wish to become a Witness, yet I have never regretted my decision to subscribe to Awake! Thank you, and congratulations on the world’s best general interest magazine.”
Jehovah’s Witnesses are an international organization of over four million Bible students who are devoted to helping people learn more about God’s purposes.

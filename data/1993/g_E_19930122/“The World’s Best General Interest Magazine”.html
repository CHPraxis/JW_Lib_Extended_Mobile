<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">THAT is how a letter last year to the Nigeria branch office of Jehovah’s Witnesses described <em>Awake! </em>The writer explained:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“I work with <em>Eko </em>magazine, a city publication of <em>Newswatch, </em>Nigeria’s most widely read international magazine. I have been a subscriber to <em>Awake! </em>since 1985, though not a Witness. The other day while we were at the production of the next edition of <em>Eko, </em>I left the <em>Awake! </em>I was reading [April 22, 1991] on the table to attend to a minor task.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“One of my colleagues picked it up for a quick browse, but she spent the time reading the entire series of articles on divorce. Another person got the magazine from her, and yet another, and yet another. One of them, a practicing Orthodox Christian, told me that she used to ignore <em>Awake! </em>and never thought you could feature ‘such interesting, amazingly educational articles,’ and she immediately asked me how to go about subscribing. Another asked me to make my magazines available to him whenever I receive them.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">“Indeed, I have no wish to become a Witness, yet I have never regretted my decision to subscribe to <em>Awake! </em>Thank you, and congratulations on the world’s best general interest magazine.”</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">DO YOU know of anything so valuable that you would willingly sacrifice everything you own in order to possess it? Jesus did, and he spoke of it to his followers.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">He said: “The kingdom of the heavens is like a traveling merchant seeking fine pearls. Upon finding one pearl of high value, away he went and promptly sold all the things he had and bought it.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:13:45-40:13:46" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matthew 13:45, 46</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">That merchant was willing to give up everything in order to possess the “pearl,” God’s Kingdom. Why? Because there is nothing in this world to compare with it. God’s Kingdom will solve the problems that man has been unable to solve, such as war, hunger, crime, and oppression. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:72:4-19:72:8" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Psalm 72:4-8,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:72:13-19:72:14" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 13, 14</a>) Under the Kingdom, even sin, disease, and death will be no more. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:4-66:21:5" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Revelation 21:4, 5</a>) No wonder the second petition of the Lord’s Prayer (the “Our Father”) is, “Let your kingdom come”!​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:9-40:6:10" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Matthew 6:9, 10</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">What would you give to share in the Kingdom’s blessings? In fact, the blessings are free. But in order to enjoy them, you have to know what the Kingdom is, believe that it is a reality, and give it first place in your life. Can you do that? There is information in the Bible that will help you. Why not allow Jehovah’s Witnesses to assist you in learning about God’s Kingdom and finding how it can benefit you even now.</p>

▪ The Society is now producing English bound volumes of The Watchtower for the years 1986 to 1991 as permanent stock items. Any interested in obtaining these bound volumes should request them through the congregation. Future years of the English Watchtower bound volumes, as well as those for 1992, will be permanent stock items and may be requested at any time. Please bear in mind that bound volumes are special-​request items.
▪ Another release on computer diskettes is available: New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures​—With References/​Insight on the Scriptures. This release contains the New World Translation and both volumes of Insight. This is available only in English on 5 1/4-inch 1.2-megabyte or 3 1/2-inch 1.44-​megabyte diskettes.

Diskettes containing only the Bible will continue to be available.
▪ The Society is now working on a CD-​ROM to use with computers. This is a compact disk with read-​only memory. It will allow one to view on a computer screen any reference from the New World Translation, the Insight volumes, The Watchtower from 1950 to 1993, and many other of our copyrighted publications. The CD-​ROM will include a versatile, Society-​designed program to search those publications. An appropriate device for reading CD-​ROMs will be needed. This CD-​ROM should be available early next year. Please do not write or telephone the Society for information. When technical information is finalized, we will send a letter to all congregations, giving details about equipment needed to use this new CD-​ROM.

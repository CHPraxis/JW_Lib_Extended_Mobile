<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">HAVE you ever met one of Jehovah’s Witnesses face to face? Have you ever had the opportunity to find out what they really believe? Probably you have had a brief encounter with a Witness on the street or at your door. But often that fails to allow time for a real meeting of the minds.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">George Plagenz, a U.S. religion columnist, wrote about his experiences with Witnesses: “To paraphrase [American humorist] Will Rogers, who said he had never met a man he didn’t like, I have never met a Jehovah’s Witness I haven’t liked.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Then Plagenz quoted the Irish author Alan Bestic: “The rank-and-file of this much-abused movement are gregarious, cheerful and happy people. At their international assembly in London [England], I was treated with the utmost kindness, gentle courtesy and genuine friendliness by every Witness I met.”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Plagenz says that former aggressive door-to-door methods of some Witnesses created a lot of ill will. “But most of that has changed.” Then he quotes a Witness spokesman: “Most who are Witnesses today once slammed the door in the face of a Witness caller.” Why is there a more positive response nowadays? “It is beginning to dawn on people . . . that there is no human solution to the enormous problems the world faces.”</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Jehovah’s Witnesses believe that the only complete answer to mankind’s problems is indicated in Jesus’ prayer: “Our Father in the heavens, let your name be sanctified. Let your kingdom come. Let your will take place, as in heaven, also upon earth.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:9-40:6:10" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matthew 6:9, 10</a>) Rulership by God’s Kingdom, acknowledged by an obedient and meek human family, is the only solution to the violence and hatred presently racking the world.

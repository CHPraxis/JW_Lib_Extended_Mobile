The Water of Life
“LET anyone hearing say: ‘Come!’ And let anyone thirsting come; let anyone that wishes take life’s water free.” (Revelation 22:17) “Life’s water”​—that means all of God’s provisions for our salvation based on the ransom sacrifice of Jesus Christ. These provisions are available, and they are free. What wonderful generosity on the part of our God! Why, though, are they symbolized by water?
Well, literal water makes possible the growth of vegetation in the soil, and that makes human life possible. Without water, plant life, and thus human life, cannot exist. Further, your body is 65 percent water. Some health specialists recommend maintaining that ratio by taking in about two and a half quarts [2.4 liters] of water a day. All your internal life processes​—from digesting food to getting rid of waste—​require water. Go a week without water, and you die.
Similarly, “life’s water” makes possible and nourishes spiritual life. If we reject the water of life, we have no lasting future. (John 3:36) If we accept it, we can gain everlasting life. No wonder the Samaritan woman responded with interest when Jesus said to her: “Whoever drinks from the water that I will give him will never get thirsty at all, but the water that I will give him will become in him a fountain of water bubbling up to impart everlasting life”! (John 4:14) May we reach out with eagerness and take life’s water free.

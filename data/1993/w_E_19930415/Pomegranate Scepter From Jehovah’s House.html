<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">ARCHAEOLOGISTS in Israel have uncovered many scepters, rods carried by persons in authority. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:49:10-1:49:10" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Genesis 49:10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/17:8:4-17:8:4" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Esther 8:4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:19:14-26:19:14" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> Ezekiel 19:14</a>) Some scepters found in Lachish had a head in the shape of a pomegranate. God’s people knew this fruit well.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:8:8-5:8:8" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 8:8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/22:4:13-22:4:13" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Song of Solomon 4:13</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The ivory pomegranate in the blossom stage, at left, came to light not long ago. It is 1.68 inches high, and a hole in its base suggests that it was part of a scepter. Note the letters inscribed in the early Hebrew style dated to the eighth century B.C.E.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Part of the ivory was broken off in ancient times, so a few letters are missing or only partially present. Yet, specialists in ancient writing propose the restoration drawn below. (Based on <em>Biblical Archaeologist</em>) Irregular spacing between the letters has led to two principal readings. French scholar André Lemaire offered the reading “Belonging to the Tem[ple of the Lor]d [Yahweh], holy to the priests.” Nahman Avigad proposed “Sacred donation for the priests of (in) the House of Yahweh.”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">They and other scholars concluded that the scepter originally bore the four Hebrew characters of God’s personal name​—Jehovah. So it would have mentioned “the house of Jehovah,” a phrase common in the Bible.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:23:19-2:23:19" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Exodus 23:19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:8:10-11:8:11" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 1 Kings 8:10, 11</a>.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Many still feel that this scepter head may have been owned by a priest at the temple Solomon built or that it was donated to that temple. Interestingly, the pomegranate design was often seen at God’s temple.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:28:31-2:28:35" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Exodus 28:31-35;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:7:15-11:7:20" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 1 Kings 7:15-20</a>.</p>

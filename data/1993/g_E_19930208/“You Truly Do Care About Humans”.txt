“You Truly Do Care About Humans”
That was the conclusion drawn by a man in California, U.S.A., who enjoys reading publications of the Watch Tower Society. Of the book The Greatest Man Who Ever Lived, he writes:
“I am now reading it through a second time, and it is just never dull reading. Not only is the book very instructive but the color illustrations are so lifelike. Each picture makes me feel as if I’m back in Jesus’ time.
“For instance, the demon-possessed man in the illustration in chapter 45 truly looks wild and dangerous. Yet Jesus is shown coming ashore unafraid and removing the demon spirits . . .
“All the drawings of the hateful Jewish leaders are a work of art. They show how angry a person can look when he is faced with having to deal with Jesus and yet will not give up his sinful ways. I could go on and on. . . . You truly do care about humans . . .
“I am not one of Jehovah’s Witnesses but love receiving The Watchtower and Awake! I wait eagerly for each issue, and when it arrives, it is the best part of my day’s mail. The June 22 Awake! was an award winner! ‘Rearing Children in an Immoral World’ couldn’t be a more timely subject. . . .
“I’m 35 years old and have come to realize that this old world is in big trouble. I’m glad you are out there telling it like it is and how God feels about it.”
Jehovah’s Witnesses are an international organization of over four million Bible students who are devoted to helping people learn more about God’s purposes.

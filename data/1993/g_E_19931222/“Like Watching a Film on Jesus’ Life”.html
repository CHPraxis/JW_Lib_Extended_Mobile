<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A woman in France likened reading the book <em>The Greatest Man Who Ever Lived </em>to watching such a film. The book makes an effort to discuss every event in Jesus’ earthly life that is set forth in the Gospels. And to the extent possible, each of these events is related in chronological order. The woman explained:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“When I got to the end of the book, I felt as if I had been invited by Jesus to associate with him, to live by his side, to share his joys, his emotions, in short, every aspect of his ministry. The magnificent illustrations truly convey the feelings and personalities of all those who associated with Jesus and even of Jesus himself. Reading the book from cover to cover is like watching a film on Jesus’ life.”</p>

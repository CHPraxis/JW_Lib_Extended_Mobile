<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Blood transfusions are common in modern medicine, but do they measure up to their reputation? What do you think?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">In <em>The American Journal of Medicine </em>(February 1993), Dr. Craig S. Kitchens asked: “Are Transfusions Overrated?” He noted that physicians often weigh whether the benefit of a therapy is more than the risk it might bring. What about transfusions?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Kitchens reviewed recent evidence of many risks linked with transfusions, such as hepatitis, compromised immunity, organ system failure, and graft-versus-host reactions. One study summarizing “a myriad of complications” from blood transfusions “concluded that each transfusion event has an aggregate 20% chance for some adverse reaction, some of which are minor but others deleterious,” even fatal.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">However, do the supposed benefits justify facing such risks?</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Dr. Kitchens reviewed 16 reported studies involving 1,404 operations on Jehovah’s Witnesses, who refuse transfusions in obedience to the Bible command to ‘abstain from blood.’​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:15:28-44:15:29" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Acts 15:28, 29</a>.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">The result? “The Jehovah’s Witness patients’ decision to forego transfusions for major surgical procedures appears to add 0.5% to 1.5% mortality to the overall operative risk. Less clear is how much morbidity and mortality are avoided by this practice, but <em>they probably exceed the risk of not being transfused.” </em>(Italics ours.) His point? Any medical risk of refusing blood is probably less than the risks involved in accepting blood transfusions.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Hence, Kitchens’ reasonable question: “If not transfusing Jehovah’s Witnesses actually results in little acute extra morbidity and mortality and avoids a significant amount of costs and chronic complications, should patients receive fewer transfusions?”</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Those who refuse transfusions on the basis of such evidence will also be acting in harmony with directions from our Creator.</p>

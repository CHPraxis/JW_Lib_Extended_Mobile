<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>‘Do what?’ you ask. <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:3:27-20:3:27" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Proverbs 3:27</a> answers: “Do not hold back good from those to whom it is owing, when it happens to be in the power of your hand to <em>do it.” </em>Is it “in the power of your hand” to expand your activities and share in the auxiliary or the regular pioneer service? Can you do that?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>How encouraging it was to read in the <em>1993 Yearbook </em>that there was an average of 106,031 regular and auxiliary pioneers in the United States, a ratio of 1 pioneer to 8 publishers. Yes, 5,093 entered the pioneer service last year. This amounts to almost 14 publishers a day who examined their circumstances and discovered they could do more in the ministry.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>Auxiliary pioneering is an avenue of doing good to others. Last year there was a peak of 105,748 auxiliary pioneers. That is excellent. Many publishers are seeking ways to auxiliary pioneer more often throughout the year.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>To determine whether you can “do it” or not, you first need to consider your heartfelt desire. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:22:37-40:22:39" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matt. 22:37-39</a>) <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:20:35-44:20:35" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Acts 20:35</a> says: “There is more happiness in giving than there is in receiving.” Undoubtedly, those who give spiritual assistance generously from the heart have the right desire. To be a successful publisher or pioneer, that desire is essential.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>Second, consider your present circumstances. Can you make adjustments in your daily affairs to serve full-​time? Not everyone can. But after prayerful self-​examination, every year thousands find a way to “do it.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:4:5-51:4:5" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Col. 4:5</a>; <a class="xt" data-xtid="13" href="jwpub://p/E:1977849/5:570-13:212"><em>w</em>77 p. 701</a>) For example, some families select particular months for some or all members of the family to auxiliary pioneer. Other families sponsor one of their members as a regular pioneer. Has your family given consideration to these possibilities?​—See <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:11:25-20:11:25" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Proverbs 11:25</a>.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup>Helping others to know the truth is what brings genuine satisfaction, whether you serve as a publisher or as a pioneer. We know that true joy comes from doing good to others, especially if it happens to be ‘in the power of our hand to do it.’</p>

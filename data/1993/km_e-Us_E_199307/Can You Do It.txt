Can You Do It?
1 ‘Do what?’ you ask. Proverbs 3:27 answers: “Do not hold back good from those to whom it is owing, when it happens to be in the power of your hand to do it.” Is it “in the power of your hand” to expand your activities and share in the auxiliary or the regular pioneer service? Can you do that?
2 How encouraging it was to read in the 1993 Yearbook that there was an average of 106,031 regular and auxiliary pioneers in the United States, a ratio of 1 pioneer to 8 publishers. Yes, 5,093 entered the pioneer service last year. This amounts to almost 14 publishers a day who examined their circumstances and discovered they could do more in the ministry.
3 Auxiliary pioneering is an avenue of doing good to others. Last year there was a peak of 105,748 auxiliary pioneers. That is excellent. Many publishers are seeking ways to auxiliary pioneer more often throughout the year.
4 To determine whether you can “do it” or not, you first need to consider your heartfelt desire. (Matt. 22:37-39) Acts 20:35 says: “There is more happiness in giving than there is in receiving.” Undoubtedly, those who give spiritual assistance generously from the heart have the right desire. To be a successful publisher or pioneer, that desire is essential.
5 Second, consider your present circumstances. Can you make adjustments in your daily affairs to serve full-​time? Not everyone can. But after prayerful self-​examination, every year thousands find a way to “do it.” (Col. 4:5; w77 p. 701) For example, some families select particular months for some or all members of the family to auxiliary pioneer. Other families sponsor one of their members as a regular pioneer. Has your family given consideration to these possibilities?​—See Proverbs 11:25.
6 Helping others to know the truth is what brings genuine satisfaction, whether you serve as a publisher or as a pioneer. We know that true joy comes from doing good to others, especially if it happens to be ‘in the power of our hand to do it.’

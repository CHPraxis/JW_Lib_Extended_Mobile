<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>In obedience to Jesus’ words at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:33-40:6:33" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matthew 6:33</a>, true Christians have always kept the Kingdom first in their lives. Hence, “Keep Seeking First the Kingdom” is an appropriate theme for the circuit assembly program that will begin in September 1993.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>From the outset the program will highlight the reality of the Kingdom, emphasizing that it is a functioning government with a domain, rulers, subjects, and laws. In fact, many of the laws of human governments that benefit society today are based on Bible laws.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>The protection and blessings we receive from giving the Kingdom priority in all aspects of our lives will be considered. Helpful counsel will be given to show how we can avoid needless anxiety. Talks, demonstrations, and discussions will show why it is so important to keep our eye simple.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>On Saturday of the assembly, qualified baptismal candidates will be able to make public declaration of their dedication to Jehovah. And on Sunday, all of us will want to be present for the public talk, entitled “What God’s Kingdom Will Do for Mankind.”</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>Be sure to make your plans to be present for both days of the circuit assembly. The assembly program, coupled with pleasant brotherly association, will provide uplifting and refreshing encouragement that none of us will want to miss.</p>

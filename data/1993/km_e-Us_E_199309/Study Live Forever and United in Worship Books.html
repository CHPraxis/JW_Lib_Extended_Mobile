<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>Tracts, brochures, magazines, and books​—all can be used to initiate home Bible studies with interested people. Because of its widespread distribution and appeal, the book <em>The Greatest Man Who Ever Lived </em>has been used to start studies. Certainly, everyone should be encouraged to read and study it. We have done this by preparing for and attending the Congregation Book Study regularly.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>However, there are two books in particular that should be studied with new ones to help them understand basic doctrines of the Bible as well as Christian standards for living. They are: <em>You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth </em>and <em>United in Worship of the Only True God.</em> It is recommended that as soon as reasonably possible, those conducting home Bible studies in other publications change over to one of these books. If a study was being conducted in the <em>Greatest Man </em>book, encourage the student to continue reading it on his own. A Bible study should be continued until the <em>Live Forever </em>and the <em>United in Worship </em>books have been completed, even though a person may get baptized before the second book is finished. This procedure will give an added measure of depth and spiritual stability to the Bible student.</p>

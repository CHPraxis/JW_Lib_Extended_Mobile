Benefit Others by Using Magazines
1 How happy we are to receive the latest issues of The Watchtower and Awake! We cherish the opportunity to read them as soon as possible so that we may benefit from the information that is presented. In addition to looking for material that may help us personally, it is a good idea to look for points that can be used in offering the magazines to others. We may wish to mark portions that would be especially appealing to those in our congregationâ€™s territory or even make notes in the margins of our copy to remind ourselves of talking points and how the article could be presented locally.
2 Our journals have enduring value. Although we may primarily give attention to presenting the current magazines, there is no need to discard older issues, since the information itself does not go out of date. Keep back issues in your book bag so that they will be available when witnessing. These may be especially useful when a specific need of the householder becomes known. When an older magazine is left, it is all right to mention briefly to the householder his opportunity to contribute to the worldwide work.

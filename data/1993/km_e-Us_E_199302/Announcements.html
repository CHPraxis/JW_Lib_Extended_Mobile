<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">▪ Literature featured for <strong>February: </strong><em>You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth. </em><strong>March: </strong><em>Revelation​—Its Grand Climax At Hand! </em><strong>April and May: </strong><em>Watchtower </em>subscription. NOTE: Congregations that will need the above-​mentioned campaign items should request them on their next monthly Literature Request Form (S(d)-14).</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn">▪ The secretary and the service overseer should review the activity of all regular pioneers. If any are having difficulty meeting the requirement of hours, elders should arrange for assistance to be given. For suggestions, review Society’s letters (S-201) of October 1, 1992, and October 1, 1991. Also, see paragraphs 12-20 of the August 1986 <em>Our Kingdom Ministry </em>insert.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn">▪ On Saturday, May 8, 1993, the Brooklyn Bethel Home and factory, as well as Watchtower Farms buildings, will be closed for spring cleaning, so there will be no arrangements for tours or for congregations to pick up literature on that day.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn">▪ The Memorial celebration will be held Tuesday, April 6, 1993. Although the talk may start earlier, please remember that the passing of the Memorial bread and wine <em>should not begin until after sundown. </em>Check with local sources to determine when sundown occurs in your area. No meetings other than for field service are to be held on that date. If your congregation normally has meetings on Tuesday, you may want to switch those to another time of the week if the Kingdom Hall is available. If your Service Meeting is affected, it may be possible to incorporate into another Service Meeting any parts scheduled for that week that are particularly applicable to your congregation. Congregations having the visit of the circuit overseer should reschedule the meetings normally held on Tuesday evening.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn">▪ Publishers who wish to serve as auxiliary pioneers in March and April should make their plans now and turn in their application early. This will help the elders to make necessary field service arrangements and have sufficient literature on hand.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sn">▪ All resident aliens in the United States who were issued green cards prior to 1978 must apply for and obtain a new card. The new card will have the photograph, fingerprint, and signature of the individual. Filing early is suggested. Application forms can be obtained by calling 1-800-755-0777 or the local INS (Immigration and Naturalization Service) office. Compliance with this legal requirement will prevent certain employment and travel problems and is in harmony with <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:13:1-45:13:14" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Romans chapter 13</a>.</p>

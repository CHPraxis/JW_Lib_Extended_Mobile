New Weapon Against Malaria
AS REPORTED in Awake! of May 8, 1993, malaria is making a comeback as a world scourge. The New York Times (March 23, 1993) reported that “last year, Brazil recorded 560,000 malaria cases.” Annually 8,000 Brazilians die from malaria. Now a Colombian investigator, Dr. Manuel Elkin Patarroyo, has come up with a different approach​—a synthetic chemical vaccine that only costs 30 cents for three doses. “Less than the price of a Coca-Cola [in Colombia],” said Dr. Patarroyo. As of now it has proved to be effective in about 67 percent of the cases treated. While not a complete answer to deadly malaria, it appears to be a big step forward in the antimalaria battle.

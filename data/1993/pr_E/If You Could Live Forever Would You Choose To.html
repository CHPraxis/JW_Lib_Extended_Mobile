<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">You really can live forever in Paradise on earth, as this brochure clearly shows. God’s purpose for such conditions is certain to be fulfilled! But you have to <em>choose </em>to live forever.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">That choice, Jesus Christ taught, must be based on accurate knowledge of God. This brochure was provided to help you gain that knowledge. Further help can be received from Jehovah’s Witnesses. They would be pleased to visit you at a time and place convenient for you. And if you would like to have a free home Bible study, you may make this known by writing to Watchtower, 25 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn, New York 11201, or an appropriate address below.</p>

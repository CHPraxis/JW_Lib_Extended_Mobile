<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">EVERYONE exercises some kind of influence on others, either for good or for bad. A young person from Nigeria wrote last November:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“I can’t hold back any longer. When I read the effect that Wyndham’s faith had on many youths like me (the October 22, 1992, <em>Awake! </em>article “Wyndham’s Faith​—How It Has Affected Others”), I knew I just had to write. My eyes were filled with tears. I think of Wyndham so much, as if I had known him.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“I was seriously sick that very week and about to be taken to the hospital. I prayed to Jehovah God that if the doctor should suggest blood transfusion, He would strengthen me and give me courage to stand firm in my convictions as Wyndham Cook did, even if I should die.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">“As I write I’ve not yet fully recovered, but I thank you for presenting such a strengthening and encouraging article.”</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><em>Awake! </em>does much more than help readers cope with problems. It also builds confidence in the Creator’s promise of a peaceful and secure new world.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">FROM long before the first man walked the earth, the moon has shone brightly in the night sky. At one time many worshiped it as a goddess. The Greek author Plutarch claimed that it was the final destination of pure souls after death. In Baltic mythology the moon was a man, husband of the sun. They had a marital dispute, and the moon ran away from his wife, seldom appearing with her in the heavens!</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Today, young​—and not so young—​lovers look up at the moon and think romantic thoughts. In the 1960’s scientists spent immense sums of money to put men on the moon and bring back a few pounds of rock for research. One thing about the moon is sure. Each day, right on schedule, it will rise and set. So faithful is it in its appointed rounds that we can calculate its phases and eclipses thousands of years into the past.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">When Israelites looked at the moon, they were reminded of something wonderful. God promised that King David’s royal dynasty would not pass away. He said: “As the moon it [David’s seed] will be firmly established for time indefinite, and as a faithful witness in the skies.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:89:35-19:89:37" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 89:35-37</a>) This promise was fulfilled in Jesus, the “Son of David.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:18:38-42:18:38" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Luke 18:38</a>) After his death Jesus was resurrected an immortal spirit and ascended to heaven. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:2:34-44:2:36" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Acts 2:34-36</a>) In time he was installed as King of God’s heavenly Kingdom. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:12:10-66:12:10" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Revelation 12:10</a>) That Kingdom is now ruling and “will stand to times indefinite.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:2:44-27:2:44" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Daniel 2:44</a>) In this way Jesus, the immortal representative of David’s royal dynasty, will last as long as the moon, the “faithful witness in the skies.”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Hence, each time you see the moon shining brightly in the night sky, remember God’s promise to David and give thanks that God’s Kingdom now reigns and will reign forever, to God’s glory and to faithful mankind’s everlasting blessing.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:11:15-66:11:15" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Revelation 11:15</a>.</p>

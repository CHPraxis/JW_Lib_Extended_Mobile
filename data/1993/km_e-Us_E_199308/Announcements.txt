Announcements
▪ Literature to be used during August and September: You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth. October: Mankind’s Search for God or copies of Awake! and The Watchtower. Subscriptions may be offered on return visits. November: New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures with the book The Bible​—God’s Word or Man’s? NOTE: Congregations that have not yet requested the above-​mentioned campaign items should do so on their next monthly Literature Request Form (S(d)-14). Please request needed extra magazines for October distribution.
▪ Congregations should begin requesting the 1994 Calendar of Jehovah’s Witnesses with their September literature request. The calendars will be available in Chinese, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Serbian, Spanish, Swedish, and Ukrainian.
▪ From August 27 through September 1, the Society will be taking an inventory of all literature on hand in Brooklyn Bethel. Because of this inventory, no congregation literature requests will be processed for shipment or for pickup during those days.
▪ Each congregation will receive three Literature Inventory forms (S(d)-18). The congregation secretary should meet with the literature servant early in August and set a date for taking inventory of the congregation’s stock of literature at the end of the month. An actual count must be made of all literature in stock, and the totals are to be entered on the Literature Inventory form. The total number of magazines on hand can be obtained from the magazine servant. Please mail the original to the Society no later than September 6. Keep a carbon copy for your files. The third copy may be used as a work sheet. The inventory should be supervised by the secretary, and the completed form should be checked and signed by the presiding overseer.
▪ An adequate supply of forms for use during the 1994 service year is being sent to each congregation. These forms should not be wasted. They should be used only for their intended purpose.
▪ Everyone associated with a congregation should send all new and renewal subscriptions for The Watchtower and Awake!, including their personal subscriptions, through the congregation.
▪ The Society does not fill requests for literature that are made by individual publishers. Those desiring a given item may advise the literature servant, who will promptly include it in the congregation monthly request for literature. The presiding overseer should arrange for an announcement each month before the congregation monthly request for literature is sent to the Society so that all interested in obtaining personal literature items may advise the brother handling literature.
▪ Publishers who plan to begin regular pioneer service September 1, 1993, should apply without delay. Applications should be mailed to the Society before the end of August. Please review paragraphs 21 to 26 of the August 1986 Our Kingdom Ministry insert.
▪ The congregation secretary will compile the service reports for entry on the Congregation Analysis Report form (S-10). He will also carefully instruct any elder or ministerial servant who may be helping to compile the report. This will ensure an accurate tabulation of the information needed from the Congregation’s Publisher Record cards (S-21). The Congregation Analysis Report form (S-10) should be filled out accurately and neatly and be carefully checked by the service committee.

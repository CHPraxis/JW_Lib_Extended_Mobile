Requirements for Both the New and the Seasoned Minister
1 The psalmist David asked: “O Jehovah, who will be a guest in your tent? Who will reside in your holy mountain?” With a few well-​chosen words, David answered: “He who is walking faultlessly and practicing righteousness and speaking the truth.” (Ps. 15:1, 2) Those requirements have not changed. All today who come to worship in the Christian congregation must abandon immoral practices and drunkenness. There is no place among Jehovah’s people for those who are quarrelsome, have violent tempers, or are double-​tongued. Whether new ministers or seasoned ones, we must be faithful in maintaining the high standards outlined in God’s Word.​—Gal. 5:19-21.
2 Many new ones are associating with Jehovah’s organization. Young and old alike have transformed their thinking so as to conform their way of life to God’s requirements. A boy in South America grew up without parental guidance and developed severe personality problems. By the time he was 18, he was addicted to drugs and had already spent time in prison for stealing to support the habit. Through a Bible study, he broke off association with his previous companions, found new friends among Jehovah’s Witnesses, and eventually dedicated his life to God.
3 Likewise, we must be determined to please God in all our conduct, “in true righteousness and loyalty.” (Eph. 4:24) We have the obligation to “strip off the old personality with its practices” and to “clothe [ourselves] with the new personality, which through accurate knowledge is being made new” if we are to remain in God’s mountainlike organization.​—Col. 3:9, 10.
4 God’s Word, a Powerful Influence: Jehovah’s personality as revealed to us through the Bible can powerfully affect our thinking and our actions in a positive way. (Rom. 12:2) His Word has the power to transform minds and search through hearts. (Heb. 4:12) The inspired Scriptures teach us that Jehovah’s will requires that we lead a morally upright life, have a full share in the public ministry, and not neglect Christian meetings.
5 In these times hard to deal with, mounting pressures can influence a Christian to break God’s laws. If personal study, family study, congregation meetings, or the ministry is neglected, even a once-​strong Christian may drift away from the faith, perhaps falling into wrong conduct. That is why Paul wrote Timothy: “Pay constant attention to yourself and to your teaching” and, “Give constant thought to what I am saying.”​—1 Tim. 4:16; 2 Tim. 2:7.
6 Whether newly associated or seasoned by years of experience, we must keep God’s requirements clearly in focus, be completely balanced in the ministry, and maintain our hope strong if our life is to be preserved. (1 Pet. 1:13-16) Day-​to-​day observance of God’s righteous requirements is absolutely essential.
7 Make it your goal to be out in the field service during this last month of the 1993 service year. Be determined to help others to grow in faith and to increase productivity in the field ministry. (Rom. 1:12) Keep your thoughts on right matters by regularity in personal study, family study, and meeting attendance. (Phil. 4:8) Your efforts to please God by living up to his requirements will not go unnoticed.​—Col. 3:23, 24.

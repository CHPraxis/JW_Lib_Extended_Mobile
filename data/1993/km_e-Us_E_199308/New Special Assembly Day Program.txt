New Special Assembly Day Program
1 Our study of The Greatest Man Who Ever Lived has enhanced our appreciation for Jesus Christ. Appropriately, the special assembly day program starting in September will develop the theme “Closely Following Our Great Exemplar,” helping us to understand more fully what it means to follow him.
2 Regardless of age or years in the truth, all who attend the assembly will be encouraged to be more Christlike. Part of the program will feature counsel especially for youths. It will equip them to face challenges in connection with education, entertainment, and materialism. There will be talks, experiences, and demonstrations highlighting how to resist the world’s influence and model oneself after Christ.​—1 Pet. 2:21.
3 Newly dedicated persons will have the opportunity to declare publicly by being baptized that they are followers of Christ. A stimulating Scriptural discussion on the subject will precede the baptism ceremony. Those desiring to be baptized at the special assembly day should make their wish known to their presiding overseer in sufficient time for him to arrange for elders to go over the prescribed questions for baptismal candidates.
4 A guest speaker will present the principal talk, entitled “Following Our Great Exemplar​—To What Are We Led?” Be sure to invite all interested persons to this encouraging and faith-​strengthening program. There can be no greater or more rewarding course than following our Great Exemplar, Jesus Christ.​—Matt. 19:27-29.

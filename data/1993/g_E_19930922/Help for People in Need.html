<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Help is just what many well-meaning people want to provide. But what kind of help? And how can it be given? A kindly person wrote the Netherlands branch office of Jehovah’s Witnesses last October and explained how he would like to provide help.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“Last Saturday,” he explained, “I was offered a small tract entitled <em>Life in a Peaceful New World. </em>I think this is a good and clear tract with a fine message. It seems to me suitable for people with big problems, people who really want help, people who would be glad to read such a tract.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“Near my school, Laurenskerkplein in Rotterdam, there are always a number of tramps, alcoholics, and drug addicts sitting about. I would like to receive a number of tracts from you, which I then can offer to them. By no means will I do this in an obtrusive way. My idea is to give them something that appeals to me as I pass by.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">“I hope that you will help me in this regard. I wish you much success in your work!”</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Jehovah’s Witnesses are devoted to helping people learn more about God’s purposes. If you would like a copy of the above-mentioned tract or desire a free home Bible study, please write to Watchtower, 25 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn, New York 11201, or to the appropriate address listed on page 5.</p>

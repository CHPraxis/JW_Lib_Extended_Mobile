Farming the Wind
CONSTRUCTION of Britain’s first commercial wind farm suffered a temporary setback when, according to The Independent of London, one of the cranes used to erect the turbine blew over in a gale. Nevertheless, harnessing the wind is claimed to be one of the quickest, cheapest means of generating power. More attractive still, it leaves none of the chemical pollution that comes from burning fossil fuels, such as coal.
Although several European States​—such as Denmark, Germany, and the Netherlands—​together with California, favor wind farms as sources of renewable energy, not all of those concerned with the environment are pleased. Some object to the noise of the turning turbine blades; others dislike their unsightliness, especially when the machines are located in areas of natural beauty.
Nevertheless, in Britain, one of Europe’s windiest countries, government advisers hail onshore wind power as “the most promising single energy source in the short term,” reports New Scientist magazine. On the other hand, despite the high costs that would be involved, critics of onshore siting recommend erecting the turbines offshore, using special winches instead of cranes to move heavy equipment​—taking advantage of strong sea winds.

Are More Copies Available?
“EARLY in November,” writes a woman from Michigan, U.S.A., “my mother-in-law and I were in a printing shop in Grand Rapids photocopying some material when I noticed a woman photocopying a lot of material on chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). I asked if she had ever had a chance to read the article in the Awake! magazine dealing with CFS.
“‘No. I heard about it but never did receive a copy,’ she replied.
“I asked if she would like to have one.
“‘Can you get me one?’ she asked.
“I explained that I was one of Jehovah’s Witnesses and happened to have a couple of extra copies of that issue. Well, she gave me her address, and later I mailed her the copies. I asked her if she would please write back to let me know what she thought about the article.”
A few days later, the woman wrote: “Thanks so much. The article you sent is wonderful. It was well researched and well written. . . . What would be the chance of getting, say, 1,000 of these? I’d pay for them and would like to share the information with all.”
When the woman learned that people can contribute to the worldwide preaching activity carried on by Jehovah’s Witnesses, she made out a check to the Watchtower Bible & Tract Society. She said she was going to distribute the magazines to 17 different support groups across Michigan.
Awake! does much more than show readers how to cope with today’s problems. It also builds confidence in the Creator’s promise of a peaceful and secure new world.

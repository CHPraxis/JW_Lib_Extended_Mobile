<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">“EARLY in November,” writes a woman from Michigan, U.S.A., “my mother-in-law and I were in a printing shop in Grand Rapids photocopying some material when I noticed a woman photocopying a lot of material on chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). I asked if she had ever had a chance to read the article in the <em>Awake! </em>magazine dealing with CFS.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“‘No. I heard about it but never did receive a copy,’ she replied.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“I asked if she would like to have one.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">“‘Can you get me one?’ she asked.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">“I explained that I was one of Jehovah’s Witnesses and happened to have a couple of extra copies of that issue. Well, she gave me her address, and later I mailed her the copies. I asked her if she would please write back to let me know what she thought about the article.”</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">A few days later, the woman wrote: “Thanks so much. The article you sent is wonderful. It was well researched and well written. . . . What would be the chance of getting, say, 1,000 of these? I’d pay for them and would like to share the information with all.”</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">When the woman learned that people can contribute to the worldwide preaching activity carried on by Jehovah’s Witnesses, she made out a check to the Watchtower Bible &amp; Tract Society. She said she was going to distribute the magazines to 17 different support groups across Michigan.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb"><em>Awake! </em>does much more than show readers how to cope with today’s problems. It also builds confidence in the Creator’s promise of a peaceful and secure new world.</p>

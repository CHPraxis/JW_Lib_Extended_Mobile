<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>One reader said that he had learned much more of real value by reading <em>The Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>than he did during six years of university schooling. It is not uncommon for sincere readers to make such heartwarming expressions of appreciation after reading these magazines for just a short time. How privileged we are to share our magazines regularly with those who truly value them!</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>Many people, although having some interest in the truth, have not progressed to the point of accepting a home Bible study. But their interest may be cultivated if someone calls back regularly with each new issue of <em>The Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>Yes, faithfully delivering magazines on a magazine route has helped move people eventually to agree to having a regular Bible study.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>We benefit personally by having a magazine route if we read the magazines first and take note of specific points that will be of particular interest to each person on our list.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>Keep in mind that it is the extent of the householder’s interest, and not the size of his donation, that determines whether you should include his name on your list of magazine-​route calls. If the person shows real interest when accepting the magazines, you may explain that outstanding articles appear in our magazines every two weeks and that you will be happy to deliver them. Be sure to follow through on a regular basis, taking advantage of opportunities to converse with the householder on Bible subjects. We know you will enjoy this fine privilege of service.</p>

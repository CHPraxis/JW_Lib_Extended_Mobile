After discussing paragraph 3, have well-​prepared publisher demonstrate how a Bible study might be started either on initial call or on return visit, using the tract <em>Will This World Survive? </em>Publisher: “Good morning. We are talking to people today about the quality of life. Are you satisfied with what you observe taking place in the lives of people today?” Householder: “Not really.” Publisher: “Do you think the situation will improve?” Householder: “I don’t know.” Publisher offers tract and says: “Some think that what is happening is in fulfillment of Bible prophecy and that the world’s end is near. What do you think?” Householder: “I don’t know. I guess it is possible.” Publisher then refers to tract and explains that the end of the world does not mean the end of literal heavens and earth.

Elder handling this part has new cards distributed to baptized publishers and carefully considers October 15, 1991, letter, which explains the use of these cards.

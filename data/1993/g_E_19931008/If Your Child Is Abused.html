<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">TO STOP abuse, you must know it when you see it. In the numerous books on the subject, experts have listed dozens of telltale signs of abuse that parents can watch for. These include: complaints of pain while urinating or defecating, genital infections, abrasions or lesions in the genital area, the sudden onset of bed-wetting, appetite loss or other eating problems, precocious sexual behavior, a sudden fear of such places as school or parts of the house, periods of panic, an extreme fear of undressing, a fear of being alone with a familiar person, and self-mutilation.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">However, be careful about jumping to conclusions. Most of these symptoms do not by themselves necessarily mean that a child has actually been sexually abused. Each could indicate some other problem. But if you see disturbing symptoms, gently broach the subject, perhaps with such a statement as: “If anyone ever touches you in a way that makes you feel uncomfortable, I want you to know that you can always tell me, and I’ll do all I can to protect you. Has anything like that ever happened to you?”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:20:5-20:20:5" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Proverbs 20:5</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">If your child discloses sexual abuse, you will no doubt feel shattered. But remember: Your reaction will play a major role in the child’s recovery. Your child has been carrying an unbearable burden and needs you, with all your adult strength, to lift it from her or his shoulders. Praise the child for being so brave as to tell you what happened. Repeatedly reassure the child that you will do your best to provide protection; that the abuse was the abuser’s fault, not the child’s; that the child is not “bad”; that you love the child.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Some legal experts advise reporting the abuse to the authorities as soon as possible. In some lands the legal system may require this. But in other places the legal system may offer little hope of successful prosecution.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">What, though, when the abuser is one’s own beloved mate? Sad to say, many women fail to take decisive action. To be sure, it is never easy to face the ugly reality of a mate who is a child abuser. Emotional ties, and even financial dependency, can be overwhelmingly strong. The wronged wife may also realize that taking action could cost her husband his family, his job, his reputation.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> The hard truth is, though, that he may just be reaping what he has sown. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:6:7-48:6:7" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Galatians 6:7</a>) Innocent children, on the other hand, stand to lose much more if they are not believed and protected. Their whole future is at stake. They do not have the resources that adults have. Trauma can scar and shape them adversely for life. They are the ones who need and deserve tender treatment.​—Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:33:13-1:33:14" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Genesis 33:13, 14</a>.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Parents must therefore make every reasonable effort to protect their children! Many responsible parents choose to seek out professional help for an abused child. Just as you would with a medical doctor, make sure that any such professional will respect your religious views.<span data-fnid="2" class="fn">b<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="2"></span></span> Help your child rebuild his or her shattered self-esteem through a steady outpouring of parental love.</p>

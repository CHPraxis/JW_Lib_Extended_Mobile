<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Some people appear to be all right, but they feel terrible. What can help? Concern and understanding are important. Last year such a person wrote the Watch Tower Society in Brooklyn, New York:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“I just read the tract <em>Comfort for the Depressed. </em>I suffer from periodic depression caused by a chemical imbalance. The tract is very comforting.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“It’s comforting to know that there is hope concerning depression and that there are ways of coping with it. It’s also comforting to know that someone cares for and understands people like me who suffer from depression.”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sd">This tract says a lot in a little space. If you would like to have a copy of it or would like further information, please write to Watchtower, 25 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn, New York 11201, or to the appropriate address listed on page 5.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"><strong>▪ What would be considered proper attire when presenting oneself for baptism?</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">While standards of dress vary in different parts of the world, the Bible’s admonition to dress “with modesty and soundness of mind” remains the same for all Christians, regardless of where they live. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:2:9-54:2:9" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Tim. 2:9</a>) This principle should be applied when considering what is proper attire for baptism.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The <a class="xt" data-xtid="13" href="jwpub://p/E:1985408/6:164-16:250">June 1, 1985, <em>Watchtower</em>, page 30</a>, gives this counsel for a person who is getting baptized: “Certainly modesty should prevail in the type of bathing suit used. This is important today when fashion designers seem to want to flaunt sexuality and achieve almost total nudity. Another factor to take into account is that some suits that appear modest when dry are less than that when wet. No one getting baptized would want to be a cause for distraction or stumbling at an event as serious as baptism.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:1:10-50:1:10" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Philippians 1:10</a>.”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">In harmony with this advice, those being baptized will want to wear modest clothing, keeping in mind the importance of the occasion. Thus, a swimsuit that is skimpy or one that immodestly clings to the body when wet would be unbecoming attire for a Christian and should be avoided. Likewise, it would be inappropriate for one to be unkempt or slovenly in appearance. Further, it would not be fitting to wear T-shirts with worldly sayings or commercial slogans.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">When the assigned elders review the questions for baptism with the baptismal candidate, this would be a good time to discuss the importance of wearing proper attire. In this way the dignity of the occasion will be maintained, and we will continue to stand out as different from the world.​—Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:15:19-43:15:19" data-bid="3-1" class="b">John 15:19</a>.</p>

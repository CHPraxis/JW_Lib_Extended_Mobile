<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>Many of us will be away from our home congregations for a time during vacation months this summer, such as while attending district conventions. If we will be away at the end of a month, we will want to make sure that we send our field service reports to the congregation secretary. This should be done early enough to be included with the congregation’s monthly report, which the secretary compiles and sends to the Society by the sixth of the month.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>We also want to be alert to opportunities for informal witnessing. Such opportunities may arise while traveling, visiting with relatives, or talking with others we meet. Do we view occasions to give a witness as Jesus did? He did not hold back from giving an informal witness. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:4:5-43:4:30" data-bid="1-1" class="b">John 4:5-30</a>) The apostle Paul likewise ‘bought out the opportune time’ and enjoyed fine results. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:5:16-49:5:16" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Eph. 5:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:17:17-44:17:17" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Acts 17:17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:28:30-44:28:31" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> 28:30, 31;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:4:5-51:4:5" data-bid="2-4" class="b"> Col. 4:5</a>) Make definite plans to engage in informal witnessing. Be well prepared with a few timely talking points and have a magazine or a tract at hand to stimulate interest.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>By carefully following through on these reminders, we will be sure to use our time wisely this summer and will be giving Jehovah our “firstfruits.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:3:9-20:3:9" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Prov. 3:9</a>.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>Do we take positive steps to share in the field service on a regular basis? Are we diligent in promptly turning in our field service report at the Kingdom Hall each month? It is something that all of us should endeavor to do, never allowing a month to go by without in some way publicly expressing our faith.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:10:9-45:10:10" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Rom. 10:9, 10</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>Besides being regular ourselves, we want to be alert to help others share regularly in the field ministry. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:2:4-50:2:4" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Phil. 2:4</a>) How can we do this? We may be able to invite unbaptized publishers who are just starting out in the ministry to work along with us. A consistent schedule of service will help keep the truth firmly embedded in their hearts.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>Be regular in the field service. Faithfully turn in your field service report each month. Assist others to share in service regularly. Show “love for the whole association of brothers.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:2:17-60:2:17" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Pet. 2:17</a>.</p>

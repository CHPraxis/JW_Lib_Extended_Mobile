<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">SEVERAL hundred letters have been received in appreciation for the <em>Awake! </em>issue of August 22, 1992, that featured the subject “Chronic Fatigue Syndrome​—How to Deal With It.” Last summer a medical doctor from Tennessee, U.S.A., wrote:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“On August 22nd and 23rd I gave presentations to two different groups in southern California. My subject: Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“One of the people who attended the Pasadena conference gave me a copy of the August 22, 1992, issue of <em>Awake! </em>and I’ve read and reread the cover story. I’m writing to commend you for your superb coverage of this still mysterious and often misunderstood illness. It was absolutely the best article on the subject I’ve read​—and I’ve read dozens of them.”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">In October, one of Jehovah’s Witnesses from Illinois, U.S.A., who suffers from the syndrome, explained: “Well, as of this morning, I have placed 319 magazines featuring the chronic fatigue syndrome articles. I placed them with pharmacists, health-food-store clerks, workers with blood banks, nurses, and medical library personnel.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">“Medical groups took copies for doctors. The staff members I talked to said that they would make sure that the doctors got their copy. Some even asked for my phone number in case they needed any more of the magazines.”</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Jehovah’s Witnesses, who make up an international organization of over four million Bible students, are the publishers of <em>Awake! </em>The magazine does much more than show readers how to cope with today’s problems. It also builds confidence in the Creator’s promise of a peaceful and secure new world. Jehovah’s Witnesses are devoted to helping people learn more about God’s purposes.</p>

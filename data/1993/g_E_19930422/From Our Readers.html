<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><strong>Negative Emotions  </strong>I am a 12-year-old girl, and I really enjoyed the series of articles “You <em>Can </em>Overcome Negative Emotions.” (October 8, 1992) I have had problems with my friends and schoolmates. At the root of it all was the negative way I always used to see things. The articles taught me to have a more positive outlook.</p>

<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Having received therapy over the past two years for a series of emotional and hormonal problems, I know from experience that your suggestions work. Two days ago I suffered a relapse and just wanted to give up. My ever-patient husband told me to reread the articles. They contained all the encouragement I could wish for and gave me the will to try once again.</p>

<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><strong>Disgraced Parents  </strong>Thank you for the article “Young People Ask . . . What if My Parent Has Disgraced Us?” (October 22, 1992) It encouraged me a lot. My father recently forbade me to attend Christian meetings. However, reading your article helped me to understand that I am not alone in this situation and that I can count on Jehovah’s help.</p>

<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">My father is inactive as a Christian. My mother is disfellowshipped from the congregation and opposes the truth. Once she denied me a meal for over 36 hours because I had gone out preaching. She also beat me. Sometimes I cry because of the spiritual condition of my parents. You cannot therefore imagine how your article encouraged me and strengthened my faith. I am determined to adhere to Bible principles.</p>

<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">I too have a disfellowshipped father and a number of siblings who have been reproved or disfellowshipped. Others have labeled me as being like them, but I am now married and have completed my first year as a full-time evangelizer. Yes, you can truly prove yourself to be different.</p>

<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb"><strong>Watching the World  </strong>Thank you for printing the little news items in “Watching the World.” Since I’ve had such a sheltered, uncomplicated life, I have to reassure myself continually that these are indeed the last days. “Watching the World” has been a great aid in convincing me of how sick and degraded this old world truly is. Please continue to publish it regularly.</p>

<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb"><strong>Letter to Parents  </strong>The article “A Letter to Mom and Dad” (October 8, 1992) brought tears to my eyes. It made me realize how hard a time my parents had raising their eight children. So at the age of 42, I have written my own letter of thanks to Mom and Dad.</p>

<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">Reading it was very painful because my parents did not give me any of the things listed by that young man. But as I reread it, I realized how much Jehovah, our heavenly Father, has done for me and so many others. He has taught me love and given me discipline when I needed it. Thus, he has given me some freedom from the painful childhood I suffered.</p>

What Does the Bible Say About Abortions?
That is what a couple in Argentina asked a woman visiting them, since they knew she was well-acquainted with the Bible. The couple wanted to know if God considered an abortion to be proper. The wife had been pregnant for two months and was planning to have an abortion, even though her husband was not in agreement.
The woman visiting the couple took out a copy of the book Reasoning From the Scriptures and turned to page 25. She read the definition of abortion and then had the couple read the scriptures listed in the publication, showing how God views an unborn child. Seven months later the baby was born. In the meantime, the proud parents had become Bible students.
Your Youth​—Getting the Best out of It answers such questions as, Why should youths study in school? How should they view their parents? Should they have sex relations before marriage? Should they drink alcoholic beverages? Receive a copy for only $1 by filling in and mailing the coupon.

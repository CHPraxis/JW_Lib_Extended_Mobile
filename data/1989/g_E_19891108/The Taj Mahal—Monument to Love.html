<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">It has been described as a delicate jewel, as a love song in stone, as the exquisite epitaph of a mourning husband to his lost wife.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A hundred miles <strong>[160 km] </strong>east of Delhi, in northern India, is the city of Agra, where this prize of Muslim architecture stands​—the Taj Mahal. Designed by a Turkish architect and made of white marble, this beautiful building stands as a monument to the love of Shah Jahan for his favorite wife, Mumtaz Mahal, who died in 1631. The tomb took about 20 years to build and involved some 20,000 workers.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The Muslim influence is clearly seen in the slender minarets that rise to a height of 133 feet <strong>[40.5 m] </strong>and by the texts taken from the Qurʼān that decorate the outside walls. A serene pool lends a romantic reflection to the mausoleum, especially in the moonlight or with the rising and setting of the sun.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The Shah’s deep love for his wife reminds one of King Solomon’s expressions of love for the unattainable Shulammite shepherd girl, found in the Bible in the Song of Solomon.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">To do so successfully is a real challenge. A youth tells her experience: “I was feeling happy, but the next minute I was in a deep depression. Sometimes I didn’t even know what I was feeling. It was as if I was completely lost in the dark. I couldn’t express myself and what my emotions were no matter who I talked to, not even to myself. I felt as if I wasn’t getting attention from people around me, especially my schoolmates, because I wasn’t attractive enough. Eventually all these feelings were killing me inside, and I began hating myself and my personality.”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The girl had a copy of the book <em>Your Youth​—Getting the Best out of It. </em>“It was all very interesting,” she writes, “so I wanted to read the next chapter, which was ‘Moving into Womanhood.’ I couldn’t believe what I was reading. The chapter exactly described how I’ve felt lately, plus it gave the answer. It was so encouraging to read that it was perfectly normal to feel this way. I just have to know the <em>right </em>way to handle it.”</p>

These acknowledgments include brief expressions of appreciation. The presiding overseer should observe such acknowledgments and have these called to the attention of the congregation each month when the accounts report is given. The Society wants the brothers to know that their contributions have been received and that they are appreciated.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn">● The Society is now accepting orders for reprinted <em>Watchtower </em>bound volumes in English for the years 1970 through 1974. Congregations and individuals desiring to have these volumes for their library should determine the total number of volumes they need for each year and submit their requests through the congregation. The total quantities should be entered on the Literature Order form (S-14) and SUBMITTED DURING THE MONTH OF MARCH 1989. (See <em>Cost List, </em>paragraphs 7-10.) Printing of the third five-year series of <em>The Watchtower </em>bound volumes in English will commence this spring. Please do not place orders for years other than 1970 through 1974 until future direction appears in <em>Our Kingdom Ministry. </em>Since the Society will not stock these reprinted volumes, we urge all to consider the matter carefully and place orders for the 1970 through 1974 volumes that are needed. Later orders will only be filled as long as existing supplies last. These reprinted volumes are controlled stock items and are to be paid for upon receipt. The price will be $6.00 each.</p>

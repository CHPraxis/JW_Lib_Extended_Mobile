<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn">● The Memorial date for 1991 will be Saturday, March 30, after sundown. This advance notice of the date for the 1991 Memorial celebration is given so that brothers may make necessary reservations or contracts for available halls when there are too many congregations using one Kingdom Hall and they must find other facilities.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn">● The <em>Watchtower </em>in Hungarian and in Samoan will become semimonthly editions starting with the January 1, 1990, issue.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn">● The <em>Awake! </em>magazine will begin as a monthly edition in the Hungarian, Sepedi, and Tswana languages starting with the January 8, 1990, issue. Additionally, <em>Awake! </em>in Zulu will become a semimonthly edition as of the January 8, 1990, issue.</p>

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sn">● Congregations should begin ordering bound volumes of <em>The Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>for 1989 on their December literature orders. (See the 1989 <em>Cost List, </em>paragraphs 7-10.) The bound volumes will be available in Dutch, English, French, German, Greek, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese, and Spanish.

<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sn">● Some adjustments will be made in future printings of the <em>Live Forever </em>book. The only significant change is with regard to the Sodomites, on pages 178 and 179. This change appeared in the <em>Revelation </em>book, page 273, and in <a class="xt" data-xtid="40" href="jwpub://p/E:1988410/1-17"><em>The Watchtower </em>of June 1, 1988, pages 30 and 31</a>.

Corresponding With Prisoners
1 People from many walks of life are being contacted with the Kingdom message. Our Kingdom Ministry for February 1982 gave direction regarding witnessing to prisoners. Since that time, positive reports continue to be received about incarcerated persons who have responded favorably. Bible studies and meetings are being held in a number of institutions. This has resulted in new disciples dedicating their lives to Jehovah and getting baptized.
2 In many cases prisoners are being witnessed to by correspondence. In this regard, we feel it is necessary to repeat a word of caution. It has been found that some prisoners who are eager to correspond with others have questionable motives. While it would be appropriate to write to prisoners, providing Scriptural information and encouragement or Bible literature as needed, money or personal gifts should not be sent, despite the fact that such may be requested by the correspondent.
3 It is strongly recommended that only qualified brothers correspond with male prisoners. Qualified sisters should write to female prisoners. Individual members of the congregation should not indiscriminately visit prisons and have close association with inmates.
4 When interest is shown by prisoners, it is best to turn the names and addresses of such ones over to the congregation in the area of the particular institution. The qualified brothers there will visit these prisoners and, if possible, arrange to study with those who are sincerely interested in the truth.
5 If questions arise about writing to prisoners or visiting penal institutions, please review what was stated in the article referred to above. Additional written direction was provided for all bodies of elders in a letter from the Society dated December 1, 1981.

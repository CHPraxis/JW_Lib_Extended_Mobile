<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"><strong>● Is it proper to write the Society or its branch offices for addresses of persons with whom you may wish to correspond on business or other personal matters?</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">All addresses in the Society’s files and in congregation files are confidential and cannot be released for personal use. Therefore, no one should write to the Society or to its branch offices, requesting such information.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The congregation must keep in focus its purpose and work involving our whole-souled dedication to Jehovah and the doing of his will. Neither the Society nor the congregation can involve itself in the support or promotion of business activities. Such ventures should be viewed strictly as personal, private commercial enterprises. Publishers who wish to correspond with brothers in other cities and even in foreign countries should work such matters out for themselves.</p>

<p id="p1" data-pid="1" class="st"><span id="page3" class="pageNum" data-no="3" data-before-text="3"></span><strong>You Are Invited to the 1989 “Godly Devotion” District Convention!</strong></p>
<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>In just a few weeks, a worldwide, spiritually upbuilding program will begin, and you are invited! In the United States, the “Godly Devotion” District Conventions will commence on June 9 and are scheduled to run for nine consecutive weeks. There will be a total of 132 conventions, the largest number ever. Jehovah himself makes this provision through his organization, and so we can attend with high expectations that will not meet with disappointment.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:61:4-19:61:4" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ps. 61:4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:54:13-23:54:13" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Isa. 54:13</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>The conventions this year will emphasize the need for godly devotion and will motivate us to make improvement in the exercise of this quality. This is especially important in view of the ungodly world that surrounds us.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>Through progressive training and discipline, Jehovah has made us a unique people, unified in an outstanding organization while in the midst of this irreverent generation. Our godly devotion is genuine and free from the hypocrisy that Paul described when he stated that in the last days, people would have a form of godly devotion but would prove false to its power. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:1-55:3:1" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Tim. 3:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:5-55:3:5" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 5</a>) May our cooperative spirit at all times reflect godly devotion, and may we always prove true to its power.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:14:40-46:14:40" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Cor. 14:40</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup><strong>ARRIVE EARLY: </strong>Jehovah’s Witnesses are well known for their dependability and punctuality. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:16:10-42:16:10" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Luke 16:10</a>) This is important when attending a convention. We should arrive early each day and be seated before the program begins. This requires allowing sufficient time to care for matters that need attention, such as parking our vehicle, finding suitable seats for our family, and obtaining convention food tickets.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>Convention time affords a fine opportunity to enjoy pleasant association. But visiting with friends late into the night can hinder our efforts to be on time the next day. Much anxiety and frustration can result from getting a late start and thus having to rush in the morning. To prevent this, some families find it beneficial to set a reasonable time for retiring. By strictly adhering to a schedule, they are more likely to get a good night’s sleep and be ready for an early start the next day. This avoids their arriving while the program is in progress, which is distracting and can be an annoyance to those already seated. Our thoughtfulness in this regard can be a reflection of our reverence and respect for Jehovah, and it gives evidence of true godly devotion.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup><strong>A THREE-DAY CONVENTION: </strong>The “Godly Devotion” District Convention will last three days. Carefully selected information vital to our spiritual health will be presented at every session. A variety of subjects related to godly devotion will be developed in talks, demonstrations, and a modern-day drama.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><sup>7 </sup>Make it your resolve not to miss even one session. This may require personal sacrifices and adjustments in your schedule. Some find it necessary to make special arrangements with their employer. Many even forgo financial advantages in order to attend all sessions. Jehovah will certainly bless those who make the matter a subject of sincere prayer and put forth heartfelt effort to be there.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:13:24-42:13:24" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Luke 13:24</a>.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb"><sup>8 </sup><strong>LISTEN INTENTLY: </strong>During the convention program, do not be distracted by sights and sounds unrelated to the material being discussed from the platform. How grateful we are to Jehovah who gifted us with the ability to concentrate “intently” on thoughts of our choice. Our godly devotion should motivate us to make the choice that harmonizes with Jehovah’s request at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:55:2-23:55:2" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Isaiah 55:2</a>: “Listen intently to me.”</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb"><sup>9 </sup>While it is true that the Sunday afternoon lecture is advertised for the general public, most of the material to be presented at this convention has been prepared especially for those who are already devoted to Jehovah. The convention will bring us up-to-date with the current needs and help us to keep pace with Jehovah’s progressive organization. Inattentiveness will result in our being left behind. We must keep ourselves absorbed in the program in order to derive full benefit from the rich spiritual nourishment. ​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:2:2-60:2:2" data-bid="7-1" class="b">1 Pet. 2:2</a>.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb"><sup>10 </sup>Over the years, many convention delegates have developed the useful habit of taking notes during the program. Appropriate note-taking materials should be included with Bibles and songbooks as standard equipment when attending a convention. Some may have viewed note-taking with skepticism, feeling that there is no real benefit in it. If you have been so inclined, why not try taking notes during the “Godly Devotion” Convention? As is true for many others, you may find that it is a good way to keep your attention riveted on what is being said and that it protects you from daydreaming or allowing your mind to wander.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb"><sup>11 </sup>Notes need not be extensive or elaborate. Usually a phrase or two will suffice for a key point. Elders find it advantageous to have neatly arranged notes for conducting a meaningful review of the convention program on the Service Meeting. They may also incorporate many of the points presented at the convention in their teaching and shepherding work thereafter.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb"><sup>12 </sup>All of us should give attention to how we listen, for it means our happiness and our very life. While attending the “Godly Devotion” District Convention, we should bear in mind Jehovah’s exhortation at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:8:33-20:8:35" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Proverbs 8:33-35</a>: “Listen to discipline and become wise, and do not show any neglect. Happy is the man that is listening to me by keeping awake at my doors day by day, by watching at the posts of my entrances. For <span id="page4" class="pageNum" data-no="4" data-before-text="4"></span>the one finding me will certainly find life, and gets goodwill from Jehovah.”</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb"><sup>13 </sup><strong>PRAYER AND SONG: </strong>One of the most beautiful adornments of our godly devotion is the singing of praises to Jehovah God. The singing of songs appears to have been a regular feature of true Christianity in the first century. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:14:15-46:14:15" data-bid="9-1" class="b">1 Cor. 14:15</a>) Jehovah is also pleased when his people approach him in earnest prayer. District conventions afford us a unique opportunity to be united with thousands of our brothers and sisters in praising Jehovah in both song and prayer. However, some have shown a lack of respect for these important parts of our worship. How? By unnecessarily arriving at the convention during or after the opening song and prayer. At the conclusion of the program, some leave their seats during the song and before the prayer. Why? On rare occasions there may be good reasons for this. However, some may relinquish the privilege of singing and joining in prayer just so they can get an early start to their cars. Others have left their seats in order to be among the first in line for literature releases or for food. Care must be exercised that in the pursuit of personal convenience, we do not allow the worldly me-first attitude or ungodly traits such as greed and selfishness to hamper our spiritual progress. As a people of godly devotion, we strive to manifest appropriate respect for such lofty features of our worship, namely, our praying and singing to Jehovah.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb"><sup>14 </sup><strong>OUR CHRISTIAN MANNERS: </strong>Over the years, our Christian manners and appearance at conventions have earned us a good reputation as Jehovah’s Witnesses. This is because we rightly view our conventions as spiritual festivals, not social outings. Accordingly, we endeavor to demonstrate a spiritual frame of mind and to conduct ourselves as ministers.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb"><sup>15 </sup>Note this fine experience enjoyed by a Witness family while dining at a restaurant in a convention city last summer. The brother wrote: “A man and his wife were at a table next to ours. When they finished their meal, the man approached our table, excused himself, and said he would like to commend us for our very neat and clean appearance. My wife told the man we were attending the Watchtower Convention this weekend. He said he was sure we were. He had seen many of our brothers and sisters around the motel while he and his wife were staying there, and all displayed exemplary conduct and dress. He said that in the church he attends, the young people do not dress or act like our young people. This makes me appreciate how important it is to rear our children from an early age to be a good Christian example at all times. Credit must be given to strong counsel and direction from Jehovah’s organization to set a fine example.”</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb"><sup>16 </sup>Sadly, some attending the conventions have become unduly casual in their attitude, dress, speech, and conduct. When such becomes evident either in the local congregation or during a convention, those who have spiritual qualifications should offer loving counsel with a view to readjustment. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:6:1-48:6:1" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Gal. 6:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:4:11-49:4:12" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> Eph. 4:11, 12</a>) Our godly devotion should move us to be diligent in upholding our good reputation and in maintaining high standards of conduct at all times.</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb"><sup>17 </sup>In view of the fact that we are getting very good motel rooms at significantly reduced rates, we should show our appreciation and be considerate of motel personnel, being courteous and not overly demanding. Much direction and counsel has been given regarding proper conduct at motels during the convention. Many have responded favorably and are earnestly striving to cooperate fully with motel personnel. Despite such cooperation, a negative attitude toward the Witnesses has been observed in some places. Why? Some of the following information will no doubt shock many, but in view of the problems caused by a few, it is necessary to bring these points to your attention.</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb"><sup>18 </sup>The articles “To Tip​—Or Not” and “Tips on Tipping,” on <a class="xt" data-xtid="15" href="jwpub://p/E:101986447/1-8:325$p/E:101986448/">pages 24-7 of the June 22, 1986, issue of <em>Awake!</em></a> deserve our attention. Please reread these articles, as they specifically define who expect tips and how much, according to the custom in different countries. It is pointed out on page 24 that in the United States, for many who perform certain services for you, “tipping is more than a thank-you for extra service rendered. It is the principal part of a person’s income.” It also points out that “other people besides waiters​—bellhop, doorman, concierge, hotel maid, cloakroom and washroom attendants . . . also depend on tips for their living.” Ignoring this fact has reaped unfriendly reactions on the part of motel staff members. In some cases disgruntled individuals have falsely accused convention delegates of stealing or of making long-distance phone calls and then refusing to pay.</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb"><sup>19 </sup>Additionally, the above-mentioned <em>Awake! </em>articles suggest that when “attending a convention, what you do personally reflects on the whole group. People will judge the group by your behavior.” So regardless of your personal views about tipping, when you visit a city as a delegate to a convention of Jehovah’s Witnesses, if you tip just a little or not at all, others may conclude that Jehovah’s Witnesses are stingy or unwilling to pay for services rendered. Thus, giving due consideration to local tipping practices and complying with them will go a long way in maintaining ‘peace with all men’ “for the sake of the good news.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:12:18-45:12:18" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Rom. 12:18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:9:19-46:9:23" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 1 Cor. 9:19-23</a>.</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb"><sup>20 </sup>Although the vast majority of the brothers bring honor to God’s name, we must admit that some families attending conventions have given reason for complaint. For example, after renting a room with the rated capacity of no more than four or five persons, including children, some have brought in up to ten persons, and that is dishonest. To accommodate them, mattresses were taken off the beds and placed on the floor so that some could sleep on the mattresses while others slept directly on the box springs. Then extra linen was requested from the management. In addition, sleeping bags were used for children to sleep in.</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb"><span id="page5" class="pageNum" data-no="5" data-before-text="5"></span><sup>21 </sup>There are motels that no longer want to rent their rooms to Jehovah’s Witnesses because some did not comply with cooking regulations. There were reports of Witnesses bringing microwave ovens, electric pots, frying pans, and so forth, for cooking meals in their rooms. In some cases the use of such cooking utensils created electrical problems for the building due to current overload. Motel managers say that the food odor remained in the rooms for days, and as a result, subsequent guests refused to stay in the rooms.</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb"><sup>22 </sup>Another matter of concern is the fact that some have checked out of motels, leaving their rooms in an unsightly condition. Evidently, some who purchase food to eat in their rooms have been careless. Food residue has been found on the furniture, carpet, and walls. Large amounts of food garbage and paper trash, such as food containers, bags, and cups, have been left in the rooms. All such inconsiderate behavior has marred our good name and does not reflect our godly devotion. During the coming district conventions, let us all strive to conduct ourselves so as to “adorn the teaching of our Savior, God, in all things.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/56:2:10-56:2:10" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Titus 2:10</a>.</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb"><sup>23 </sup><strong>FOR PARENTS: </strong>Young children and teenagers are especially invited to attend the “Godly Devotion” District Convention. Much of the information presented will be particularly encouraging for them. How fine it is to see the godly devotion of young ones who have learned to pay close attention at all Christian meetings and who are intently interested in the convention program! (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:148:12-19:148:13" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Ps. 148:12, 13</a>) But much depends on the example and supervision of the parents. Many young ones have been well trained to take notes. If as a parent you have not as yet taught your children how to take notes, why not use the time remaining before your convention to do so? Even the very young can be encouraged to write down Scripture citations and related key words they hear expressed by the speakers. Some parents arrange to review main points from the day’s program after returning to their place of lodging or while traveling home.</p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb"><sup>24 </sup>Of course, most parents appreciate that the natural inclination of children is to be playful. They lack experience in life, and they are immature. Therefore, they have to be taught when to pay attention and how to conduct themselves at meetings. This calls for good supervision by their parents. Some parents have been lax in this area. At times, although parents may be showing proper reverence to Jehovah during a prayer, their children are playing and distracting others. Parents should know what their children are doing during prayers. What are they doing when they leave their seats during the program? Are children left unsupervised during or after the convention program?</p>
<p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb"><sup>25 </sup>In some cases parents have left their children unsupervised in motel swimming pools while they are in the room, out to dinner, or involved in other activity. There are reports of children being so rowdy in the pool that the management had to close it early. This adversely affected the privileges of non-Witness guests also. In other instances, children remained in the pool well beyond closing time. Young ones have been left without proper adult supervision in the rooms to watch television but later have been found creating problems while playing with the elevators, running around in the lobby and corridors, and throwing buckets of ice down the corridors. Such unruliness and conduct unbefitting Christians is often the result of permissiveness and a lack of discipline in the home.</p>
<p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb"><sup>26 </sup>One motel manager who observed such conduct was moved to write a letter to all of the Witnesses staying in his motel as follows: “Over the past evening or two, there have been many children running freely around the hotel and swimming pool area. . . . Also, there has been much property damage of the hotel facilities. Anyone found damaging hotel property will be arrested. Children . . . are not allowed to run freely about the hotel (for their protection). They must be escorted by their <em>parents. </em>Their escort may not be an older [fleshly] brother or sister.” True godly devotion should motivate parents to give close supervision to their children at all times as they bring them up “in the discipline and mental-regulating of Jehovah.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:6:4-49:6:4" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Eph. 6:4</a>.</p>
<p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sb"><sup>27 </sup><strong>YOUR FULL COOPERATION IS APPRECIATED: </strong>Considerable planning and work have been done to see that sufficient seating, literature, food, and other provisions are available for everyone attending the convention. To ensure the effectiveness of these arrangements, each congregation has been specifically assigned to a particular convention. Your full cooperation is vital in order to prevent overcrowding. Of course, there may be circumstances that make it necessary for a few to attend a convention in another area. However, most should be able to attend the convention at their assigned location.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:13:5-46:13:5" data-bid="15-1" class="b">1 Cor. 13:5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:2:4-50:2:4" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> Phil. 2:4</a>.</p>
<p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="sb"><sup>28 </sup>Your full cooperation is requested in the matter of saving seats. Please keep in mind that SEATS MAY BE SAVED ONLY FOR YOUR IMMEDIATE FAMILY MEMBERS AND ANY WHO MAY BE TRAVELING WITH YOU IN YOUR OWN CAR. Please do not reserve seats for others. At times, extra seats are reserved for no one in particular. This is unloving and is misleading to the attendants and others looking for available seats. In harmony with the Bible counsel, we should complement our godly devotion with brotherly affection and cooperate fully with the approved arrangement for saving seats.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:1:5-61:1:8" data-bid="16-1" class="b">2 Pet. 1:5-8</a>.</p>
<p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="sb"><sup>29</sup> It is suggested that good judgment be used in bringing personal items to the convention site. In the past, some have brought large coolers or other bulky items that could not be placed under their seats. These were placed in the aisle or on seats. This resulted in depriving others of a seat, and sometimes it violated fire and safety codes. We need to show consideration in such matters.</p>
<p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="sb"><span id="page6" class="pageNum" data-no="6" data-before-text="6"></span><sup>30 </sup>The use of video cameras and audio recording equipment is permitted at the convention site. However, those who use such equipment must exercise care to avoid disturbing or distracting others. Such equipment should not be set up in aisles or exits. No such equipment should be connected to the public address system or electrical outlets. Floodlights will not be permitted. Those who are causing a distraction or ignoring any of the above guidelines should without hesitation correct the matter when it is brought to their attention. Attendants and others in charge will be alert to correct any violation of these guidelines, and they should receive full cooperation from those using such equipment.</p>
<p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="sb"><sup>31 </sup><strong>OUR GODLY DEVOTION </strong>will face severe tests in the near future. “In fact, all those desiring to live with godly devotion in association with Christ Jesus will also be persecuted.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:12-55:3:12" data-bid="17-1" class="b">2 Tim. 3:12</a>) How grateful we are to Jehovah for spiritual provisions such as the “Godly Devotion” District Conventions, where he will be training us and “instructing us to repudiate ungodliness and worldly desires and to live with soundness of mind and righteousness and godly devotion amid this present system of things.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/56:2:12-56:2:12" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Titus 2:12</a>.</p>
<p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="se"><strong>[Box on page 6]</strong></p>
<p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="sc"><strong>District Convention Reminders</strong></p>
<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="sc">  <strong>ROOMING: </strong>Your cooperation in using the listing of accommodations provided by the convention is very much appreciated. If you have not already confirmed a reservation, please do so immediately if you are planning to stay overnight in the convention city. If you find it necessary to cancel your reservation, you should write or phone the motel directly, doing so as far in advance as possible so that the room can be made available to someone else.</p>
<p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="sb">Congregation secretaries should be sure that Special Needs Room Request Forms have been promptly forwarded to the appropriate convention address. If you must cancel an accommodation made through the special needs arrangement, you should immediately notify both the landlord or motel and the convention Rooming Department so that the room can be reassigned.</p>
<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="sc">  <strong>BABY STROLLERS: </strong>In many states, baby strollers may not be used in places of public assembly. Fire regulations prohibit parking them in corridors, aisles, or between rows of seats. Since larger crowds may cause congested conditions, baby strollers are potentially dangerous not only to the baby but also to any who may stumble over them, so please do not bring them to the convention site. However, infant or car seats are permissible, since these can be secured in seats next to the parents. Your cooperation in this matter will be appreciated.</p>
<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="sc">  <strong>BAPTISM: </strong>Baptismal candidates should endeavor to be in their seats in the designated section before the program begins on Saturday morning. A modest bathing suit and a towel should be brought by each one who plans to be baptized. After the baptism talk and prayer by the speaker, the session chairman will give brief instructions to baptismal candidates and then call for a song. Beginning with the last verse, the attendants will direct the baptismal candidates to the immersion site or to vehicles that will take them there, while the rest of the audience completes the singing of the song. Since baptism in symbol of one’s dedication is an intimate and personal matter between the individual and Jehovah, there is no provision for so-called partner baptisms in which two or more baptismal candidates embrace or hold hands while being baptized.</p>
<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="sc">  <strong>PIONEER IDENTIFICATION: </strong>All <em>regular </em>and <em>special </em>pioneers, as well as traveling overseers, will need to bring their Watchtower Identification and Assignment card (S-202) to the convention. Pioneers on the list for at least six months at the time of the district convention they attend will receive $15 worth of convention food tickets upon presentation of their Watchtower ID card at one convention only. Therefore, treat the card as carefully as you would cash. It cannot be replaced at the convention. Any gift releases or literature at pioneer rates will be available to pioneers at the bookroom only upon showing their Watchtower ID card. Those in Bethel service may obtain these same provisions by showing their Bethel ID card.</p>
<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="sc">  <strong>VOLUNTEER SERVICE: </strong>Volunteer help is needed for the smooth operation of a district convention. Even if you may be able to work for only a part of the convention, your services will be appreciated. If you can assist, please report to the Volunteer Service Department when you arrive at the convention. Children under 16 years of age can also contribute to the success of the convention, but they are required to work with a parent or other responsible adult.</p>
<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="sc">  <strong>LAPEL CARDS: </strong>Please <em>wear </em>the specially designed lapel card at the convention and while traveling to and from the convention site. This often makes it possible for us to give a fine witness while traveling. Lapel cards should be obtained through your congregation, as they will <em>not </em>be available at the conventions.</p>
<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="sc">  <strong>WORDS OF CAUTION: </strong>Regardless of where you park, you should lock your vehicle at <em>all </em>times and <em>never </em>leave anything visible inside. Keep your belongings locked inside the trunk, if possible. Also, guard against thieves and pickpockets, who are attracted by large gatherings. This includes not leaving anything of value unattended on seats at the conventions. Please be careful.</p>
<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="sc">  It has been reported that some motels provide easy access to television movies with immoral content or even of pornographic nature. This highlights the need to avoid unsupervised TV watching by children at these places of lodging.</p>
<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="sb"></p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">JESUS said in prayer to God: “This means everlasting life, their taking in knowledge of you, the only true God, and of the one whom you sent forth, Jesus Christ.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:3-43:17:3" data-bid="1-1" class="b">John 17:3</a>) What kind of knowledge? “[God’s] will is that all sorts of men should be saved and come to an <em>accurate </em>knowledge of truth.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:2:4-54:2:4" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Timothy 2:4</a>) <em>The Amplified Bible </em>renders the latter phrase this way: “Know precisely <em>and </em>correctly the [divine] Truth.”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">So God wants us to know him and his purposes accurately, in conformity with divine truth. And God’s Word, the Holy Bible, is the source of that truth. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:17-43:17:17" data-bid="3-1" class="b">John 17:17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:16-55:3:17" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 2 Timothy 3:16, 17</a>) When people learn accurately what the Bible says about God, then they will avoid being like those mentioned at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:10:2-45:10:3" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Romans 10:2, 3</a>, who had “a zeal for God; but not according to accurate knowledge.” Or like the Samaritans, to whom Jesus said: “You worship what you do not know.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:4:22-43:4:22" data-bid="5-1" class="b">John 4:22</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Therefore, if we want God’s approval, we need to ask ourselves: What does <em>God </em>say about himself? How does <em>he </em>want to be worshiped? What are <em>his </em>purposes, and how should we fit in with them? An accurate knowledge of the truth gives us the right answers to such questions. Then we can worship God on his terms.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="ss"><strong><em>Dishonoring God</em></strong></p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">“THOSE honoring me I shall honor,” says God. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:2:30-9:2:30" data-bid="6-1" class="b">1 Samuel 2:30</a>) Does it honor God to call anyone his equal? Does it honor him to call Mary “the mother of God” and the “Mediatrix . . . between the Creator and His creatures,” as does the <em>New Catholic Encyclopedia? </em>No, those ideas insult God. No one is his equal; nor did he have a fleshly mother, since Jesus was not God. And there is no “Mediatrix,” for God has appointed only “one mediator between God and men,” Jesus.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:2:5-54:2:5" data-bid="7-1" class="b">1 Timothy 2:5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:2:1-62:2:2" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 1 John 2:1, 2</a>.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Beyond a doubt, the Trinity doctrine has confused and diluted people’s understanding of God’s true position. It prevents people from accurately knowing the Universal Sovereign, Jehovah God, and from worshiping him on his terms. As theologian Hans Küng said: “Why should anyone want to add anything to the notion of God’s oneness and uniqueness that can only dilute or nullify that oneness and uniqueness?” But that is what belief in the Trinity has done.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Those who believe in the Trinity are not “holding God in accurate knowledge.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:1:28-45:1:28" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Romans 1:28</a>) That verse also says: “God gave them up to a disapproved mental state, to do the things not fitting.” <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:1:29-45:1:31" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Rom 1 Verses 29 to 31</a> list some of those ‘unfitting’ things, such as ‘murder, strife, being false to agreements, having no natural affection, merciless.’ Those very things have been practiced by religions that accept the Trinity.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">For instance, Trinitarians have often persecuted and even killed those who rejected the Trinity doctrine. And they have gone even further. They have killed their fellow Trinitarians in wartime. What could be more ‘unfitting’ than Catholics killing Catholics, Orthodox killing Orthodox, Protestants killing Protestants—all in the name of the same Trinitarian God?</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Yet, Jesus plainly said: “By this all will know that you are my disciples, <em>if you have love among yourselves.” </em>(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:13:35-43:13:35" data-bid="10-1" class="b">John 13:35</a>) God’s Word expands on this, saying: “The children of God and the children of the Devil are evident by this fact: Everyone who does not carry on righteousness does not originate with God, <em>neither does he who does not love his brother.” </em>It likens those who kill their spiritual brothers to “Cain, who originated with the wicked one [Satan] and slaughtered his brother.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:3:10-62:3:12" data-bid="11-1" class="b">1 John 3:10-12</a>.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Thus, the teaching of confusing doctrines about God has led to actions that violate his laws. Indeed, what has happened throughout Christendom is what Danish theologian Søren Kierkegaard described: “Christendom has done away with Christianity without being quite aware of it.”</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb"><span id="page31" class="pageNum" data-no="31" data-before-text="31"></span>Christendom’s spiritual condition fits what the apostle Paul wrote: “They publicly declare they know God, but they disown him by their works, because they are detestable and disobedient and not approved for good work of any sort.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/56:1:16-56:1:16" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Titus 1:16</a>.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Soon, when God brings this present wicked system of things to its end, Trinitarian Christendom will be called to account. And she will be judged adversely for her God-dishonoring actions and doctrines.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:14-40:24:14" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Matthew 24:14,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:34-40:24:34" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 34;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:25:31-40:25:34" data-bid="13-3" class="b"> 25:31-34,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:25:41-40:25:41" data-bid="13-4" class="b"> 41,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:25:46-40:25:46" data-bid="13-5" class="b"> 46;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:17:1-66:17:6" data-bid="13-6" class="b"> Revelation 17:1-6,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:17:16-66:17:16" data-bid="13-7" class="b"> 16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:18:1-66:18:8" data-bid="13-8" class="b"> 18:1-8,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:18:20-66:18:20" data-bid="13-9" class="b"> 20,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:18:24-66:18:24" data-bid="13-10" class="b"> 24;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:19:17-66:19:21" data-bid="13-11" class="b"> 19:17-21</a>.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="ss"><strong><em>Reject the Trinity</em></strong></p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">THERE can be no compromise with God’s truths. Hence, to worship God on his terms means to reject the Trinity doctrine. It contradicts what the prophets, Jesus, the apostles, and the early Christians believed and taught. It contradicts what God says about himself in his own inspired Word. Thus, he counsels: “Acknowledge that I alone am God and that there is no one else like me.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:46:9-23:46:9" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Isaiah 46:9</a>, <em>TEV.</em></p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">God’s interests are not served by making him confusing and mysterious. Instead, the more that people become confused about God and his purposes, the better it suits God’s Adversary, Satan the Devil, the ‘god of this world.’ It is he who promotes such false doctrines to ‘blind the minds of unbelievers.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:4:4-47:4:4" data-bid="15-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 4:4</a>) And the Trinity doctrine also serves the interests of clergymen who want to maintain their hold on people, for they make it appear as though only theologians can understand it.—See <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:8:44-43:8:44" data-bid="16-1" class="b">John 8:44</a>.</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">Accurate knowledge of God brings great relief. It frees us from teachings that are in conflict with God’s Word and from organizations that have apostatized. As Jesus said: “You will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:8:32-43:8:32" data-bid="17-1" class="b">John 8:32</a>.</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">By honoring God as supreme and worshiping him on his terms, we can avoid the judgment that he will soon bring on apostate Christendom. Instead, we can look forward to God’s favor when this system ends: “The world is passing away and so is its desire, but he that does the will of God remains forever.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:2:17-62:2:17" data-bid="18-1" class="b">1 John 2:17</a>.</p>

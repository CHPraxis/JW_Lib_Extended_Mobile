<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">God promises eternal life to those who honor him. “The righteous themselves will possess the earth, and they will reside forever upon it,” his Word assures us.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:37:29-19:37:29" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 37:29</a></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Yet, to be counted among “the righteous,” you need to do more than become informed about the Trinity teaching. You need to progress in knowledge about God. Jehovah’s Witnesses will be happy to help you, if you are not already receiving that help. Just write to Watch Tower at the appropriate address listed below, requesting further information or that one of Jehovah’s Witnesses come to your home and regularly study the Bible with you free of charge.</p>

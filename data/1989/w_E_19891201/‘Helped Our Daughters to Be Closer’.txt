‘Helped Our Daughters to Be Closer’
Writing to the Watch Tower Society branch office last year, a schoolteacher in Murewa, Zimbabwe, said that this is what My Book of Bible Stories accomplished. She received the publication from a fellow teacher and reported:
“I followed his advice on how to get the best out of that book, first with my youngest 8-year-old daughter and then with two others, aged 16 and 18, who were at a local Boarding Secondary School. I have great pleasure to let you know that the response from all three of my daughters has indeed been very encouraging. Their moral behaviour has since been noticeably changing for the better.” The mother added: “The book has successfully helped our daughters to be closer to us, their parents, than ever before.”
This 256-page publication, the same page size as this magazine, may be received by filling in and mailing the accompanying coupon along with $3. The book’s 116 Bible accounts give the reader an idea of what the Bible is all about. These stories appear in the order in which the events occurred in history. You will find this really helpful in learning when, in relation to other events, things happened in history. The book is beautifully illustrated and has large print.
Please send, postpaid, the hardbound book My Book of Bible Stories, for which I enclose $3 (U.S.).

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">That was the comment of a woman who had applied the advice provided in the book <em>Making Your Family Life Happy. </em>She was having marriage problems and began discussing these with the woman who cleaned her house. The cleaning lady writes:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“Any advice I gave her was right out of the book. Finally I told her I had a book she might find interesting. I explained how it had helped me and that it had a lot of common sense from the Bible. A few days later, I spoke to her on the phone and was informed that she and her husband had read in it and decided to treat each other a little nicer.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“This evening she called again to tell me, among other things, that their life has never been happier than it is now. They have read the book together, checked it out in the Bible, and are applying the principles in it.”</p>

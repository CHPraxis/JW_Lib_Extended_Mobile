“Godly Devotion” District Convention
THE apostle Paul wrote: “In the last days critical times hard to deal with will be here. For men will be . . . lovers of pleasures rather than lovers of God, having a form of godly devotion but proving false to its power.”​—2 Timothy 3:1-5.
How those words accurately describe the vast majority of those who profess to be Christians! According to one clergyman, “today too many churches have become . . . entertainment centers.” In striking contrast, Christ’s true followers are a people “zealous for fine works.” (Titus 2:14) Jesus’ followers are “the salt of the earth” and “the light of the world.”​—Matthew 5:13, 14.
Our annual conventions, district, national, and international, are some facets of our worship that make us unique. The very theme for our 1989 district conventions, “Godly Devotion,” points to a quality of our worship that makes us stand out as different.
The Scriptures emphasize the importance of godly devotion. This convention will be a further opportunity to “be training yourself with godly devotion as your aim. For bodily training is beneficial for a little; but godly devotion is beneficial for all things, as it holds promise of the life now and that which is to come.” (1 Timothy 4:7, 8) And 1 Timothy 6:6 further states: “To be sure, it is a means of great gain, this godly devotion along with self-sufficiency.” Jesus Christ is the very epitome of godly devotion.​—1 Timothy 3:16.
The Greek word rendered “godly devotion” is eu·seʹbei·a. For Christians it “is the highest kind of devotion to God.” Devotion is “earnestness and zeal in the performance of religious duties.” Godly devotion is a response of the heart that will motivate one to live in a way that pleases God. It means being oriented to God. How careful we must be that while we are in the world, we become no part of it! Godly fear will keep us from doing what is bad, but godly devotion motivates us to do that which is pleasing to God. Encouragingly, at 2 Peter 2:9 we are assured that “Jehovah knows how to deliver people of godly devotion out of trial.”
To acquire godly devotion requires taking God and his Word seriously. To exercise godly devotion, one needs to know God accurately and then act in harmony with that knowledge. It calls for being conscious of one’s spiritual need. Because of the importance of our genuinely practicing godly devotion, we need all the help we can possibly get. Our district conventions will do much to provide us with that help. By means of talks, demonstrations, and interviews, we will be taught how to exercise godly devotion in all avenues of our lives.
We do want to be genuine Christians and thereby stand out as different from the world. So come to these conventions with a good spiritual appetite. Make it a point to be there for the opening song on Friday morning, and remain through the closing song and prayer on Sunday afternoon. Rivet your attention on the platform as long as the program lasts. Resist the temptation or inclination to visit during the sessions. Come prepared to take notes. By paying close attention to the program, you will more than ever be fully equipped to practice godly devotion in all avenues of life: in the family circle, in the congregation, and toward outsiders.

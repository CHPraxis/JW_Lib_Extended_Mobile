Your Future
Today’s youths have grown up under the threat of having no future at all. Nuclear war, ecological disaster, and economic chaos all loom large on the horizon. The fate of mankind, however, may be the least of your worries. You may be far more concerned with where you will be 10, 20, or 30 years from now.
Fortunately, there is real reason for you to be optimistic about your future. This depends upon how you utilize the present.

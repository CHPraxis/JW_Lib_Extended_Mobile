Section 6
Sex and Morals
Many youths will no doubt turn to this section of the book first. Why? Because no subject generates as many questions and as much controversy​—and confusion—​as sex and morals. Morality, however, encompasses more than sexual behavior. For example, can you call a youth moral who lies and cheats? Or are there situations in which dishonesty is OK? Fortunately, the Bible gives us some direct and practical guidelines on these matters of morality.

“Continue in the Things That You Learned”
That is what the apostle Paul wrote to young Timothy. (2 Timothy 3:14) After reading this publication, you know about the many good things God has in store for those who love him. But you need to continue to progress in a spiritual way. Jehovah’s Witnesses will be happy to help you, if you are not already receiving that help. Just write to Watch Tower at the appropriate address listed below, requesting further information or that one of Jehovah’s Witnesses come to your home and regularly study the Bible with you free of charge.

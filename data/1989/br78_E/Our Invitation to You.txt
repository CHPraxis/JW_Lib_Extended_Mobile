See how we endeavor to share with others the good news of a paradise earth under Christ’s Kingdom.
God has promised it. “There are new heavens and a new earth that we are awaiting according to his promise, and in these righteousness is to dwell.” (2 Peter 3:13) Nineteen centuries have passed. The waiting period approaches its end. World conditions signify this. The fulfillment of Jesus’ promise draws near: “As these things start to occur, raise yourselves erect and lift your heads up, because your deliverance is getting near.”​—Luke 21:28.
“As you behold the day drawing near,” the apostle Paul said, “consider one another to incite to love and fine works, not forsaking the gathering of ourselves together.” (Hebrews 10:24, 25) Our invitation to you is, Heed Paul’s advice by assembling with us.

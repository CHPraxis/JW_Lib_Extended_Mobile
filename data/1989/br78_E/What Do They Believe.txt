What Do They Believe?
Jehovah’s Witnesses believe in Almighty God, Jehovah, Creator of the heavens and the earth. The very existence of the intricately designed wonders in the universe surrounding us reasonably argues that a supremely intelligent and powerful Creator produced it all. Just as the works of men and women reflect their qualities, so do those of Jehovah God. The Bible tells us that “his invisible qualities are clearly seen from the world’s creation onward, because they are perceived by the things made.” Also, without voice or words, “the heavens are declaring the glory of God.”​—Romans 1:20; Psalm 19:1-4.
People do not mold clay pots or make television sets and computers without a purpose. The earth and its creations of plant and animal life are far more marvelous. The structure of the human body with its trillions of cells is beyond our understanding​—even the brain with which we think is incomprehensibly wonderful! If men have a purpose in bringing forth their comparatively insignificant inventions, surely Jehovah God had a purpose in his awesome creations! Proverbs 16:4 says that he does: “Everything Jehovah has made for his purpose.”
Jehovah made the earth for a purpose, as he stated to the first human pair: “Be fruitful and become many and fill the earth . . . , have in subjection the fish of the sea and the flying creatures of the heavens and every living creature that is moving upon the earth.” (Genesis 1:28) Because they became disobedient, this couple failed to fill the earth with righteous families who would lovingly care for the earth and its plants and animals. But their failure does not make Jehovah’s purpose fail. Thousands of years later it was written: “God, the Former of the earth . . . , did not create it simply for nothing.” He “formed it even to be inhabited.” It is not to be destroyed, but “the earth endures for ever.” (Isaiah 45:18; Ecclesiastes 1:4, The New English Bible) Jehovah’s purpose for the earth will be realized: “My own counsel will stand, and everything that is my delight I shall do.”​—Isaiah 46:10.
Hence, Jehovah’s Witnesses believe that the earth will remain forever and that all persons, living and dead, who will fit in with Jehovah’s purpose for a beautified, inhabited earth may live on it forever. All mankind inherited imperfection from Adam and Eve and, hence, are sinners. (Romans 5:12) The Bible tells us: “The wages sin pays is death.” “The living are conscious that they will die; but as for the dead, they are conscious of nothing at all.” “The soul that is sinning​—it itself will die.” (Romans 6:23; Ecclesiastes 9:5; Ezekiel 18:4, 20) Then how can they live again to share in the earthly blessings? Only through the ransom sacrifice of Christ Jesus, for he said: “I am the resurrection and the life. He that exercises faith in me, even though he dies, will come to life.” “All those in the memorial tombs will hear his voice and come out.”​—John 11:25; 5:28, 29; Matthew 20:28.
How will this come about? It is explained in “the good news of the kingdom” that Jesus started to proclaim while on earth. (Matthew 4:17-23) But today Jehovah’s Witnesses are preaching the good news in a very special way.

They Reach the Heart
A mother from Virginia, U.S.A. writes: “We have a five-year-old son, Keith. At this stage in his young life, he is not particularly religiously minded. This is not to say he is not a good boy. He is very loving and kind and listens to his conscience. But he usually shrugs off most attempts at Bible discussions or changes the topic quickly. So we pray for patience and seek other ways to inculcate spiritual truths into his tender heart.
“The boy has now developed an avid interest in stories. Enter the Bible Stories book and next the tapes. His grandma gave him a cassette player. We showed him how to use it. Now for hours at a time, he sits with book in hand, following along with the tapes.
“Bedtime here is customarily story time. Tonight I said I was too tired, but perhaps he might like to tell me one. I requested a Bible story. Imagine my delight when he proceeded to tell me about Job, then David and Goliath, then Ruth and Naomi. When he came to the part where Ruth comes to love Jehovah very much, he giggled and said, ‘That’s my favorite part!’
“An added blessing came when I realized he also imitates intonation, punctuation, and is practicing better diction! And he quotes these stories word for word! Thank you, thank you, thank you!”

<div class="openingContent"><p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sa"><strong>Definition: </strong>Jehovah God’s written Word to humankind. He used some 40 human secretaries over a period of 16 centuries to record it, but God himself actively directed the writing by his spirit. Thus it is inspired by God. A large portion of the record is made up of actual pronouncements made by Jehovah and details as to the teachings and activities of Jesus Christ, the Son of God. In these we find statements of God’s requirements for his servants and what he will do to bring his grand purpose for the earth to completion. To deepen our appreciation for these things, Jehovah also preserved in the Bible a record demonstrating what happens when individuals and nations listen to God and work in harmony with his purpose, as well as the outcome when they go their own way. By means of this reliable historical record Jehovah acquaints us with his dealings with humankind and thus with his own marvelous personality.</p>

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn"><strong>Reasons for considering the Bible</strong></p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="si"><strong><em>The Bible itself says it is from God, mankind’s Creator</em></strong></p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="si"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:16-55:3:17" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Tim. 3:16, 17</a>: “All Scripture is inspired of God and beneficial for teaching, for reproving, for setting things straight, for disciplining in righteousness, that the man of <span id="page59" class="pageNum" data-no="59" data-before-text="59"></span>God may be fully competent, completely equipped for every good work.”</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="si"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:1:1-66:1:1" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Rev. 1:1</a>: “A revelation by Jesus Christ, which God gave him, to show his slaves the things that must shortly take place.”</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="si"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:23:1-10:23:2" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2 Sam. 23:1, 2</a>: “The utterance of David the son of Jesse . . . The spirit of Jehovah it was that spoke by me, and his word was upon my tongue.”</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="si"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:22:15-23:22:15" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Isa. 22:15</a>: “This is what the Sovereign Lord, Jehovah of armies, has said.”</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="si">We would expect God’s message to all mankind to be available around the globe. The Bible, the whole or in part, has been translated into some 1,800 languages. Its circulation totals in the billions. Says <em>The World Book Encyclopedia: </em>“The Bible is the most widely read book in history. It is probably also the most influential. More copies have been distributed of the Bible than of any other book. It has also been translated more times into more languages than any other book.”—(1984), Vol. 2, p. 219.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="si"><strong><em>Bible prophecy explains the meaning of world conditions</em></strong></p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="si">Many world leaders acknowledge that mankind is on the brink of disaster. The Bible foretold these conditions long ago; it explains their meaning and what the outcome will be. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:1-55:3:5" data-bid="5-1" class="b">2 Tim. 3:1-5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:21:25-42:21:31" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Luke 21:25-31</a>) It tells what we must do in order to survive the impending world destruction, with the opportunity to gain eternal life under righteous conditions here on earth.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/36:2:3-36:2:3" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Zeph. 2:3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:3-43:17:3" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> John 17:3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:37:10-19:37:11" data-bid="6-3" class="b"> Ps. 37:10, 11,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:37:29-19:37:29" data-bid="6-4" class="b"> 29</a>.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="si"><strong><em>The Bible enables us to understand the purpose of life</em></strong></p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="si">It answers such questions as: Where did life come from? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:17:24-44:17:26" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Acts 17:24-26</a>) Why are we here? Is it just to live a few years, get what we can out of life, and then die?—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:27-1:1:28" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Gen. 1:27, 28;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:5:12-45:5:12" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> Rom. 5:12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:3-43:17:3" data-bid="8-3" class="b"> John 17:3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:37:11-19:37:11" data-bid="8-4" class="b"> Ps. 37:11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:40:8-19:40:8" data-bid="8-5" class="b"> Ps. 40:8</a>.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="si"><strong><em>The Bible shows how we can have the very things that lovers of righteousness desire most</em></strong></p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="si">It tells us where to find wholesome associates who truly <span id="page60" class="pageNum" data-no="60" data-before-text="60"></span>love one another (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:13:35-43:13:35" data-bid="9-1" class="b">John 13:35</a>), what can give assurance that we will have sufficient food for ourselves and our families (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:31-40:6:33" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Matt. 6:31-33;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:19:15-20:19:15" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> Prov. 19:15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:4:28-49:4:28" data-bid="10-3" class="b"> Eph. 4:28</a>), how we can be happy in spite of difficult conditions that surround us.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:1:1-19:1:2" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Ps. 1:1, 2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:34:8-19:34:8" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 34:8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:11:28-42:11:28" data-bid="11-3" class="b"> Luke 11:28;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:20:35-44:20:35" data-bid="11-4" class="b"> Acts 20:35</a>.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="si">It explains that God’s Kingdom, his government, will remove the present wicked system (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:2:44-27:2:44" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Dan. 2:44</a>), and under its rule mankind will be able to enjoy perfect health and eternal life.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:3-66:21:4" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Rev. 21:3, 4</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:33:24-23:33:24" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Isaiah 33:24</a>.</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="si"><em>Surely a book that claims to be from God, that explains both the meaning of world conditions and the purpose of life, and that shows how our problems will be solved is worthy of consideration.</em></p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sn"><strong>Evidences of inspiration</strong></p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="si"><strong><em>It is filled with prophecies reflecting detailed knowledge of the future—something impossible for humans</em></strong></p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="si"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:1:20-61:1:21" data-bid="15-1" class="b">2 Pet. 1:20, 21</a>: “No prophecy of Scripture springs from any private interpretation. For prophecy was at no time brought by man’s will, but men spoke from God as they were borne along by holy spirit.”</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="si">▪ Prophecy: <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:44:24-23:44:24" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Isa. 44:24,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:44:27-23:44:28" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> 27, 28;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:45:1-23:45:4" data-bid="16-3" class="b"> 45:1-4</a>: “Jehovah . . . the One saying to the watery deep, ‘Be evaporated; and all your rivers I shall dry up’; the One saying of Cyrus, ‘He is my shepherd, and all that I delight in he will completely carry out’; even in my saying of Jerusalem, ‘She will be rebuilt,’ and of the temple, ‘You will have your foundation laid.’ This is what Jehovah has said to his anointed one, to Cyrus, whose right hand I have taken hold of, to subdue before him nations, so that I may ungird even the hips of kings; to open before him the two-leaved doors, so that even the gates will not be shut: ‘Before you I myself shall go, and the swells of land I shall straighten out. The copper doors I shall break in pieces, and the iron bars I shall cut down. . . . For the sake of my servant Jacob and of Israel my chosen one, I even proceeded to call you by your name.’” (Writing by Isaiah was completed by about 732 B.C.E.)</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="si"><span id="page61" class="pageNum" data-no="61" data-before-text="61"></span>□ Fulfillment: Cyrus had not been born when the prophecy was written. The Jews were not taken into exile to Babylon until 617-607 B.C.E., and Jerusalem and its temple were not destroyed until 607 B.C.E. In detail the prophecy was fulfilled starting in 539 B.C.E. Cyrus diverted the waters of the Euphrates River into an artificial lake, the river gates of Babylon were carelessly left open during feasting in the city, and Babylon fell to the Medes and Persians under Cyrus. Thereafter, Cyrus liberated the Jewish exiles and sent them back to Jerusalem with instructions to rebuild Jehovah’s temple there.—<em>The Encyclopedia Americana </em>(1956), Vol. III, p. 9; <em>Light From the Ancient Past </em>(Princeton, 1959), Jack Finegan, pp. 227-229; <em>“All Scripture Is Inspired of God and Beneficial” </em>(New York, 1983), pp. 282, 284, 295.</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="si">▪ Prophecy: <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:49:17-24:49:18" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Jer. 49:17, 18</a>: “‘Edom must become an object of astonishment. Everyone passing along by her will stare in astonishment and whistle on account of all her plagues. Just as in the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah and her neighbor towns,’ Jehovah has said, ‘no man will dwell there.’” (Jeremiah’s recording of prophecies was completed by 580 B.C.E.)</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="si">□ Fulfillment: “They [the Edomites] were driven from Palestine in the 2nd century <span class="altsize">B.C. </span>by Judas Maccabæus, and in 109 <span class="altsize">B.C. </span>John Hyrcanus, Maccabæan leader, extended the kingdom of Judah to include the w. part of Edomitic lands. In the 1st century <span class="altsize">B.C. </span>Roman expansion swept away the last vestige of Edomitic independence . . . After the destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans in 70 <span class="altsize">A.D. </span>. . . the name Idumæa [Edom] disappeared from history.” (<em>The New Funk &amp; Wagnalls Encyclopedia, </em>1952, Vol. 11, p. 4114) Notice that the fulfillment extends down to our day. In no way can it be argued that this prophecy was written <em>after </em>the events had taken place.</p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="si">▪ Prophecy: <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:19:41-42:19:44" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Luke 19:41-44;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:21:20-42:21:21" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> 21:20, 21</a>: “He [Jesus Christ] viewed the city [Jerusalem] and wept over it, saying: . . . ‘The days will come upon you when your enemies will build around you a fortification with pointed stakes and will encircle you and distress you from every side, and they will dash you and your children within you to the ground, and <span id="page62" class="pageNum" data-no="62" data-before-text="62"></span>they will not leave a stone upon a stone in you, because you did not discern the time of your being inspected.’” Two days later, he counseled his disciples: “When you see Jerusalem surrounded by encamped armies, then know that the desolating of her has drawn near. Then let those in Judea begin fleeing to the mountains, and let those in the midst of her withdraw.” (Prophecy spoken by Jesus Christ in 33 C.E.)</p>
<p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="si">□ Fulfillment: Jerusalem revolted against Rome, and in 66 C.E. the Roman army under Cestius Gallus attacked the city. But, as Jewish historian Josephus reports, the Roman commander “suddenly called off his men, abandoned hope though he had suffered no reverse, and flying in the face of all reason retired from the City.” (<em>Josephus, the Jewish War, </em>Penguin Classics, 1969, p. 167) This provided opportunity for Christians to flee from the city, which they did, moving to Pella, beyond the Jordan, according to Eusebius Pamphilus in his <em>Ecclesiastical History. </em>(Translated by C. F. Crusé, London, 1894, p. 75) Then around Passover time of the year 70 C.E. General Titus besieged the city, an encircling fence 4.5 miles (7.2 km) long was erected in just three days, and after five months Jerusalem fell. “Jerusalem itself was systematically destroyed and the Temple left in ruins. Archaeological work shows us today just how effective was the destruction of Jewish buildings all over the land.”—<em>The Bible and Archaeology </em>(Grand Rapids, Mich.; 1962), J. A. Thompson, p. 299.</p>
<p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="si"><strong><em>Its contents are scientifically sound on matters that human researchers discovered only at a later date</em></strong></p>
<p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="si"><strong><em>Origin of the Universe: </em></strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:1-1:1:1" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Gen. 1:1</a>: “In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.” In 1978, astronomer Robert Jastrow wrote: “Now we see how the astronomical evidence leads to a biblical view of the origin of the world. The details differ, but the essential elements in the astronomical and biblical accounts of Genesis are the same: the chain of events leading to man commenced suddenly and sharply at a definite moment in time, in a flash of light and energy.”—<em>God and the Astronomers </em>(New York, 1978), p. 14.</p>
<p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="si"><span id="page63" class="pageNum" data-no="63" data-before-text="63"></span><strong><em>Shape of Planet Earth: </em></strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:40:22-23:40:22" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Isa. 40:22</a>: “There is One who is dwelling above the circle of the earth.” In ancient times the general opinion was that the earth was flat. It was not until over 200 years after this Bible text had been written that a school of Greek philosophers reasoned that the earth likely was spherical, and in about another 300 years a Greek astronomer calculated the approximate radius of the earth. But the idea of a spherical earth was not the general view even then. Only in the 20th century has it been possible for humans to travel by airplane, and later into outer space and even to the moon, thus giving them a clear view of “the circle” of earth’s horizon.</p>
<p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="si"><strong><em>Animal Life: </em></strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:11:6-3:11:6" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Lev. 11:6</a>: “The hare . . . is a chewer of the cud.” Though this was long attacked by some critics, the rabbit’s cud chewing was finally observed by Englishman William Cowper in the 18th century. The unusual way in which it is done was described in 1940 in <em>Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London, </em>Vol. 110, Series A, pp. 159-163.</p>
<p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="si"><strong><em>Its internal harmony is significant</em></strong></p>
<p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="si">This is especially so in view of the fact that the books of the Bible were recorded by some 40 men as diverse as king, prophet, herdsman, tax collector, and physician. They did the writing over a period of 1,610 years; so there was no opportunity for collusion. Yet their writings agree, even in the smallest detail. To appreciate the extent to which the various portions of the Bible are harmoniously intertwined, you must read and study it personally.</p>
<p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="sn"><strong>How can we be sure the Bible has not been changed?</strong></p>
<p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="sb">“In the number of ancient MSS. [manuscripts] attesting a writing, and in the number of years that had elapsed between the original and the attesting MSS., the Bible enjoys a decided advantage over classical writings [those of Homer, Plato, and others]. . . . Altogether classical MSS. are but a handful compared with Biblical. No ancient book is so well attested as the Bible.”—<em>The Bible From the Beginning </em>(New York, 1929), P. Marion Simms, pp. 74, 76.</p>
<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="sb"><span id="page64" class="pageNum" data-no="64" data-before-text="64"></span>A report published in 1971 shows that there are possibly 6,000 handwritten copies containing all or part of the Hebrew Scriptures; the oldest dates back to the third century B.C.E. Of the Christian Greek Scriptures, there are some 5,000 in Greek, the oldest dating back to the beginning of the second century C.E. There are also many copies of early translations into other languages.</p>
<p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="sb">In the introduction to his seven volumes on <em>The Chester Beatty Biblical Papyri, </em>Sir Frederic Kenyon wrote: “The first and most important conclusion derived from the examination of them [the papyri] is the satisfactory one that they confirm the essential soundness of the existing texts. No striking or fundamental variation is shown either in the Old or the New Testament. There are no important omissions or additions of passages, and no variations which affect vital facts or doctrines. The variations of text affect minor matters, such as the order of words or the precise words used . . . But their essential importance is their confirmation, by evidence of an earlier date than was hitherto available, of the integrity of our existing texts.”—(London, 1933), p. 15.</p>
<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="sb">It is true that some translations of the Bible adhere more closely to what is in the original languages than others do. Modern paraphrase Bibles have taken liberties that at times alter the original meaning. Some translators have allowed personal beliefs to color their renderings. But these weaknesses can be identified by comparison of a variety of translations.</p>

Even humans have sent messages and pictures from the moon. How did they do it? By using laws that originated long ago with God himself.’ (3) ‘But how can we be sure that what the Bible contains is really from God? It contains information that could not possibly have come from a human source. What kind? Details about the future; and these have always proved to be completely accurate.

In that way we are letting God’s own Word guide our thinking, and the interpretation is not ours but his.

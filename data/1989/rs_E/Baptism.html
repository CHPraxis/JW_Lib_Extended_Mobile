<div class="openingContent"><p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sa"><strong>Definition: </strong>The word “baptize” comes from the Greek <em>ba·ptiʹzein, </em>meaning “to dip, to plunge.” (<em>A Greek-English Lexicon, </em>by Liddell and Scott) Christian water baptism is an outward symbol that the one being baptized has made a complete, unreserved, and unconditional dedication through Jesus Christ to do the will of Jehovah God. The Scriptures also refer to John’s baptism, baptism with holy spirit, and baptism with fire, among others.</p>

<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">However, later on, Origen (185-254 C.E.) wrote: “It is the custom of the church that baptism be administered even to infants.” (<em>Selections From the Commentaries and Homilies of Origen, </em>Madras, India; 1929, p. 211) The practice was confirmed by a Council of Carthage (c. 252 C.E.).</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">Religious historian Augustus Neander wrote: “Faith and baptism were always connected with one another; and thus it is in the highest degree probable . . . that the practice of infant baptism was unknown at this period [in the first century]. . . . That it first became recognised as an apostolic tradition in the course of the third century, is evidence rather <em>against </em>than <em>for </em>the admission of its apostolic origin.”—<em>History of the Planting and Training of the Christian Church by the Apostles </em>(New York, 1864), p. 162.</p>

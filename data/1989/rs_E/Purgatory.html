<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">After reviewing what Catholic writers have said regarding such texts as 2 Maccabees 12:39-45, <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:12:32-40:12:32" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matthew 12:32</a>, and <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:3:10-46:3:15" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 3:10-15</a>, the <em>New Catholic Encyclopedia </em>(1967, Vol. XI, p. 1034) acknowledges: “In the final analysis, the Catholic doctrine on purgatory is based on tradition, not Sacred Scripture.”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">“The church has relied on tradition to support a middle ground between heaven and hell.”—<em>U.S. Catholic, </em>March 1981, p. 7.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn"><strong>Regarding the nature of purgatory, what do Catholic spokesmen say?</strong></p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">“Many think that the total suffering of purgatory is identified with the awareness of the temporary postponement of the beatific vision, although the more common view holds that, in addition to this, there is some positive punishment . . . In the Latin Church it has been generally maintained that this pain is imposed through real fire. This is not, however, essential to belief in purgatory. It is not even certain. . . . Even if one chooses, with the theologians of the East, to reject the idea of suffering induced by fire, one should be careful not to exclude all positive suffering from purgatory. There are still real affliction, sorrow, chagrin, shame of conscience, and other spiritual sorrows capable of inflicting true pain on the soul. . . . One should remember, at any rate, that in the midst of their sufferings these souls also experience great joy over the certainty of salvation.”—<em>New Catholic Encyclopedia </em>(1967), Vol. XI, p. 1036, 1037.</p>

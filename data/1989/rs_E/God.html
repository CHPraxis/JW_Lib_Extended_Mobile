The Hebrew language uses terms for “God” that convey the idea of strength, also of majesty, dignity, and excellence. In contrast to the true God, there are false gods. Some of these have set themselves up as gods; others have been made objects of worship by those who serve them.</p>

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><em>New Scientist </em>magazine said: “The lay view persists—of scientists having ‘disproved’ religion. It is a view that commonly expects scientists to be nonbelievers; that Darwin put the last nails in God’s coffin; and that a succession of scientific and technological innovations since have ruled out the possibility of any resurrection. It is a view that is wildly wrong.”—May 26, 1977, p. 478.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">A member of the French Academy of Sciences stated: “Natural order was not invented by the human mind or set up by certain perceptive powers. . . . The existence of order presupposes the existence of organizing intelligence. Such intelligence can be none other than God’s.”—<em>Dieu existe? Oui </em>(Paris, 1979), Christian Chabanis, quoting Pierre-Paul Grassé, p. 94.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Scientists have identified over 100 chemical elements. Their atomic structure displays an intricate mathematical interrelationship of the elements. The periodic table points to obvious design. Such amazing design could not possibly be accidental, a product of chance.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb"><em>Illustration: </em>When we see a camera, a radio, or a computer, we readily acknowledge that it must have been produced by an intelligent designer. Would it be reasonable, then, to say that far more complex things—the eye, the ear, and the human brain—did not originate with an intelligent Designer?</p>

<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sn"><strong>Does the existence of wickedness and of suffering prove that there is no God?</strong></p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb"><em>Consider examples: </em>Does the fact that knives have been used to murder prove that no one designed them? Is the use of jet aircraft to drop bombs in time of war evidence that they had no designer? Or is it rather the use to which these are being put that is causing grief to mankind?</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Is it not true that much disease is a result of man’s own poor living habits and his spoiling of the environment for himself and others? Are not the wars fought by humans a <span id="page147" class="pageNum" data-no="147" data-before-text="147"></span>major cause of human suffering? Is it not also true that, while millions suffer from lack of food, there is more than enough in other lands, so that one of the underlying problems is human greed? All these things give evidence, not that there is no God, but that humans are sadly misusing their God-given abilities and the earth itself.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="si"><strong><em>Does God really care what happens to us humans?</em></strong></p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="si">Yes, indeed! Consider the evidence: The Bible tells us that God gave man a perfect start. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:27-1:1:27" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Gen. 1:27,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:31-1:1:31" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 31;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:32:4-5:32:4" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> Deut. 32:4</a>) Man’s continued enjoyment of God’s favor, however, depended on obedience to his Maker. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:2:16-1:2:17" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Gen. 2:16, 17</a>) If man was obedient, he would continue to enjoy perfect human life—no sickness, no suffering, no death. The Creator would provide man with needed guidance and would use His power to safeguard mankind against any calamity. But man rejected God’s guidance; he chose the course of self-rule. In trying to do something for which he was never designed, he has brought calamity upon himself. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:10:23-24:10:23" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Jer. 10:23;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:8:9-21:8:9" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> Eccl. 8:9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:5:12-45:5:12" data-bid="6-3" class="b"> Rom. 5:12</a>) Yet, over the centuries God has been patiently seeking out those who, because of love for him and his ways, are willing to serve him. He sets before them the opportunity to enjoy all the blessings of which they have been deprived because of man’s imperfections and misrule. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:3-66:21:5" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Rev. 21:3-5</a>) The provision God made by means of his Son to redeem humans from sin and death is a marvelous evidence of God’s great love for mankind. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:3:16-43:3:16" data-bid="8-1" class="b">John 3:16</a>) God has also set an appointed time when he will destroy those who ruin the earth and will cause lovers of righteousness to enjoy life in harmony with his own original purpose.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:11:18-66:11:18" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Rev. 11:18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:37:10-19:37:11" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> Ps. 37:10, 11</a>; see also the main headings “<a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1101989274/">Suffering</a>” and “<a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1101989277/">Wickedness</a>.”</p>

<p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sb"><em>Is that reasonable? </em>Our minds cannot fully comprehend it. But that is not a sound reason for rejecting it. <em>Consider examples: </em>(1) <em>Time. </em>No one can point to a certain moment as the beginning of time. And it is a fact that, even though our lives end, time does not. We do not reject the idea of time because there are aspects of it that we do not fully comprehend. Rather, we regulate our lives by it. (2) <em>Space. </em>Astronomers find no beginning or end to space. The farther they probe into the universe, the more there is. They do not reject what the evidence shows; many refer to space as being infinite. The same principle applies to the existence of God.</p>
<p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="sb"><em>Other examples: </em>(1) Astronomers tell us that the <em>heat of the sun </em>at its core is 27,000,000 degrees Fahrenheit (15,000,000° C.). Do we reject that idea because we cannot fully comprehend such intense heat? (2) They tell us that the <em>size of our Milky Way </em>is so great that a beam of light traveling at over 186,000 miles per second (300,000 km/sec) would require 100,000 years to cross it. Do our minds really comprehend such a distance? Yet we accept it because scientific evidence supports it.</p>
<p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="sb"><em>Which is more reasonable</em>—that the universe is the product of a living, intelligent Creator? or that it must have arisen simply by chance from a nonliving source without intelligent direction? Some persons adopt the latter viewpoint <span id="page149" class="pageNum" data-no="149" data-before-text="149"></span>because to believe otherwise would mean that they would have to acknowledge the existence of a Creator whose qualities they cannot fully comprehend. But it is well known that scientists do not fully comprehend the functioning of the genes that are within living cells and that determine how these cells will grow. Nor do they fully understand the functioning of the human brain. Yet, who would deny that these exist? Should we really expect to understand everything about a Person who is so great that he could bring into existence the universe, with all its intricate design and stupendous size?</p>

<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="sb">Jesus himself referred to his Father as “the only true God.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:3-43:17:3" data-bid="25-1" class="b">John 17:3</a>) Jehovah himself said: “Besides me there is no God.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:44:6-23:44:6" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Isa. 44:6</a>) The apostle Paul wrote that, to true Christians, “there is . . . one God the Father.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:8:5-46:8:6" data-bid="27-1" class="b">1 Cor. 8:5, 6</a>) So Jehovah is unique; no one else shares his position. Jehovah stands in utter contrast to all such objects of worship as idols, deified humans, and Satan. All these are false gods.</p>
<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="sb">Jesus is spoken of in the Scriptures as “a god,” even as “Mighty God.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:1:1-43:1:1" data-bid="28-1" class="b">John 1:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:9:6-23:9:6" data-bid="28-2" class="b"> Isa. 9:6</a>) But nowhere is he spoken of as being Almighty, as Jehovah is. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:17:1-1:17:1" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Gen. 17:1</a>) Jesus is said to be “the reflection of [God’s] glory,” but the Father is the Source of that glory.

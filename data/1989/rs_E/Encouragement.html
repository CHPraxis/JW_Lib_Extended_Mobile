<div class="openingContent"><p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sa"><strong>Definition: </strong>Something that gives courage or imparts hope. Everyone needs encouragement. Giving it may require rendering personal help or expressing appreciation. Often it involves assisting someone to see how to cope with a difficult situation or discussing reasons for confidence in a better future. The Bible provides the finest basis for such encouragement, and the texts quoted below can be helpful in giving it to persons faced with various situations. At times much good is done by simply displaying a sympathetic attitude.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:12:15-45:12:15" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Rom. 12:15</a>.</p>

<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:4:13-47:4:13" data-bid="4-1" class="b">2 Cor. 4:13,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:4:16-47:4:16" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 16</a>: “We too exercise faith . . .

But spiritually we are being renewed as we continue to feed on God’s precious promises.)</p>

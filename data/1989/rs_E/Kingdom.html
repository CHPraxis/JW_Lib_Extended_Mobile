<div class="openingContent"><p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sa"><strong>Definition: </strong>The Kingdom of God is the expression of Jehovah’s universal sovereignty toward his creatures, or the means used by him to express that sovereignty. This term is used particularly to designate the manifestation of God’s sovereignty <span id="page226" class="pageNum" data-no="226" data-before-text="226"></span>through the royal government headed by his Son, Jesus Christ. “Kingdom” may refer to the rulership of the one anointed as King or to the earthly realm ruled by that heavenly government.</p>

But the Kingdom as represented by Christ was in their midst. Thus <em>The Emphatic Diaglott </em>reads: “God’s royal majesty is among you.”)</p>

<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="si"><strong><em>What effect will this Kingdom have on human governments?</em></strong></p>

You will break them with an iron scepter, as though a potter’s vessel you will dash them to pieces.”</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sn"><strong>What will God’s Kingdom accomplish?</strong></p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="si"><strong><em>Sanctify Jehovah’s name and uphold his sovereignty</em></strong></p>

Let your kingdom come.’” (Here the sanctifying of God’s name is closely associated with the coming of his Kingdom.)</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="si"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:38:23-26:38:23" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Ezek. 38:23</a>: “I shall certainly magnify myself and sanctify myself and make myself known before the eyes of many nations; and they will have to know that I am Jehovah.” (God’s name will be cleansed of all reproach; it will be treated as holy and deserving of respect, and all who live will be persons who willingly uphold Jehovah’s sovereignty, delighting to do his will. Upon such sanctification of Jehovah’s name the peace and well-being of all the universe depend.)</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="si"><strong><em>Put an end to Satan’s tolerated rulership over the world</em></strong></p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="si"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:20:2-66:20:3" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Rev. 20:2, 3</a>: “He [the heavenly King, Jesus Christ] seized the dragon, the original serpent, who is the Devil and Satan, and bound him for a thousand years. And he hurled him into the abyss and shut it and sealed it over him, that he might <span id="page228" class="pageNum" data-no="228" data-before-text="228"></span>not mislead the nations anymore until the thousand years were ended. After these things he must be let loose for a little while.” (Thus mankind will be freed from the satanic influence that has made life very difficult for people who want to do what is right. Gone will be the diabolic influence that has caused acts of extreme inhumanity and the demonic influence that has filled the lives of many with fear.)</p>

Righteous and true are your ways, King of eternity. Who will not really fear you, Jehovah, and glorify your name, because you alone are loyal? For all the nations will come and worship before you, because your righteous decrees have been made manifest.”</p>

And all the nations will be gathered before him, and he will separate people one from another, just as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats. . . . And these [who showed no love for his anointed brothers] will depart into everlasting cutting-off, but the righteous ones into everlasting life.” (Obviously, not all mankind were to be converted before Christ would take his throne; not all would prove to be righteous ones.)</p>

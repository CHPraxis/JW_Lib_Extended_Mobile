<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sn"><strong>Why do many Bible translations not use the personal name of God or use it only a few times?</strong></p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">The preface of the <em>Revised Standard Version </em>explains: “For two reasons the Committee has returned to the more familiar usage of the King James Version: (1) the word ‘Jehovah’ does not accurately represent any form of the Name ever used in Hebrew; and (2) the use of any proper name for the one and only God, as though there were other gods from whom he had to be distinguished, was discontinued in Judaism before the Christian era and is entirely inappropriate for the universal faith of the Christian Church.” (Thus their own view of what is appropriate has been relied on as the basis for removing from the Holy Bible the personal name of its Divine Author, whose name appears in the original Hebrew more often than any other name or any title. They admittedly follow the example of the adherents <span id="page194" class="pageNum" data-no="194" data-before-text="194"></span>of Judaism, of whom Jesus said: “You have made the word of God invalid because of your tradition.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:15:6-40:15:6" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Matt. 15:6</a>.)</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">Translators who have felt obligated to include the personal name of God at least once or perhaps a few times in the main text, though not doing so every time it appears in Hebrew, have evidently followed the example of William Tyndale, who included the divine name in his translation of the Pentateuch published in 1530, thus breaking with the practice of leaving the name out altogether.</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sn"><strong>Was the name Jehovah used by the inspired writers of the Christian Greek Scriptures?</strong></p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">Jerome, in the fourth century, wrote: “Matthew, who is also Levi, and who from a publican came to be an apostle, first of all composed a Gospel of Christ in Judaea in the Hebrew language and characters for the benefit of those of the circumcision who had believed.” (<em>De viris inlustribus, </em>chap. III) This Gospel includes 11 direct quotations of portions of the Hebrew Scriptures where the Tetragrammaton is found. There is no reason to believe that Matthew did not quote the passages as they were written in the Hebrew text from which he quoted.</p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">Other inspired writers who contributed to the contents of the Christian Greek Scriptures quoted hundreds of passages from the <em>Septuagint, </em>a translation of the Hebrew Scriptures into Greek. Many of these passages included the Hebrew Tetragrammaton right in the Greek text of early copies of the <em>Septuagint. </em>In harmony with Jesus’ own attitude regarding his Father’s name, Jesus’ disciples would have retained that name in those quotations.—Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:6-43:17:6" data-bid="20-1" class="b">John 17:6,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:26-43:17:26" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> 26</a>.</p>
<p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb">In <em>Journal of Biblical Literature, </em>George Howard of the University of Georgia wrote: “We know for a fact that Greek-speaking Jews continued to write יהוה within their Greek Scriptures. Moreover, it is most unlikely that early conservative Greek-speaking Jewish Christians varied from this practice. Although in secondary references to God they probably used the words [God] and [Lord], it would have been extremely unusual for them to have dismissed the Tetragram from the biblical text itself. . . . Since the Tetragram <span id="page195" class="pageNum" data-no="195" data-before-text="195"></span>was still written in the copies of the Greek Bible which made up the Scriptures of the early church, it is reasonable to believe that the N[ew] T[estament] writers, when quoting from Scripture, preserved the Tetragram within the biblical text. . . . But when it was removed from the Greek O[ld] T[estament], it was also removed from the quotations of the O[ld] T[estament] in the N[ew] T[estament]. Thus somewhere around the beginning of the second century the use of surrogates [substitutes] must have crowded out the Tetragram in both Testaments.”—Vol. 96, No. 1, March 1977, pp. 76, 77.</p>
<p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sn"><strong>Which form of the divine name is correct—Jehovah or Yahweh?</strong></p>
<p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sb">No human today can be certain how it was originally pronounced in Hebrew. Why not? Biblical Hebrew was originally written with only consonants, no vowels. When the language was in everyday use, readers easily provided the proper vowels. In time, however, the Jews came to have the superstitious idea that it was wrong to say God’s personal name out loud, so they used substitute expressions. Centuries later, Jewish scholars developed a system of points by which to indicate which vowels to use when reading ancient Hebrew, but they put the vowels for the <em>substitute expressions </em>around the four consonants representing the divine name. Thus the original pronunciation of the divine name was lost.</p>
<p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="sb">Many scholars favor the spelling “Yahweh,” but it is uncertain and there is not agreement among them. On the other hand, “Jehovah” is the form of the name that is most readily recognized, because it has been used in English for centuries and preserves, equally with other forms, the four consonants of the Hebrew Tetragrammaton.</p>
<p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="sb">J. B. Rotherham, in <em>The Emphasised Bible, </em>used the form Yahweh throughout the Hebrew Scriptures. However, later in his <em>Studies in the Psalms </em>he used the form “Jehovah.” He explained: “JEHOVAH—The employment of this English form of the Memorial name . . . in the present version of the Psalter does not arise from any misgiving as to the more <span id="page196" class="pageNum" data-no="196" data-before-text="196"></span>correct pronunciation, as being Yahwéh; but solely from practical evidence personally selected of the desirability of keeping in touch with the public ear and eye in a matter of this kind, in which the principal thing is the easy recognition of the Divine name intended.”—(London, 1911), p. 29.</p>
<p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="sb">After discussing various pronunciations, German professor Gustav Friedrich Oehler concluded: “From this point onward I use the word Jehovah, because, as a matter of fact, this name has now become more naturalized in our vocabulary, and cannot be supplanted.”—<em>Theologie des Alten Testaments, </em>second edition (Stuttgart, 1882), p. 143.</p>
<p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="sb">Jesuit scholar Paul Joüon states: “In our translations, instead of the (hypothetical) form <em>Yahweh, </em>we have used the form <em>Jéhovah </em>. . . which is the conventional literary form used in French.”—<em>Grammaire de l’hébreu biblique </em>(Rome, 1923), footnote on p. 49.</p>
<p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="sb">Most names change to some extent when transferred from one language to another. Jesus was born a Jew, and his name in Hebrew was perhaps pronounced <em>Ye·shuʹa‛, </em>but the inspired writers of the Christian Scriptures did not hesitate to use the Greek form of the name, <em>I·e·sousʹ. </em>In most other languages the pronunciation is slightly different, but we freely use the form that is common in our tongue. The same is true of other Bible names. How, then, can we show proper respect for the One to whom the most important name of all belongs? Would it be by never speaking or writing his name because we do not know exactly how it was originally pronounced? Or, rather, would it be by using the pronunciation and spelling that are common in our language, while speaking well of its Owner and conducting ourselves as his worshipers in a manner that honors him?</p>
<p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="sn"><strong>Why is it important to know and use God’s personal name?</strong></p>
<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="sb">Do you have a close relationship with anyone whose personal name you do not know? For people to whom God is nameless he is often merely an impersonal force, not a real person, not someone that they know and love and to whom they can speak from the heart in prayer. If they do pray, <span id="page197" class="pageNum" data-no="197" data-before-text="197"></span>their prayers are merely a ritual, a formalistic repetition of memorized expressions.</p>
<p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="sb">True Christians have a commission from Jesus Christ to make disciples of people of all nations. When teaching these people, how would it be possible to identify the true God as different from the false gods of the nations?

[<em>Dy </em>reads: “ . . . every tongue should confess that the Lord Jesus Christ is in the glory of God the Father.” <em>Kx </em>and <em>CC </em>read similarly, but a footnote in <em>Kx </em>acknowledges: “ . . . the Greek is perhaps more naturally rendered ‘to the glory,’” and <em>NAB </em>and <em>JB </em>render it that way.]” (Notice that Jesus Christ is here shown to be different from God the Father and subject to Him.)</p>

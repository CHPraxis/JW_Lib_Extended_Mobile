<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="si">Frequently the confessor directs that the penitent say a specified number of “Our Fathers” and “Hail Marys.”</p>

<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb"><em>How did the apostles understand and apply this? </em>There is no record in the Bible of a single instance in which an apostle listened to a private confession and then pronounced absolution. However, the requirements for being forgiven by God are set out in the Bible. The apostles, under the direction of holy spirit, could discern whether individuals were <span id="page82" class="pageNum" data-no="82" data-before-text="82"></span>meeting such requirements and could on this basis declare that <em>God </em>had either forgiven them or not forgiven them. For examples, see <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:5:1-44:5:11" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Acts 5:1-11</a>, also <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:5:1-46:5:5" data-bid="10-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 5:1-5</a> and <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:2:6-47:2:8" data-bid="11-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 2:6-8</a>.</p>

<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sn"><strong>Viewpoints of scholars as to the origin of auricular confession differ</strong></p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb"><em>The Catholic Encyclopedia, </em>by R. C. Broderick, states: “Since the fourth century auricular confession has been the accepted method.”—P. 58.</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">The <em>New Catholic Encyclopedia </em>says: “Many contemporary historians, both Catholic and Protestant, trace the origins of private penance as a normal discipline to the churches of Ireland, Wales, and Britain, where the Sacraments, including Penance, were administered usually by the abbot of a monastery and his priest-monks. With the monastic practice of confession and public and private spiritual direction as the model, repeated confession and confession of devotion seem to have been introduced for the laity. . . . However, it was not until the 11th century that secret sins were absolved at the time of confession and before the fulfillment of penance.”—(1967), Vol. XI, p. 75.</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">Historian A. H. Sayce reports: “The ritual texts show that both public and private confession was practised in Babylonia. Indeed, private confession seems to have been the older and more usual method.”—<em>The Religions of Ancient Egypt and Babylonia </em>(Edinburgh, 1902), p. 497.</p>

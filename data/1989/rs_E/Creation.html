<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“The natural laws of the universe are so precise that we have no difficulty building a spaceship to fly to the moon and can time the flight with the precision of a fraction of a second. These laws must have been set by somebody.”<span id="page85" class="pageNum" data-no="85" data-before-text="85"></span>—Quoted from Wernher von Braun, who had much to do with sending American astronauts to the moon.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><strong><em>Physical universe: </em></strong>If you found a precision timepiece, would you conclude that it was formed by a chance blowing together of some dust particles? Obviously, someone with intelligence made it. There is an even more magnificent “clock.” The planets in our solar system, also the stars in the entire universe, move at a rate that is more precise than most clocks designed and manufactured by man. The galaxy in which our solar system is located includes over 100 billion stars, and astronomers estimate that there are 100 billion of such galaxies in the universe. If a clock is evidence of intelligent design, how much more so is the far more vast and complicated universe! The Bible describes the Designer of it as “the true God, Jehovah, . . . the Creator of the heavens and the Grand One stretching them out.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:42:5-23:42:5" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Isa. 42:5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:40:26-23:40:26" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 40:26;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:19:1-19:19:1" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> Ps. 19:1</a>.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><strong><em>Planet Earth: </em></strong>When crossing a barren desert, if you came to a beautiful house, well equipped in every way and stocked with food, would you believe that it got there by some chance explosion? No; you would realize that someone with considerable wisdom built it. Well, scientists have not yet found life on any of the planets of our solar system except the earth; available evidence indicates that the others are barren. This planet is, as the book <em>The Earth </em>says, “the wonder of the universe, a unique sphere.” (New York, 1963, Arthur Beiser, p. 10) It is at just the right distance from the sun for human life, and it moves at just the right speed to be held in orbit. The atmosphere, of a kind found only around the earth, is made up of just the right proportion of gases to sustain life. Marvelously, light from the sun, carbon dioxide from the air, and water and minerals from fertile soil combine to produce food for earth’s inhabitants. Did it all come about as a result of some uncontrolled explosion in space? <em>Science News </em>admits: “It seems as if such particular and precise conditions could hardly have arisen at random.” (August 24 and 31, 1974, p. 124) The Bible’s conclusion is reasonable when it states: “Of course, <span id="page86" class="pageNum" data-no="86" data-before-text="86"></span>every house is constructed by someone, but he that constructed all things is God.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:3:4-58:3:4" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Heb. 3:4</a>.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><strong><em>Human brain: </em></strong>Modern computers are a product of intensive research and careful engineering. They did not “just happen.” What about the human brain? Unlike the brain of any animal, the brain of a human infant triples in size during its first year. How it functions is still largely a mystery to scientists. In humans, there is the built-in capacity to learn complex languages, to appreciate beauty, to compose music, to contemplate the origin and meaning of life. Said brain surgeon Robert White: “I am left with no choice but to acknowledge the existence of a Superior Intellect, responsible for the design and development of the incredible brain-mind relationship—something far beyond man’s capacity to understand.” (<em>The Reader’s Digest, </em>September 1978, p. 99) The development of this marvel begins from a tiny fertilized cell in the womb. With remarkable insight, the Bible writer David said to Jehovah: “I shall laud you because in a fear-inspiring way I am wonderfully made. Your works are wonderful, as my soul is very well aware.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:139:14-19:139:14" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ps. 139:14</a>.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><strong><em>Living cell: </em></strong>A single living cell is sometimes referred to as being a “simple” form of life. But a one-celled animal can catch food, digest it, get rid of wastes, build a house for itself and engage in sexual activity. Each cell of the human body has been likened to a walled city, with a central government to maintain order, a power plant to generate energy, factories to produce proteins, a complex transportation system, and guards to regulate what is permitted to enter. And a single human body is made up of as many as 100 trillion cells. How appropriate the words of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:104:24-19:104:24" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Psalm 104:24</a>: “How many your works are, O Jehovah! All of them in wisdom you have made”!</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sn"><strong>Does the Bible allow for the idea that God used evolution to produce the various kinds of living things?</strong></p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:11-1:1:12" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Genesis 1:11, 12</a> says that grass and trees were made to produce each “according to its kind.” <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:21-1:1:21" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Verses 21,</a> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:24-1:1:25" data-bid="7-1" class="b">24, 25</a> add <span id="page87" class="pageNum" data-no="87" data-before-text="87"></span>that God created sea creatures, flying creatures and land animals, each “according to its kind.” There is no allowance here for one basic kind to evolve or change into another.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Regarding man, <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:26-1:1:26" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Genesis 1:26</a> reports that God said: “Let us make man in our image, according to our likeness.” So he was to have godlike qualities, not traits that were simply a development of those of a beast. <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:2:7-1:2:7" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Genesis 2:7</a> adds: “Jehovah God proceeded to form the man [not out of some preexisting life form but] out of dust from the ground and to blow into his nostrils the breath of life.” There is no hint of evolution here, but, rather, description of a new creation.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sn"><strong>Did God create all the millions of varieties of organisms that exist on earth today?</strong></p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:1-1:1:31" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Genesis chapter 1</a> says simply that God created each “according to its kind.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:12-1:1:12" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Gen. 1:12,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:21-1:1:21" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 21,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:24-1:1:25" data-bid="11-3" class="b"> 24, 25</a>) In preparation for the global Flood in Noah’s day, God directed that representative members of each “kind” of land animal and flying creature be taken into the ark. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:7:2-1:7:3" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Gen. 7:2, 3,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:7:14-1:7:14" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> 14</a>) Each “kind” has the genetic potential for great variety. Thus there are reportedly more than 400 different breeds of dogs and upwards of 250 breeds and types of horses. All interfertile varieties of any animal are just one Genesis “kind.” Similarly, all varieties of humans—Oriental, African, Caucasian, those as tall as the seven-foot Dinka in the Sudan and as short as the four-foot-four-inch Pygmies—stem from the one original pair, Adam and Eve.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:27-1:1:28" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Gen. 1:27, 28;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:3:20-1:3:20" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 3:20</a>.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sn"><strong>What accounts for the basic similarities in the structure of living things?</strong></p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">“God . . . created all things.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:3:9-49:3:9" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Eph. 3:9</a>) Thus everything has the same Great Designer.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">“All things came into existence through him [God’s only-begotten Son, who became Jesus Christ when on earth], and apart from him not even one thing came into existence.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:1:3-43:1:3" data-bid="15-1" class="b">John 1:3</a>) Thus there was one Master Worker through whom Jehovah performed his works of creation.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:8:22-20:8:22" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Prov. 8:22,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:8:30-20:8:31" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> 30, 31</a>.</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sn"><span id="page88" class="pageNum" data-no="88" data-before-text="88"></span><strong>What is the origin of the raw material of which the universe is made?</strong></p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">Scientists have learned that matter is a concentrated form of energy. This is demonstrated with the explosion of nuclear weapons. Astrophysicist Josip Kleczek states: “Most and possibly all elementary particles may be created by materialization of energy.”—<em>The Universe </em>(Boston, 1976), Vol. 11, p. 17.</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">From where could such energy come? After asking, “Who has created these things [the stars and planets]?”, the Bible states regarding Jehovah God, “Due to the abundance of dynamic energy, he also being vigorous in power, not one of them is missing.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:40:26-23:40:26" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Isa. 40:26</a>) So God himself is the Source of all the “dynamic energy” that was needed to create the universe.</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sn"><strong>Was all physical creation accomplished in just six days sometime within the past 6,000 to 10,000 years?</strong></p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">The facts disagree with such a conclusion: (1) Light from the Andromeda nebula can be seen on a clear night in the northern hemisphere. It takes about 2,000,000 years for that light to reach the earth, indicating that the universe must be at least millions of years old. (2) End products of radioactive decay in rocks in the earth testify that some rock formations have been undisturbed for billions of years.</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:3-1:1:31" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Genesis 1:3-31</a> is not discussing the original creation of matter or of the heavenly bodies. It describes the preparation of the already existing earth for human habitation. This included creation of the basic kinds of vegetation, marine life, flying creatures, land animals, and the first human pair. All of this is said to have been done within a period of six “days.” However, the Hebrew word translated “day” has a variety of meanings, including ‘a long time; the time covering an extraordinary event.’ (<em>Old Testament Word Studies, </em>Grand Rapids, Mich.; 1978, W. Wilson, p. 109) The term used allows for the thought that each “day” could have been thousands of years in length.</p>

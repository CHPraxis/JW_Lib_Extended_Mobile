</header>
<div class="openingContent"><p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sa"><strong>Definition: </strong>The word “hell” is found in many Bible translations. In the same verses other translations read “the grave,” “the world of the dead,” and so forth. Other Bibles simply transliterate the original-language words that are sometimes rendered “hell”; that is, they express them with the letters of our alphabet <span id="page169" class="pageNum" data-no="169" data-before-text="169"></span>but leave the words untranslated. What are those words? The Hebrew <em>she’ohlʹ </em>and its Greek equivalent <em>haiʹdes, </em>which refer, not to an individual burial place, but to the common grave of dead mankind; also the Greek <em>geʹen·na, </em>which is used as a symbol of eternal destruction. However, both in Christendom and in many non-Christian religions it is taught that hell is a place inhabited by demons and where the wicked, after death, are punished (and some believe that this is with torment).</p>

<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="si"><strong><em>Why is there confusion as to what the Bible says about hell?</em></strong></p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="si">“Much confusion and misunderstanding has been caused <span id="page171" class="pageNum" data-no="171" data-before-text="171"></span>through the early translators of the Bible persistently rendering the Hebrew Sheol and the Greek Hades and Gehenna by the word hell. The simple transliteration of these words by the translators of the revised editions of the Bible has not sufficed to appreciably clear up this confusion and misconception.”—<em>The Encyclopedia Americana </em>(1942), Vol. XIV, p. 81.</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="si">Translators have allowed their personal beliefs to color their work instead of being consistent in their rendering of the original-language words. For example: (1) The <em>King James Version </em>rendered <em>she’ohlʹ </em>as “hell,” “the grave,” and “the pit”; <em>haiʹdes </em>is therein rendered both “hell” and “grave”; <em>geʹen·na </em>is also translated “hell.” (2) <em>Today’s English Version </em>transliterates <em>haiʹdes </em>as “Hades” and also renders it as “hell” and “the world of the dead.” But besides rendering “hell” from <em>haiʹdes </em>it uses that same translation for <em>geʹen·na. </em>(3) <em>The Jerusalem Bible </em>transliterates <em>haiʹdes </em>six times, but in other passages it translates it as “hell” and as “the underworld.” It also translates <em>geʹen·na </em>as “hell,” as it does <em>haiʹdes </em>in two instances. Thus the exact meanings of the original-language words have been obscured.</p>

The primary signification has been adopted, because it agrees better with the second member of the sentence, thus preserving the force and beauty of the antithesis. The righteous go to <em>life, </em>the wicked to the <em>cutting off </em>from life, or <em>death. </em>See <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/53:1:9-53:1:9" data-bid="10-1" class="b">2 Thess. 1.9</a>.”)</p>

But the effect of that fire has been lasting; the cities have not been rebuilt. God’s judgment, however, was against not merely those cities but also their wicked inhabitants.

At <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:17:29-42:17:29" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Luke 17:29</a>, Jesus says that they were “destroyed”; <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/65:1:7-65:1:7" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Jude 7</a> shows that the destruction was eternal.)</p>

<p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="si"><em>What is the ‘torment’ to which these texts refer? </em>It is noteworthy that at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:11:10-66:11:10" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Revelation 11:10</a> (<em>KJ</em>) reference is made to ‘prophets that torment those dwelling on the earth.’ Such torment results from humiliating exposure by the messages that these prophets proclaim. At <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:14:9-66:14:11" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Revelation 14:9-11</a> (<em>KJ</em>) worshipers of the symbolic “beast and his image” are said to be “tormented with fire and brimstone.” This cannot refer to conscious torment after death because “the dead know not any thing.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:9:5-21:9:5" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Eccl. 9:5</a>, <em>KJ</em>) Then, what causes them to experience such torment while they are still alive? It is the proclamation by God’s servants that worshipers of the <span id="page173" class="pageNum" data-no="173" data-before-text="173"></span>“beast and his image” will experience second death, which is represented by “the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone.” The smoke, associated with their fiery destruction, ascends forever because the destruction will be eternal and will never be forgotten. When <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:20:10-66:20:10" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Revelation 20:10</a> says that the Devil is to experience ‘torment forever and ever’ in “the lake of fire and brimstone,” what does that mean? <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:8-66:21:8" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Revelation 21:8</a> (<em>KJ</em>) says clearly that “the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone” means “the second death.” So the Devil’s being “tormented” there forever means that there will be no relief for him; he will be held under restraint forever, actually in eternal death. This use of the word “torment” (from the Greek <em>baʹsa·nos</em>) reminds one of its use at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:18:34-40:18:34" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Matthew 18:34</a>, where the same basic Greek word is applied to a ‘jailer.’—<em>RS, AT, ED, NW.</em></p>
<p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="si"><strong><em>What is the ‘fiery Gehenna’ to which Jesus referred?</em></strong></p>
<p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="si">Reference to Gehenna appears 12 times in the Christian Greek Scriptures. Five times it is directly associated with fire. Translators have rendered the Greek expression <em>geʹen·nan tou py·rosʹ </em>as “hell fire” (<em>KJ, Dy</em>), “fires of hell” (<em>NE</em>), “fiery pit” (<em>AT</em>), and “fires of Gehenna” (<em>NAB</em>).</p>
<p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="si"><em>Historical background: </em>The Valley of Hinnom (Gehenna) was outside the walls of Jerusalem. For a time it was the site of idolatrous worship, including child sacrifice. In the first century Gehenna was being used as the incinerator for the filth of Jerusalem. Bodies of dead animals were thrown into the valley to be consumed in the fires, to which sulfur, or brimstone, was added to assist the burning. Also bodies of executed criminals, who were considered undeserving of burial in a memorial tomb, were thrown into Gehenna. Thus, at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:5:29-40:5:30" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Matthew 5:29, 30</a>, Jesus spoke of the casting of one’s “whole body” into Gehenna. If the body fell into the constantly burning fire it was consumed, but if it landed on a ledge of the deep ravine its putrefying flesh became infested with the ever-present worms, or maggots. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:9:47-41:9:48" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Mark 9:47, 48</a>) Living humans were not pitched into Gehenna; so it was not a place of conscious torment.</p>
<p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="si">At <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:10:28-40:10:28" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Matthew 10:28</a>, Jesus warned his hearers to “be in fear <span id="page174" class="pageNum" data-no="174" data-before-text="174"></span>of him that can destroy both soul and body in Gehenna.” What does it mean? Notice that there is no mention here of <em>torment </em>in the fires of Gehenna; rather, he says to ‘fear him that can <em>destroy </em>in Gehenna.’ By referring to the “soul” separately, Jesus here emphasizes that God can destroy all of a person’s life prospects; thus there is no hope of resurrection for him. So, the references to the ‘fiery Gehenna’ have the same meaning as ‘the lake of fire’ of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:8-66:21:8" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Revelation 21:8</a>, namely, destruction, “second death.”</p>

<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="sn"><strong>By what Jesus said about the rich man and Lazarus</strong>, <strong>did Jesus teach torment of the wicked after death?</strong></p>

Does that sound reasonable to you? If it were literal, it would conflict with other parts of the Bible. If the Bible were thus contradictory, would a lover of truth use it as a basis for his faith? But the Bible does not contradict itself.</p>
<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="sb"><em>What does the parable mean? </em>The “rich man” represented the Pharisees. (See <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:16:14-42:16:14" data-bid="31-1" class="b">verse 14</a>.) The beggar Lazarus represented the common Jewish people who were despised by the Pharisees but who repented and became followers of Jesus. (See <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:18:11-42:18:11" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Luke 18:11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:7:49-43:7:49" data-bid="32-2" class="b"> John 7:49;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:21:31-40:21:32" data-bid="32-3" class="b"> Matthew 21:31, 32</a>.) Their deaths were also symbolic, representing a change in circumstances. Thus, the formerly despised ones came into a position of divine favor, and the formerly seemingly favored ones were rejected by God, while being tormented by the judgment messages delivered by the ones whom they had despised.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:5:33-44:5:33" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Acts 5:33;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:7:54-44:7:54" data-bid="33-2" class="b"> 7:54</a>.</p>
<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="sn"><strong>What is the origin of the teaching of hellfire?</strong></p>
<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="sb">In ancient Babylonian and Assyrian beliefs the “nether world . . . is pictured as a place full of horrors, and is presided over by gods and demons of great strength and fierceness.” (<em>The Religion of Babylonia and Assyria, </em>Boston, 1898, Morris Jastrow, Jr., p. 581) Early evidence of the fiery aspect of Christendom’s hell is found in the religion of ancient Egypt. (<em>The Book of the Dead, </em>New Hyde Park, N.Y., 1960, with introduction by E. A. Wallis Budge, pp. 144, 149, 151, 153, 161) Buddhism, which dates back to the 6th century B.C.E., in time came to feature both hot and cold hells. (<em>The Encyclopedia Americana, </em>1977, Vol. 14, p. 68) Depictions of hell portrayed in Catholic churches in Italy have been traced to Etruscan roots.—<em>La civiltà etrusca </em>(Milan, 1979), Werner Keller, p. 389.</p>
<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="sb">But the real roots of this God-dishonoring doctrine go much deeper. The fiendish concepts associated with a hell of torment slander God and originate with the chief slanderer of God (the Devil, which name means “Slanderer”), the one whom Jesus Christ called “the father of the lie.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:8:44-43:8:44" data-bid="34-1" class="b">John 8:44</a>.</p>

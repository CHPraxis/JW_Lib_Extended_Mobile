<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">On the contrary, Jehovah warned Adam against disobedience, which would lead to death. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:2:17-1:2:17" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Gen. 2:17</a>) Later, God warned Israel against conduct that would lead even to premature death for them. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:18:31-26:18:31" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ezek. 18:31</a>) In time he sent his Son to die on behalf of mankind so that those who would put faith in this provision might enjoy everlasting life.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:3:16-43:3:16" data-bid="3-1" class="b">John 3:16,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:3:36-43:3:36" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 36</a>.</p>

That was true when Moses wrote it, but that was not so from the beginning. (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:5:3-1:5:32" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Genesis 5:3-32</a>.) <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:9:27-58:9:27" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Hebrews 9:27</a> says, “It is reserved for men to die once for all time.” This, too, was true when it was written. But it was not the case before God passed judgment on sinful Adam.</p>

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Jehovah created the first human couple perfect, with the prospect of living forever. They were endowed with free will. Would they obey their Creator out of love and appreciation for all that he had done for them? They were fully capable of doing so. God told Adam: “As for the tree of the knowledge of good and bad you must not eat from it, for in the day you <span id="page99" class="pageNum" data-no="99" data-before-text="99"></span>eat from it you will positively die.” Using a serpent as a mouthpiece, Satan enticed Eve to violate Jehovah’s command. Adam did not reprove his wife but joined her in eating that forbidden fruit. True to his word, Jehovah passed sentence of death upon Adam, but before executing the sinful pair, Jehovah mercifully permitted them to bring forth children.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:2:17-1:2:17" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Gen. 2:17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:3:1-1:3:19" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 3:1-19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:5:3-1:5:5" data-bid="7-3" class="b"> 5:3-5</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:32:4-5:32:4" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 32:4 and</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:12:9-66:12:9" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> Revelation 12:9</a>.</p>

<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">God does not “take” children from their parents, as some have been told. Although the earth produces ample food, selfish political and commercial elements often hinder its distribution to those most in need, resulting in death due to malnutrition.

<p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="sn"><strong>What about reports made by persons who were revived after being reported to be dead and who spoke of another life?</strong></p>
<p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="sb">Normally, after a person stops breathing and the heartbeat ceases, it is several minutes before gradual cessation of <span id="page101" class="pageNum" data-no="101" data-before-text="101"></span>the life-force in the body cells begins. If the body is subjected to severe cold, that process can be delayed for hours. For this reason, it is sometimes possible to revive persons by means of cardiopulmonary resuscitation. They were what is termed “clinically dead,” but their body cells were still alive.</p>
<p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="sb">Many persons revived from “clinical death” remember nothing. Others report experiencing a floating sensation. Some say they saw beautiful things; others were terrified by their experience.</p>
<p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="si"><strong><em>Is there a medical explanation for any of these experiences?</em></strong></p>
<p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="si">The medical editor of <em>The Arizona Republic </em>wrote: “When physical prowess is at its lowest ebb, as under anesthesia, or the result of disease or injury, automatic control of bodily functions diminishes accordingly. Thus, the neurohormones and catecholamines of the nervous system are released and pour out in uncontrolled quantity. The result, among other manifestations, is the hallucination, rationalized after returning to consciousness, of having died and returned to life.”—May 28, 1977, p. C-1; also the German medical journal <em>Fortschritte der Medizin, </em>No. 41, 1979; <em>Psychology Today, </em>January 1981.</p>
<p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="si"><strong><em>But is not the testimony of those who were revived confirmed by persons to whom deceased loved ones have appeared and spoken?</em></strong></p>
<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="si">Read again, please, the scriptures quoted earlier regarding the condition of the dead. What is God’s Word of truth telling us about the condition of the dead?</p>
<p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="si"><em>Who wants humans to believe otherwise? </em>After Jehovah warned our first parents that disobedience would bring death, who contradicted that? “The serpent [used by Satan; see <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:12:9-66:12:9" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Revelation 12:9</a>] said to the woman: ‘You positively will not die.’” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:3:4-1:3:4" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Gen. 3:4</a>) Later, of course, Adam and Eve did die. Reasonably, then, who invented the idea that a spirit part of man survives the death of the body? As we have already seen, this is not what God’s Word says. God’s law to ancient Israel condemned as “unclean” and “detestable” the practice of consulting the dead. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:19:31-3:19:31" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Lev. 19:31;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:18:10-5:18:12" data-bid="30-2" class="b"> Deut. 18:10-12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:8:19-23:8:19" data-bid="30-3" class="b"> Isa. 8:19</a>) <span id="page102" class="pageNum" data-no="102" data-before-text="102"></span>Would a God of love condemn this practice if the living were simply communicating with loved ones who had departed? On the other hand, if demonic spirits were impersonating the dead and misleading mankind by conveying to their minds impressions that would perpetuate a lie, would it not be loving on God’s part to safeguard his servants against such deception?—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:6:11-49:6:12" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Eph. 6:11, 12</a>.</p>
<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="sn"><strong>Why do Jehovah’s Witnesses not share in the traditional customs of mourning for the dead?</strong></p>
<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="si"><strong><em>Grief over the death of a loved one is normal and may properly be expressed</em></strong></p>

<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="si">But because of the resurrection hope, Christians are told: “We do not want you to be ignorant concerning those who are sleeping in death; that you may not sorrow just as the rest also do who have no hope.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/52:4:13-52:4:13" data-bid="34-1" class="b">1 Thess. 4:13</a>.</p>

But you, when <span id="page103" class="pageNum" data-no="103" data-before-text="103"></span>fasting, grease your head and wash your face, that you may appear to be fasting, not to men, but to your Father who is in secrecy; then your Father who is looking on in secrecy will repay you.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:16-40:6:18" data-bid="37-1" class="b">Matt. 6:16-18</a>.</p>
<p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="si"><em>Certain customs reflect belief that man has an immortal soul that survives death of the body and, so, is aware of what the survivors are doing. </em>But the Bible says: “The dead . . . are conscious of nothing at all.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:9:5-21:9:5" data-bid="38-1" class="b">Eccl. 9:5</a>) Also, “The soul that is sinning—it itself will die.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:18:4-26:18:4" data-bid="39-1" class="b">Ezek. 18:4</a>.</p>

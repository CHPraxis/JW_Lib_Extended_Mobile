</header>
<div class="openingContent"><p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sa"><strong>Comments: </strong>The life prospects of people depend on their attitude toward Jehovah God and his Kingdom by Christ Jesus. The message of God’s Kingdom is thrilling, and it points to the only dependable hope for humankind. It is a message that transforms lives. We want everyone to hear it. We realize that only a minority will receive it appreciatively, but we know that people at least need to hear it if they are to make an informed choice. Yet not everyone is willing to listen, and we do not try to force them. But with discernment it is often possible to turn potential conversation stoppers into opportunities for further discussion. Here are examples of what some experienced Witnesses have used in their efforts to search out deserving ones. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:10:11-40:10:11" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matt. 10:11</a>) Our recommendation is not that you memorize any of these replies but that you get the idea in mind, put it in your own words and express it in a manner that conveys your genuine interest in the person to whom you are speaking. As you do so, you can have confidence that those whose hearts are <span id="page16" class="pageNum" data-no="16" data-before-text="16"></span>rightly disposed will listen and respond appreciatively to what Jehovah is doing to draw them to his loving provisions for life.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:6:44-43:6:44" data-bid="2-1" class="b">John 6:44;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:16:14-44:16:14" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Acts 16:14</a>.</p>

<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn">● ‘May I ask, Do you mean that you are not interested in <em>the Bible, </em>or is it religion in general that does not interest you? I ask that because we have met many who at one time were religious but no longer go to church because they see much hypocrisy in the churches (or, they feel that religion is just another money-making business; or, they do not approve of religion’s involvement in politics; etc.). The Bible does not approve of such practices either and it provides the only basis on which we can look to the future with confidence.’</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn">● ‘If you mean that you are not interested in another religion, I can understand that. But more than likely you are interested in what kind of future we can expect in view of the threat of nuclear war (or, how we can safeguard our children against drug abuse; or, what can be done about crime so that we won’t have to be afraid to walk the streets; etc.). Can you see any prospect for a real solution?’</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn">● ‘Is that because you already have a religion? . . . Tell me, Do you think we will ever see a time when everyone belongs to the same religion? . . . What seems to stand in the way? . . . For it to be meaningful, what sort of foundation would be needed?’</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sn">● ‘I can appreciate that. A few years ago I felt the same way. But I read something in the Bible that helped me to view matters in a different light. (Show the person what it was.)’</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sn">● ‘Would you be interested if I could show you from the Bible how you could see your dead loved ones again (or, what the real purpose of life is; or, how it can help us to keep our families united; etc.)?’</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sn">● ‘If you mean that you are not interested in buying something, let me put your mind at ease. I’m not engaged in a commercial work.

<h2 id="p55" data-pid="55"><strong>WHEN SOMEONE SAYS, ‘I’M A BUDDHIST’</strong></h2>
<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p56" data-pid="56" class="sn">● Do not conclude that the person’s beliefs are the same as those of all other Buddhists. Buddhist teachings are vague and the interpretation varies from one person to another. Japanese Buddhism is quite different from the Buddhism of Southeast Asia. Individuals, too, differ as to their viewpoint. In general, however, the following points may be helpful: (1) Buddhism does not recognize an external God, a personal Creator. But many Buddhists worship images and relics of Buddha. (2) Siddhartha Gautama, who was given the title Buddha, came to be viewed as the religious ideal of his followers, to be imitated by them. He encouraged gaining enlightenment by studying mankind from a human standpoint, also severing the roots of suffering by controlling the mind so as to eliminate all earthly desire. He taught that in this way one might attain to Nirvana, free from the rebirths of transmigration. (3) Buddhists worship their ancestors, because they view these as the source of their life.</p>
<p id="p57" data-pid="57" class="sb">Suggestions for conversation: (1) When speaking with Buddhists, emphasize that you are no part of Christendom. (2) Buddhists have respect for “holy books,” and generally they respect the Bible for that reason. Instead of dwelling on Buddhist philosophy, present the positive message of the Bible. Let them know that the Bible is not mere human philosophy but the authoritative Word of mankind’s Creator, Jehovah God. Ask politely if you may show them an interesting point in this holy book, the Bible. (3) Many Buddhists are keenly interested in peace and family life and want to live moral lives. Discussion on any of these matters is often welcomed. (4) Show that the Bible points to a righteous heavenly government over the earth as the real solution to the problems facing mankind. It explains the future of the earth and the wonderful prospect of living forever in an earthly paradise. (5) You might point out that the Bible explains the origin of life, the meaning of life, the condition of the dead and the resurrection hope, the reason for the existence of wickedness. A kindly presentation of the clear truths of God’s Word will find appreciative response in the hearts of sheeplike ones.</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p60" data-pid="60" class="sn">● You ought to be aware that Hindu philosophy is very complex and does not conform to normal logic. You may find it helpful to have the following points in mind: (1) Hinduism teaches that the god Brahman includes three forms—Brahma the Creator, Vishnu the Preserver, and Siva the Destroyer. But Hindus do not think of a personal god with an individual existence. (2) Hindus believe that all natural objects possess a soul that never dies, that the soul experiences a virtually endless cycle of reincarnation, that the forms in which it is reborn are determined by deeds (Karma), that release from this “endless wheel” is possible only by extinguishing all physical desire, and that if this is achieved, the soul will merge with the universal spirit. (3) In general, Hindus respect other religions. Hindus believe that, in spite of the fact that they teach conflicting doctrines, all religions lead to the same truth.</p>
<p id="p61" data-pid="61" class="sb">Instead of trying to deal with the complexities of Hindu philosophy, present the satisfying truths found in the Holy Bible. Jehovah’s loving provisions for life are open to people of all kinds, and the clear truths in his Word will reach the hearts of those who hunger and thirst for righteousness. Only the Bible provides a truly well-founded hope for the future; only the Bible gives really satisfying answers to the important questions that face all mankind. Give them opportunity to hear those answers. It is of interest that the Hindu <em>Rig-Veda </em>hymn, 10. 121, is entitled “To the Unknown God.” In some cases you may find it appropriate to refer to this in a manner similar to the apostle Paul’s reference to the altar “To an Unknown God” in Athens. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:17:22-44:17:23" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Acts 17:22, 23</a>) Interestingly, the name of the Hindu god Vishnu, without the digamma, is Ish-nuh, which in Chaldee means “the man Noah.” Point out what the Bible says about the significance of the global Flood in the days of Noah. Those who are distressed by the prospect of endless reincarnations may be helped by the material on <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1101989260/19-26">pages 320, 321, under the main heading “Reincarnation.”</a></p>
<p id="p62" data-pid="62" class="sb">The booklets <em>The Path of Divine Truth Leading to Liberation </em>and <em>From Kurukshetra to Armageddon—And Your Survival </em>contain information that will be very beneficial to sincere Hindus.</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p64" data-pid="64" class="sn">● First, ascertain how the person views himself as a Jew. Few are religious. For many, being Jewish is simply an ethnic designation.</p>
<p id="p65" data-pid="65" class="sb">Here are a few points that are beneficial to have in mind: (1) Religious Jews view the pronouncing of God’s name as forbidden. (2) Many Jews think of “the Bible” as a Christian book, but if you refer to “the Hebrew Scriptures,” “the Scriptures,” or “the Torah,” that <span id="page23" class="pageNum" data-no="23" data-before-text="23"></span>problem does not arise. (3) Tradition is a central part of their faith and is viewed by many religious Jews as equal in authority with the Scriptures. (4) They may associate Jesus Christ with the brutal persecution experienced by the Jews at the hands of Christendom in the name of Jesus. (5) They frequently believe that God requires the Jews to keep the Sabbath, which belief includes refraining from handling money on that day.</p>
<p id="p66" data-pid="66" class="sb">To establish a common ground, you might say: (1) ‘You would no doubt agree that, regardless of our background, we all face many of the same difficulties in today’s world. Do you believe that there will really be a lasting solution to the great problems that face this generation? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:37:10-19:37:11" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Ps. 37:10, 11,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:37:29-19:37:29" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> 29;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:146:3-19:146:5" data-bid="20-3" class="b"> Ps. 146:3-5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:2:44-27:2:44" data-bid="20-4" class="b"> Dan. 2:44</a>)’ (2) ‘We are no part of Christendom and do not believe in a Trinity but worship the God of Abraham. We are especially interested in the matter of religious truth. Do you mind if I ask how you determine what is true, especially in view of the fact that there are great differences of beliefs among Jewish people? . . . (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:4:2-5:4:2" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Deut. 4:2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:29:13-23:29:14" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> Isa. 29:13, 14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:119:160-19:119:160" data-bid="21-3" class="b"> Ps. 119:160</a>)’ (3) ‘We are keenly interested in God’s promise to Abraham that through his seed people of all nations will be blessed. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:22:18-1:22:18" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Gen. 22:18</a>)’</p>
<p id="p67" data-pid="67" class="sb">If the person expresses lack of faith in God, ask whether he has always felt that way. Then perhaps discuss why God has permitted wickedness and suffering. Memories of the Nazi holocaust have caused many Jews to be concerned about this.</p>
<p id="p68" data-pid="68" class="sb">If you discuss the importance of using God’s name, find out first how the other person feels about it. Point out that <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:20:7-2:20:7" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Exodus 20:7</a> forbids taking up God’s name in a worthless way, but <em>it does not forbid using it with respect. </em>Then reason on texts such as <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:3:15-2:3:15" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Exodus 3:15</a> (or <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:135:13-19:135:13" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Psalm 135:13</a>); <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:8:41-11:8:43" data-bid="26-1" class="b">1 Kings 8:41-43;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:12:4-23:12:4" data-bid="26-2" class="b"> Isaiah 12:4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:10:25-24:10:25" data-bid="26-3" class="b"> Jeremiah 10:25;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/39:3:16-39:3:16" data-bid="26-4" class="b"> Malachi 3:16</a>.</p>
<p id="p69" data-pid="69" class="sb">When you discuss the Messiah: (1) Talk first about the future blessings under his rule, instead of his identity. (2) Then reason on texts that point to a <em>personal </em>Messiah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:22:17-1:22:18" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Gen. 22:17, 18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/38:9:9-38:9:10" data-bid="27-2" class="b"> Zech. 9:9, 10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:7:13-27:7:14" data-bid="27-3" class="b"> Dan. 7:13, 14</a>) (3) You may need to discuss the <em>two </em>comings of the Messiah. (Contrast <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:7:13-27:7:14" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Daniel 7:13, 14</a> with <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:9:24-27:9:26" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Daniel 9:24-26</a>.) (4) When referring to Jesus, do so in a context that emphasizes the progressive nature of God’s purpose. Mention that when Jesus taught, the time was near when God allowed the second temple to be destroyed, never to be rebuilt. But Jesus emphasized the <em>fulfillment </em>of the Law and of the Prophets and the glorious future to which these would direct persons with faith.</p>

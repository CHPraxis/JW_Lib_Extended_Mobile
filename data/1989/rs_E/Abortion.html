<div class="openingContent"><p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sa"><strong>Definition: </strong>Abortion is the expulsion of an embryo or a fetus that is not normally able to live outside the womb. Spontaneous abortion or miscarriage may result from human imperfection or from an accident. Deliberately induced abortion simply to avoid the birth of an unwanted child is the willful taking of human life.</p>

But if a fatal accident should occur, then you must give soul for soul.” (Some translations make it appear that in this law to Israel the crucial matter was what happened to the mother, not to the fetus. The original Hebrew text, however, refers to a fatal accident to either mother or child.)</p>

<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="si">Medical opinions are sometimes wrong. Would it be right to kill a fellow human because that one <em>might </em>harm his fellowman? If <em>at the time of childbirth </em>a choice must be made between the life of the mother and that of the child, it is up to the individuals concerned to make that choice. However, advances in medical procedures in many lands have made this situation very rare.</p>

To receive the benefits, though, we must also accept the responsibilities.’ <strong>Then perhaps add: </strong>(1) ‘Many mothers have been abandoned by the men who fathered their children. But in a home where both husband and wife live by Bible standards, the husband will really love his wife and children and loyally stay with them and provide for them.

And you will certainly come from your place, from the remotest parts of the north, you and many peoples with you . . . ” “And it must occur in that day, in the day when Gog comes in upon the soil of Israel,” is the utterance of the Sovereign Lord Jehovah, “that my rage will come up into my nose. And in my ardor, in the fire of my fury, I shall have to speak.”’”</p>

<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sn"><strong>Why should Christians be keenly interested in the Bible’s predictions?</strong></p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:42-40:24:42" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Matt. 24:42</a>: “Keep on the watch, therefore, because you do not know on what day your Lord is coming.”</p>

<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:4:18-20:4:18" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Prov. 4:18</a>: “The path of the righteous ones is like the bright light that is getting lighter and lighter until the day is firmly established.”</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sn"><strong>‘You put too much emphasis on prophecy. All that is needed is to accept Christ as your Savior and to lead a good Christian life’</strong></p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb"><strong>You might reply: </strong>‘Appreciation of the role of Jesus Christ is certainly vital. But did you know that one reason why the Jews in the first century failed to accept him was that they did not pay sufficient attention to prophecy?’ <strong>Then perhaps add: </strong>(1) ‘The prophecies in the Hebrew Scriptures had foretold when the Messiah (Christ) would appear and what he would do. But the Jews in general did not pay heed to what those prophecies said. They had their own ideas as to what the Messiah should do, and as a result they rejected the Son of God. (See <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1101989240/12-14">page 211, under “Jesus Christ.”</a>)’ (2) ‘We today live at the time when Christ has begun to rule as heavenly King and is separating people of all nations, with a view to life or destruction. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:25:31-40:25:33" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Matt. 25:31-33,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:25:46-40:25:46" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> 46</a>) But most people are looking for something else.’</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb"><strong>Or you could say: </strong>‘I agree that being a good Christian is important. But would I be a good Christian if I did <em>some </em>of the things that Jesus taught but ignored what he said we should put first in life? . . . Notice what he said as recorded here at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:33-40:6:33" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Matthew 6:33</a>.’ <strong>Then perhaps add: </strong>‘Isn’t it true that Jesus taught us to pray for that Kingdom, even putting it ahead of our asking for forgiveness because of our faith in him as Savior? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:9-40:6:12" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Matt. 6:9-12</a>)’</p>

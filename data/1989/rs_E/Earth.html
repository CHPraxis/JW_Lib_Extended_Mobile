<div class="openingContent"><p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sa"><strong>Definition: </strong>The term “earth” is used in more than one sense in the Scriptures. Usually we think of it as referring to the planet itself, which Jehovah generously endowed so that it could sustain human life with a view to making our lives richly satisfying. It should be realized, however, that “earth” also may be used in a figurative sense, referring, for example, to people living on this planet or to a human society that has certain characteristics.</p>

But billions of stars employ nuclear power on a scale that is beyond our ability to comprehend. Who created and controls all these heavenly bodies? Can He not prevent the nations from using their nuclear weapons in a way that would hinder his purpose? That God would do this is illustrated by his destroying the military power of Egypt when Pharaoh sought to stop the deliverance of Israel.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:14:5-2:14:31" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ex. 14:5-31</a>.)</p>

The day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up [“burned (burnt) up,” <em>RS, JB; </em>“will vanish,” <em>TEV; </em>“will be made manifest,” <em>NAB; </em>“will be laid bare,” <em>NE; </em>“will be discovered,” <em>NW</em>].” (Note: The Codex Sinaiticus and Vatican MS 1209, both of the 4th century C.E., read “be discovered.” Later manuscripts, the 5th-century Codex Alexandrinus and the 16th-century Clementine recension of the Vulgate, read “be burned up.”)</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb"><em>Does </em><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:1-66:21:1" data-bid="9-1" class="b"><em>Revelation 21:1</em></a> (<em>KJ</em>) <em>indicate that our planet will be destroyed? </em>“And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away; and there was no more sea.”</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="si"><strong><em>To be correct, the explanation of these verses must agree with the context and with the rest of the Bible</em></strong></p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="si">If these texts (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:3:7-61:3:7" data-bid="10-1" class="b">2 Peter 3:7,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:3:10-61:3:10" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> 10</a> and <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:1-66:21:1" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Revelation 21:1</a>) mean that the literal planet Earth is to be consumed by fire, then the literal heavens (the stars and other heavenly bodies) are also to be destroyed by fire. Such a literal view, however, conflicts with the assurance contained in such texts as <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:10-40:6:10" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Matthew 6:10, </a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:37:29-19:37:29" data-bid="12-2" class="b">Psalm 37:29</a> and <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:104:5-19:104:5" data-bid="13-1" class="b">104:5</a>, also <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:2:21-20:2:22" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Proverbs 2:21, 22</a>. Furthermore, what effect would fire have on the already intensely hot sun and stars? So the term “earth” in the above-quoted texts must be understood in a different sense.</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="si">At <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:11:1-1:11:1" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Genesis 11:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:2:1-11:2:2" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> First Kings 2:1, 2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:16:31-13:16:31" data-bid="15-3" class="b"> First Chronicles 16:31,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:96:1-19:96:1" data-bid="15-4" class="b"> Psalm 96:1</a>, etc., the term “earth” is used in a <em>figurative </em>sense, referring to mankind, to human society. Might that be the case at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:3:7-61:3:7" data-bid="16-1" class="b">2 Peter 3:7,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:3:10-61:3:10" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> 10</a> and <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:1-66:21:1" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Revelation 21:1</a>?</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="si">Note that, in the context, at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:3:5-61:3:6" data-bid="18-1" class="b">2 Peter 3:5, 6</a> (also <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:2:5-61:2:5" data-bid="19-1" class="b">2:5,</a> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:2:9-61:2:9" data-bid="20-1" class="b">9</a>), a parallel is drawn with the Flood of Noah’s day, in which wicked human society was destroyed, but Noah and his household, as well as the globe itself, were preserved. Likewise, at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:3:7-61:3:7" data-bid="21-1" class="b">2 Peter 3:7</a> it says that the ones to be destroyed are “ungodly men.” The view that “the earth” here refers to <span id="page115" class="pageNum" data-no="115" data-before-text="115"></span>wicked human society fully agrees with the rest of the Bible, as is illustrated by the texts cited above. It is that symbolic “earth,” or <em>wicked human society, </em>that is “discovered”; that is, Jehovah will sear away as by fire all disguise, <em>exposing </em>the wickedness of ungodly human society and showing it to be worthy of complete destruction. That wicked society of humans is also “the first earth,” referred to at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:1-66:21:1" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Revelation 21:1</a> (<em>KJ</em>).</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="si">Consistently, Jesus’ expression at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:21:33-42:21:33" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Luke 21:33</a> (“heaven and earth will pass away, but . . . ”) must be understood in the light of the parallel statement at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:16:17-42:16:17" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Luke 16:17</a> (<em>“it is easier </em>for heaven and earth to pass away <em>than </em>. . . ”), both of which simply emphasize the impossibility of the situations presented.—See also <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:5:18-40:5:18" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Matthew 5:18</a>.</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sn"><strong>Will the righteous be taken to heaven and then returned to earth after the wicked are destroyed?</strong></p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb"><em>Does </em><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:2-66:21:3" data-bid="26-1" class="b"><em>Revelation 21:2, 3</em></a> <em>support that view? </em>It says: “I saw also the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God and prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. With that I heard a loud voice from the throne say: ‘Look! The tent of God is with mankind, and he will reside with them, and they will be his peoples. And God himself will be with them.’” (Does the fact that God will “reside” with mankind and “be with them” mean that he will become a fleshly Being? That cannot be, because Jehovah told Moses: “No man may see me and yet live.” [<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:33:20-2:33:20" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Ex. 33:20</a>] Consistently, then, the members of the New Jerusalem will not return to earth as physical beings. In what sense, then, could God “be with” mankind and how would the New Jerusalem ‘come down out of heaven’? No doubt an indication is found in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:21:1-1:21:1" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Genesis 21:1</a>, which says that God “visited” Sarah, blessing her with a son in her old age. <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:4:31-2:4:31" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Exodus 4:31</a> tells us that God “visited” Israel by sending Moses as a deliverer. <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:7:16-42:7:16" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Luke 7:16</a> says that by means of Jesus’ ministry God “visited” his people. [All from <em>KJ </em>and <em>RS</em>] Other translations use the expression God “turned his attention” to his people [<em>NW</em>] or ‘showed concern’ for them [<em>NE</em>]. So <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:2-66:21:3" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Revelation 21:2, 3</a> must mean that God will ‘visit,’ or be with, mankind by means of <span id="page116" class="pageNum" data-no="116" data-before-text="116"></span>the heavenly New Jerusalem, through which blessings will come to obedient humans.)</p>

<div class="openingContent"><p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sa"><strong>Definition: </strong>Being born again involves being baptized in water (“born from water”) and begotten by God’s spirit (“born from . . . spirit”), thus becoming a son of God with the prospect of sharing in the Kingdom of God. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:3:3-43:3:5" data-bid="1-1" class="b">John 3:3-5</a>) Jesus had this experience, as do the 144,000 who are heirs with him of the heavenly Kingdom.</p>

<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:7:9-66:7:10" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Rev. 7:9, 10,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:7:17-66:7:17" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> 17</a>: “After these things [after the apostle John heard the number of those who would be “born again,” <span id="page78" class="pageNum" data-no="78" data-before-text="78"></span>those who would make up spiritual Israel and would be with Christ in heaven; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:2:28-45:2:29" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Romans 2:28, 29</a> and <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:3:26-48:3:29" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Galatians 3:26-29</a>] I saw, and, look! a great crowd, which no man was able to number, out of all nations and tribes and peoples and tongues, standing before the throne and before the Lamb, dressed in white robes; and there were palm branches in their hands. And they keep on crying with a loud voice, saying: ‘Salvation we owe to our God, who is seated on the throne, and to the Lamb.’ . . . ‘The Lamb [Jesus Christ], who is in the midst of the throne, will shepherd them, and will guide them to fountains of waters of life.’”</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">After listing many pre-Christian persons of faith, <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:11:39-58:11:40" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Hebrews 11:39, 40</a> says: “All these, although they had witness borne to them through their faith, did not get the fulfillment of the promise, as God foresaw something better for us, in order that they might not be made perfect apart from us.” (Who are here meant by “us”? <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:3:1-58:3:1" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Hebrews 3:1</a> shows that they are “partakers of the heavenly calling.” The pre-Christian persons who had faith, then, must have a hope for perfect life somewhere other than in heaven.)</p>

<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sn"><strong>Is it possible for a person to have God’s spirit and yet not be “born again”?</strong></p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">Regarding John the baptizer, Jehovah’s angel said: “He will be filled with holy spirit right from his mother’s womb.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:1:15-42:1:15" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Luke 1:15</a>) And Jesus later said: “Among those born of women there has not been raised up a greater than John the Baptist; but a person that is a lesser one in the kingdom of the heavens is greater than he is [Why? Because John will not be in the heavens and so there was no need for him to be “born again”]. But from the days of John the Baptist until <span id="page79" class="pageNum" data-no="79" data-before-text="79"></span>now [when Jesus stated this] the kingdom of the heavens is the goal toward which men press.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:11:11-40:11:12" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Matt. 11:11, 12</a>.</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">The spirit of Jehovah was “operative” upon David and “spoke” by him (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:16:13-9:16:13" data-bid="21-1" class="b">1 Sam. 16:13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:23:2-10:23:2" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> 2 Sam. 23:2</a>), but nowhere does the Bible say that he was “born again.” There was no need for him to be “born again,” because, as <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:2:34-44:2:34" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Acts 2:34</a> says: “David did not ascend to the heavens.”</p>

<p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sn"><strong>‘I’ve been born again’</strong></p>
<p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="sb"><strong>You might reply: </strong>‘That means that you expect someday to be with Christ in heaven, doesn’t it? . . . Have you ever wondered what those who go to heaven will do there?’ <strong>Then perhaps add: </strong>(1) ‘They will be kings and priests, ruling with Christ. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:20:6-66:20:6" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Rev. 20:6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:5:9-66:5:10" data-bid="23-2" class="b"> 5:9, 10</a>) Jesus said that these would be just a “little flock.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:12:32-42:12:32" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Luke 12:32</a>)’ (2) ‘If they are kings, there must also be subjects over whom they will rule. Who will these be? . . . Here are some points that I found to be very interesting when they were drawn to my attention.

<p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="sn"><strong>‘Have you been born again?’</strong></p>
<p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="sb"><strong>You might reply: </strong>‘I find that what people mean by “born again” is not always the same. Would you tell me what it means to you?’</p>
<p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="sb"><strong>Or you could say: </strong>‘You want to know whether I have accepted Jesus as my Savior and have received holy spirit, is that right? May I assure you that the answer is Yes; otherwise I would not be talking to you about Jesus.’ <strong>Then perhaps add: </strong>(1) ‘But when I think of having the holy spirit, I find that evidence of that spirit is sadly missing in many who claim to be Christians. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:5:22-48:5:23" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Gal. 5:22, 23</a>)’ (2) ‘Would you enjoy living on this earth if everyone reflected those godly qualities? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:37:10-19:37:11" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Ps. 37:10, 11</a>)’</p>
<p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="sb"><span id="page80" class="pageNum" data-no="80" data-before-text="80"></span><strong>Another possibility: </strong>‘If you mean by that, “Have I accepted Christ as my Savior?” the answer is Yes. All of Jehovah’s Witnesses have done that. But, to us, being born again involves much more than that.’ <strong>Then perhaps add: </strong>(1) ‘When Jesus spoke about being born again he said that it was necessary in order to enter the Kingdom of God, that is, to be part of God’s Kingdom, his heavenly government. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:3:5-43:3:5" data-bid="28-1" class="b">John 3:5</a>)’ (2) ‘The Bible also shows that many people who do the will of God will live here on earth, as happy subjects of that Kingdom. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:10-40:6:10" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Matt. 6:10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:37:29-19:37:29" data-bid="29-2" class="b"> Ps. 37:29</a>)’</p>
<p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="sb"><strong>An additional suggestion: </strong>Those who are of the heavenly class could reply: ‘Yes, I am. But the Bible cautions all of us not to be overconfident of our position. We need to keep examining ourselves to be sure that we are really doing what God and Christ require of us.

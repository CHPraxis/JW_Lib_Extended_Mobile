<div class="openingContent"><p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sa"><strong>Definition: </strong>The only-begotten Son of God, the only Son produced by Jehovah alone. This Son is the firstborn of all creation. By means of him all other things in heaven and on earth were created. He is the second-greatest personage in the universe. It is this Son whom Jehovah sent to the earth to give his life as a ransom for mankind, thus opening the way to eternal life for those of Adam’s offspring who would exercise faith. This same Son, restored to heavenly glory, now rules as King, with authority to destroy all the wicked and to carry out his Father’s original purpose for the earth. The Hebrew form of the name <em>Jesus </em>means “Jehovah Is Salvation”; <em>Christ </em>is the equivalent of the Hebrew <em>Ma·shiʹach </em>(Messiah), meaning “Anointed One.”</p>

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn"><strong>Was Jesus Christ a real, historical person?</strong></p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The Bible itself is the principal evidence that Jesus Christ is a historical person. The record in the Gospels is not a vague narrative of events at some unspecified time and in an unnamed location. It clearly states time and place in great detail. For an example, see <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:3:1-42:3:2" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Luke 3:1, 2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:3:21-42:3:23" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 21-23</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The first-century Jewish historian Josephus referred to the stoning of “James, the brother of Jesus who was called the Christ.” (<em>The Jewish Antiquities, </em>Josephus, Book XX, sec. 200) A direct and very favorable reference to Jesus, found in Book XVIII, sections 63, 64, has been challenged by some who claim that it must have been either added later or embellished by Christians; but it is acknowledged that the vocabulary and the style are basically those of Josephus, and the passage is found in all available manuscripts.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Tacitus, a Roman historian who lived during the latter part of the first century C.E., wrote: “Christus [Latin for “Christ”], from whom the name [Christian] had its origin, suffered the extreme penalty during the reign of Tiberius at the hands of one of our procurators, Pontius Pilatus.”—<em>The Complete Works of Tacitus </em>(New York, 1942), “The Annals,” Book 15, par. 44.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">With reference to early non-Christian historical references to Jesus, <em>The New Encyclopædia Britannica </em>states: “These independent accounts prove that in ancient times <span id="page210" class="pageNum" data-no="210" data-before-text="210"></span>even the opponents of Christianity never doubted the historicity of Jesus, which was disputed for the first time and on inadequate grounds by several authors at the end of the 18th, during the 19th, and at the beginning of the 20th centuries.”—(1976), Macropædia, Vol. 10, p. 145.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sn"><strong>Was Jesus Christ simply a good man?</strong></p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Interestingly, Jesus rebuked a man who addressed him with the title “Good Teacher,” because Jesus recognized not himself but his Father to be the standard of goodness. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:10:17-41:10:18" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Mark 10:17, 18</a>) However, to measure up to what people generally mean when they say that someone is good, Jesus surely must have been truthful. Indeed, even his enemies acknowledged that he was. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:12:14-41:12:14" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Mark 12:14</a>) He himself said that he had a prehuman existence, that he was the unique Son of God, that he was the Messiah, the one whose coming was foretold throughout the Hebrew Scriptures. Either he was what he said or he was a gross impostor, but neither option allows for the view that he was simply a good man.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:3:13-43:3:13" data-bid="4-1" class="b">John 3:13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:10:36-43:10:36" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 10:36;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:4:25-43:4:26" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> 4:25, 26;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:24:44-42:24:48" data-bid="4-4" class="b"> Luke 24:44-48</a>.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sn"><strong>Was Jesus merely a prophet whose authority was similar to that of Moses, Buddha, Muhammad, and other religious leaders?</strong></p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Jesus himself taught that he was the unique Son of God (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:10:36-43:10:36" data-bid="5-1" class="b">John 10:36;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:16:15-40:16:17" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Matt. 16:15-17</a>), the foretold Messiah (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:14:61-41:14:62" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Mark 14:61, 62</a>), that he had a prehuman existence in heaven (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:6:38-43:6:38" data-bid="7-1" class="b">John 6:38;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:8:23-43:8:23" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 8:23,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:8:58-43:8:58" data-bid="7-3" class="b"> 58</a>), that he would be put to death and then would be raised to life on the third day and would thereafter return to the heavens. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:16:21-40:16:21" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Matt. 16:21;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:14:2-43:14:3" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> John 14:2, 3</a>) Were these claims true, and was he thus really different from all other true prophets of God and in sharp contrast to all self-styled religious leaders? The truth of the matter would be evident on the third day from his death. Did God then resurrect him from the dead, thus confirming that Jesus Christ had spoken the truth and was indeed God’s unique Son? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:1:3-45:1:4" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Rom. 1:3, 4</a>) Over 500 witnesses actually saw Jesus alive following his resurrection, and his faithful apostles were eyewitnesses as he began his ascent back to heaven and <span id="page211" class="pageNum" data-no="211" data-before-text="211"></span>then disappeared from their view in a cloud. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:15:3-46:15:8" data-bid="10-1" class="b">1 Cor. 15:3-8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:1:2-44:1:3" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> Acts 1:2, 3,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:1:9-44:1:9" data-bid="10-3" class="b"> 9</a>) So thoroughly were they convinced that he had been raised from the dead that many of them risked their lives to tell others about it.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:4:18-44:4:33" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Acts 4:18-33</a>.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sn"><strong>Why did the Jews in general not accept Jesus as the Messiah?</strong></p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">The <em>Encyclopaedia Judaica </em>says: “The Jews of the Roman period believed [the Messiah] would be raised up by God to break the yoke of the heathen and to reign over a restored kingdom of Israel.” (Jerusalem, 1971, Vol. 11, col. 1407) They wanted liberation from the yoke of Rome. Jewish history testifies that on the basis of the Messianic prophecy recorded at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:9:24-27:9:27" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Daniel 9:24-27</a> there were Jews who expected the Messiah during the first century C.E. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:3:15-42:3:15" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Luke 3:15</a>) But that prophecy also connected his coming with ‘making an end of sin,’ and <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:53:1-23:53:12" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Isaiah chapter 53</a> indicated that Messiah himself would die in order to make this possible. However, the Jews in general felt no need for anyone to die for their sins. They believed that they had a righteous standing with God on the basis of their descent from Abraham. Says <em>A Rabbinic Anthology, </em>“So great is the [merit] of Abraham that he can atone for all the vanities committed and lies uttered by Israel in this world.” (London, 1938, C. Montefiore and H. Loewe, p. 676) By their rejection of Jesus as Messiah, the Jews fulfilled the prophecy that had foretold regarding him: “He was despised, and we esteemed him not.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:53:3-23:53:3" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Isaiah 53:3</a>, <em>JP.</em></p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Before his death, Moses foretold that the nation would turn aside from true worship and that, as a result, calamity would befall them. (Read <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:31:27-5:31:29" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 31:27-29</a>.) The book of Judges testifies that this occurred repeatedly. In the days of the prophet Jeremiah, national unfaithfulness led to the nation’s being taken into exile in Babylon. Why did God also allow the Romans to destroy Jerusalem and its temple in 70 C.E.? Of what unfaithfulness had the nation been guilty so that God did not protect them as he had done when they had put their trust in him? It was shortly before this that they had rejected Jesus as the Messiah.</p>

<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="si"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:1:1-43:1:1" data-bid="20-1" class="b">John 1:1</a>, <em>RS: </em>“In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God [also <em>KJ, JB, Dy, Kx, NAB</em>].” <em>NE </em>reads “what God was, the Word was.” <em>Mo </em>says “the Logos was divine.” <em>AT </em>and <em>Sd </em>tell us “the Word was divine.” The interlinear rendering of <em>ED </em>is “a god was the Word.” <em>NW </em>reads “the Word was a god”; <em>NTIV </em>uses the same wording.</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="si">What is it that these translators are seeing in the Greek text that moves some of them to refrain from saying “the Word was God”? The definite article (the) appears before the first occurrence of <em>the·osʹ </em>(God) but not before the second. The articular (when the article appears) construction of the noun points to an identity, a personality, whereas a singular anarthrous (without the article) predicate noun before the verb (as the sentence is constructed in Greek) points to a quality about someone. So the text is not saying that the Word (Jesus) was the same as the God <em>with whom </em>he was but, rather, that the Word was godlike, divine, a god. (See <a class="xt" data-xtid="2" href="jwpub://p/E:1001060096/1-112">1984 Reference edition of <em>NW, </em>p. 1579</a>.)</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="si">What did the apostle John mean when he wrote <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:1:1-43:1:1" data-bid="21-1" class="b">John 1:1</a>?

In the same chapter, <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:1:18-43:1:18" data-bid="22-1" class="b">verse 18</a>, <span id="page213" class="pageNum" data-no="213" data-before-text="213"></span>John wrote: “No one [“no man,” <em>KJ, Dy</em>] has ever seen God; the only Son [“the only-begotten god,” <em>NW</em>], who is in the bosom of the Father, he has made him known.” (<em>RS</em>) Had any human seen Jesus Christ, the Son? Of course! So, then, was John saying that Jesus was God? Obviously not. Toward the end of his Gospel, John summarized matters, saying: “These are written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, [not God, but] the Son of God.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:20:31-43:20:31" data-bid="23-1" class="b">John 20:31</a>, <em>RS.</em></p>

<p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="si">There is no objection to referring to Jesus as “God,” if this is what Thomas had in mind. Such would be in harmony with Jesus’ own quotation from the Psalms in which powerful men, judges, were addressed as “gods.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:10:34-43:10:35" data-bid="26-1" class="b">John 10:34, 35</a>, <em>RS; </em><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:82:1-19:82:6" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Ps. 82:1-6</a>) Of course, Christ occupies a position far higher than such men. Because of the uniqueness of his position in relation to Jehovah, at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:1:18-43:1:18" data-bid="28-1" class="b">John 1:18</a> (<em>NW</em>) Jesus is referred to as “the only-begotten god.” (See also <em>Ro, By.</em>) <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:9:6-23:9:6" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Isaiah 9:6</a> (<em>RS</em>) also prophetically describes Jesus as “Mighty God,” but not as the Almighty God. All of this is in harmony with Jesus’ being described as “a god,” or “divine,” at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:1:1-43:1:1" data-bid="30-1" class="b">John 1:1</a> (<em>NW, AT</em>).</p>
<p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="si">The context helps us to draw the right conclusion from this. Shortly before Jesus’ death, Thomas had heard Jesus’ prayer in which he addressed his Father as “the only true God.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:3-43:17:3" data-bid="31-1" class="b">John 17:3</a>, <em>RS</em>) After Jesus’ resurrection Jesus had sent a message to his apostles, including Thomas, in which he had said: “I am ascending . . . to my God and your God.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:20:17-43:20:17" data-bid="32-1" class="b">John 20:17</a>, <em>RS</em>) After recording what Thomas said when he actually saw and touched the resurrected Christ, the apostle John stated: “These are written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing you may have life in his name.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:20:31-43:20:31" data-bid="33-1" class="b">John 20:31</a>, <em>RS</em>) So, if anyone has concluded from Thomas’ exclamation that Jesus is himself “the only true God” or that Jesus is a Trinitarian “God the Son,” he needs to look again at what Jesus himself said (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:20:17-43:20:17" data-bid="34-1" class="b">vs. 17</a>) and at the conclusion that is clearly stated by the apostle John (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:20:31-43:20:31" data-bid="35-1" class="b">vs. 31</a>).</p>

Paul showed that more was required—namely, knowledge and acceptance of the Word of God, as Paul and Silas now proceeded to preach it to the jailer. Would a person’s belief in Jesus be genuine if he did not worship the God whom Jesus worshiped, if he did not apply what Jesus taught as to the kind of persons his disciples should be, or if he did not do the work that Jesus commanded his followers to perform? We cannot <em>earn </em>salvation; it is possible only on the basis of faith in the value of the sacrifice of Jesus’ human life.

<p id="p52" data-pid="52" class="sb"><em>Illustration: </em>If a man pays a debt for a friend but then promptly takes back the payment, obviously the debt continues.

<p id="p53" data-pid="53" class="sb">It is true that Jesus appeared in physical form to his disciples after his resurrection. But on certain occasions, why did they not at first recognize him? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:24:15-42:24:32" data-bid="65-1" class="b">Luke 24:15-32;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:20:14-43:20:16" data-bid="65-2" class="b"> John 20:14-16</a>) On one occasion, for the benefit of Thomas, Jesus appeared with the physical evidence of nail prints in his hands and a spear wound in his side. But how was it possible on that occasion for him suddenly to appear in their midst even though the doors were locked? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:20:26-43:20:27" data-bid="66-1" class="b">John 20:26, 27</a>) Jesus evidently materialized bodies on these occasions, as angels had done in the past when appearing to humans. Disposing of Jesus’ physical body at the time of his resurrection presented no problem for God. Interestingly, although the physical body was not left by God in the tomb (evidently <span id="page218" class="pageNum" data-no="218" data-before-text="218"></span>to strengthen the conviction of the disciples that Jesus had actually been raised), the linen cloths in which it had been wrapped were left there; yet, the resurrected Jesus always appeared fully clothed.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:20:6-43:20:7" data-bid="67-1" class="b">John 20:6, 7</a>.</p>
<p id="p54" data-pid="54" class="sn"><strong>Is Jesus Christ the same person as Michael the archangel?</strong></p>
<p id="p55" data-pid="55" class="sb">The name of this Michael appears only five times in the Bible. The glorious spirit person who bears the name is referred to as “one of the chief princes,” “the great prince who has charge of your [Daniel’s] people,” and as “the archangel.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:10:13-27:10:13" data-bid="68-1" class="b">Dan. 10:13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:12:1-27:12:1" data-bid="68-2" class="b"> 12:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/65:1:9-65:1:9" data-bid="68-3" class="b"> Jude 9</a>, <em>RS</em>) Michael means “Who Is Like God?” The name evidently designates Michael as the one who takes the lead in upholding Jehovah’s sovereignty and destroying God’s enemies.</p>
<p id="p56" data-pid="56" class="sb">At <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/52:4:16-52:4:16" data-bid="69-1" class="b">1 Thessalonians 4:16</a> (<em>RS</em>), the command of Jesus Christ for the resurrection to begin is described as “the archangel’s call,” and <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/65:1:9-65:1:9" data-bid="70-1" class="b">Jude 9</a> says that the archangel is Michael. Would it be appropriate to liken Jesus’ commanding call to that of someone lesser in authority? Reasonably, then, the archangel Michael is Jesus Christ. (Interestingly, the expression “archangel” is never found in the plural in the Scriptures, thus implying that there is only one.)</p>
<p id="p57" data-pid="57" class="sb"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:12:7-66:12:12" data-bid="71-1" class="b">Revelation 12:7-12</a> says that Michael and his angels would war against Satan and hurl him and his wicked angels out of heaven in connection with the conferring of kingly authority on Christ. Jesus is later depicted as leading the armies of heaven in war against the nations of the world. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:19:11-66:19:16" data-bid="72-1" class="b">Rev. 19:11-16</a>) Is it not reasonable that Jesus would also be the one to take action against the one he described as “ruler of this world,” Satan the Devil? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:12:31-43:12:31" data-bid="73-1" class="b">John 12:31</a>) <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:12:1-27:12:1" data-bid="74-1" class="b">Daniel 12:1</a> (<em>RS</em>) associates the ‘standing up of Michael’ to act with authority with “a time of trouble, such as never has been since there was a nation till that time.” That would certainly fit the experience of the nations when Christ as heavenly executioner takes action against them. So the evidence indicates that the Son of God was known as Michael before he came to earth and is known also by that name since his return to heaven where he resides as the glorified spirit Son of God.</p>

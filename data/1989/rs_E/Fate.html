<div class="openingContent"><p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sa"><strong>Definition: </strong>An inevitable and often adverse outcome. Fatalism is the belief that all events are determined by the divine will or by some force greater than man, that every event must take place as it does because it has been predetermined. <em>Not a Bible word or teaching.</em></p>

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn"><strong>Does everyone have a predetermined “time to die”?</strong></p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">This belief was popular among the Greeks and Romans. According to pagan Greek mythology, the Fates were three goddesses that spun the thread of life, determined its length, and cut it.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:3:1-21:3:2" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 3:1, 2</a> speaks of “a time to die.” But, showing that this is not a predetermined fixed moment for the individual, <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:7:17-21:7:17" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 7:17</a> counsels: “Do not be wicked overmuch, nor become foolish. Why should <em>you die when it is not your time?” </em><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:10:27-20:10:27" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Proverbs 10:27</a> says: “The years themselves of the wicked ones will be cut short.” And <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:55:23-19:55:23" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Psalm 55:23</a> adds: “As for bloodguilty and deceitful men, they will not live out half their days.” What, then, does <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:3:1-21:3:2" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 3:1, 2</a> mean? It is simply discussing the continuous cycle of life and death in this imperfect system of things. There is a time when people are born and a time when they die—usually at not more than 70 or 80 years of age, but sometimes sooner and sometimes later.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:90:10-19:90:10" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ps. 90:10</a>; see also <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:9:11-21:9:11" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 9:11</a>.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">If each one’s moment and manner of death were already fixed at the time of birth or earlier, there would be no need to avoid dangerous situations or to care for one’s health, and safety precautions would not alter mortality rates. But do you believe that a battlefield during war is as safe as one’s home far away from the war zone? Do you care for your health or take your children to the doctor? Why do smokers die three to four years younger, on an average, than nonsmokers? Why are there fewer fatal accidents when automobile passengers wear seat belts and when drivers obey traffic laws? Obviously, taking precautions is beneficial.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sn"><span id="page139" class="pageNum" data-no="139" data-before-text="139"></span><strong>Is everything that happens “the will of God”?</strong></p>

Clearly, it is not “the will of God” when some fail to repent. Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:9:20-66:9:21" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Revelation 9:20, 21</a>.)</p>

I kept sending to you all my servants the prophets, daily getting up early and sending them. But they did not listen to me, and they did not incline their ear, but they kept hardening their neck.” (Obviously, the badness taking place in Israel was not “the will of God.”)</p>

<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:11:1-23:11:3" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Isa. 11:1-3</a>: “There must go forth a twig out of the stump of Jesse; and out of his roots a sprout will be fruitful. [Jesus was born in the line of Jesse.] And upon him the spirit of Jehovah must settle down, . . . and there will be enjoyment by him in the fear of Jehovah.” (Jehovah could confidently foretell this regarding his Son because He had observed his attitude and conduct in the heavens since the beginning of creation.) (Regarding Jesus’ prehuman existence, see <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1101989240/46-48">pages 216, 217, under the heading “Jesus Christ.”</a>)</p>

Similarly, on the basis of what is observed, a weather forecaster may predict the weather with a great degree of accuracy, but he does not cause it or necessarily like it.)</p>

Likewise, Jehovah has the ability to foreknow events, but the Bible shows that he makes <em>selective </em>and <em>discretionary </em>use of that ability, with due regard for the free will with which he has endowed his human creation.—Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:22:12-1:22:12" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Genesis 22:12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:18:20-1:18:21" data-bid="27-2" class="b"> 18:20, 21</a>.</p>

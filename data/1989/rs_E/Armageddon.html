<div class="openingContent"><p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sa"><strong>Definition: </strong>The Greek <em>Har Ma·ge·donʹ, </em>taken from Hebrew and rendered “Armageddon” by many translators, means “Mountain of Megiddo,” or “Mountain of Assembly of Troops.” The Bible associates the name, not with a nuclear holocaust, but with the coming universal “war of the great day of God the Almighty.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:16:14-66:16:14" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Rev. 16:14,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:16:16-66:16:16" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 16</a>) This name is applied specifically to “the place [Greek, <em>toʹpon; </em>that is, condition or situation]” to which earth’s political rulers are being gathered in opposition to Jehovah and his Kingdom by Jesus Christ. Such opposition will be shown by global action against Jehovah’s servants on earth, the visible representatives of God’s Kingdom.</p>

<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="si">The kings and military forces of “the entire inhabited earth” could not fit into the literal Plain of Esdraelon, below Megiddo.

<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="si">The reference to Megiddo (meaning “Assembly of Troops”) is appropriate because Armageddon is a world situation in which the troops and other supporters of the rulers of all nations will be involved.</p>

<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="sn"><strong>What will happen to young children at Armageddon?</strong></p>
<p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="sb">The Bible does not directly answer that question, and we are not the judges. However, the Bible does show that God views the young children of true Christians as “holy.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:7:14-46:7:14" data-bid="21-1" class="b">1 Cor. 7:14</a>) <span id="page48" class="pageNum" data-no="48" data-before-text="48"></span>It also reveals that in times past when God destroyed the wicked he likewise destroyed their little ones.

Would it not be wise for parents to pursue a course that would result in their children being looked on with favor by God both now and at Armageddon?</p>

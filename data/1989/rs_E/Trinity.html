</header>
<div class="openingContent"><p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sa"><strong>Definition: </strong>The central doctrine of religions of Christendom. According to the Athanasian Creed, there are three divine Persons (the Father, the Son, the Holy Ghost), each said to be eternal, each said to be almighty, none greater or less than another, each said to be God, and yet together being but one God. Other statements of the dogma emphasize that these three “Persons” are not separate and distinct individuals but are three modes in which the divine essence exists. Thus some Trinitarians emphasize their belief that Jesus Christ is God, or that Jesus and the Holy Ghost are Jehovah. <em>Not a Bible teaching.</em></p>

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn"><strong>What is the origin of the Trinity doctrine?</strong></p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><em>The New Encyclopædia Britannica </em>says: “Neither the word Trinity, nor the explicit doctrine as such, appears in the New Testament, nor did Jesus and his followers intend to contradict the Shema in the Old Testament: ‘Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God is one Lord’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:6:4-5:6:4" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Deut. 6:4</a>). . . . The doctrine developed gradually over several centuries and through many controversies. . . . By the end of the 4th century . . . the doctrine of the Trinity took substantially the form it has maintained ever since.”—(1976), Micropædia, Vol. X, p. 126.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The <em>New Catholic Encyclopedia </em>states: “The formulation ‘one God in three Persons’ was not solidly established, certainly not fully assimilated into Christian life and its profession of faith, prior to the end of the 4th century. But it is precisely this formulation that has first claim to the title <em>the Trinitarian dogma. </em>Among the Apostolic Fathers, there had been nothing even remotely approaching such a mentality or perspective.”—(1967), Vol. XIV, p. 299.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><span id="page406" class="pageNum" data-no="406" data-before-text="406"></span>In <em>The Encyclopedia Americana </em>we read: “Christianity derived from Judaism and Judaism was strictly Unitarian [believing that God is one person]. The road which led from Jerusalem to Nicea was scarcely a straight one. Fourth century Trinitarianism did not reflect accurately early Christian teaching regarding the nature of God; it was, on the contrary, a deviation from this teaching.”—(1956), Vol. XXVII, p. 294L.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">According to the <em>Nouveau Dictionnaire Universel, </em>“The Platonic trinity, itself merely a rearrangement of older trinities dating back to earlier peoples, appears to be the rational philosophic trinity of attributes that gave birth to the three hypostases or divine persons taught by the Christian churches. . . . This Greek philosopher’s [Plato, fourth century B.C.E.] conception of the divine trinity . . . can be found in all the ancient [pagan] religions.”—(Paris, 1865-1870), edited by M. Lachâtre, Vol. 2, p. 1467.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">John L. McKenzie, S.J., in his <em>Dictionary of the Bible, </em>says: “The trinity of persons within the unity of nature is defined in terms of ‘person’ and ‘nature’ which are G[ree]k philosophical terms; actually the terms do not appear in the Bible. The trinitarian definitions arose as the result of long controversies in which these terms and others such as ‘essence’ and ‘substance’ were erroneously applied to God by some theologians.”—(New York, 1965), p. 899.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sn"><strong>Even though, as Trinitarians acknowledge, neither the word “Trinity” nor a statement of the Trinitarian dogma is found in the Bible, are the concepts that are embodied in that dogma found there?</strong></p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="si"><strong><em>Does the Bible teach that the “Holy Spirit” is a person?</em></strong></p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="si">Some individual texts that refer to the holy spirit (“Holy Ghost,” <em>KJ</em>) might seem to indicate personality. For example, the holy spirit is referred to as a helper (Greek, <em>pa·raʹkle·tos; </em>“Comforter,” <em>KJ; </em>“Advocate,” <em>JB, NE</em>) that ‘teaches,’ ‘bears witness,’ ‘speaks’ and ‘hears.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:14:16-43:14:17" data-bid="2-1" class="b">John 14:16, 17,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:14:26-43:14:26" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 26;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:15:26-43:15:26" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> 15:26;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:16:13-43:16:13" data-bid="2-4" class="b"> 16:13</a>) <span id="page407" class="pageNum" data-no="407" data-before-text="407"></span>But other texts say that people were “filled” with holy spirit, that some were ‘baptized’ with it or “anointed” with it. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:1:41-42:1:41" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Luke 1:41;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:3:11-40:3:11" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Matt. 3:11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:10:38-44:10:38" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> Acts 10:38</a>) These latter references to holy spirit definitely do not fit a person. To understand what the Bible as a whole teaches, all these texts must be considered. What is the reasonable conclusion? That the first texts cited here employ a figure of speech personifying God’s holy spirit, his active force, as the Bible also personifies wisdom, sin, death, water, and blood. (See also <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1101989271/3-7">pages 380, 381, under the heading “Spirit.”</a>)</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="si">The Holy Scriptures tell us the personal name of the Father—Jehovah. They inform us that the Son is Jesus Christ. But nowhere in the Scriptures is a <em>personal </em>name applied to the holy spirit.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="si"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:7:55-44:7:56" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Acts 7:55, 56</a> reports that Stephen was given a vision of heaven in which he saw “Jesus standing at God’s right hand.” But he made no mention of seeing the holy spirit. (See also <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:7:10-66:7:10" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Revelation 7:10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:22:1-66:22:1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 22:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:22:3-66:22:3" data-bid="5-3" class="b"> 3</a>.)</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="si">The <em>New Catholic Encyclopedia </em>admits: “The majority of N[ew] T[estament] texts reveal God’s spirit as something, not someone; this is especially seen in the parallelism between the spirit and the power of God.” (1967, Vol. XIII, p. 575) It also reports: “The Apologists [Greek Christian writers of the second century] spoke too haltingly of the Spirit; with a measure of anticipation, one might say too impersonally.”—Vol. XIV, p. 296.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="si"><strong><em>Does the Bible agree with those who teach that the Father and the Son are not separate and distinct individuals?</em></strong></p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="si"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:26:39-40:26:39" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Matt. 26:39</a>, <em>RS: </em>“Going a little farther he [Jesus Christ] fell on his face and prayed, ‘My Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me; nevertheless, not as I will, but as thou wilt.’” (If the Father and the Son were not distinct individuals, such a prayer would have been meaningless. Jesus would have been praying to himself, and his will would <em>of necessity </em>have been the Father’s will.)</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="si"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:8:17-43:8:18" data-bid="7-1" class="b">John 8:17, 18</a>, <em>RS: </em>“[Jesus answered the Jewish Pharisees:] In your law it is written that the testimony of two men is true; I bear witness to myself, and the Father who sent <span id="page408" class="pageNum" data-no="408" data-before-text="408"></span>me bears witness to me.” (So, Jesus definitely spoke of himself as being an individual separate and distinct from the Father.)</p>

<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="si"><strong><em>Does the Bible teach that all who are said to be part of the Trinity are eternal, none having a beginning?</em></strong></p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="si"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:1:15-51:1:16" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Col. 1:15, 16</a>, <em>RS: </em>“He [Jesus Christ] is the image of the invisible God, the first-born of all creation; for in him all things were created, in heaven and on earth.” In what sense is Jesus Christ “the first-born of all creation”? <strong>(1) </strong>Trinitarians say that “first-born” here means prime, most excellent, most distinguished; thus Christ would be understood to be, not part of creation, but the most distinguished in relation to those who were created. If that is so, and if the Trinity doctrine is true, why are the Father and the holy spirit not also said to be the firstborn of all creation? But the Bible applies this expression only to the Son. According to the customary meaning of “firstborn,” it indicates that Jesus is the eldest in Jehovah’s family of sons. <strong>(2) </strong>Before <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:1:15-51:1:15" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Colossians 1:15</a>, the expression “the firstborn of” occurs upwards of 30 times in the Bible, and in each instance that it is applied to living creatures the same meaning applies—the firstborn is part of the group. “The firstborn of Israel” is one of the sons of Israel; “the firstborn of Pharaoh” is one of Pharaoh’s family; “the firstborn of beast” are themselves animals. What, then, causes some to ascribe a different meaning to it at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:1:15-51:1:15" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Colossians 1:15</a>? Is it Bible usage or is it a belief to which they already hold and for which they seek proof? <strong>(3) </strong>Does <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:1:16-51:1:17" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Colossians 1:16, 17</a> (<em>RS</em>) exclude Jesus from having been created, when it says “in him all things were created . . . all things were created through him and for him”? The Greek word here rendered “all things” is <em>panʹta, </em>an inflected form of <em>pas. </em>At <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:13:2-42:13:2" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Luke 13:2</a>, <em>RS </em>renders this “all . . . other”; <em>JB </em>reads “any other”; <em>NE </em>says “anyone else.” (See also <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:21:29-42:21:29" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Luke 21:29</a> in <em>NE </em>and <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:2:21-50:2:21" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Philippians 2:21</a> in <em>JB.</em>) In harmony with everything else that the Bible says regarding the Son, <em>NW </em>assigns the same meaning to <em>panʹta </em>at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:1:16-51:1:17" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Colossians 1:16, 17</a> so that it reads, in part, “by means of him <em>all other things </em><span id="page409" class="pageNum" data-no="409" data-before-text="409"></span>were created . . . <em>All other things </em>have been created through him and for him.” Thus he is shown to be a created being, part of the creation produced by God.</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="si"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:1:1-66:1:1" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Rev. 1:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:3:14-66:3:14" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> 3:14</a>, <em>RS: </em>“The revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave him . . . ‘And to the angel of the church in La-odicea write: “The words of the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning [Greek, <em>ar·kheʹ</em>] of God’s creation.”’” (<em>KJ, Dy, CC, </em>and <em>NW, </em>as well as others, read similarly.) Is that rendering correct? Some take the view that what is meant is that the Son was ‘the beginner of God’s creation,’ that he was its ‘ultimate source.’ But Liddell and Scott’s <em>Greek-English Lexicon </em>lists “beginning” as its first meaning of <em>ar·kheʹ. </em>(Oxford, 1968, p. 252) The logical conclusion is that the one being quoted at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:3:14-66:3:14" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Revelation 3:14</a> is a creation, the first of God’s creations, that he had a beginning. Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:8:22-20:8:22" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Proverbs 8:22</a>, where, as many Bible commentators agree, the Son is referred to as wisdom personified. According to <em>RS, NE, </em>and <em>JB, </em>the one there speaking is said to be “created.”)</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="si">Prophetically, with reference to the Messiah, <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/33:5:2-33:5:2" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Micah 5:2</a> (<em>KJ</em>) says his “goings forth have been from of old, from everlasting.” <em>Dy </em>reads: “his going forth is from the beginning, from the days of eternity.” Does that make him the same as God? It is noteworthy that, instead of saying “days of eternity,” <em>RS </em>renders the Hebrew as “ancient days”; <em>JB, </em>“days of old”; <em>NW, </em>“days of time indefinite.” Viewed in the light of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:3:14-66:3:14" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Revelation 3:14</a>, discussed above, <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/33:5:2-33:5:2" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Micah 5:2</a> does not prove that Jesus was without a beginning.</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="si"><strong><em>Does the Bible teach that none of those who are said to be included in the Trinity is greater or less than another, that all are equal, that all are almighty?</em></strong></p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="si"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:13:32-41:13:32" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Mark 13:32</a>, <em>RS: </em>“Of that day or that hour no ones knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father.” (Of course, that would not be the case if Father, Son, and Holy Spirit were coequal, comprising one Godhead. And if, as some suggest, the Son was limited by his human nature from knowing, the question remains, Why did the Holy Spirit not know?)</p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="si"><span id="page410" class="pageNum" data-no="410" data-before-text="410"></span><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:20:20-40:20:23" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Matt. 20:20-23</a>, <em>RS: </em>“The mother of the sons of Zebedee . . . said to him [Jesus], ‘Command that these two sons of mine may sit, one at your right hand and one at your left, in your kingdom.’ But Jesus answered, . . . ‘You will drink my cup, but to sit at my right hand and at my left is not mine to grant, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared by my Father.’” (How strange, if, as claimed, Jesus is God! Was Jesus here merely answering according to his “human nature”? If, as Trinitarians say, Jesus was truly “God-man”—<em>both </em>God and man, not one or the other—would it truly be consistent to resort to such an explanation? Does not <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:20:23-40:20:23" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Matthew 20:23</a> rather show that the Son is not equal to the Father, that the Father has reserved some prerogatives for himself?)</p>
<p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="si"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:12:31-40:12:32" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Matt. 12:31, 32</a>, <em>RS: </em>“Every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven men, but the blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven. And whoever says a word against the Son of man will be forgiven; but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this age or in the age to come.” (If the Holy Spirit were a person and were God, this text would flatly contradict the Trinity doctrine, because it would mean that in some way the Holy Spirit was greater than the Son. Instead, what Jesus said shows that the Father, to whom the “Spirit” belonged, is greater than Jesus, the Son of man.)</p>

It should be noted that this was written about 55 C.E., some 22 years after Jesus returned to heaven. So the truth here stated applies to the relationship between God and Christ in heaven.)</p>
<p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="si"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:15:27-46:15:28" data-bid="28-1" class="b">1 Cor. 15:27, 28</a> <em>RS: </em>“‘God has put all things in subjection under his [Jesus’] feet.’ But when it says, ‘All things are put in subjection under him,’ it is plain that he is excepted who put all things under him.

(Most translations here use the expression “the only true God” with reference to the Father. <em>NE </em>reads “who alone art truly God.” He cannot be “the only true God,” the one “who alone [is] truly God,” if there are two others who are God to the same degree as he is, can he? Any others referred to as “gods” must be either false or merely a reflection of the true God.)</p>

<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="sb">A person who is really seeking to know the truth about God is not going to search the Bible hoping to find a text that he can construe as fitting what he already believes. He wants to know what God’s Word itself says. He may find some texts that he feels can be read in more than one way, but when these are compared with other Biblical statements on the same subject their meaning will become clear. It should be noted at the outset that <em>most of the texts </em>used as “proof” of the Trinity actually mention only two persons, not three; so even if the Trinitarian explanation of the texts were correct, these would not prove that the Bible teaches the Trinity. Consider the following:</p>

<p id="p53" data-pid="53" class="si">The plural form of the noun here in Hebrew is the plural of majesty or excellence. (See <em>NAB, </em>St. Joseph Edition, Bible Dictionary, p. 330; also, <em>New Catholic Encyclopedia, </em>1967, Vol. V, p. 287.) It conveys no thought of plurality of persons within a godhead.

<p id="p54" data-pid="54" class="si">The Greek language does not have a ‘plural of majesty or excellence.’ So, at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:1-1:1:1" data-bid="82-1" class="b">Genesis 1:1</a> the translators of <em>LXX </em>used <em>ho The·osʹ </em>(God, singular) as the equivalent of <em>’Elo·himʹ.</em> At <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:12:29-41:12:29" data-bid="83-1" class="b">Mark 12:29</a>, where a reply of Jesus is reproduced in which he quoted <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:6:4-5:6:4" data-bid="84-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 6:4</a>, the Greek singular <em>ho The·osʹ </em>is similarly used.</p>

<p id="p61" data-pid="61" class="si">Is the rendering “a god” consistent with the rules of Greek grammar? Some reference books argue strongly that the Greek text must be translated, “The Word was God.” But not all agree. In his article “Qualitative Anarthrous Predicate Nouns: <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:15:39-41:15:39" data-bid="93-1" class="b">Mark 15:39 and</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:1:1-43:1:1" data-bid="93-2" class="b"> John 1:1</a>,” Philip B. Harner said that such clauses as the one in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:1:1-43:1:1" data-bid="94-1" class="b">John 1:1</a>, “with an anarthrous predicate preceding the verb, are primarily qualitative in <span id="page417" class="pageNum" data-no="417" data-before-text="417"></span>meaning. They indicate that the <em>logos </em>has the nature of <em>theos.” </em>He suggests: “Perhaps the clause could be translated, ‘the Word had the same nature as God.’” (<em>Journal of Biblical Literature, </em>1973, pp. 85, 87) Thus, in this text, the fact that the word <em>the·osʹ </em>in its second occurrence is without the definite article (<em>ho</em>) and is placed before the verb in the sentence in Greek is significant. Interestingly, translators that insist on rendering <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:1:1-43:1:1" data-bid="95-1" class="b">John 1:1</a>, “The Word was God,” do not hesitate to use the indefinite article (a, an) in their rendering of other passages where a singular anarthrous predicate noun occurs before the verb. Thus at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:6:70-43:6:70" data-bid="96-1" class="b">John 6:70</a>, <em>JB </em>and <em>KJ </em>both refer to Judas Iscariot as “a devil,” and at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:9:17-43:9:17" data-bid="97-1" class="b">John 9:17</a> they describe Jesus as “a prophet.”</p>
<p id="p62" data-pid="62" class="si">John J.

<p id="p63" data-pid="63" class="si">In harmony with the above, <em>AT </em>reads: “the Word was divine”; <em>Mo, </em>“the Logos was divine”; <em>NTIV, </em>“the word was a god.” In his German translation Ludwig Thimme expresses it in this way: “God of a sort the Word was.” Referring to the Word (who became Jesus Christ) as “a god” is consistent with the use of that term in the rest of the Scriptures. For example, at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:82:1-19:82:6" data-bid="99-1" class="b">Psalm 82:1-6</a> human judges in Israel were referred to as “gods” (Hebrew, <em>’elo·himʹ; </em>Greek, <em>the·oiʹ, </em>at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:10:34-43:10:34" data-bid="100-1" class="b">John 10:34</a>) because they were representatives of Jehovah and were to speak his law.</p>

It is scarcely possible that [<em>’Elo·himʹ</em>] in the original can be addressed to the king. The presumption therefore is against the belief that [<em>ho the·osʹ</em>] is a vocative in the LXX. Thus on the whole it seems best to adopt in the first clause the rendering: <em>God is Thy throne </em>(or, <em>Thy throne is God</em>), that is ‘Thy kingdom is founded upon God, the immovable Rock.’”—<em>The Epistle to the Hebrews </em>(London, 1889), pp. 25, 26.</p>

<p id="p107" data-pid="107" class="si">When saying, “I and the Father are one,” did Jesus mean that they were equal? Some Trinitarians say that he did. But at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:21-43:17:22" data-bid="159-1" class="b">John 17:21, 22</a>, Jesus prayed regarding his followers: “That they may all be one,” and he added, “that they may be one even as we are one.” He used the same Greek word (<em>hen</em>) for “one” in all these instances. Obviously, Jesus’ disciples do not all become part of the Trinity. But they do come to share a oneness of purpose with the Father and the Son, the same sort of oneness that unites God and Christ.</p>
<p id="p108" data-pid="108" class="sn"><strong>In what position does belief in the Trinity put those who cling to it?</strong></p>
<p id="p109" data-pid="109" class="sb">It puts them in a very dangerous position. The evidence is indisputable that the dogma of the Trinity is not found in the Bible, nor is it in harmony with what the Bible teaches. (See the preceding pages.) It grossly misrepresents the true God. Yet, Jesus Christ said: “The hour is coming, and now is, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for such the Father seeks to worship him. God is spirit, and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:4:23-43:4:24" data-bid="160-1" class="b">John 4:23, 24</a>, <em>RS</em>) Thus Jesus made it clear that those whose worship is not ‘in truth,’ not in harmony with the truth set out in God’s own Word, are not “true worshipers.” To Jewish religious leaders of the first century, Jesus said: “For the sake of your tradition, you have made void the word of God. You hypocrites! Well did Isaiah prophesy of you, when he said: ‘This people honors me with their lips, but <span id="page425" class="pageNum" data-no="425" data-before-text="425"></span>their heart is far from me; in vain do they worship me, teaching as doctrines the precepts of men.’” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:15:6-40:15:9" data-bid="161-1" class="b">Matt. 15:6-9</a>, <em>RS</em>) That applies with equal force to those in Christendom today who advocate human traditions in preference to the clear truths of the Bible.</p>
<p id="p110" data-pid="110" class="sb">Regarding the Trinity, the Athanasian Creed (in English) says that its members are “incomprehensible.” Teachers of the doctrine often state that it is a “mystery.” Obviously such a Trinitarian God is not the one that Jesus had in mind when he said: “We worship what we know.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:4:22-43:4:22" data-bid="162-1" class="b">John 4:22</a>, <em>RS</em>) Do you really know the God you worship?</p>
<p id="p111" data-pid="111" class="sb">Serious questions confront each one of us: Do we sincerely love the truth? Do we really want an approved relationship with God? Not everyone genuinely loves the truth. Many have put having the approval of their relatives and associates above love of the truth and of God.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:14:28-43:14:28" data-bid="167-1" class="b">John 14:28</a>).’ (3) ‘Then what is the origin of the Trinity doctrine? Notice what well-known encyclopedias say about that. (See <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1101989276/3-8">pages 405, 406</a>.)’</p>
<p id="p115" data-pid="115" class="sb"><strong>Or you could say: </strong>‘No, I do not. You see, there are Bible texts that I could never fit in with that belief. Here is one of them. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:36-40:24:36" data-bid="168-1" class="b">Matt. 24:36</a>) Perhaps you can explain it to me.’ <strong>Then perhaps add: </strong>(1) ‘If the Son is equal to the Father, how is <span id="page426" class="pageNum" data-no="426" data-before-text="426"></span>it that the Father knows things that the Son does not?’ If they answer that this was true only regarding his human nature, then ask: (2) ‘But why does the holy spirit not know?’ (If the person shows a sincere interest in the truth, show him what the Scriptures do say about God. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:83:18-19:83:18" data-bid="169-1" class="b">Ps. 83:18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:4:23-43:4:24" data-bid="169-2" class="b"> John 4:23, 24</a>)’</p>
<p id="p116" data-pid="116" class="sb"><strong>Another possibility: </strong>‘We do believe in Jesus Christ but not in the Trinity. Why? Because we believe what the apostle Peter believed about Christ. Notice what he said . . . (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:16:15-40:16:17" data-bid="170-1" class="b">Matt. 16:15-17</a>).’</p>
<p id="p117" data-pid="117" class="sb"><strong>An additional suggestion: </strong>‘I find that not everyone has the same thing in mind when he refers to the Trinity. Perhaps I could answer your question better if I knew what you mean.’ <strong>Then perhaps add: </strong>‘I appreciate that explanation. But what I believe is only what the Bible teaches. Have you ever seen the word “Trinity” in the Bible? . . . (Refer to the concordance in your Bible.) But is Christ referred to in the Bible? . . . Yes, and we believe in him. Notice here in the concordance under “Christ” one of the references is to <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:16:16-40:16:16" data-bid="171-1" class="b">Matthew 16:16</a>. (Read it.) That is what I believe.’</p>
<p id="p118" data-pid="118" class="sb"><strong>Or you might answer </strong>(if the person draws particular attention to <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:1:1-43:1:1" data-bid="172-1" class="b">John 1:1</a>): ‘I am acquainted with that verse. In some Bible translations it says that Jesus is “God,” and others say that he is “a god.” Why is that?’ (1) ‘Could it be because the next verse says that he was <em>“with </em>God”?’ (2) ‘Might it also be because of what is found here in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:1:18-43:1:18" data-bid="173-1" class="b">John 1:18</a>?’ (3) ‘Have you ever wondered whether Jesus himself worships someone as God?

<p id="p119" data-pid="119" class="sn"><strong>‘Do you believe in the divinity of Christ?’</strong></p>
<p id="p120" data-pid="120" class="sb"><strong>You might reply: </strong>‘Yes, I certainly do. But perhaps I do not have in mind the same thing that you do when you refer to “the divinity of Christ.”’ <strong>Then perhaps add: </strong>(1) ‘Why do I say that? Well, at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:9:6-23:9:6" data-bid="175-1" class="b">Isaiah 9:6</a> Jesus Christ is described as “Mighty God,” but only his Father is ever referred to in the Bible as the <em>Almighty </em>God.’ (2) ‘And notice that at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:3-43:17:3" data-bid="176-1" class="b">John 17:3</a> Jesus speaks of his Father as “the <em>only </em>true God.” So, at most, Jesus is just a reflection of the true God.’ (3) ‘What is required on our part to be pleasing to God? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:4:23-43:4:24" data-bid="177-1" class="b">John 4:23, 24</a>)’</p>

</header>
<div class="openingContent"><p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sa"><strong>Comments: </strong>In determining the kind of introduction to use when you share in the field ministry, three things deserve careful consideration: (1) The message that we are commissioned to deliver is “this good news of the kingdom.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:14-40:24:14" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matt. 24:14</a>) Even when we are not discussing it directly, we should have in mind helping people to see the need for it, or perhaps clearing out of the way obstacles to their being willing to consider it. (2) Genuine concern for the welfare of the people we meet will help us, as it did Jesus, to reach hearts. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:6:34-41:6:34" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Mark 6:34</a>) Such genuine interest may be indicated by a warm smile and a friendly manner, willingness to listen when they speak and then adapting our remarks accordingly, also by our use of questions that encourage them to express themselves so we can better understand their viewpoint. <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:9:19-46:9:23" data-bid="3-1" class="b">First Corinthians 9:19-23</a> shows that the apostle Paul adapted his presentation of the good news to the circumstances of the people to whom he spoke. (3) In some parts of the world, visitors are expected to observe certain formalities before stating the reason they are calling. Elsewhere the householder may expect an uninvited visitor to get to the point quickly.—Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:10:5-42:10:5" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Luke 10:5</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sa">The following introductions show how some experienced Witnesses begin conversations. If the introductions you are now using seldom open the way for conversations, try some of these suggestions. When you do so, you will no doubt want to put them in your own words. Also, you will find it helpful to get suggestions from other Witnesses in your congregation who have good success in approaching people.</p>

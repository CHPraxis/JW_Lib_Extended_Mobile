<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="si"><strong><em>What have researchers learned about dreams?</em></strong></p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="si">“Everyone dreams,” says <em>The World Book Encyclopedia </em>(1984, Vol. 5, p. 279). “Most adults dream for about 100 minutes during eight hours of sleep.” So dreams are a normal human experience.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="si"><span id="page105" class="pageNum" data-no="105" data-before-text="105"></span>Said Dr. Allan Hobson, of Harvard Medical School: “They are ambiguous stimuli which can be interpreted in any way a therapist is predisposed to. But their meaning is in the eye of the beholder—not in the dream itself.” When reporting this, the “Science Times” section of <em>The New York Times </em>added: “Within the school that places great value on dreams, there are many approaches to finding the psychological message of a dream, each reflecting different theoretical outlooks. A Freudian will find one kind of meaning in a dream, while a Jungian will find another, and a Gestalt therapist will find still another meaning. . . . But the view that dreams have psychological meaning at all has come under strong attack from neuroscientists.”—July 10, 1984, p. C12.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="si"><strong><em>Can dreams that seem to impart special knowledge come from a source other than God?</em></strong></p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="si"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:29:8-24:29:9" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Jer. 29:8, 9</a>: “This is what Jehovah of armies . . . has said: ‘Let not your prophets who are in among you and your <em>practicers of divination </em>deceive you, and do not you listen to their dreams that they are dreaming. For “it is in falsehood that they are prophesying to you in my name. I have not sent them,” is the utterance of Jehovah.’”</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="si"><em>Harper’s Bible Dictionary </em>informs us: “Babylonians had such trust in dreams that on the eve of important decisions they slept in temples, hoping for counsel. Greeks desiring health instruction slept in shrines of Aesculapius [whose emblem was a serpent], and Romans in temples of Serapis [at times associated with a coiled serpent]. Egyptians prepared elaborate books for dream interpretation.”—(New York, 1961), Madeleine Miller and J. Lane Miller, p. 141.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="si"><strong><em>In the past, God used dreams to give warnings, instruction, and prophecy, but is he leading his people in that way now?</em></strong></p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="si">References to such dreams originating with God are found at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:2:13-40:2:13" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matthew 2:13,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:2:19-40:2:20" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 19, 20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:3:5-11:3:5" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> 1 Kings 3:5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:40:1-1:40:8" data-bid="3-4" class="b"> Genesis 40:1-8</a>.</p>

<div class="openingContent"><p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sa"><strong>Definition: </strong>The dwelling place of Jehovah God and of faithful spirit creatures; a realm invisible to human eyes. The Bible also uses the term “heaven(s)” in a variety of other senses; for example: to represent God himself, his organization of faithful spirit creatures, a position of divine favor, the physical universe apart from the earth, the expanse surrounding planet Earth, human governments under Satan’s domination, and the righteous new heavenly government in which Jesus Christ with his joint heirs are empowered by Jehovah to rule.</p>

But as for the tree of the knowledge of good and bad you must not eat from it, for in the day you eat from it you will positively die.’” (It was not Jehovah’s original purpose for man someday to die. God’s command here quoted shows that he warned against the course that would lead to death. Death was to be punishment for disobedience, not the doorway to a better life in heaven. Obedience would have been rewarded by continued life, eternal life, in the Paradise that God had given to man.

Comparison of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:2:4-61:2:4" data-bid="13-1" class="b">2 Peter 2:4 and</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/65:1:6-65:1:6" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> Jude 6</a> with <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:6:2-1:6:4" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Genesis 6:2-4</a> shows that these spirits were angelic sons of God that had materialized and married in Noah’s day. At <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:3:19-60:3:20" data-bid="15-1" class="b">1 Peter 3:19, 20</a> the Greek word for “spirits” is <em>pneuʹma·sin, </em>while the word rendered “souls” is <em>psy·khaiʹ. </em>The “spirits” were not disembodied souls but disobedient angels; the “souls” here referred to were living people, humans, Noah and his household. What was preached to “spirits in prison” must therefore have been a message of judgment.)</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="si"><em>What is the meaning of </em><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:4:6-60:4:6" data-bid="16-1" class="b"><em>1 Peter 4:6</em></a><em>? </em>“In fact, for this <span id="page164" class="pageNum" data-no="164" data-before-text="164"></span>purpose the good news was declared also to the dead, that they might be judged as to the flesh from the standpoint of men but might live as to the spirit from the standpoint of God.” (Were these “dead” the people who had died prior to the death of Christ? As already shown, the dead are not “the spirits in prison.” Those spirits were disobedient angels. And preaching would not have benefited physically dead humans because, as <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:9:5-21:9:5" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 9:5</a> says, they “are conscious of nothing at all,” and <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:146:4-19:146:4" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Psalm 146:4</a> adds that at death a person’s “thoughts do perish.” But <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:2:1-49:2:7" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Ephesians 2:1-7,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:2:17-49:2:17" data-bid="19-2" class="b"> 17</a> does refer to persons who were spiritually dead and who came to life spiritually as a result of accepting the good news.)</p>

Otherwise, I would have told you, because I am going my way to prepare a place for you. Also, if I go my way and prepare a place for you, I am coming again and will receive you home to myself, that where I am you also may be.” (Jesus here shows that his faithful apostles, to whom he was speaking, would, in time, be in his Father’s “house,” in heaven, with Jesus. But he does not here say how many others would also go to heaven.)</p>

As many of them as did receive him when he came to them in the first century became God’s children, with heavenly life in view.

But this had not always been true. <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:1:15-42:1:15" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Luke 1:15</a> says that John the Baptizer would be filled with holy spirit, but <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:11:11-40:11:11" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Matthew 11:11</a> makes clear that he will not share in the glory of the heavenly Kingdom.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">PEOPLE view the Bible’s Ten Commandments in various ways. Seventh-Day Adventists say that the Ten Commandments are binding on all people. Lutherans consider them the “best set of rules ever given upon which an individual can structure his life.” “Rightly understood,” explains a Catholic spokesman, “the Ten Commandments still provide a basis for Christian living.”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Thus, while some religious groups believe that we should obey the Ten Commandments to the letter, others consider them merely a guide for sound moral behavior. Indeed, according to the <em>Encyclopædia of Religion and Ethics, </em>“there is probably no human document which has exercised a greater influence upon religious and moral life than the Decalogue [Ten Commandments].” Why is this the case? Consider first what they say. They are brief, comprehensive, and forceful. But how should you view the Ten Commandments? What do they mean to you?</p>

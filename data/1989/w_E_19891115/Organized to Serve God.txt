Organized to Serve God
“I have gone through different religions and religious sects,” writes a man from Mexico. “But I have never seen such organization.” The man had just finished reading the brochure Jehovah’s Witnesses Unitedly Doing God’s Will Worldwide. He explained: “What impresses me the most is the seriousness with which you fulfill the commission to preach the good news of the Kingdom from house to house, at work, on the street, in buses. It is marvelous to find people who take the doing of God’s will seriously in this age of so much religious hypocrisy.”

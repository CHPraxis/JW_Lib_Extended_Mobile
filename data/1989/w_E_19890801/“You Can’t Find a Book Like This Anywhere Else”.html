<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">That is what a schoolteacher in Ohio, U.S.A., said on receiving the book <em>“All Scripture Is Inspired of God and Beneficial.” </em>A high school senior had presented it to the teacher because the teacher had asked for some information about Jehovah’s Witnesses, and the student knew that she taught Bible classes. The youth describes his teacher’s response on accepting the book:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“She was thrilled. She said she had been looking for a book like that. She thanked me very much. The next day she was even more thrilled. She gave me a thank-you note and said that the book was excellent. ‘You can’t find a book like this anywhere else!’ she said. ‘Everything is so well organized. I am sure this will prove valuable in my classes.’”</p>

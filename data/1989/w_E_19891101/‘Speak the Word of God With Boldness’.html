<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">JEHOVAH God can empower his servants to ‘speak the Word of God with boldness.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:4:31-44:4:31" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Acts 4:31</a>) Even those young in the ways of Bible truth and inexperienced in the evangelizing activity need not hesitate to speak the good news boldly. In Côte d’Ivoire, two publishers of the good news were engaged in the door-to-door ministry when they met a university professor. The younger Witness, Seriki, feeling unqualified to speak to such an educated man, let the other Witness do the talking.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The professor was troubled by racial prejudice and blamed God for the racial problems that exist, feeling that he was the one who created the different races. After a lengthy discussion that seemed to go nowhere, Seriki finally mustered up courage to speak, and he politely interrupted the conversation. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/52:2:2-52:2:2" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Thessalonians 2:2</a>) Noticing that the professor’s house was decorated with a tasteful choice of colors, Seriki asked the professor, “Why didn’t you make your whole house the same color?”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“You must think that I’m crazy!” retorted the professor. Seriki replied: “No, but why should we expect God to make everything and everybody the same color?” The point was clear. That simple illustration proved effective, and a good witness was given by the once timid Seriki.</p>

“Publication by Jehovah’s Witnesses Worth Reading”
This was the title of an article appearing on December 23, 1988, in the Creston News Advertiser, of Iowa, U.S.A. “Philosophy and religion interest me,” observes staff writer Randy Porter, “but the publications also have semi-secular stories about an amazing variety of world issues. . . .
“Furthermore, some may be surprised to learn the magazines often quote other authoritative sources, other than the Bible. . . .
“Incidentally, the January [22nd] edition also features a short story and color photograph of the state rock of Iowa, the geode. The article says people are like geodes. Rather plain-looking on the outside, when opened up geodes reveal a dazzling, crystallized inner beauty. A person, too, may be plain-looking on the outside, and even quiet and shy; however, when a person takes ‘the time to get acquainted, they open up and show you an inner beauty that glows.’ . . .
“January’s [22nd] issue contained numerous other articles that probably wouldn’t have crossed my desk, too! For example, most persons have heard about African killer bees, but one article told how entomologists are ‘bugging’ the bees. Designed by American engineers, a microprocessor device small enough to attach to the back of a bee will enable scientists to monitor the bees’ movements from one to two kilometers.”

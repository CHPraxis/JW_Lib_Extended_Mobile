<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn">□ IN ICY Greenland some publishers on a preaching tour met a young Norwegian who accepted the book <em>Life​—How Did It Get Here? By Evolution or by Creation? </em>However, he did not show much interest. On their next visit to this faraway place, he told them that he had read the book several times and wanted more books. A number of books and brochures were left with him. He was sad to learn that the publishers could not return for another year but obtained the address of the Witnesses. One month later, to their surprise, he knocked on their door. He related that he had fallen through the ice with his snow scooter on his way to his boat, and then it had taken him six hours’ sailing to reach the Witnesses. He wanted to obtain more literature and to discuss the truth. He attended the meeting that evening and made plans to attend once a month. He came for the circuit overseer’s visit and was greatly encouraged. He has withdrawn from the church and is now preaching the good news in his area. When the ice in winter prevents him from getting to the meetings by boat, he takes a helicopter, which costs him $150 a trip.</p>

<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn">□ Many people are responding to the good news in Madagascar. With just over 3,200 Kingdom publishers, 16,205 attended the Memorial of Christ’s death. The brothers are making great efforts to reach all persons on the island.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">For example, 17 of the 30 publishers of the Isaonjo Congregation decided to witness in a territory many miles <strong>[50 km] </strong>away. They left their village half an hour past midnight. For two hours they walked on steeply sloped pathways and through muddy marshes. Then they entered the tropical forest at 2:30 a.m. Because darkness covered the forest, some brothers fell over crags. Some stumbled into pools of water in hollow rocks. The forest contained leeches, and many insects bit them. Most of the sisters suffered in this way. The mud was knee deep at times. All 17 publishers got injured in one way or another, but they finally emerged from the forest at 6:30 a.m.!</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Field service began at 6:45 a.m. Most of the people received the publishers kindly. One that did not at first was the wife of a Protestant religious leader. She said: “I have my own religion; that’s enough for me. I know all that the Bible tells.” As soon as the publisher took out a <em>Watchtower </em>magazine, the woman haughtily refused it, saying: “I already have many other things to read.” But she began to ask questions: “Who are you, and from where, and who sent you?” After they answered with mildness and related briefly all the effort they made to reach her village, the lady accepted <em>The Watchtower, </em>saying: “I’ll buy it. Who knows if you are sent by God?”</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">At 1:30 p.m., the 17 left the territory for home, making the trip in less than four hours because it was still day. They were tired but safe, and their faces radiated joy. They said: “It was an unforgettable day for the 17 of us from the Isaonjo Congregation.”</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Certainly, Jehovah’s spirit is moving his dedicated servants to preach the good news of the Kingdom “to the most distant part of the earth,” and many are responding to the Witnesses’ fine efforts.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:1:8-44:1:8" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Acts 1:8</a>.</p>

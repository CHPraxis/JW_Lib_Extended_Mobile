Where the Devil Came From
“My duties are mainly to keep the kids in their seat belts and to keep them quiet,” explains a young woman who works part-time as a school-bus monitor in South Dakota. She relates:
“One of the boys gives me an especially hard time. Mind you, he’s only six years old, yet his mouth at times can make a sailor blush. I have had to put him bodily in his seat and to sit with my hand over his mouth to keep him quiet. He has kicked, scratched, pinched, cursed, and screamed. On a bad day, he requires being sat on to keep him in his seat.
“Friday was a bad day, and about the time I was numb from the shoulders down, he asked: ‘Why did God make the Devil?’ There was a copy of My Book of Bible Stories on the bus. I told him that this book would help him to see where the Devil came from. Would you believe that we have gone through 41 stories together? I had just about given up on this kid, but his attitude has changed to the point that he doesn’t want to leave the bus when we get to school. He wants to go through more stories!”

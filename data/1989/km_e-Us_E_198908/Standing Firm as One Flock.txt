Standing Firm as One Flock
1 The special assembly day for the 1990 service year will have as its theme “Standing Firm as One Flock.” This theme is based on Philippians 1:27. The morning program will include information on the need to stand firm, provisions to help us to stand firm, examples of standing firm, and how we can guard against weakening influences. There will be arrangements for baptism at the end of the morning session. Any who are contemplating baptism should let the presiding overseer know well in advance so that arrangements can be made to go over the questions in Organized to Accomplish Our Ministry.
2 In the afternoon there will be a Watchtower summary followed by encouragement to be positive in the ministry, instruction on helping others in the ministry, and practical counsel to help us stand firm in one spirit. Now of all times, it is necessary to stand firm as one flock before Jehovah. Our united stand for true worship protects us from the divisive forces that pervade Satan’s world, and it puts us in a strong position to help others join us in true worship.
3 The program will be spiritually upbuilding, and all of us will want to make arrangements to be present for the entire day. Your circuit overseer will notify you when you are scheduled to have your special assembly day program, if he has not done so already.

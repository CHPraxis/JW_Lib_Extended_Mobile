<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>In anticipation of the start of the new service year in September, it is good for all interested in Kingdom service to consider what we have accomplished up to now and what we desire to accomplish in the year ahead. As the apostle Paul said: “To what extent we have made progress, let us go on walking orderly in this same routine.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:3:16-50:3:16" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Phil. 3:16</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>September means the end of the vacation season for many of school age. So why not take advantage of the first weekend to work with the pioneers in your congregation and get a good start in the service for the new service year? Some youths have made it their goal to witness to more of their fellow students and try to start a Bible study. Or for those of you who are parents and whose children will be going to school, might this be a good month for you to enjoy auxiliary pioneer work again? You will have an extra Saturday in the month to help you meet the requirements.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>For young publishers, the school year often brings homework. Will you schedule time for theocratic study as well as your homework? It will help you qualify for a career in full-time service and assist you in staying on the road to life. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:30:21-23:30:21" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Isa. 30:21</a>) Sometimes we feel we are too busy to do any more. But valuable time can be lost watching television. Why not use that time for priority matters of a theocratic nature?​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:4:15-54:4:15" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Tim. 4:15</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>Do not let the hours or months slip by you like clouds in the sky, but, rather, plan your time and set goals to use your life in a way that will bring honor to Jehovah.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:11:4-21:11:4" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Eccl. 11:4</a>.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Meet Africa’s white-fronted bee-eater, a bird that catches insects, including bees, while on the wing. This colorful little creature is also known for its selfless traits. Instead of nesting in a tree, it digs in a sandbank and makes a nest chamber at the end of a long tunnel, where the female lays her eggs. When these hatch, other bee-eaters cooperate, assisting the parents in providing food for the chicks. These willing helpers are often youngsters from a previous brood, but they also include birds who are unrelated. When food is scarce, as in times of drought, the number of assistant bee-eaters has been observed to increase.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“Even in the non-breeding season,” state Sinclair and Mendelsohn in the book <em>Everyone’s Guide to South African Birds, </em>“this species usually associates in small groups, and at night, large numbers may roost communally in trees”​—which is one more proof that ‘birds of a feather do flock together.’</p>

Why You Should Attend the “Godly Devotion” District Convention
A rewarding three days of Bible instruction await you at the “Godly Devotion” District Convention of Jehovah’s Witnesses beginning this month. By means of instructive discourses and interviews and a drama, vital Bible guidance will be provided. Be present at 10:20 Friday morning when the convention begins with a musical presentation.
Friday morning’s program will feature the talk “Avoiding Lips of Hurtfulness” and an important discourse on the origin of the Trinity doctrine. In the afternoon, parents will be admonished to accept their moral responsibility to provide their children a spiritual heritage. Next, youths will be encouraged to make Christ their model and to make the truth their own. The day’s program will conclude with the discussion of a grand provision that is being made particularly to assist youths.
Saturday will be another full day of instruction that will feature the baptism in the morning and in the afternoon noteworthy talks about the Christian Governing Body and how we can cooperate with it today. The afternoon sessions will conclude with the important talk “The Bible​—God’s Word or Man’s?”
Sunday morning, timely instruction will warn against “the man of lawlessness” and against going astray in matters of food and drink, grooming, and recreation. (2 Thessalonians 2:3) This will be followed by a modern-day drama stressing the importance of subjecting ourselves to God. Then, you will not want to miss the public talk, “Deliverance Near for People of Godly Devotion!”
During June, July, and August, more than 130 conventions are scheduled throughout the United States alone, so there will be one not far from your home. Check with Jehovah’s Witnesses locally for the time and place of the one nearest you.

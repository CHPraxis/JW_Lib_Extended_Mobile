Revelation​—Its Grand Climax At Hand!
“This publication [with the above title] shows in a marvelous way the deep love and concern that our Creator has for all his people,” writes an appreciative reader from Washington State. “It surely is faith strengthening and invigorating to read each word.”
The appreciative reader adds: “The format of each chapter is fantastic. I appreciate the boldface type of the verses being discussed, as well as the beautiful illustrations and charts. I cannot describe the feeling that is drawn up from inside me as I read. Many times it brought tears to my eyes.”
We feel that you too will be thrilled by the clear, logical identification of the beasts, the dragon, the great harlot, and the other symbolic characters of Revelation. You will see the meaning for our day. This fascinating hardbound book, the same page size as this magazine, presents a verse-by-verse consideration of the entire Bible book of Revelation.

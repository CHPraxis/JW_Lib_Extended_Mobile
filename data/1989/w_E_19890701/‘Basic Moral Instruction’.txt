‘Basic Moral Instruction’
A 14-year-old girl from Nigeria, West Africa, is grateful to receive such instruction from the book Your Youth​—Getting the Best out of It. She writes:
“This book is a most helpful, truthful, marvelous and delightful masterpiece. It will surely be of immense assistance to anyone who is inclined to be guided amicably through all those prevailing sinful oddities in life.
“I have introduced this book to my schoolmates and neighbours. Everyone who reads it commends your profound ‘knowledge-building’ illustrations and the topics discussed in the book. We opine that the facts portrayed in the book would not only enlighten or impart wisdom and requisite modest behavioural principles, but could provide positive guidelines to youths and adults who aspire to enjoy true peace of mind and health, and who would exercise self-control and show strength for what is right. . . .
“To crown it all, this book is so comprehensive and overstuffed with basic sexual moral instruction that may not be derived from most parents or teachers . . . How I wish that the book would be introduced to schools for daily class lessons, with a view to establishing a more peaceful, lovable, fruitful and meaningful life-style.”
Your Youth​—Getting the Best out of It answers such questions as, Why should youths study in school? How should they view their parents? Should they have sex relations before marriage? Should they drink alcoholic beverages? Receive a copy for only $1 by filling in and mailing the coupon.

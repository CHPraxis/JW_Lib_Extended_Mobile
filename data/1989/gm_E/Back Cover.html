<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">THE MODERN WORLD has too many problems. Marriages break up. Family violence is widespread. Hundreds of millions go hungry. Crime runs rampant. Peace and security are elusive. Why is the world like this? Are there any solutions? The Bible not only offers an answer to these questions but it provides guidance in everyday living as well. Should we not, then, be interested in what the Bible says?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Some people maintain that the Bible is little more than a collection of myths, legends, and folk wisdom. Others, though, hold that the Bible is the inspired Word of God. Which viewpoint is correct? This book, <em>The Bible​—God’s Word or Man’s?, </em>will help you to answer that question. We invite you to consider the facts for yourself. Doing so may well change your life forever.</p>

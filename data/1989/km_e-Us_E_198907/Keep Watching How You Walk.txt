Keep Watching How You Walk
1 The new circuit assembly program for the 1990 service year will begin in September. It will stress the importance of watching how we walk, pursuing the things that make for peace, and avoiding the many pitfalls put in our path by Satan and his hordes, both spirit and human.
2 Walking in the pathway of righteousness is not becoming easier in these last days. Therefore, the two-day circuit assembly program will provide encouragement and practical counsel to help Jehovah’s people maintain their spiritual balance and prove to be integrity keepers.
3 The assembly theme, “Keep Watching How You Walk,” based on Ephesians 5:15, 16, is most appropriate for the development and presentation of the prepared material. Instruction will be given by means of talks, demonstrations, experiences, interviews, and skits. On Saturday there will be opportunity for newly dedicated ones to get baptized. Therefore, those planning to be baptized at the circuit assembly should let the presiding overseer know well in advance so that arrangements can be made for going over the preliminary questions.
4 A highlight of the circuit assembly is the public talk given by the district overseer. The subject of his talk will be “Light Bearers in a Dark World.” This Bible discussion will contain vital information for newly interested people, and it will be encouraging to those who are already serving as ministers of the good news.​—Matt. 24:14.
5 Your circuit overseer will let you know when and where your circuit assembly will be held. Make definite plans to attend all the sessions on both days. We cannot afford to miss any part of the program. Jehovah will reward your endeavors by helping you to keep watching how you walk.

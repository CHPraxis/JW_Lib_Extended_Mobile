804,518 Total Publishers for April​—A New Peak!
Exceptional Number of 120,979 Auxiliary Pioneers!
Jehovah’s people have shown that they are ‘hearing’ and ‘observing’ what is written in the prophecy of Revelation. (Rev. 1:3) Their zealous efforts in helping others see the urgency of our times are evident in the all-time peaks experienced in April 1989. What are some of these peaks?
Total Publishers: 804,518. This is almost 24,000 more than we had in April 1988 and 7,414 more than our previous peak in August 1988.
Total Hours: 18,673,721. How encouraging that nearly 1,700,000 more hours were devoted to Kingdom activity than in April of last year!
Return Visits: 5,767,946. An increase of 5.5 percent or 302,130 more return visits than in April 1987, which was the month of our previous peak.
Home Bible Studies: 573,244. This is 3,150 more than we had last April our previous all-time peak month.
Auxiliary Pioneers: 120,979. What an outstanding peak, reflecting the efforts being put forth to herald the Kingdom hope! This is a 20-percent increase over our previous peak.
We are confident that Jehovah and his Son, Christ Jesus, are pleased as we extend ourselves in Kingdom service during “the Lord’s day.’ (Rev. 1:10) May we help thousands more to become part of the “great crowd” as the increase continues in these momentous days.​—Rev. 7:9.

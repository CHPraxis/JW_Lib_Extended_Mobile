“I Would Happily Pick ‘Awake!’”
So wrote Frank Senge in Papua New Guinea’s Post-Courier. In his weekly column of July 19, 1988, Senge explained:
“[Awake!] magazine’s contents page explains that it is published for the ‘enlightenment of the entire family.’
“‘It shows how to cope with today’s problems,’ it says.
“And it does. Unlike many other church newsletters or magazines, Awake! explains God through the worldly problems surrounding us. . . .
“This may seem like religious propaganda (I am not a [Witness]) . . . but if we were to judge magazines, for the family, I would happily pick Awake!”
We feel that you too will enjoy Awake! It has an average printing of 11,250,000 copies per issue and is published in 54 languages.
Please send a year’s subscription for Awake! I enclose $5 (U.S.) for 24 issues of this magazine (2 copies a month).

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">So wrote Frank Senge in Papua New Guinea’s <em>Post-Courier. </em>In his weekly column of July 19, 1988, Senge explained:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“[<em>Awake!</em>] magazine’s contents page explains that it is published for the ‘enlightenment of the entire family.’</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“‘It shows how to cope with today’s problems,’ it says.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">“And it does. Unlike many other church newsletters or magazines, <em>Awake! </em>explains God through the worldly problems surrounding us. . . .</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">“This may seem like religious propaganda (I am not a [Witness]) . . . but if we were to judge magazines, for the family, I would happily pick <em>Awake!”</em></p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">We feel that you too will enjoy <em>Awake! </em>It has an average printing of 11,250,000 copies per issue and is published in 54 languages.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Please send a year’s subscription for <em>Awake! </em>I enclose $5 (U.S.) for 24 issues of this magazine (2 copies a month).</p>

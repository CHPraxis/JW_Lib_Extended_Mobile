Sweet Treats From Trees
The North American Indians were the first to show the white men how to do it​—get sweet treats from trees. The Indians taught the early European settlers in Canada the art of making a sweet syrup from the sap of maple trees. But it was not until the year 1706 that the first authentic record of Canadian maple syrup and sugar production began. Now it is a multimillion-dollar industry for Canada.
Here are two sweet treats you may want to try:
MAPLE FUDGE
2 cups maple syrup
1 cup plain or crunchy peanut butter
1 teaspoon vanilla
Heat maple syrup to 234° F. (112° C.) until a drop will form a soft ball in cold water. When lukewarm, add peanut butter and vanilla. Beat until it starts to set, then pour quickly into a pan. When cool, cut into squares.
MAPLE PUDDING
2/3 cup uncooked rice
Pinch of nutmeg
2 eggs, slightly beaten
1/4 teaspoon salt
2/3 cup maple syrup
1/2 cup seedless raisins
1 1/2 cups milk
Cook rice in boiling salted water until tender; drain thoroughly. Combine eggs and maple syrup and blend well. Stir in milk, nutmeg, and salt, then rice and raisins. Place ingredients in a buttered casserole and bake in a moderate oven, 350° F. (177° C.) until set (60-70 minutes). Makes 6 to 8 servings.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">The North American Indians were the first to show the white men how to do it​—get sweet treats from trees. The Indians taught the early European settlers in Canada the art of making a sweet syrup from the sap of maple trees. But it was not until the year 1706 that the first authentic record of Canadian maple syrup and sugar production began. Now it is a multimillion-dollar industry for Canada.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">“The human brain is a whole universe inside the skull. It is the only human organ that has practically unlimited possibilities,” stated Soviet scientist and brain specialist Natalya Bekhtereva.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">For those possibilities to be explored, the brain has to be used and exercised. And the most vital study to which man can apply his mind is that of the brain’s Designer, Jehovah God.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Thus the wise proverb writer stated: “If you keep seeking for it [wisdom] as for silver, and as for hid treasures you keep searching for it, in that case you will understand the fear of Jehovah, and you will find the very knowledge of God.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:2:1-20:2:5" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Proverbs 2:1-5</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Do you use your brain to find that precious “knowledge of God”?</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">That is the title of a new book that discusses in detail the entire Bible book of Revelation. An enthusiastic reader from California writes:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“I love it! I particularly like its format. The scriptures being in bold, dark print, and the clear, crisp, understandable explanation given of <em>each </em>scripture. It makes for easy reading. I also appreciate the chapters being short. The charts and illustrations help further.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“Just think, as a housewife I can sit down and read with understanding the deep things of God. Because you took the time and care to simplify this material, we can all grow closer to our God.”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">You will be thrilled by the clear, logical identification of the beasts, the dragon, the great harlot, and the other symbolic characters of Revelation. You will see the meaning for our day. This fascinating hardbound book, the same page size as this magazine, presents a verse-by-verse consideration of Revelation. Send for it today.

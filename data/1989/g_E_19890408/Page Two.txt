The Holocaust​—that word evokes memories of the systematic slaughter of millions of Jews under Hitler’s Nazi regime in Germany from 1933 to 1945. But it also raises many questions:
Did it really happen?
Should the Holocaust be considered only a Jewish tragedy?
Why air this subject again, more than 40 years after the end of World War II?
Were there any conscientious objectors to Hitler’s policies?
Why did God allow the Holocaust to happen?
What hope is there for the millions who were murdered or who were worked or starved to death during that dark age? Is their death the last word for them, or will they live again?
Our opening series will consider these questions.

Hitler Could Not Stop Them!
When Hitler ordered the stamping out of Jehovah’s Witnesses, a great persecution erupted in Austria. Many were imprisoned, others were hounded by the Gestapo, some were killed. Read the thrilling accounts about the integrity keeping of Christians during this momentous period of history. Send for your copy of the 1989 Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
Included also in the Yearbook are historic accounts of the activity of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Barbados and Ecuador, as well as an up-to-date report of their work worldwide.
Please send, postpaid, the 1989 Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses. I enclose $1 (U.S.).

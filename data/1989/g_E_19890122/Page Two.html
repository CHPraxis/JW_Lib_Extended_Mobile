<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">PEOPLE ARE BECOMING ever more aware of the polluting of the earth. Scientists warn of the consequences. Acid rain killing forests and fish, spray cans punching holes in the ozone layer, toxic chemicals poisoning the soil, garbage dumping and oil spills damaging the oceans, fossil fuels turning earth into a greenhouse​—the many books on the subject have failed to document all the damage done. What most people are not aware of is the initial cause of the pollution​—the breakdown of morals. It has happened before. “The land suffers for the sins of its people. The earth languishes, the crops wither, the skies refuse their rain. The land is defiled by crime; the people have twisted the laws of God and broken his everlasting commands.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:24:4-23:24:5" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Isaiah 24:4, 5</a>, <em>The Living Bible.</em></p>

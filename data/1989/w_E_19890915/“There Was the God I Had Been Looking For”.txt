“There Was the God I Had Been Looking For”
Where? What was the person talking about?
The story goes back to when a gift was made of the book Life​—How Did It Get Here? By Evolution or by Creation? The book was given to a retired archaeology lecturer living in Spain. Later, when the person who had given the gift was visiting Spain, this retired lecturer observed: “By the way, Edwin, thank you for sending that book. I read it but then gave it away to a young Spanish lad.”
The young Spaniard was a drug user, with a beard and long hair. However, after the young man received the book, there was a remarkable transformation in the lad. He shaved off his beard, cut his hair, and stopped using drugs. Learning this, Edwin was eager to meet him.
When they met and the young lad learned where the book had come from, he embraced Edwin and said: “For five years I have been looking for God, and when I opened that book, there was the God I had been looking for.” The lad had progressed to the point of sharing his newfound faith with others.

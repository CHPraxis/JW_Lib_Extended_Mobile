<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Where? What was the person talking about?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The story goes back to when a gift was made of the book <em>Life​—How Did It Get Here? By Evolution or by Creation? </em>The book was given to a retired archaeology lecturer living in Spain. Later, when the person who had given the gift was visiting Spain, this retired lecturer observed: “By the way, Edwin, thank you for sending that book. I read it but then gave it away to a young Spanish lad.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The young Spaniard was a drug user, with a beard and long hair. However, after the young man received the book, there was a remarkable transformation in the lad. He shaved off his beard, cut his hair, and stopped using drugs. Learning this, Edwin was eager to meet him.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">When they met and the young lad learned where the book had come from, he embraced Edwin and said: “For five years I have been looking for God, and when I opened that book, there was the God I had been looking for.” The lad had progressed to the point of sharing his newfound faith with others.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">“Thank you for your publications the <em>Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>volumes,” writes a 13-year-old from New Zealand. She explains:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“My teacher asked the class to do research on any disaster and then put it into booklet form. I chose to study about the <em>Titanic. </em>I looked for books at school but couldn’t find anything suitable. So I looked in the <em>Awake! </em>volume for ’81. I read the whole article about the <em>Titanic, </em>and then in my own words, I put it in booklet form. When my teacher had marked all the assignments, he showed mine to the class. I got the highest mark.” The youth concludes: “Anytime I have an assignment, I will use your publications.”</p>

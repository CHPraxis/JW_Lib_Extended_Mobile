“The Wide and Easy Way”
“If only people rose to the occasion, if only they were not overwhelmed by their softness and apathy, if only they overcame their greed, if only they were morally strong, if only they were not selfish and narrow, if only they were not petty and spiteful and stupid, if only they were big, if only they knew what was at stake, if only they were not hypocritical, if only they trampled underfoot the wide and easy way.”​—Charles Malik, a former president of the UN General Assembly.
“If only they knew what was at stake,” Malik said. Over 19 centuries ago, Christ Jesus spoke of a ‘broad and spacious way’ and of a ‘narrow and cramped way,’ and he told what was at stake: “Go in through the narrow gate; because broad and spacious is the road leading off into destruction, and many are the ones going in through it; whereas narrow is the gate and cramped the road leading off into life, and few are the ones finding it.”​—Matthew 7:13, 14.
The broad and spacious way is a dead end; the narrow and cramped way widens out and is endless.

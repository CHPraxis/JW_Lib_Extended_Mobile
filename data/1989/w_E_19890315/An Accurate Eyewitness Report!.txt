An Accurate Eyewitness Report!
A recently published Ugaritic text (KTU 1.161) confirms the reliability of 2 Kings 10:19, 20. To destroy the Baal worshipers, King Jehu commanded: “Sanctify a solemn assembly for Baal.” (A false god, possibly represented by the statuette at the left.) According to Vetus Testamentum, a magazine published in the Netherlands, this expression is “genuine Canaanite” and means “‘a closed circle’: any outsider could be punished with a curse.” “We now perceive that the author of the passage in 2 Kings apparently betrays good knowledge of Canaanite religious terminology,” comments Vetus Testamentum.

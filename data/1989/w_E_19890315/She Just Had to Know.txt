She Just Had to Know
A 15-year-old girl from Mobile, Alabama, writes: “When you put out the book Revelation​—Its Grand Climax At Hand! I knew I would read it sooner or later.
“One night when I wasn’t sleeping very well, I picked up the book and just looked at the pictures. On pages 75, 78, and 86, I found pictures that fascinated me. I didn’t know what they meant, and I just had to know. I couldn’t very well start in the middle because then nothing else would make sense. So that very night I read the first chapter.
“The next night I read the next chapter and found I just didn’t want to put it down. So I went ahead and read the next one also.
“This is one of the most fascinating books I’ve ever read! Now I have a regular habit of reading at least one chapter a night. Sometimes I’ve stayed up till one o’clock in the morning just reading! . . . I wish that all young people would read this book.”

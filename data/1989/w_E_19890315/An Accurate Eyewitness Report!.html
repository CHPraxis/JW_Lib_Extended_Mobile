<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A recently published Ugaritic text (<em>KTU </em>1.161) confirms the reliability of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:10:19-12:10:20" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Kings 10:19, 20</a>. To destroy the Baal worshipers, King Jehu commanded: “Sanctify a solemn assembly for Baal.” (A false god, possibly represented by the statuette at the left.) According to <em>Vetus Testamentum, </em>a magazine published in the Netherlands, this expression is “genuine Canaanite” and means “‘a closed circle’: any outsider could be punished with a curse.” “We now perceive that the author of the passage in 2 Kings apparently betrays good knowledge of Canaanite religious terminology,” comments <em>Vetus Testamentum.</em></p>

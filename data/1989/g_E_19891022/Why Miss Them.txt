Why Miss Them?
While standing in line in a New York City bank, a middle-aged woman noted that the man in front of her was reading the Watchtower magazine. She was quite anxious to read the article in it on prayer, so she took note of the issue date.
A few days later, Jehovah’s Witnesses called at her home, and she asked: “Do you have the July issues of The Watchtower?” After learning why she was interested in a particular magazine, one of the Witnesses noted: “The best way not to miss any interesting issues is to subscribe.”
“I didn’t know you could!” the woman exclaimed. When told the year’s subscription was $5, she answered: “Are you sure? Only $5 for the whole year?” When assured that it was, she wanted not only The Watchtower but its companion magazine, Awake!, as well. “Are you sure I can get both magazines for just $10?” she asked again.
The woman was pleased to have the Witness subscribe for her. You too can have the Watchtower and Awake! magazines delivered to your home. Send only $10, and you will receive both these magazines (four copies a month) for one year.
Please send a year’s subscription for The Watchtower and Awake! I enclose $10 (U.S.). (Outside the U.S.A., write to local Watch Tower branch for information.)

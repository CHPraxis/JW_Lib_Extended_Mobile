An Event to Remember!
IT was Nisan 14 of the year 33 C.E.
Jesus was sharing a cup of wine and a loaf of unleavened bread with his apostles. His instruction? “Keep doing this in remembrance of me.”​—Luke 22:19.
So once a year, Jehovah’s Witnesses around the world gather to memorialize Jesus’ death in the way he instructed on the night he made that statement. This year, Nisan 14 begins on Wednesday, March 22, at sundown. You are cordially invited to join us in this remembrance meeting on that Wednesday evening. Please check with Jehovah’s Witnesses locally for the exact time and place of the meeting.

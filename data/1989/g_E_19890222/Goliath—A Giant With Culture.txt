Goliath​—A Giant With Culture?
WHO has not heard the historical account of young David’s encounter with the Philistine giant Goliath? (1 Samuel 17:23-51) According to Bible chronology, this fight occurred about the year 1100 B.C.E. But what can be said of Philistine culture in those days?
During the past seven years, excavations of what is believed to be ancient Ekron, a major Philistine city in David’s day, have revealed that the Philistines were master builders with advanced notions of city planning. Last summer, for example, a 2,300-square-foot [210 sq m] complex was unearthed. It is the largest building known from the period of Philistine prominence (from the 12th to the 10th century B.C.E.). Excavation of the 50-acre [20 ha] site revealed a method of terracing the city in a stepped-down fashion to utilize natural water runoff. Archaeologist Seymour Gitin marveled: “It was a highly sophisticated way of building.”
Excavations also produced large quantities of exquisite pottery decorated with birds, fish, and geometric designs. Also discovered were four-horned religious altars, storage jars possibly for olive oil, and metal implements. All these items demonstrate the skill and the advanced culture of the ancient Philistines. Gitin noted: “The Philistines . . . introduced a new culture in this part of the world. Eventually they became a great trading power and a powerful industrial nation.”

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">WHO has not heard the historical account of young David’s encounter with the Philistine giant Goliath? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:17:23-9:17:51" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Samuel 17:23-51</a>) According to Bible chronology, this fight occurred about the year 1100 B.C.E. But what can be said of Philistine culture in those days?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">During the past seven years, excavations of what is believed to be ancient Ekron, a major Philistine city in David’s day, have revealed that the Philistines were master builders with advanced notions of city planning. Last summer, for example, a 2,300-square-foot <strong>[210 sq m] </strong>complex was unearthed. It is the largest building known from the period of Philistine prominence (from the 12th to the 10th century B.C.E.). Excavation of the 50-acre <strong>[20 ha] </strong>site revealed a method of terracing the city in a stepped-down fashion to utilize natural water runoff. Archaeologist Seymour Gitin marveled: “It was a highly sophisticated way of building.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Excavations also produced large quantities of exquisite pottery decorated with birds, fish, and geometric designs. Also discovered were four-horned religious altars, storage jars possibly for olive oil, and metal implements. All these items demonstrate the skill and the advanced culture of the ancient Philistines. Gitin noted: “The Philistines . . . introduced a new culture in this part of the world. Eventually they became a great trading power and a powerful industrial nation.”</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">There is a worldwide love affair with parks. Millions flock to them each year. Since Yellowstone (seen here) became the worldâ€™s first national park in 1872, over a hundred countries have established some 2,000 protected areas, for example, Glacier National Park in the United States (seen on the cover).</p>

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><em>Fiordland National Park</em>, the largest in New Zealand, was created in 1904. It features a spectacular seacoast, high mountains, lakes, rivers, waterfalls, forests, and glaciers. Discovered here in 1948 was the flightless takahe, which was thought to be extinct.</p>

<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><em>Nairobi National Park </em>is situated at the gate of the nation’s capital, only a few minutes’ drive from Nairobi’s city center. It offers views of buffalo, zebras, giraffes, wildebeests, ostriches, rhinoceroses, and sleeping lions, which are undisturbed by the presence of visitors.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="ss"><strong>U.S.A./​</strong><strong>CANADA</strong></p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><em>Waterton Lakes National Park, </em>where prairies meet the mountains, was established in 1895, and <em>Glacier National Park </em>in 1910. Upon the urging of many, these two parks were united in 1932 as the <em>Waterton-Glacier International Peace Park</em>, the first of its type. The parks contain spectacular scenery, situated as they are astride the Continental Divide. Grizzly bears, black bears, bighorn sheep, mountain goats, moose, and cougars make this frontier park their home, along with mule deer, white-tailed deer, and elks.</p>

<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb"><em>Iguaçú National Park </em>is, in fact, two parks; the Argentinean park was created in 1909, and the adjoining Brazilian park in 1939. The world-famous Iguaçú Falls are higher than Niagara Falls and wider than Africa’s Victoria Falls. Here also is some of the most luxuriant, beautiful vegetation found anywhere in the world.</p>

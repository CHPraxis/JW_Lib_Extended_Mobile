<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><strong><em>Preemies  </em></strong>I have a daughter, now in her third year of junior high school. I have observed over the years that both her reading ability and her ability to listen are deficient. In trying to encourage her, I have said words that must have sounded cruel to her ears. When I read your article, however, I was made to recall that my daughter too was a preemie. (“Born Early, Born Small,” February 22, 1989) Your article helped me to realize that I should take her background into account when dealing with her.</p>

<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Thank you so much for your sensitive and balanced approach. Your articles moved me to tears. I especially appreciate your acknowledgment that these tiny humans indeed have feelings and that loving care from mother and family can contribute greatly to their well-being.</p>

<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><strong><em>Bats  </em></strong>I appreciated your article on bats. (January 22, 1989) I actually put off reading it because the thought of them made my skin crawl. Now after reading the article, I can appreciate them. In the photographs, they seemed to be gentle, innocent animals. I could even find humor in their little faces. Jehovah’s creation is certainly beautiful.</p>

<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><strong><em>Lost for 20 Years  </em></strong>The experience of Uncle Jimmy encouraged me immensely. (December 8, 1988) I have leukemia, but I am able to function very well. Every once in a while I get depressed and go through my ‘woe is me’ period. But, now, I can reflect on how Uncle Jimmy’s faith carried him through his difficult and trialsome times. I’ll never forget him.</p>

<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">My eight-year-old daughter was so moved by Uncle Jimmy’s experience that she had to sit down and write him a letter. (Actually, if she had had her way, we would have got in the car and driven down to the United States to visit him.) She wrote him: “It is really encouraging to read that when people tried to stop you from serving Jehovah, you just kept right on going. I am eight years old, and I hope I can be as strong as you are in the [Christian faith].”</p>

<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb"><strong><em>Loneliness  </em></strong>A schoolmate of mine said: “The girls in my class are cold, and no one will be friends with me.” The next day I brought her the article “How Do I Make My Loneliness Go Away?” in the August 8, 1987, issue of <em>Awake! </em>I didn’t really expect this girl to read it. But the next day she told me: “I read it as soon as I got home. Do you have any more?” I gave her other “Young People Ask . . ” articles that I thought might interest her. A few days later, she said excitedly: “I’ve made friends just as it was explained in that magazine!” As a result, we are now studying the Bible together.</p>

<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb"><strong><em>Same-Sex Crushes  </em></strong>I am a 17-year-old girl, and for the longest time I have been asking myself, ‘Is there something wrong with me?’ I was so incredibly relieved when I read your “Young People Ask . . ” article on that very subject. (April 8, 1989) It was also a relief to find that there were others who were experiencing the same feelings as I do, and that one day they will be outgrown. Thank you so much!</p>

There is a worldwide love affair with parks. Millions flock to them each year. Since Yellowstone (seen here) became the worldâ€™s first national park in 1872, over a hundred countries have established some 2,000 protected areas, for example, Glacier National Park in the United States (seen on the cover).
Why are people so enamored with parks? Could the earth ever become one worldwide park? What dangers are there in many parks, and how can you enjoy them in safety? This issue of Awake! not only answers these questions but explains how the dangers certain animals now present will, in time, be eliminated.

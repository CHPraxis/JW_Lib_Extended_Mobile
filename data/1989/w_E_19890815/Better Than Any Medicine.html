<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">“I have been suffering for ten years with schizophrenia, a severe mental illness,” writes a woman from Ohio, U.S.A. “It required medication to help me cope. Recently my body has been reacting to the medication, so it is difficult for me to sleep.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“One evening before retiring, I turned on the <em>Kingdom Melodies. </em>I couldn’t believe how soothing and relaxing this was. Best of all, when I awake in the middle of the night and can hear those melodies in a soft relaxing sound, I thank Jehovah, ‘Oh, you sure do know what delights your people!’ And I fall back to sleep. Believe me, it is better than any medicine I could take.”</p>

Better Than Any Medicine
“I have been suffering for ten years with schizophrenia, a severe mental illness,” writes a woman from Ohio, U.S.A. “It required medication to help me cope. Recently my body has been reacting to the medication, so it is difficult for me to sleep.
“One evening before retiring, I turned on the Kingdom Melodies. I couldn’t believe how soothing and relaxing this was. Best of all, when I awake in the middle of the night and can hear those melodies in a soft relaxing sound, I thank Jehovah, ‘Oh, you sure do know what delights your people!’ And I fall back to sleep. Believe me, it is better than any medicine I could take.”

Oceans​—Precious Resource . . . Or Global Sewer?
The ocean gives us air, food, and water. It awes us with its beauty and power. It transports us and our goods around the globe. If it were to die, mankind would die with it. How, then, is humanity treating the ocean? As a precious resource? No. Sadly and foolishly, it is too often being treated like a global sewer.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">WHAT should you do if confronted by a rapist? There is conflicting advice. Some claim that resistance only goads on an attacker, yet the Bible indicates a woman should resist. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:22:23-5:22:27" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 22:23-27</a>) What is the best advice?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A new study published in the January issue of <em>The American Journal of Public Health </em>suggests resistance. The article says: “The empirical research converges to support one important conclusion: resistance reduces the probability of an assault being completed.” What happened last September to a woman in Japan illustrates this. She had just returned late at night to her home, where she lives alone. She explains:</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“A rapist came into my house and locked the door. Because of being taken by surprise and being so terrified, I completely froze. The man tried to pull me into the bedroom, but I grabbed a pillar and resisted him.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">“It was then that I remembered the scripture in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:22:1-5:22:30" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Deuteronomy chapter 22</a>. It says that if a woman does not cry out when attacked, it indicates she is submitting to the man and is committing a sin against Jehovah. Also, I remembered what I read in the <em>Awake! </em>article ‘Rape​—How Can You Protect Yourself?’​—October 8, 1980, Japanese edition; July 8, 1980, English edition.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">“Anyway, I thought: ‘I have got to scream and resist him for all I’m worth.’ So I shouted: ‘Jehovah, help me!’ over and over again and kept it up. When the rapist pulled my hands to the right, I pulled to the left. When he pulled me forward, I pulled back, and when he covered my mouth to try to stop me from screaming, I bit him. At any rate, I kept on resisting him.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">“Gradually I got tired. It was getting difficult for me to breathe, and I thought my heart was going to stop, but I continued to do all I could to resist him and kept on calling out to Jehovah to help me. As a result, the rapist gave up, walked hurriedly to the door, and went out.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">“I believe that I was able to avoid being raped because of Jehovah’s help and because of applying what I had read in <em>Awake! </em>Had I not read the <em>Awake! </em>article, I think that out of fear I would have kept quiet and most likely done just as the criminal said. Thank you very, very much.”</p>

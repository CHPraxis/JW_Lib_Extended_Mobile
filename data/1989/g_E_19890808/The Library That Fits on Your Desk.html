<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">IMAGINE having at your fingertips a collection of literature that would rival some of the world’s greatest libraries. Imagine millions of articles and similar items from thousands of books, magazines, newspapers, and other works that would fit on your desk.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">‘How can this be?’ you wonder. The answer comes in the form of three items of modern technology: a personal computer, a modem, and a telephone line. (A modem is a device that transmits and receives computer information over telephone lines.) These three items can transform a desk top into a virtual library.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">In a traditional library, although myriads of books and magazines may have been painstakingly arranged, time is still needed to wade through this carefully cataloged printed matter. But even after searching through a catalog, there is no guarantee that the book you are looking for is on the library shelf.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="ss"><strong><em>The New Age</em></strong></p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">With a desktop computer and a modem, a person is able to tap into a much larger computer system that contains literally millions of items extracted from books, magazines, news services, and other sources, all cataloged in certain computer “files” (called a data base) that are accessible through simple commands.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">For example, if a businessman wants to find information in magazines on leveraged buyouts, he might, after using a password to sign on, request information on “magazines.” After being connected to that category of publications, he could continue <span id="page27" class="pageNum" data-no="27" data-before-text="27"></span>the search by typing: “find leveraged buyouts.” Immediately, over 1.4 million magazine items extracted from more than 16 years ago to the present are searched in a matter of seconds!</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Every article that contains the words “leveraged buyouts” is called up, and the total number of articles is displayed. Next, the “display” command is used, and starting from the most recent article, every article title, date, and author is displayed, as well as a brief summary with additional information​—in just seconds. How much did it cost him? Two or three dollars​—maybe.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">With this system, a housewife can get new ideas for cooking by viewing recipes used in various countries around the world. Decorating ideas and new styles and fashions are also available. Medical personnel can monitor the most recent research in microbiology and can also keep track of recent regulations affecting the pharmaceutical industry. Attorneys can locate cases resembling those of current clients and research the various ways any given case has been cited in the courts.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">A student can look up virtually any subject taught in school. What the businessman did with the subject of “leveraged buyouts” the student can do with the subject of “black holes.” This research aid would also be of interest to educators, writers, researchers, and corporate personnel.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="ss"><strong><em>More on Costs</em></strong></p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">While this is relatively inexpensive, costs depend to a large extent on what computer file is being used. Of course, as with any industry, costs vary from company to company.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Generally speaking, though, you pay only for the time you are connected to the computer and for the results of your search. One information service charges $1 (U.S.) per minute on the average, while the average search itself lasts about ten minutes. Time of day is one of a few variables that come into play when considering costs. If the search is conducted outside normal business hours, the charge could be as much as 50 percent less.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">To reduce costs even more, such services usually provide help in the form of customer representatives or subject specialists. These hi-tech librarians assist in deciding a search strategy before the actual search. This saves time, which in turn saves money. Some information-service companies that serve the professional community, attorneys in particular, may charge a monthly fee. Interestingly, some smaller law firms avoid the additional costs by buying time from larger firms that subscribe to the service and have full-time personnel doing regular searches.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">But what if you, like many, are intimidated by computers? What if you cannot afford a desktop computer, a modem, and an additional phone line in your home? What if you do not have the time to perform your own searches even if you could afford these items?</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">Since the advent of this service, libraries and colleges have taken an interest in them. In pursuit of more information about them, they found the attraction to be mutual. The service organizations saw city and campus libraries as public outlets for their services, while the libraries recognized their services as an attractive and powerful tool. After exploring the possibilities, a relationship developed and blossomed.</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">The service organizations offered their services at a discount to these institutions, who in turn passed on the savings to their patrons. Now you, as a patron or a student, can have searches done for you without owning computer equipment.</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">As with many items of modern technology, such as microwave ovens and digital watches, the price for searches is coming down. This is making the library that can fit on a desk more affordable for many people.</p>

<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sc"><strong>The New Librarian</strong></p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sc">  There is a new librarian in town, and you do not have to leave your desk to visit him. Instead, just reach for your telephone. He is known as an information broker. But you will not find him at your local library. He sits at a desk in an office, and for a fee he will do the research for you by means of the special telephone hookup described on these pages.</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sc">  His job is not as easy as it seems. He has to know not only which of the more than 3,000 computer files (data bases) to search but also how to move easily through a particular data base and what key words to use for the search.</p>

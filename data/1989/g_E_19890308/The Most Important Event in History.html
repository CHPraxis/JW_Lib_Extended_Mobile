<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">The event was the death of Jesus Christ. Why so?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">It served to vindicate God’s righteousness, proving that a human could keep perfect integrity to God.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">It opened to mankind the prospect of attaining everlasting life in an earthly Paradise.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Jesus himself instituted the memorial of his death on the night before he died. It was a simple ceremony. During it, Jesus told his disciples: “Keep doing this in remembrance of me.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:22:19-42:22:20" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Luke 22:19, 20</a>.</p>

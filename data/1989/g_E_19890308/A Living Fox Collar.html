<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">I stopped in my tracks on a main shopping street of Cheltenham, England. Was I seeing things? Was that lady wearing a fox collar? Or was it really a live fox?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">My double take was justified. There she was, in front of a flower stall, cool as a cucumber, wearing a real live fox around her neck! Overcome by curiosity, I asked her how she had tamed the furry creature to be so quiet and calm on a busy street with people and traffic everywhere. She explained that one day her dog had caught this fox puppy. She took it in and nurtured it, and it became a family pet. I could not resist the photo opportunity.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">But it also made me think that most people yearn to have a harmonious relationship with the animals. And according to Bible prophecy, that day will come when “the wolf shall live with the sheep, and the leopard lie down with the kid; the calf and the young lion shall grow up together, and a little child shall lead them.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:11:6-23:11:6" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Isaiah 11:6</a>, <em>The New English Bible.​—Contributed.</em></p>

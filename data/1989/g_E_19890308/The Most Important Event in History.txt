The Most Important Event in History
The event was the death of Jesus Christ. Why so?
It served to vindicate God’s righteousness, proving that a human could keep perfect integrity to God.
It opened to mankind the prospect of attaining everlasting life in an earthly Paradise.
Jesus himself instituted the memorial of his death on the night before he died. It was a simple ceremony. During it, Jesus told his disciples: “Keep doing this in remembrance of me.”​—Luke 22:19, 20.
Will you remember?

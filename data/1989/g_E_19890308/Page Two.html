<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Millions of sincere people believe in miracles, apparitions, and visions. They flock to shrines such as the one shown here in FÃ¡tima, Portugal, with the hope of obtaining or seeing a miraculous cure. Some of the devout will go on their knees to the sanctuary. Many believe that they have been healed. But other sincere people ask, Are these miracles and apparitions really from God? Is there any other explanation?</p>

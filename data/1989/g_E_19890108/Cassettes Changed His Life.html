<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A Witness in Barbados was studying the Bible with a lad whose brother was a seaman. This seaman had traveled abroad and was disillusioned with what he had seen of religion. He ridiculed his brother’s interest in the Bible. Although skeptical, he accepted some Bible literature and some Bible cassette tapes, which he took on his next voyage. By the time he reached Australia, he had read all the literature and listened to the tapes. He wanted to know more. Australian Witnesses happened to visit his ship, and he happily accepted more Bible literature.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">After several months at sea, he returned to Barbados​—a changed man. He quit smoking tobacco and marijuana, gave up gambling and drinking, and left off his immoral ways. He was eventually baptized. What triggered his change? In retrospect he said: “It was the Bible tapes that opened up the Scriptures to me and made it especially easy for me to absorb Bible truths.”</p>

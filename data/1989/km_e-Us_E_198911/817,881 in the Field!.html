<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">In August a new peak of 817,881 publishers was reached here in the United States! This exceeds our previous peak in April by 13,363​—a fitting climax to a very fine year in field service. We now look forward with great anticipation to the monthly reports of the 1990 service year and to further blessings from Jehovah. Let us press on, then, with our commission to ‘make disciples,’ teaching them to “fear God and give him glory.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:28:19-40:28:19" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matt. 28:19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:14:7-66:14:7" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Rev. 14:7</a>.</p>

<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn"><strong>20 min: </strong>Stimulate Interest for Future Calls. Talk and demonstrations. It is important that we be tactful and kind in our ministry. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:9:19-46:9:23" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Cor. 9:19-23</a>) Leaving a favorable impression may make it possible for the next publisher who calls to give a more thorough witness. By raising a question as we leave the door, we may be able to stimulate the householder’s thinking so that he will look forward to the next visit. He may even want to continue the present conversation if we ask a question about a subject that interests him. It would be good to use subjects found in the <em>Reasoning </em>book. Questions such as “Was man created by God to die?” (<a class="xt" data-xtid="16" href="jwpub://p/E:1101989220/32:230-34$p/E:1101989221/1-7:359"><em>rs </em>p. 98</a>), “Will planet Earth be destroyed in a nuclear war?” (<a class="xt" data-xtid="18" href="jwpub://p/E:1101989223/35-39$p/E:1101989224/1-5"><em>rs </em>p. 112</a>), “What is the purpose of human life?” (<a class="xt" data-xtid="20" href="jwpub://p/E:1101989243/55:118-58$p/E:1101989244/1-5:178"><em>rs </em>p. 243</a>), “How can a person know which religion is right?” (<a class="xt" data-xtid="22" href="jwpub://p/E:1101989261/34:347-41:282"><em>rs </em>p. 328</a>), and “Why is there so much wickedness?” (<a class="xt" data-xtid="23" href="jwpub://p/E:1101989277/1-7:708"><em>rs </em>p. 427</a>) or any others that would be appropriate locally could be selected from the <em>Reasoning </em>book. Demonstrate concluding a call where no interest is shown. As publisher leaves, he asks a question, mentioning that he will be glad to answer it the next time he calls. Also, demonstrate how a publisher might use the <em>Reasoning </em>book to reply when a householder asks for the answer. Chairman concludes by commenting on need to try to stimulate interest by using thought-provoking questions.</p>

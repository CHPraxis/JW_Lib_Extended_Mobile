Question Box
● What should be posted on the congregation’s information board?
The information board in the Kingdom Hall provides information about congregation activities. No items should be placed on the information board without the approval of the presiding overseer.
Some of the things posted on a regular basis include: Service Meeting and Theocratic Ministry School schedules and assignments, list of public talks that have been scheduled, Public Meeting chairman and Watchtower reader assignments, makeup and location of Congregation Book Studies, notice of the circuit overseer’s next visit along with other related information, information regarding an upcoming assembly or convention, and the Kingdom Hall cleaning schedule. At times the Society instructs the elders to post certain letters or other items. If something out of the ordinary comes up, the body of elders can decide if it would be appropriate to have it posted.
Although a brief announcement concerning a wedding scheduled to take place in the Kingdom Hall may be made at one of the meetings, a formal wedding announcement would not be placed on the information board. Neither would it be proper to post announcements about gatherings of a strictly social nature, since these are not related to congregation activities.​—See The Watchtower, April 15, 1984, page 15; Kingdom Ministry, June 1975, page 4, and May 1970, page 8.
The information board should be kept neat and attractive. It should be large enough to accommodate the necessary items outlined herein. Expired schedules and general items that the congregation has come to know about should be promptly removed. When more than one congregation meets in the same hall, each congregation should have its own separate, clearly marked information board or portion thereof. We recommend that the presiding overseer, or someone under his direction, check the board periodically to make sure that the items posted are current, appropriate, and neat.

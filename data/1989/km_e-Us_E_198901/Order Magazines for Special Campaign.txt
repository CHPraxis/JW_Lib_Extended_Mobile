Order Magazines for Special Campaign
The Watchtower during April and May will feature powerful articles exposing Babylon the Great. The full text of the resolution adopted by Jehovah’s Witnesses at the “Divine Justice” District Conventions will be published in the April 15 Watchtower. We wish to give the widest possible distribution to this as well as the other magazines during the two-month subscription campaign.
In addition to the special effort made by all the publishers to distribute both the Watchtower and the Awake! magazines, many will no doubt enroll as auxiliary pioneers and will require extra magazines during the campaign. In preparing for the special campaign, congregations should anticipate their need for additional copies of the April and May issues and order sufficient copies well in advance of the campaign.

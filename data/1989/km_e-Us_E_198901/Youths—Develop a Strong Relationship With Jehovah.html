<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>Delightful are the words found at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:24:3-19:24:5" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 24:3-5</a>: “Who may ascend into the mountain of Jehovah, and who may rise up in his holy place? Anyone innocent in his hands and clean in heart, who has not carried My soul to sheer worthlessness, nor taken an oath deceitfully. He will carry away blessing from Jehovah and righteousness from his God of salvation.” Yes, Jehovah wants in his intimate association those who are clean and innocent, those who have not been leading a double life by taking a deceitful oath. It is a joy to see that multitudes of Christian youths today fit that description. They are a real credit to Jehovah and his organization. Their moral purity makes them beautiful in the eyes of God.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>Is it easy for young people to be morally clean today? No. Daily there are challenges that must be faced. There is a worldwide epidemic of unclean influences and immoral behavior. What can you do to protect yourself? There is a need to develop a strong relationship with Jehovah.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="ss"><strong>WHAT YOU MUST DO</strong></p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>Since a strong relationship with Jehovah involves heartfelt appreciation for Jehovah’s qualities, you need to learn what he is really like. This requires an earnest study of his Word along with Bible-based publications. Like Timothy, you need to be “nourished with the words of the faith and of the fine teaching which you have followed closely.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:4:6-54:4:6" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Tim. 4:6</a>) Such study will help you see “the pleasantness of Jehovah.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:27:4-19:27:4" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ps. 27:4</a>) The more you learn about him, the closer you will be drawn to him.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>Developing such a relationship requires time and effort. Paul told Timothy: “Ponder over these things; be absorbed in them, that your advancement may be manifest to all persons.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:4:15-54:4:15" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 Tim. 4:15</a>) If you are not yet baptized, then work toward dedication and baptism. Since we are near the end of this system, we should be concentrating on “what sort of persons” we ought to be in “deeds of <span id="page2" class="pageNum" data-no="2" data-before-text="2"></span>godly devotion.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:3:11-61:3:11" data-bid="5-1" class="b">2 Pet. 3:11</a>) How we feel about Jehovah as our God and Life-Giver is important. If we develop a closeness to Jehovah similar to what one should have for a respected and dearly loved father, then deeds reflecting that relationship will be forthcoming.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/39:1:6-39:1:6" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Mal. 1:6</a>.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>Tens of thousands of young men and women throughout the organization are using their vigor, energy, and enthusiasm to share in the preaching work. They are at the Kingdom Hall for meetings, willing and prepared to comment. Thousands are using their power of youth in the pioneer service. <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:20:29-20:20:29" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Proverbs 20:29</a> calls such well-spent power “the beauty of young men.” Although cultivating a strong personal relationship with Jehovah requires hard work in his service, it is worth the effort!</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup>Many of you young ones have Christian parents who have mapped out the course for you to follow. They have shown you the steps to take in order to keep on the road to life. Listen to your parents in union with the Lord. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:6:1-49:6:1" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Eph. 6:1</a>) They dearly love you and they want you to succeed. They want you to be in the new world, so cooperate with them in the study periods they arrange. Make the truth your own. Learn all you can about Jehovah, and you will grow to love him and serve him forever.</p>

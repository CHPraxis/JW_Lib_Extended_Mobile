<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">“ARTISTS paint countless sunrises and sunsets, and their works sell for hundreds, even thousands, of dollars. Yet, Jehovah God, the Grand Artist and Originator of sunsets and sunrises, gives us one each day​—free. The originals far surpass the copies. Should that not give us cause to appreciate him as the Creator?” So reasoned a traveling overseer of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Hawaii during one of his talks to a congregation.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">An atheistic woman, visiting the Kingdom Hall for the first time, was in the audience. She took note of the minister’s reasoning, but strong doubts about the existence of God still lingered. However, as she was driving home from work almost two years later, she was caught in rush-hour traffic. This caused her to notice a particularly spectacular sunset. Her thoughts returned to that traveling overseer’s talk.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">She relates: “Instead of being upset about being caught in traffic, I noticed the beautiful sunset, and it reminded me of what the speaker had said about appreciating Jehovah God as an Artist and a Creator. It got me thinking, ‘Perhaps what he said is true; maybe there really is a Creator.’ I thought about it as I continued home, and that night I called my friend who had originally invited me to the Kingdom Hall. I started studying the Bible, and now I worship Jehovah as my God and Creator.”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Like the psalmist, this woman not only came to appreciate Jehovah as the Grand Artist of creation but also came to sing his praises. Wrote the psalmist: “Praise Jehovah from the heavens . . . Praise him, you sun and moon. Praise him, all you stars of light. . . . Let them praise the name of Jehovah; for he himself commanded, and they were created.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:148:1-19:148:5" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 148:1-5</a>.</p>

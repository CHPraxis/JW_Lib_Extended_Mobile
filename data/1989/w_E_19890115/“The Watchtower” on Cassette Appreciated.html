<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">More and more people have been expressing such appreciation. A youth from Alberta, Canada, writes:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“I am a 17-year-old girl who suffers from dyslexia, a learning disability. I have always had the problem of being able to understand very little of what I read. Yet, if someone took the time to read the information to me, I could understand it right away.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“In the past, it has always been frustrating, even discouraging, to read <em>The Watchtower. </em>Now this has changed dramatically. I have just finished the cassette covering the January 1st issue. Words cannot describe how thrilling it is to understand what I have read, from cover to cover! I am so very thankful, grateful, and appreciative for this new provision.”</p>

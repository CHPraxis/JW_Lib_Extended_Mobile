<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">The head of a department at a school in Durban, South Africa, said that he regularly reads the <em>Awake! </em>Because of the magazine’s educational value on so many subjects, he asked if he could obtain a year’s supply. When an <em>Awake! </em>bound volume was brought to him, he exclaimed: “This is a teacher’s boon! I am going to tell all my teachers that this is what each of them should have in their library.”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The man requested that at the end of each year, a bound volume of the magazines be brought to him. When told that the volumes are $6, he exclaimed: “That’s very reasonable for all the wonderful articles in here! The ones on dealing with children and how to communicate with them are really helpful. In fact, all the articles are informative and a delight to read.”</p>

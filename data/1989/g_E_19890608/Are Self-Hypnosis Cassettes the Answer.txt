Are Self-Hypnosis Cassettes the Answer?
Do you have trouble sleeping? Are you too fat? Are you trying to overcome bad characteristics? If so, help is only as far away as your cassette recorder, claim the makers of self-hypnosis cassettes.
One side of the cassette contains the day version and the other side the night version. The day version contains music composed for your particular problem and should be played often, say the manufacturers, even when a person is not consciously listening. Its purpose is to make the mind more receptive to the message of the night version.
The night version, it is suggested, should be played only when one can relax, preferably upon retiring at night. After a short time, the voice of a hypnotist will lull you into deep sleep. Your subconscious mind never sleeps, says the advertisement, so it will be receptive to his messages even while you are asleep.
However, Alan Baddeley, director of the British Medical Research Council’s Applied Psychology Unit in Cambridge, England, writes that the subconscious mind is limited in what it can accomplish. He says that tests disprove the effectiveness of these so-called sleep-teaching systems. His conclusion: “It appears then that if you wish to learn, it is advisable to be conscious at the time.”
An even more important aspect to be considered is the connection of such cassettes with hypnotism. Surrendering one’s mind and will to another person, in this case the hypnotist, can be dangerous. The answer to overcoming weaknesses does not lie in allowing our mind to be manipulated by music and the voices of unseen people. The answer is in gaining an accurate knowledge of God’s Word and then following the leadings of his holy spirit. (Romans 12:2; Ephesians 4:22-24) Above all, it will give us the hope of endless life in God’s problem-free new system of things now near.​—Revelation 21:3-5.

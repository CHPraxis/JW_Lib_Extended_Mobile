Trafficking in Death
While the world spends about a trillion dollars a year for armaments:
800,000,000 people live in absolute poverty
770,000,000 do not have enough food for an active working life
100,000,000 are without shelter
1,300,000,000 do not have safe drinking water
14,000,000 children die each year because of the effects of hunger
THEY have been called Merchants of Death, Gravediggers of Civilization, A Cancerous Tumor on the Body of Society. Who? The world’s arms merchants. Why?
In former times, they kept troops equipped with swords, spears, axes, and pikes for man-to-man slaughtering on the battlefields. In this century, they made and delivered the guns, bombs, tanks, warships, airplanes, poison gas, and ammunition for killing tens of millions of people in the two world wars while ruining billions of dollars of material resources, such as cities, homes, and other property. They have fueled the more than 120 wars fought since the end of World War II.
They continue to fuel bloody wars in various parts of the world. They train Third World armies for more effective use of their weapons. They have equipped world military powers with a stockpile of nuclear weapons able to blow up the human family several times over and transform the earth into an uninhabitable planet. They seem to be completely unscrupulous. Their watchword could be: “Your death​—our profit.”
No business has affected the human family as deeply as the arms business. The evidences are clear. The next article will reveal some disturbing facts.

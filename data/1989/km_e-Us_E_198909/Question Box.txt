Question Box
● Who should handle the announcements on the Service Meeting?
The objective of this portion of the Service Meeting is to inform the congregation of details important to carrying out the assigned ministry. Some announcements serve as reminders and are similar week after week. However, all announcements should be expressed clearly. None should be given casually or treated as routine.
The nature of some announcements may require that they be presented by an elder. Whenever this is the case, it would be the responsibility of the presiding overseer to arrange for a well-qualified brother to present the information, even though another brother will be handling the other scheduled announcements.
When a letter that contains information for the congregation includes other information directed to the elders only, an elder should present the information that applies to the congregation. Some letters from the Society that contain specific direction for the congregation may best be read by a qualified elder. Such letters may have to do with special letter-writing campaigns in behalf of our brothers experiencing persecution. Some letters may contain detailed information about future theocratic activities, such as circuit overseer visits, assemblies, and conventions.
There may be times when an important announcement pertaining to the welfare of the congregation must be made, and the information must be clearly presented. Such announcements would best be made by an elder.
Whether made by elders or ministerial servants, announcements should be given with clarity and conciseness. Following these guidelines will ensure proper relating of instructions to the congregation so that all will move ahead in unity.​—Ps. 133:1; 1 Cor. 14:8, 9, 40.

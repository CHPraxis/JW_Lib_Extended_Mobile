“Awake!” on Audiocassette
As announced at the “Godly Devotion” District Convention, beginning with the January 8, 1990, issue, the Awake! in English will be available on cassette on a subscription basis. Most of the articles in each issue will be recorded on a single cassette. Although available to everyone, this provision will be especially helpful to those handicapped by physical impairment that prevents them from reading Awake! in print.
The subscription rates will be the same as for the Watchtower on cassette, as follows:
Congregation and public: $36.00
Pioneer: $30.00
Those certified as blind or physically unable to read ordinary reading material: $12.00
Cassettes will be provided with Braille labels if requested. Subscription rates are for one year only. There is no six-month subscription rate.
Special cassette subscription forms are being supplied to congregations, and these may be obtained from the brother handling subscriptions. The completed form should be returned to him for forwarding to the Society along with other regular subscriptions. Do not use regular magazine subscription forms for cassette subscriptions.
Those currently qualified for the reduced rate for Watchtower cassettes may receive Awake! at the same rate. To certify eligibility, the congregation secretary, on the basis of his personal acquaintance with the subscriber, should sign the certification statement on the reverse side of the special subscription slip. (For details, please see the Society’s letter of August 15, 1989, to all congregations.)
A durable 24-cavity cassette album is also available for convenient storage of the Awake! cassettes. The cost is as follows:
Congregation and public: $7.00
Pioneer: $5.50
Those desiring to receive the first issue of Awake! on cassette should send their subscriptions in promptly, although subscriptions will be accepted at any time. It is hoped that these recordings will enable more persons to enjoy the material contained in Awake!

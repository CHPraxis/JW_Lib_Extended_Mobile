<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A young woman who had attended college in Iowa, U.S.A., writes regarding one of her teachers: “I could remember her way of teaching about the human anatomy and physiology of the body. She strongly believed in a Creator, yet the questions of evolution would be asked by students.”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">When this former student received a copy of the book <em>Life​—How Did It Get Here? By Evolution or by Creation? </em>she thought of her teacher and sent her a copy. The teacher wrote back:</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“I’m about halfway through the book, and as I suspected, it is exactly the type of reference material I have often wished I had to back up my beliefs. In my opinion it is excellent! Very well presented plus very well documented. All the research I have often wished I had time for or an inclination to do has been done for me! Also, it pleases me that you knew it is the type of book I would want to have. Thank you very much!”</p>

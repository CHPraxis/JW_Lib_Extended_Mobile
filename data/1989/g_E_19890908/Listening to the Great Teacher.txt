Listening to the Great Teacher
Now on Four Cassettes in One Handy Album
Millions of families have enjoyed Listening to the Great Teacher, a book designed for reading with young ones. Its 46 Bible stories fascinate children, while also teaching them high moral principles. Now this valuable 192-page book has been recorded on four cassette tapes. Listen to the stories together as a family. Or children can play the tapes for themselves and their companions. The album with the four cassettes as well as the book Listening to the Great Teacher is only $10. The playing time is a little over five hours.
Please send, postpaid, the book as well as the colorful vinyl album with the four cassette tapes of Listening to the Great Teacher. I enclose $10 (U.S.). (Outside the U.S.A., write to local Watch Tower branch for price.)

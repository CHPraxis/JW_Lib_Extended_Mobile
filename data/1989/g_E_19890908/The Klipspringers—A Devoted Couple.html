<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">MEET the klipspringers from South Africa, members of Africa’s antelope family.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“One of the most endearing aspects of the klipspringer’s behaviour,” reports Peter Norton in <em>African Wildlife </em>magazine, “is the formation of a very strong and long lasting pair-bond that lasts over several years, probably until one of them dies. The pair stays close together nearly all the time​—my data shows that they spend 97 per cent of their time within 15 metres of one another and 77 per cent within five metres. When resting or alarmed, they are nearly always within touching distance.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">A klipspringer pair usually take turns, with one grazing while the other stands guard perched on a rock like a sentry. Then they swap positions. Observes Norton: “The male spends far more time on the look-out for predators than does the female, who needs to eat more to nourish the foetus, or provide milk for her lamb.”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Compared with other antelopes, the klipspringer’s hooves are unique and enable it to climb steep, smooth rock. From safe, rocky mountain slopes, it warns of predators with a trumpetlike whistle. The alarm call is often a duet, with the female’s whistle coming a fraction of a second after the male’s. They certainly look out for each other. A truly devoted couple.</p>

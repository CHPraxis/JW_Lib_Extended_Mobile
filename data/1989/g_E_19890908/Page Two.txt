Is the Earth Really Getting Warmer?
The 1980’s may be remembered as the decade when the earth began to “melt.”
▪ The first half of 1988 included the warmest five months in the history of weather records. And when all the reports were in, 1988 took the prize. It turned out to be the hottest year in nearly a century, according to the British Meteorological Office.
▪ Thus, 1988 replaced the previous record holder, which was 1987!
▪ Coincidence? Maybe. The years 1981 and 1983 tied for third place on the temperature record chart.
▪ The fifth and sixth warmest? The years 1980 and 1986.

“A Treasure Chest of Questions and Answers”
That is what a woman from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, called the handbook Reasoning From the Scriptures. She explained: “I recently had two of Jehovah’s Witnesses come to my home. . . . One mistakenly left (at my home) a book entitled Reasoning From the Scriptures. I must admit, I ransacked that book! I sat reading it for hours. I was extremely impressed. . . . This book was to me like a treasure chest of questions and answers, many that I’ve asked myself.”
You can receive a personal copy of this valuable Bible publication that will provide answers to hundreds of timely questions. It contains over 70 main subject headings. Included are “Abortion,” “Drugs,” “Holidays,” “Rapture,” “Reincarnation,” “Sex,” “Spiritism,” and many more. Its seven-page index of subjects and scriptures can help you to find answers quickly.
Please send, postpaid, the hardcover, 448-page handbook Reasoning From the Scriptures. I enclose $1.50 (U.S.).

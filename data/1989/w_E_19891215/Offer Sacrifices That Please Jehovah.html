<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu"> 1. What did Jehovah urge sinful Israelites to do?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb">JEHOVAH is the Helper of those offering acceptable sacrifices to him. Therefore, his favor once rested upon Israelites who offered animal sacrifices. But what happened after they repeatedly sinned? Through the prophet Hosea, they were urged: “Do come back, O Israel, to Jehovah your God, for you have stumbled in your error. Take with yourselves words and come back to Jehovah. Say to him, all you people, ‘May you pardon error; and accept what is good, and we will offer in return the young bulls of our lips.’”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/28:14:1-28:14:2" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Hosea 14:1, 2</a>.</p>
<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu"> 2. What were ‘the young bulls of the lips,’ and how did the apostle Paul allude to Hosea’s prophecy?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><span id="page21" class="pageNum" data-no="21" data-before-text="21"></span><sup>2 </sup>So it was that God’s ancient people were encouraged to offer to Jehovah God ‘the young bulls of their lips.’ What were these? Why, sacrifices of sincere praise! Alluding to this prophecy, the apostle Paul urged Hebrew Christians to “offer to God a sacrifice of praise, that is, the fruit of lips which make public declaration to his name.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:13:15-58:13:15" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Hebrews 13:15</a>) What can help Jehovah’s Witnesses to offer such sacrifices today?</p>

<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>Applying the counsel Paul gave the Hebrews will enable us to offer acceptable sacrifices to our Great Helper, Jehovah God. For instance, the apostle wrote: “Remember those who are taking the lead among you, who have spoken the word of God to you, and as you contemplate how their conduct turns out imitate their faith.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:13:7-58:13:7" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Hebrews 13:7</a>) To whom did Paul refer when he said, “Remember those who are taking the lead among you,” or “are governors of you”?​—<em>New World Translation Reference Bible, </em>footnote.</p>
<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu"> 4. (a) According to the Greek text, what are those “taking the lead” doing? (b) Who are those “taking the lead” among Jehovah’s Witnesses?</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>Paul spoke of those “taking the lead,” or governing. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:13:7-58:13:7" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Heb 13 Verses 7,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:13:17-58:13:17" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 17,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:13:24-58:13:24" data-bid="5-3" class="b"> 24</a>) The English word “govern” is derived through Latin from the Greek <em>ky·ber·naʹo, </em>meaning to “steer a ship, direct, govern.” Christian elders govern by using their “abilities to direct” (Greek, <em>ky·ber·neʹseis</em>) in providing leadership and guidance in local congregations. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:12:28-46:12:28" data-bid="6-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 12:28</a>) But the apostles and other elders in Jerusalem served as a body to give guidance and counsel to all the congregations. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:15:1-44:15:2" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Acts 15:1, 2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:15:27-44:15:29" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 27-29</a>) Today, therefore, a governing body of elders provides spiritual oversight for Jehovah’s Witnesses worldwide.</p>
<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu"> 5. Why and how should we pray for congregation elders and members of the Governing Body?</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>Local elders and members of the Governing Body take the lead among us; hence, we should respect them and pray that God grant them the wisdom needed to govern the congregation. (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:1:15-49:1:17" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Ephesians 1:15-17</a>.) How fitting that we remember any ‘who spoke the word of God to us’! Timothy was taught not only by his mother and grandmother but also later by Paul and others. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:1:5-55:1:6" data-bid="9-1" class="b">2 Timothy 1:5, 6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:14-55:3:14" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 3:14</a>) So Timothy could contemplate how the conduct of those taking the lead turned out and was able to imitate their faith.</p>
<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu"> 6. Whose faith should we imitate, but whom do we follow?</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup>Such individuals as Abel, Noah, Abraham, Sarah, Rahab, and Moses exercised faith. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:11:1-58:11:40" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Hebrews 11:1-40</a>) Thus, we can imitate their faith without hesitation because they died loyal to God. But we can also ‘imitate the faith’ of loyal men now taking the lead among us. Of course, we do not follow imperfect humans, for we keep our eyes on Christ. As Bible translator Edgar J. Goodspeed said: “The heroes of old are not the believer’s models, for in Christ he has a better pattern . . . The Christian runner must fix his eyes upon Jesus.” Yes, ‘Christ suffered for us, leaving a model for us to follow his steps closely.’​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:2:21-60:2:21" data-bid="11-1" class="b">1 Peter 2:21;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:12:1-58:12:3" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> Hebrews 12:1-3</a>.</p>
<p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu"> 7. How should <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:13:8-58:13:8" data-bid="46-1" class="b">Hebrews 13:8</a> affect our attitude toward suffering for Jesus Christ?</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><sup>7 </sup>Focusing attention on God’s Son, Paul added: “Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today, and forever.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:13:8-58:13:8" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Hebrews 13:8</a>) Faithful witnesses such as Stephen and James had displayed immovable integrity, after Jesus’ steadfast pattern.

In the past, at <span id="page22" class="pageNum" data-no="22" data-before-text="22"></span>present, and even in the future, godly persons do not beg off from suffering martyrdom as Jesus’ disciples.</p>

<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><sup>8 </sup>The unchangeableness of Jesus’ personality and teachings should make us cling to what he and his apostles taught. The Hebrews were told: “Do not be carried away with various and strange teachings; for it is fine for the heart to be given firmness by undeserved kindness, not by eatables, by which those who occupy themselves with them have not been benefited.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:13:9-58:13:9" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Hebrews 13:9</a>.</p>
<p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu"> 9. To what superior things did Paul point in the letter to the Hebrew Christians?</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><sup>9 </sup>Jews pointed to such things as the spectacular giving of the Law at Mount Sinai and the lasting kingship of David. But Paul showed Hebrew Christians that although the instituting of the Law covenant was awesome, Jehovah more forcefully bore witness with signs, portents, powerful works, and distributions of holy spirit when the new covenant was inaugurated. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:2:1-44:2:4" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Acts 2:1-4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:2:2-58:2:4" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> Hebrews 2:2-4</a>) Christ’s heavenly Kingdom cannot be shaken, as was the earthly kingship of Davidic rulers in 607 B.C.E.

<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><sup>10 </sup>The Hebrews therefore needed to avoid being “carried away with various and strange teachings” of Judaizers. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:5:1-48:5:6" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Galatians 5:1-6</a>) Not by such teachings but ‘by God’s undeserved kindness can the heart be given firmness’ so as to remain steadfast in the truth. Some apparently argued about foods and sacrifices, for Paul said that the heart was not made firm “by eatables, by which those who occupy themselves with them have not been benefited.” Spiritual benefits result from godly devotion and appreciation for the ransom, not from undue concern about eating certain foods and observing particular days. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:14:5-45:14:9" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Romans 14:5-9</a>) Moreover, Christ’s sacrifice made Levitical sacrifices ineffective.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:9:9-58:9:14" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Hebrews 9:9-14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:10:5-58:10:10" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> 10:5-10</a>.</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:14:1-66:14:4" data-bid="43-1" class="b">Revelation 14:1-4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:20:4-66:20:6" data-bid="43-2" class="b"> 20:4-6</a>) It is through Christ that God, to whom we ascribe glory, ‘equips us with every good thing needed to do his will and be well-pleasing in his sight.’</p>
<p id="p58" data-pid="58" class="qu">20. How would you paraphrase and explain Paul’s closing exhortation to the Hebrew Christians?</p>
<p id="p28" data-pid="28" data-rel-pid="[58]" class="sb"><sup>20 </sup>Uncertain about how the Hebrews would react to his letter, Paul said: “Now I exhort you, brothers, to bear with this word of encouragement [to listen to God’s Son, not Judaizers], for I have, indeed, composed a letter to you in few words [considering its weighty content]. Take note that our brother Timothy has been released [from prison], with whom, if he comes quite soon, I shall see you.” Probably writing from Rome, the apostle hoped that he along with Timothy would visit the Hebrews in Jerusalem. Then Paul said: “Give my greetings to all those who are taking the lead [as hardworking elders] among you and to all the holy ones [those having the heavenly hope]. Those in Italy send you their greetings. The undeserved kindness [of God] be with all of you.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:13:22-58:13:25" data-bid="44-1" class="b">Hebrews 13:22-25</a>.</p>

<p id="p30" data-pid="30" data-rel-pid="[59]" class="sb"><sup>21 </sup>Perhaps more than any other book of the Holy Scriptures, the letter to the Hebrews helps us to understand the significance of the sacrifices offered under the Law. The epistle clearly shows that the sacrifice of Jesus Christ is the only one that provides the needed ransom for sinful humankind. And a notable message found in the letter is that we should listen to God’s Son.</p>
<p id="p60" data-pid="60" class="qu">22. What are some reasons for us to be grateful for the letter to the Hebrews?</p>
<p id="p31" data-pid="31" data-rel-pid="[60]" class="sb"><sup>22 </sup>Furthermore, as we have seen in the two previous articles, we have other reasons to be grateful for the divinely inspired letter to the Hebrews. It helps us not to tire out in our ministry, and it fills us with courage, for we know that Jehovah is our Helper. Moreover, it encourages us to use our lips and all our faculties unselfishly in rendering sacred service day and night and offering heartfelt sacrifices that please our praiseworthy and loving God, Jehovah.</p>

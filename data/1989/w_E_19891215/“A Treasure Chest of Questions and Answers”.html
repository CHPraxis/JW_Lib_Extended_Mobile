<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">That is what a woman from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, called the handbook <em>Reasoning From the Scriptures. </em>She explained: “I recently had two of Jehovah’s Witnesses come to my home. . . . One mistakenly left (at my home) a book entitled <em>Reasoning From the Scriptures. </em>I must admit, I ransacked that book! I sat reading it for hours. I was extremely impressed. . . . This book was to me like a treasure chest of questions and answers, many that I’ve asked myself.”</p>

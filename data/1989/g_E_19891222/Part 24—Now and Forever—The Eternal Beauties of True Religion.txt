Religion’s Future in View of Its Past
Part 24​—Now and Forever—​The Eternal Beauties of True Religion
“Religion, if in heav’nly truths attir’d, needs only to be seen to be admired.”​—William Cowper, 18th-century English poet
THERE is nothing to be admired about false religion. It has brought humankind 60 centuries of misery and suffering. Its lying, deceptive, treacherous, and hateful ways have made it ugly both in the sight of God and of man. Far from being attired in heavenly truths, false religion is the antithesis of truth and beauty.
Soon God’s executional forces will unceremoniously dump false religion into the pit of eternal extinction. Shortly thereafter, the rest of Satan’s system will follow. But true religion, as well as those who practice it, will live on. What a joy then to see its eternal beauties displayed to a degree we today can scarcely imagine!
What Beauties?
Many are the beauties of true religion. Here are but a few. Why not take time to look up the cited Bible texts that prove these eternal beauties to be Bible-based?
Among the many eternal beauties of true religion are:
▪ It is based on the truth of an infallible God, whose name is Jehovah, upon whom we can unconditionally rely.​—Psalm 83:18; Isaiah 55:10, 11.
▪ It is available to everyone with a humble heart, not reserved for only those with superior intelligence.​—Matthew 11:25; 1 Corinthians 1:26-28.
▪ It is blind to race, social status, and economic position.​—Acts 10:34, 35; 17:24-27.
▪ It offers the well-grounded hope of life in a world of peace and security without sorrow, sickness, misery, and death.​—Isaiah 32:18; Revelation 21:3, 4.
▪ It provides a framework within which its members can live as a worldwide loyal brotherhood, united in doctrine, conduct, and spirit.​—Psalm 133:1; John 13:35.
▪ It offers everyone​—man, woman, and child—​an opportunity to share actively in God’s work, filling life with purpose.​—1 Corinthians 15:58; Hebrews 13:15, 16.
▪ It warns us of hidden dangers, instructing us how to conduct ourselves so as to be benefited.​—Proverbs 4:10-13; Isaiah 48:17, 18.
And why can it be said that these beauties are eternal? Simply because they will last as long as does true religion itself​—forever.
Filling In the Gaps
It can be said that death is one of the greatest enemies of truth, since people often take to their graves information that no other humans know. The exact details of even comparatively recent events​—for example, the 1963 assassination of U.S. president J. F. Kennedy​—are still a matter of controversy. What are the facts? Who really knows? Many who might know are no longer alive. And if this is true of an event only 26 years in the past, what about events that took place hundreds or even thousands of years ago?
Additionally, historians are only human, limited in knowledge and working under the handicap of personal imperfections and possible prejudices. That is why the objective person does well to refrain from being dogmatic about things for which he has no authoritative, divinely inspired record.
Writing about religious history presents similar problems, since authorities often disagree on the facts. In the series “Religion’s Future in View of Its Past,” Awake! has tried to present well-documented facts, but it must be admitted that at present there are certain things we simply do not know. For example, to what extent did professed Christian groups existing during and after the Dark Ages really adhere to true Christianity?
Of these groups, professor of church history A. M. Renwick notes: “Much historical research is still called for in order to bring out the true story and the theological position of those numerous bodies.” According to Renwick, “in the past historians have depended too much on the statements of the enemies of the dissenting groups for their assessment of their doctrine and morals.” Of course, depending too much on the statements of their friends might also result in a slanted view. So even after much historical research, many questions would possibly still remain unanswered.
What about the Bible? As a divinely inspired book embodying some religious history, it is reliable in everything it says. But it says very little about all the different forms of false religion that have ever existed. Understandably so, since it was provided to serve as a textbook for the true religion, not for the false.
Even as regards true religion, the Bible does not tell us everything. It provides us with sufficient information to identify true religion successfully, but at times it omits details. While these details might be fascinating and interesting to know, at the moment they are not vital.
Then, too, the Bible has time gaps. For example, it is silent as to what happened during the over 400 years that elapsed between the completion of the Hebrew Scriptures, commonly called the Old Testament, and the appearance of Jesus. And since the Bible was completed, almost 1,900 years have passed.
So for the better part of 18 centuries, we have no inspired record about Christianity. This is what causes the uncertainty about some professed Christians, as mentioned by author Renwick. Nevertheless, it is apparent that at least some individuals down through the centuries were adhering to early Christianity. There are, however, unresolved questions that have to do with the motives and possible sincerity of certain individuals of bygone years. What about some of the Reformation leaders? For that matter, what about men like Confucius and Muhammad? Although present religious systems can be accurately judged on the basis of their fruitage, individuals​—especially if they are long dead—​often cannot be.
If, however, in God’s new world, it should be the Creator’s will to have the history books rewritten​—including those of religious history—​it will be possible. This is because of another beauty of true religion​—the assurance that the dead will be resurrected.​—John 5:28, 29; Acts 24:15.
Imagine the joy of getting accurate answers to our questions by talking to resurrected humans who actually did the things we have read about in the history books. Imagine being able to fill in missing details, such as the name of the Pharaoh who died at the Red Sea and who experienced the plagues of Egypt.
If such a record should someday be written, it will be written to glorify and eternally vindicate the founder of true religion, Jehovah God. Of this there can be no question. The question that does remain, however, is this: Will you be there to read it?
Admiration Is Not Enough
The eternal beauties of true religion are not always as easily seen as Cowper’s words, quoted at the beginning of this article, would seem to indicate. Therefore, the first issue of Zion’s Watch Tower and Herald of Christ’s Presence made the following observation 110 years ago: “Truth, like a modest little flower in the wilderness of life, is surrounded and almost choked by the luxuriant growth of the weeds of error. If you would find it you must be ever on the lookout. If you would see its beauty you must brush aside the weeds of error and the brambles of bigotry. If you would possess it you must stoop to get it.”
It is hoped that “Religion’s Future in View of Its Past” has helped our readers “brush aside the weeds of error and the brambles of bigotry” so as to appreciate more fully the eternal beauties of true religion.
But appreciation is not enough. Apt is the Chinese proverb: “Teaching that enters the ears but not the heart is like dinner eaten in a dream.” If we are to benefit personally from the eternal beauties of true religion​—not just dream about them—​it is vital that what we learn reaches our heart, not just our ears.
Read carefully the box entitled “Identifying Your Religion as True or False.” Then ask yourself: ‘Do I now agree that as far as the worldwide empire of false religion is concerned, Voltaire was right when he called religion “the enemy of mankind”? Has this glance into religious history helped me to identify true religion, and do I know in this late stage of human affairs where it can be found? If so, do I want to be like the person described by 18th-century French essayist Joseph Joubert, who “finds in it his joy and his duty”?’
May all those answering yes to the above questions continue to benefit by reading Awake! and its companion publications. We would invite you to follow the wise advice offered by the above-mentioned Zion’s Watch Tower: “Be not content with one flower of truth. Had one been sufficient there would have been no more. Gather ever, seek for more.”
Yes, continue to gather, continue to seek​—seek for more of the eternal beauties of true religion!

Identifying Your Religion as True or False
▪ True religion inspires in its worshipers an unbreakable bond of love and unity that is not affected by national boundaries. (John 13:35) False religion does not inspire such love. Rather, in imitation of Cain, its members go out and kill one another in international wars.​—1 John 3:10-12.
▪ True religion keeps free of human politics and looks to the Creator to solve world problems by means of his Kingdom government. False religion follows Nimrod’s example at the Tower of Babel. It merges itself with politics, trusts in political gods in whose affairs it meddles, and thus lays the basis for its own destruction.​—Daniel 2:44; John 18:36; James 1:27.
▪ True religion recognizes Jehovah as the true God, the only one able to deliver from oppression. False religion, such as practiced in ancient Egypt and Greece, offers a multitude of helpless mythical gods who are all without merit.​—Isaiah 42:5; 1 Corinthians 8:5, 6.
▪ True religion promises eternal life on earth in happiness. False religion​—for example, Buddhism—​views life on earth as undesirable and as something from which to be liberated in an uncertain hereafter.​—Psalm 37:29; Revelation 21:3, 4.
▪ True religion, by means of its holy book, the Bible, imbues people with unshakable faith; it gives them a guaranteed hope and motivates them to acts of genuine love toward God and neighbor. (2 Timothy 3:16, 17) False religion, despite its holy books, is for the most part ineffectual in doing these things.​—1 John 5:3, 4.
▪ True religion is marked by humble overseers. False religion is noted for its ambitious, independent-minded leaders, who are willing to twist the truth and who seek political or worldly gain.​—Acts 20:28, 29; 1 Peter 5:2, 3.
▪ True religion, the way of proper submission to God, wields a spiritual, not a literal, sword. False religion, on the other hand, compromises true doctrine, breaks Christian neutrality, and pursues human concerns more than divine interests.​—2 Corinthians 10:3-5.
▪ True religion wins the hearts of unbelievers over to the worship of the true God. False religion contributes to a climate of skepticism, freethinking, rationalism, and secularism.​—Luke 1:17; 1 Corinthians 14:24, 25.
▪ True religion, as practiced by Jehovah’s Witnesses, is spiritually flourishing as never before. False religion, its skirts splattered with blood, is suffering from spiritual malnutrition and waning support.​—Isaiah 65:13, 14.
What is religion’s future in view of its past? False religion has no future. Desert her! (Revelation 18:4, 5) Turn to true religion. It will last forever.

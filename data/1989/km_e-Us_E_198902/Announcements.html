<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">● Literature offer for <strong>February: </strong>Any 192-page book published prior to 1980, for a contribution of 50¢. Although the <em>Choosing, Commentary on James, </em>and <em>Word of God </em>books may have been reprinted on better-grade paper, these too should be used in this offer. Alternate offer for congregations that do not have older books: any other 192-page book available locally for a contribution of $1.00 each. (See January <em>Our Kingdom Ministry </em>regarding credit request.) <strong>March: </strong><em>Revelation​—Its Grand Climax At Hand! </em>for a contribution of $3.00. <strong>April and May: </strong>Subscription to <em>The Watchtower </em>for a contribution of $5.00 for each one-year subscription.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn">● On April 29 the Brooklyn Bethel Home and factory and Watchtower Farms buildings will be closed for spring cleaning, so there will be no arrangements for tours or for the congregations to pick up literature on that day.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn">● The Memorial celebration will be held Wednesday, March 22, 1989. Although the talk may start earlier, please remember that the passing of the Memorial bread and wine <em>should not begin until after sundown. </em>Check with local sources to determine when sundown occurs in your area. No other meetings are to be conducted on that date. If your congregation normally has meetings on Wednesday, you may want to switch those to another time of the week if the hall is available. If your Service Meeting is affected, it may be possible to incorporate into another Service Meeting any parts scheduled for that week that are particularly applicable to your congregation.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">In a letter from Belgium, the writer describes a legal adviser with whom he worked: “Whenever possible, he would be shunned because of his reputation as being someone instilling dread. In addition, he was an atheist and just the mention of the word ‘God’ was sufficient for him to fly into a rage. Before his retirement, this man made a trip to Israel. I took the occasion to offer him the book <em>My Book of Bible Stories, </em>which, to my amazement, he accepted.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“This gave me the opportunity tactfully to speak to him about the Bible. From a man difficult to approach, he changed so completely that other colleagues said they hardly recognized him. The office became a haven of peace. Everyone was astonished to see that man smile and become more composed.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The publication that helped to accomplish this transformation is <em>My Book of Bible Stories. </em>This 256-page, beautifully illustrated book gives the reader a broad idea of what the Bible is all about. You can have a copy. Simply fill in and mail the accompanying coupon along with a contribution of $2.50.</p>

Theocratic Ministry School Schedule for 1984
Instructions
During 1984 the following will be the arrangements when conducting the Theocratic Ministry School.
TEXTBOOKS: The New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures, Bible Topics for Discussion [td], and the books “All Scripture Is Inspired of God and Beneficial” [si] and Theocratic Ministry School Guidebook [sg] will be the basis for assignments.
The school will begin with song and prayer and remarks of welcome, and then proceed as follows:
ASSIGNMENT NO. 1: 15 minutes. This should be handled by an elder if possible, or, when necessary, by a qualified ministerial servant. When based on the Theocratic Ministry School Guidebook, this should be delivered as a 10-minute instruction talk followed by a 5-minute oral review. Since a part of a study is assigned from this book, the brother handling this assignment should be careful to cover only the portion of the material that is assigned. The objective should be not just to cover the material but to focus attention on the practical value of the information being discussed. All are encouraged to make careful advance preparation so as to benefit fully from this material.
When based on “All Scripture Is Inspired of God and Beneficial,” this assignment should be delivered as a 15-minute instruction talk with no oral review following. Once again, the objective is not just to summarize the material but rather to focus attention on the practical value of the information, highlighting what will be most helpful to the congregation.
All assigned this talk should be careful to keep within the time limit. The brother handling Assignment No. 1 should be given private counsel, if necessary.
HIGHLIGHTS FROM BIBLE READING: 6 minutes. This should be handled by the school overseer or another qualified elder assigned by him. This should not be just a summary of the assigned reading. After giving a brief overall view of the assigned chapters, help the audience to appreciate why and how the information is of value to us. To the extent possible include the audience in the discussion. The students will then be dismissed to their various classrooms.
TALK NO. 2: 5 minutes. This is a Bible reading of the assigned material to be given by a brother. Of course, nondedicated persons who are leading lives that conform to Christian principles may also enroll in the school and receive assignments. The reading assignments are usually short enough to permit the student to present brief explanatory information in the opening and concluding remarks, and even at intermediate points. Historical background, prophetic or doctrinal significance and application of principles may be included. All the assigned verses should actually be read. The material may also be presented by a boy reading it to a qualified older brother who may then use questions to draw comments from the boy on the value of the material.
TALK NO. 3: 5 minutes. This talk will be assigned to a sister, including younger ones, whenever possible. When delivering the talk, the student may be either seated or standing. One assistant will be scheduled by the school overseer, but additional assistants may be used. Settings could include situations arising at home, in the field ministry, in the congregation or elsewhere. The one giving the talk may either initiate the conversation to establish the setting or have her assistant(s) do so. Not the setting but the material should be given prime consideration.
TALK NO. 4: 5 minutes. Assigned preferably to a brother with some experience. This should be a talk to the entire audience. It will usually be best for the speaker to prepare his talk with the Kingdom Hall audience in mind, so that it will be truly informative and beneficial to those who actually hear it. However, if the material lends itself better to another practical and suitable setting, the speaker may choose to develop his talk accordingly.
When assigned to a sister, the material should be presented as outlined for Talk No. 3.
COUNSEL AND REMARKS: After each student talk the school overseer will give specific counsel, not necessarily following the program of progressive counsel outlined on the Speech Counsel slip. Rather he should concentrate on those areas where the student needs to improve. In addition, comments on informative and practical points that the students may not have included in the presentation can help to keep the attention of all focused primarily on the Scriptural information presented. The school overseer should be careful to use no more than two minutes for counsel and remarks after each student talk. If the student speaker merits only a “G” and there is no other speech quality marked “I” or “W,” then the counselor should circle a speech quality the student should work on next, doing so in the box where the “G,” “I” or “W” would normally appear. It would be advisable for those giving talks to sit toward the front of the hall. This will help to save time, and also it will enable the school overseer to give his counsel directly to each student.
PREPARING TALKS: Where the material makes it possible, talks should follow a well-developed theme. Choose a theme that will allow for the best coverage of the material in the allotted time.
TIMING: No talk should go overtime. Neither should the counsel and remarks of the school overseer. Talks Nos. 2 through 4 should tactfully be stopped when the time is up. If the school overseer assigns someone to give the “stop signal,” that one should be advised as to the importance of doing this whenever a talk goes overtime. If a brother handling Assignment No. 1 goes overtime, he should be given private counsel. All should watch their timing carefully. Total program: 45 minutes, not counting song and prayer.
WRITTEN REVIEWS: Periodically, a written review will be given. In preparation, review the assigned material and complete the scheduled Bible reading. Only the Bible may be used during this 25-minute review. The balance of the time will be devoted to a discussion of the questions and answers. Each student will check his own paper, and in reading off all the answers, the school overseer will concentrate on the more difficult questions, helping all to understand the answers clearly. If, for some reason, local circumstances make it necessary, the written review may be used a week later than what is shown on the schedule.
LARGE AND SMALL CONGREGATIONS: Congregations with a school enrollment of 75 or more students may wish to arrange for additional groups of students to deliver the scheduled talks before other counselors. Rotate the students to the various halls. Where it is necessary, sisters may take any student talk, presenting it to someone else, as outlined for Talk No. 3.
ABSENTEES: The entire congregation can show appreciation for this school by being present, when possible, at every weekly session, by preparing their assignments well, and by participating in question sessions. It is hoped that all students will view their assignments conscientiously. If a student is not present when scheduled, a volunteer may take the assignment, making whatever application he feels qualified to make on such short notice. Or, the school overseer may cover the material with appropriate audience participation.

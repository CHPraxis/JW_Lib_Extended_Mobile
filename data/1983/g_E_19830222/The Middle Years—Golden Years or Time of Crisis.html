<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">“LIFE begins at 40!” they say. And many traversing the “middle years” would heartily agree with these sentiments. Says one woman: “Truthfully, I wouldn’t want to be 18 again. I’m a lot happier now in my 50’s than I’ve been in years.”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Yes, for some these are the “golden years.” Wisdom, gleaned from years of experience, is at their disposal. They thus feel competent, reasonably in control of their lives. Even the prospect of their children’s departure does not overly dishearten them. Rather, they see opportunities for increased personal time and privacy together with their mate. Far from listless, their lives bustle with meaningful activity.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Others, however, are not so optimistic. ‘Why, turning 40,’ they say, ‘is not the beginning of anything​—just the end of being young.’ And they may have reason for their apprehension. Disconcerted by the first signs of aging, they may feel like the man who said: “When I see those bags under my eyes I know I’ve had it. I’m not going anyplace except to the cemetery.”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Further, they may be besieged with financial concerns. Loneliness may distress them. And as their health gradually deteriorates, and they for the first time confront the specter of death, they may question if their life has had meaning, if the future really offers anything of value. ‘Oh, to be young again,’ they may sigh.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">However, the Bible points out: “Whatever a man is sowing, this he will also reap.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:6:7-48:6:7" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Galatians 6:7</a>) Whether middle age is “golden” or a time of crisis has much to do with how you “sow” in your earlier days​—what values you esteem, what habits you establish and what goals in life you pursue. Since many of us must eventually pass through middle age, let us explore some of its prospects​—and problems.</p>

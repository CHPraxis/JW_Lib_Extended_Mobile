(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:12:1-58:12:2" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Hebrews 12:1, 2</a>) Then, emphasizing the Kingdom hope of these Christians, Paul describes the awesome demonstrations of Jehovah’s glory at Mount Sinai at the time of the inauguration of the Law covenant with fleshly Israel. It was then that Jehovah told Israel: “If you will strictly obey my voice and will indeed keep my covenant, . . . you yourselves will become to me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:19:5-2:19:6" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Exodus 19:5, 6</a>.</p>

What is that? Paul answers at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:12:22-58:12:22" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Hebrews 12:22</a>: “You have approached a Mount Zion and a city of the living God, heavenly Jerusalem.” That approach had started with the Kingdom heirs of Paul’s day, as these were “built up a spiritual house” on the foundation, Christ Jesus, now laid in Zion. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:2:4-60:2:9" data-bid="8-1" class="b">1 Peter 2:4-9</a>) Other anointed Christians would continue this approach to the heavenly Jerusalem until all 144,000 are gathered to the Lamb, to stand with him upon that heavenly Mount Zion.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:14:1-66:14:5" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Revelation 14:1-5</a>.</p>

He speaks of the presence of “myriads of angels,” which both <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:7:9-27:7:14" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Daniel 7:9-14 and</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:25:31-40:25:31" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> Matthew 25:31</a> indicate are on hand when the One “like a son of man” receives the Kingdom. Paul refers also to “the congregation of the firstborn” who inherit the Kingdom. He magnifies God as “the Judge of all,” who declares these ‘firstborn sons’ righteous or just, that they may be taken into the new covenant that Jesus mediated by means of his own precious blood.

For our God is also a consuming fire.” Such admonition to zeal in ‘approaching’ the heavenly Jerusalem, or <span id="page23" class="pageNum" data-no="23" data-before-text="23"></span>Messianic Kingdom, continues on to the end of Paul’s letter, as we read in the last chapter, namely, <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:13:14-58:13:14" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Hebrews 13:14</a>: “We do not have here a city that continues, but we are earnestly seeking the one to come.” Now that Kingdom has come​—in the epoch-marking year 1914! How earnest the remaining anointed ones on earth should be in ‘seeking first the kingdom’ and in always offering to Jehovah “a sacrifice of praise, that is, the fruit of lips which make public declaration to his name”!​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:33-40:6:33" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Matthew 6:33;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:13:15-58:13:15" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> Hebrews 13:15</a>.</p>

<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu"> 6. (a) What is the “New Jerusalem,” as described in Revelation? (b) Why should the “great crowd” be deeply interested in this “Jerusalem”?</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup>What, then, of “the new Jerusalem,” first mentioned at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:3:12-66:3:12" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Revelation 3:12</a>? Here the glorified Jesus says of ‘the one who conquers’: “I will make him a pillar in the temple of my God, . . . and I will write upon him the name of my God and the name of the city of my God, the new Jerusalem which descends out of heaven from my God.” Later, at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:1-66:21:2" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Revelation 21:1, 2 and</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:10-66:21:10" data-bid="19-2" class="b"> 10</a>, John locates these conquerors in “a new heaven” and describes their composite group as “the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God and prepared as a bride adorned for her husband,” Christ the bridegroom. This New Jerusalem is God’s agency through which he causes “water of life” to flow to obedient humans, as these are healed and brought to perfection of life here on earth. Thus God, the Author of this grand arrangement, will in a very literal way “wipe out every tear from their eyes, and death will be no more, neither will mourning nor outcry nor pain be anymore.” How the “great crowd,” the companions of the remnant of the “bride” class, rejoice in that prospect!​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:22:1-66:22:2" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Revelation 22:1, 2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:4-66:21:4" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> 21:4</a>.</p>
<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu"> 7. How does the “New Jerusalem” differ from the “heavenly Jerusalem”?</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><sup>7 </sup>However, there is a slight difference between the “New Jerusalem” described in Revelation and the “heavenly Jerusalem” of the book of Hebrews in that the “New Jerusalem” is made up of the 144,000 who are betrothed to the bridegroom, whereas the “heavenly Jerusalem” comprises 144,001, this “one” being the bridegroom King. Thus the Bible books of Hebrews and Revelation show a close identity between the “heavenly Jerusalem” and the “New Jerusalem.”</p>

The apostle Paul says of her: “The Jerusalem above is free, and she is our mother.”​—Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:54:13-23:54:13" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Isaiah 54:13</a>.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><sup>9 </sup>This “Jerusalem above” is Jehovah’s womanlike organization in the heavens.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:12:7-66:12:7" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Revelation 12:7</a>) These serve in the role of “wife” to their Sovereign Lord. Concerning this “woman” Paul goes on to say: “It is written [that is, at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:54:1-23:54:1" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Isaiah 54:1</a>]: ‘Be glad, you barren woman who does not give birth; break out and cry aloud, you woman who does not have childbirth pains; for the children of the desolate woman are more numerous than those of her who has the husband.’”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:4:27-48:4:27" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Galatians 4:27</a>.</p>

<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><sup>10 </sup>In fulfillment of this prophecy, Jehovah’s “wife,” his grand heavenly organization of spirit creatures, must have cried out with joy to see Christ Jesus brought forth as the primary “seed” at his baptism in 29 C.E. That joy must <span id="page24" class="pageNum" data-no="24" data-before-text="24"></span>have overflowed when the integrity-keeping Jesus was raised from the dead in 33 C.E. and exalted to God’s right hand in the heavens. Then, what joy to see the “seed” become many as disciples of Jesus Christ were brought in also, to become her spiritual children! All of this was in fulfillment of God’s promise to Abraham that He would ‘multiply his seed’ for the blessing of all nations of the earth.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:22:15-1:22:18" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Genesis 22:15-18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:3:29-48:3:29" data-bid="26-2" class="b"> Galatians 3:29</a>.</p>

And when Christ the King (also called Michael, meaning “Who Is Like God?”) answered Satan’s challenge by hurling the Devil and his angels out of the heavenly realm, no doubt the angelic host responded with great joy to the “loud voice” that declared: “On this account be glad, you heavens and you who reside in them!” They rejoiced, too, from 1919 onward, to see the remaining “sons” on earth of “the Jerusalem above” separated completely from Babylonish religion. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:12:1-66:12:12" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Revelation 12:1-12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:18:4-66:18:5" data-bid="27-2" class="b"> 18:4, 5</a>) And now, as these redeemed ones make their final approach to the “heavenly Jerusalem,” the Messianic Kingdom, what joy there must be among the throngs of loyal angels of “the Jerusalem above”!​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:62:11-23:62:11" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Isaiah 62:11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:19:7-66:19:7" data-bid="28-2" class="b"> Revelation 19:7</a>.</p>

All day long and all night long, constantly, let them not keep still. You who are making mention of Jehovah, let there be no silence on your part . . . until he fixes solidly, yes, until he sets Jerusalem as a praise in the earth.” Truly, Jehovah’s heavenly organization has become such “a praise in the earth” as his Witnesses preach throughout the globe.

Having made, and been granted, the request “for a good conscience,” these dedicated, baptized publishers of the Kingdom good news serve joyfully, as the Lamb, Christ Jesus, guides them to “fountains of waters of life.” Already the promise is fulfilled toward them in the spiritual paradise: “And God will wipe out every tear from their eyes.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:3:21-60:3:21" data-bid="41-1" class="b">1 Peter 3:21;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:7:16-66:7:17" data-bid="41-2" class="b"> Revelation 7:16, 17</a>.</p>
<p id="p51" data-pid="51" class="qu">19. (a) Why is no “plaintive cry” to be heard in “Jerusalem”? (b) What does <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:65:21-23:65:25" data-bid="61-1" class="b">Isaiah 65:21-25</a> indicate in line with the meaning of the name “Jerusalem”?</p>
<p id="p26" data-pid="26" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><sup>19 </sup>Closely paralleling this last scripture is Jehovah’s own statement at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:65:19-23:65:19" data-bid="42-1" class="b">Isaiah 65:19</a>: “I will be joyful in Jerusalem and exult in my people; and no more will there be heard in her the sound of weeping or the sound of a plaintive cry.” The remaining ones on earth yet to be resurrected into the “New Jerusalem” have experienced this joy, and now Jehovah showers like blessings on the “great crowd” of the “other sheep.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:10:16-43:10:16" data-bid="43-1" class="b">John 10:16</a>) How wonderfully the words following at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:65:21-23:65:25" data-bid="44-1" class="b">Isaiah 65:21-25</a> describe the paradisaic condition of God’s “people” who have been gathered as the nucleus of the “new earth”! Surely, here is a “Foundation of Twofold Peace,”​—peace now among Jehovah’s worshipers and extending on into the physical Paradise, when God’s will takes place in all the earth.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:3-66:21:5" data-bid="45-1" class="b">Revelation 21:3-5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:10-40:6:10" data-bid="45-2" class="b"> Matthew 6:10</a>.</p>
<p id="p52" data-pid="52" class="qu">20. Appropriately, what questions may we ask of ourselves?</p>
<p id="p27" data-pid="27" data-rel-pid="[52]" class="sb"><sup>20 </sup>Do you want to praise Jehovah eternally in the Paradise earth for the marvelous things that he accomplishes through “the Jerusalem above,” his devoted womanly organization? Do you want to see the “heavenly Jerusalem” with Christ its King, the Greater David, triumph over all unrighteousness? Do you want to see the bridal “New Jerusalem” extending its influence down from God and his Christ in heaven, so as to wipe away <em>all </em>tears of mankind?</p>
<p id="p53" data-pid="53" class="qu">21. How may we show appreciation for all that faithful Jerusalem symbolizes?</p>
<p id="p28" data-pid="28" data-rel-pid="[53]" class="sb"><sup>21 </sup>If that is your desire, then loyally continue your “sacred service” in support of all that was pictured by faithful Jerusalem of old, that city of “the grand King,” the Sovereign Lord Jehovah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:7:15-66:7:15" data-bid="46-1" class="b">Revelation 7:15</a>) Thus you may join in the joyful temple melody of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:87:3-19:87:3" data-bid="47-1" class="b">Psalm 87:3</a>, as you sing exultantly: “Glorious things are being spoken about you, O city of the true God.”</p>

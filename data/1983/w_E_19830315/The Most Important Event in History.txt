The Most Important Event in History
What event was that? The death of Jesus Christ. Why so?
Because it served to vindicate God’s name, proving that a human could keep perfect integrity to God.
It opened to humankind the prospect of attaining everlasting life in Paradise conditions.
Jesus himself instituted a memorial of his death on the night before he died. It was a simple ceremony. During it Jesus told his disciples: “Keep doing this in remembrance of me.”​—Luke 22:19, 20.

Are You the Victim of a Fraud?
Since Jesus has a name, does not his Father have one?
MANY millions of people throughout the world today are highly skeptical of religion. But it might come as a surprise to them to know that God himself is displeased with most religions. Among the many reasons for this is that the so-called Christian religions have perpetrated one of the greatest frauds in history. This fraud is related to a fundamental revelation​—the identity of God.
Most people in Christendom’s churches know the Creator as “God,” “Lord,” “the Almighty” or by some similar designation. But does the Most High lack a name? Before delivering the Israelites from bondage in Egypt, this all-powerful God let it be known that he purposed to “have [his] name declared in all the earth.” (Exodus 9:16) So he certainly has a name. And surely it was no nameless God whose presence created a marvelous spectacle at Mount Sinai (depicted on our cover), making the mountain tremble, when the Ten Commandments were given through the prophet Moses. Among other things, the Israelites were then told: “You must not take up the name of Jehovah your God in a worthless way.” (Exodus 19:16–20:18) Could such a command come from a nameless God?
Professed Christians ought to know that Divine Name. Oh, they do use the name of God’s Son. But rarely, if ever, do they utter the personal name of the Father. Yet, when Jesus Christ was on earth he stated in prayer to his heavenly Father: “I have made your name known to [my followers] and will make it known.”​—John 17:26.
It is obvious from the foregoing and from Jesus’ Model Prayer that God does indeed have a name. Jesus even taught his followers to pray that the heavenly Father’s name be “sanctified,” or held holy! (Matthew 6:9) Why, then, is it not used in the churches of Christendom? And why is that name missing from most modern translations of the Bible?

Question Box
‚óè When should an assistant be asked to conduct the Congregation Book Study?
The assistant would conduct in the absence of the appointed conductor. It would not be appropriate for him to conduct the book study periodically as training. The assigned conductor is responsible for teaching the group and, when present, he should do so unless there are extenuating circumstances. (Rom. 12:7) In most cases elders are assigned as study conductors since teaching is a weighty responsibility. (Jas. 3:1) It is not a matter of simply reading the questions and calling on persons for comments. The insight and experience of spiritually older men can be very beneficial to those in the group, helping them to understand, to explain and to apply in their lives the truths being studied. Of course, well-qualified ministerial servants may be assigned this responsibility if qualified elders are not available.
An assistant can learn effective methods of teaching by observing closely the assigned book study conductor. He can acquire teaching ability through diligence in preparing and delivering Theocratic Ministry School talks, parts on the Service Meeting and by conducting home Bible studies with individuals and families. Thus, he will be in a good position to benefit his brothers when he is called on to substitute for the assigned conductor. Also, assistants can be very helpful in organizing and leading the group in field service when the assigned conductor is unable to do so.

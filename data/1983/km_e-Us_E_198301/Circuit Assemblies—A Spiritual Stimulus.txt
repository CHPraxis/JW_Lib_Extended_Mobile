Circuit Assemblies—A Spiritual Stimulus
What a fine circuit assembly program was presented to us on the theme “Making the Truth Manifest in Our Lives.” (2 Cor. 4:2) It certainly made us aware of the need to take practical steps in making the truth manifest not only by proclaiming it but also by demonstrating it in every aspect of our lives.
The theme for the series of circuit assemblies starting in February is “Be Rich Toward God, Not Covetous.” (Luke 12:15, 21) The program on Saturday will give full consideration to the subject “Working What Is Good Toward All.” (Gal. 6:10) It will strengthen our determination to lay up spiritual treasure and conquer imperfect fleshly desires. The Sunday morning part “Producing Doers of the Word” will assist us in being more effective in our home Bible study work. The Scriptures encourage us to be not just hearers of the Word, whether at congregation meetings or assemblies, but doers—workers in Jehovah’s service.—Jas. 1:22.
Circuit assemblies are an important part of the worship of our God, Jehovah. Listening carefully to the program that has been prepared by the ‘faithful slave’ class will stimulate us spiritually, enabling us to receive added refreshment. Make sure you attend every session of your next circuit assembly. It will be spiritually rewarding.

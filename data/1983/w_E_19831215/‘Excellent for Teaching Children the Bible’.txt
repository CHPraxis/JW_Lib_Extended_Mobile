‘Excellent for Teaching Children the Bible’
That is what millions have said about the 256-page My Book of Bible Stories. Now many are saying the same about the recordings of this book on cassette tapes. A parent from Ohio, U.S.A., writes:
“Our four-year-old boy, Leif, listens to them daily and goes to bed with them every night. He knows all the Bible characters and can sight-read the titles of most of the stories. It is not unusual for him to listen to two full tapes at a time, a feat we wouldn’t be able to accomplish if we were to try to sit down and read that many stories at one time. This is an excellent way for young children to become so familiar with the Bible.”
If you have not done so already, be sure to get these cassette tapes for your young ones. Listen to the stories together as a family. Or children can play the tapes for themselves and their companions. The album with the four cassettes is only $8; playing time: 5 1⁄2 hours.
Please send me, postpaid, the brown vinyl album with the four cassette tapes of My Book of Bible Stories. I enclose $8 (U.S.).

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">“A year ago we felt that we were ready to get divorced,” reports a husband in New Caledonia. The reason? Lack of communication, different temperaments, health problems and a nervous illness on the part of the wife. After ten years together, both felt that their marriage was a failure.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">One morning the wife discussed her troubles with a neighbor. The neighbor, who happened to be one of Jehovah’s Witnesses, told her how the practical advice in the Bible helped to solve family problems. When the husband later heard about this, he was not impressed. Nothing, he felt, would change his wife’s temper and personality. Nevertheless, the wife soon started to study the Bible with Jehovah’s Witnesses. She listened closely to the Bible principles as they were explained to her and tried to apply them in her life.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The husband reports: “In a few weeks I started to notice changes in her personality.” Puzzled, he agreed to attend a district convention to see what it was all about. The talks there affected him profoundly. He joined his wife’s Bible study, and he admits: “Now we have found the basis for a really happy family life. And we are very happy, my wife and I, to share with others this solution to family problems​—in fact, to all the problems faced by humans today.”</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="st"><strong>What Is Your Goal in Life?</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">WHAT do you want to achieve in life? An advanced secular education? a good position in the world? money? fame? security? These are common goals. But will realizing them actually give you what you want out of life?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">To help answer such questions, consider the life of Moses, as illustrated in these pictures. He was raised as “the son of the daughter of Pharaoh”​—the world ruler. So, as a part of Pharaoh’s royal household, Moses had full opportunity to share in the “enjoyment of sin.” Also, he had ready access to “the treasures of Egypt.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:11:24-58:11:26" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Hebrews 11:24-26</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Furthermore, the Bible says, “Moses was instructed in all the wisdom of the Egyptians.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:7:22-44:7:22" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Acts 7:22</a>) So, then, due to his favored position, Moses had everything that most people today seek to attain. Yet did these things bring him true satisfaction and happiness?</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Not really. Although he had everything in a material way, Moses knew that these things were of no <span id="page17" class="pageNum" data-no="17" data-before-text="17"></span><em>lasting </em>value. Do you realize this important fact? It is just as Jesus Christ himself said: “What benefit will it be to a man if he gains the whole world but forfeits his [life]?” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:16:26-40:16:26" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matthew 16:26</a>) Everything we may have is worthless if we lose our life. Is that not so?</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Therefore, the Bible says of Moses: <em>“He looked intently toward the payment of the reward.” </em>Yes, Moses looked to what God offers. He realized that God’s gift of everlasting life is more valuable than anything else. So Moses “continued steadfast <em>as seeing the One who is invisible.” </em>(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:11:26-58:11:27" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Hebrews 11:26, 27</a>) Jehovah was real to Moses, and so were His promises of everlasting life.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Is that true of you? When you read about God’s promises to provide everlasting life in an earthly Paradise, are these promises real to you? Do you picture yourself as being a part of that Paradise and enjoying the blessings God has in store for his people? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:37:9-19:37:11" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Psalm 37:9-11,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:37:29-19:37:29" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 29;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:46:8-19:46:9" data-bid="5-3" class="b"> 46:8, 9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:72:7-19:72:8" data-bid="5-4" class="b"> 72:7, 8,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:72:16-19:72:16" data-bid="5-5" class="b"> 16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:9:6-23:9:7" data-bid="5-6" class="b"> Isaiah 9:6, 7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:11:6-23:11:9" data-bid="5-7" class="b"> 11:6-9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:35:5-23:35:6" data-bid="5-8" class="b"> 35:5, 6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:23:43-42:23:43" data-bid="5-9" class="b"> Luke 23:43;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:3-66:21:4" data-bid="5-10" class="b"> Revelation 21:3, 4</a>) If you do, you will be like Moses and will set as your main goal in life the serving of Jehovah God and the winning of his approval.</p>

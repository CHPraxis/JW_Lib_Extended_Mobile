<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A Witness in Portland, Oregon, wrote regarding the effect that the <em>Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses </em>had on a visitor.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“A service repairman came to my home to fix my washer. He had gone to another room in the house, and for about 20 minutes he was real quiet. Finally he came out into the kitchen and asked, ‘Are you a Jehovah’s Witness?’ He had picked up the <em>Yearbook </em>and had it in his hand. He said, ‘This is really wonderful. I want to give you a dollar. Please send one to my address.’”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Many have found the <em>Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses </em>to be absorbing reading. For 1983 the <em>Yearbook </em>contains faith-strengthening reports about the modern beginning and development of the Kingdom-preaching activity in Australia and Portugal. A copy will be mailed to you, postpaid, for a contribution of just $1.</p>

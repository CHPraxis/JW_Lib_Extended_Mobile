“I Was a Witch Doctor”
“I was a witch doctor,” wrote a Xhosa woman from the Transkei. Her letter, sent to the branch office of the Watch Tower Society in South Africa, continues: “I had my own patients or students whom I had to train as witch doctors. I was working very hard to help them, although my health was deteriorating. My hands, feet and knees were swollen and very painful. I had to go to see a European doctor, but a car had to be brought right in front of my door and then I was carried into it, like a graven image that has limbs but cannot use them. While I was sick, Jehovah’s Witnesses came to my house. They discussed with me Deuteronomy 18:9-12 and Ecclesiastes 9:5, 6, 10.”
As a result, this woman began to accept the Bible truths regarding witchcraft and the condition of the dead, and she understood why her former beliefs were of no value in relieving her suffering. She accepted a Bible study and was later baptized as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses. This, however, required some changes, as she goes on to explain: “Realizing that Jehovah is against witchcraft, I burned all the clothing I wore as a witch doctor, all the medicines and everything that went along with the practice. Jehovah’s Witnesses were present on that day when I poured kerosene on these items and set them alight. (Acts 19:19, 20) Now healthwise I am much better and, thankfully, ‘I will sing to Jehovah throughout my life.’​—Psalm 104:33.”
Some two years have passed since this former witch doctor sent this letter. Today she continues to show her thankfulness to Jehovah God by having a zealous and regular share in helping others to understand his Word.

“The Best Toy Yet Devised”
“Stimulating a baby doesn’t call for elaborate paraphernalia,” states the book Readiness for School​—Readiness for Life, published by the University of South Africa. “Essentially a parent is the best toy yet devised.” The author then proceeds to discuss how parents play the role of “toy”: “When a mother holds her infant for feeding, with his face about 20 cm (8 in.) away from hers, he can study her facial outlines, the contrast between eyes and hair, the movement of lips and eyes. He can listen to the changes in her voice, smell her body, touch her skin and clothing. . . . If he looks, smiles, gestures, his mother should reward him with a smile, hug, a change in facial expression or tone of voice.”
As to the value of such “play” the writer, Dr. Magdalena Grey, observes: “In these early years the growth of good attitudes and sympathy are more important than acquiring mathematical skills or scientific expertise. This is saying a great deal because all these skills are indeed very important later on. Yet kindliness is still one of the most important attributes of all human beings, and kindliness is learned in the early years.” Certainly these observations emphasize the value of the Biblical advice for mothers “to love their children, to be . . . workers at home.”​—Titus 2:4, 5.

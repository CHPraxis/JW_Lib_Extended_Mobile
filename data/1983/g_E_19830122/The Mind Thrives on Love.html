<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Two little girls in an orphanage, age 13 months and 16 months, showed such overwhelming evidence of retardation that they were sent to a mental hospital. About six months later a psychologist found them to be alert, normal children. Not believing that the improvement could be lasting, he tested them twice more, at intervals of about 12 months, and each time their intelligence was normal. The only difference in their lives was that women inmates in the mental hospital cuddled the babies, played with them and provided a personal relationship for them.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The American Medical Association’s book <em>Quality of Life​—The Early Years </em>says: “Had they not received this love from the women inmates, they could have spent their lives needlessly institutionalized. The case illustrates the fact that even though a child’s genetic inheritance may be excellent, he must have loving care and encouragement if he is to realize his potential.”</p>

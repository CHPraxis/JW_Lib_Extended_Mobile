<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">(5 min.) Introduction. Great enthusiasm manifested at release of <em>School </em>brochure on second day of recent “Kingdom Unity” District Conventions. Something parents and schoolchildren have been wanting. Designed to fill particular needs of parents, children and teachers in handling situations unique to Jehovah’s Witnesses involved in secular education.

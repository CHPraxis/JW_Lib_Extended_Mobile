<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn">● After September 1 congregations may order additional copies of the <em>United in Worship </em>book. Remember, this publication will not be used at present as a house-to-house campaign offer. It is for use at home Bible studies, at the Congregation Book Study and for personal study. It may also be offered to people who have read the <em>Truth </em>or <em>Live Forever </em>books. As a start, we suggest you order about one book for each Bible study being conducted in the congregation as well as one for each publisher who may need a personal copy. When additional supplies are needed, these may be ordered.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn">● There will not be special public talks in January and February based on the <em>United in Worship </em>book. Plan to use talks from the regular series during that time.</p>

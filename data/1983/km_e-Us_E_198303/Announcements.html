<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn">● We are pleased to announce that a large-print edition of <em>The Watchtower, </em>for the benefit of those with limited eyesight, will be published beginning July 1, 1983. For the present, it will be published only for the United States and only in English. This will be regular magazine size with 32 pages and will contain only the study articles with questions. The price will be the same as for the regular semimonthly edition. It can be ordered by individual subscription or as distributors’ copies sent through the congregation. To order, use the regular <em>Watchtower </em>subscription slip (M-1) or the Distributors’ Order form (M-202) and mark clearly in the upper right-hand corner, “LARGE PRINT.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn">● All should carefully study the article “Honor Godly Marriage!” that appears in <em>The Watchtower </em>of March 15, 1983. Direction is given showing the need to avoid being caught up in the permissiveness and unnatural sex perversions that abound in the world today.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn">● Congregation accounts should be audited by March 1 or as soon as possible thereafter by the presiding overseer or someone appointed by him.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn">● Questions have been raised as to how long one must wait after a reproof or reinstatement before qualifying for appointment as an auxiliary pioneer. Since all pioneers are required to be exemplary in conduct, this privilege may not be extended to one until at least one year has passed following a reproof or reinstatement from disfellowshipping or disassociation. All restrictions imposed by the judicial committee must already have been removed.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sn">● The Society has produced three new booklets in English for the special purpose of helping people of certain religious backgrounds. The booklet <em>The Time for True Submission to God </em>(<em>sm</em>) is designed to help Muslims to understand the truth. <em>In Search of a Father </em>(<em>sc</em>) has been written for people indoctrinated in the Buddhism of southeast Asia. And, <em>From Kurukshetra to Armageddon—And Your Survival </em>(<em>ku</em>) has been prepared to help persons of Hindu background. Congregations that have English-speaking persons with these backgrounds in their territory may wish to order a small supply of these booklets. As these become available in other languages, announcement will be made.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"><strong>● What two books should be studied with new Bible students?</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">For some time now we have recommended that those conducting home Bible studies complete two of the Society’s books with the student in order that a full opportunity is provided for the student to come to an accurate knowledge of the truth. It was felt that the student should have not only a good understanding of the basic doctrines of the Bible but also a good grasp of what the Bible teaches concerning moral standards, Christian living and related matters. It is felt that this procedure should still continue. We want to do all we can to prepare our students for what lies ahead, providing them with a sound education in Jehovah’s purposes as well as high Christian standards and requirements. If a student is baptized before the study of two books is completed, then it would be good for the study to continue after his baptism. The time, return visits and study can be reported by the publisher until the completion of the second book.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">If the Bible study is being held in the latest book, <em>You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth, </em>then the second book can be <em>“Let Your Kingdom Come.” </em>If the first book being studied is <em>“Let Your Kingdom Come,” </em>then the second can be the <em>Live Forever </em>publication. Of course, in languages in which we do not have the above publications, the brothers will have to use what they have available.</p>

Could All Animals Have Fitted Into Noah’s Ark?
“Impossible,” many say. But do they really know how large the ark was? Do they realize the carrying capacity of a vessel that size?
You will be fascinated to learn these things in the book Is the Bible Really the Word of God? (See the chapter “Was There an Earth-wide Flood?”) This 192-page, hardbound book examines many questions raised by critics of the Bible. Only 75 cents, postpaid.
Please send the book Is the Bible Really the Word of God? I enclose 75 cents (U.S.).

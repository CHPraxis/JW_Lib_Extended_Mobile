Circuit Assemblies—Timely Reminders
1 The circuit assembly program with the theme “Be Rich Toward God, Not Covetous” was appreciated because of its timely and practical reminders. Bombarded as we are with materialistic propaganda designed to stir up selfish desires, it was refreshing to consider the examples of Jesus Christ, Paul and others who did not covet material things. They were content with the basic necessities while they concentrated on serving Jehovah and doing good toward others. (2 Cor. 8:9; 12:14-18) Also, the Scriptural material presented forcefully reminded us of the need to be reasonable and balanced in matters of business, health and recreation. Let us resolve never to allow lack of balance in these things to distract us from our real purpose in life.
2 Starting in September, a new circuit assembly program will begin with the theme “Recommending Ourselves as God’s Ministers.” (2 Cor. 6:4) What identifies a true minister of God? How can we help ourselves and our children to be truly absorbed in the ministry? How can we avoid being ensnared by self-interest? The program will show how effective ministers display the fruitage of God’s spirit when confronted with various situations. The public talk features the subject “What Future Is There for You?” The entire program should help Jehovah’s people to make the most of their ministry. All of us, along with interested persons, should benefit from such reminders.—Ps. 119:2, 24.

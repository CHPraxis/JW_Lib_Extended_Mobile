<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">The Memorial attendance this year is another indication that many people appreciate Jehovah’s provision for salvation through Jesus Christ. As shown below, compared with last year, over 74,000 more persons attended the Memorial in the U.S. on March 29, 1983. All who were present at that event but are not yet actively associated with us need help ‘to be instructed about Jehovah’s ways and to walk in his paths.’—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:2:2-23:2:3" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Isa. 2:2, 3</a>.</p>

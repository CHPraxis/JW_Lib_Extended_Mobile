<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Musical arrangements can do so. And how fine it is when the music that reaches the heart motivates it in the right way. A mother wrote regarding the Kingdom Melodies that are recorded on cassette tapes:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“As I put the tape on, my three children came into the room to listen. Suddenly I realized we had all stopped what we were doing and the children were getting out their songbooks. Even my two-year-old girl sat down in front of the stereo to sing! We sang every song together and somehow could not leave the room until we had heard it all. These songs (so beautifully arranged) about Jehovah can really reach the heart.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">You, too, can enjoy these stirring musical arrangements. The three cassettes, Kingdom Melodies 1, Kingdom Melodies 2 and Kingdom Melodies 3, each costs only $2, and each has a playing time of nearly one hour.

<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Please send, postpaid, the cassette(s) checked. I have enclosed $2 (U.S.) for each cassette.</p>

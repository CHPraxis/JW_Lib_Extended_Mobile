<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A CERTAIN woman tried to share the good news from the Bible with her neighbor, a Chinese housewife with two children. But such efforts met with this remark: “I would never become a Christian like you!”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Rather than being discouraged by this response, however, the Christian woman continued to show kindness to her neighbor, repeatedly going to her aid when she needed help. Gradually, the neighbor was moved by this kindness and eventually accepted a Bible study in order to learn more about the God whose worshipers display such unselfish love. In due time the Chinese woman herself became a worshiper of Jehovah, the God of the Bible, and this despite her husband’s very severe opposition.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">This experience proves that every normal person appreciates being treated with kindness and consideration. And it is only natural and right that we should express our appreciation to a person showing us such kindness. After all, suppose a friend invited you to a sumptuous meal on which much time, effort and money had been spent. After enjoying such a feast, would you dream of leaving the table without saying even one word to express your appreciation for the hospitality of your host? Well, then, what about the Creator? Do you appreciate what he has done for all of us?</p>

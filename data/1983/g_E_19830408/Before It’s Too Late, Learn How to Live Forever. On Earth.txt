Before It’s Too Late, Learn How to Live Forever. On Earth.
It’s not just a dream. You really can. Happily. And this new book can help you find this promise in your Bible. You’ll also learn why we die, and why we won’t have to die in the future if we learn what to do right now.
Please send me the 256-page, hard cover, illustrated book You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth. I enclose $2.50 (U.S.).

Higher Earnings Mean Divorce?
Chances for divorce increase for high-salaried working women, the U.S. Census Bureau indicates. The divorce rate is four times higher for the woman making more than $50,000 a year than it is for the average American woman. Those who earn $25,000 a year are said to be getting divorces at twice the rate of others.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A young student in Belgium stopped smoking. When the opportunity arose, he explained to his schoolmates the reason why. He showed them what was said on the matter in <em>Your Youth​—Getting the Best out of It </em>and distributed copies of the book among them.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">One of the students stopped smoking after reading the book. The mother of another student read the book and forbade her son to continue to smoke. Another mother requested more literature. The director of the school was impressed by what was happening and also became interested in the literature of Jehovah’s Witnesses. All together, 30 books were distributed.</p>

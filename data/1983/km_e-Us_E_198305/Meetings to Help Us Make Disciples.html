<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn"><strong>20 min: </strong>Review of “<a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:201983162/">Bearing Witness to the Truth</a>.” A talk on opening three paragraphs can serve as an introduction to the part, with the balance being covered by questions and answers.

<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sn"><strong>20 min: </strong>Question-and-answer coverage of “<a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:201983170/">Presenting the Good News—By Developing Magazine Routes</a>.” Include brief interviews with any in the congregation who have magazine routes. For paragraph 7, have two publishers who do well in the magazine work discuss briefly the article in each current magazine that they plan to highlight.

<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sn"><strong>18 min: </strong>Handling the Word of Truth Aright. After book study elder discusses with publishers need for personal research and study in order to be able to handle ‘the Word of truth aright.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:2:15-55:2:15" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Tim. 2:15</a>) He has heard that the brothers at the Society’s office are getting an increasing number of phone calls and letters asking Bible questions, when oftentimes a little research in the indexes would provide the answers to these questions. Imagine the problem if each of the approximately 600,000 publishers in the United States would write in, asking just one question a year! Good to do personal research or ask help of husband, study conductor or another elder, if necessary. Sister mentions she has trouble finding answers to questions. Group mentions <em>Aid </em>book as good source or <em>Watch Tower Publications Index </em>if specific scripture is involved. Another asks about smoking; not mentioned in <em>Aid </em>book or referred to in Scripture, as it was not a practice in Bible days. Brother explains principles to be found in <em>Index </em>under that topic. Mentions 1976-1980 <em>Index </em>reference, under subhead “addiction,” to <a class="xt" data-xtid="1" href="jwpub://p/E:101978009/1-21">January 8, 1978, <em>Awake!, </em>pages 27-8</a>; briefly discusses key scriptures. Group agrees it is satisfying to do own research and do want to save brothers at the Society unnecessary questions if they can find the answer themselves. Encourage use of congregation library if publications not available at home. Conclude with audience review of Question Box.</p>

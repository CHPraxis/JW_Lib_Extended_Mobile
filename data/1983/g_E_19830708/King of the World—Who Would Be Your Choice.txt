King of the World​—Who Would Be Your Choice?
He’d have to be incorruptible. Unbiased. He’d have to be able to solve the critical problems national leaders haven’t solved for 6,000 years: war, crime, disease, hunger. Impossible?
There is one leader who qualifies. Read his credentials, past record and immediate purpose for ruling the earth.
Please send me, postpaid, the 192-page, hardcover, pocket-size book “Let Your Kingdom Come.” I enclose 75 cents (U.S.).

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">“It is good to give thanks to Jehovah,” wrote the inspired psalmist. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:92:1-19:92:1" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ps. 92:1</a>) We have added reason for doing this in view of the fine August service report that closes out the outstanding 1983 service year. The total of 643,170 publishers represents a 10.5-percent increase over last year’s average. The 23,943 regular pioneers for August is a new peak, the ninth during the past service year. Along with the many, many memorable events and blessings of the 1983 service year, the August report strengthens our resolve to keep on declaring the Kingdom good news with even more determination so as to produce fruitage to God’s glory.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:1:11-50:1:11" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Phil. 1:11</a>.</p>

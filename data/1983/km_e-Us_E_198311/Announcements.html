<p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sn">● <em>1984 Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses: </em>Publishers and pioneers, please order your <em>Yearbooks </em>through your congregation. Congregations should begin collecting requests for these <em>Yearbooks </em>now. Then on November 1, 1983, or as soon as possible thereafter, send this order to the Society using the regular Literature Order form (S-14). The <em>Yearbooks </em>will be available in English, Dutch, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese and Spanish. Until the <em>Yearbooks </em>are available and shipments are made, these will appear as “Back Ordered” on congregation invoices. Congregations should order only the number of <em>Yearbooks </em>for which there are requests. Payment should not accompany the congregation order. The <em>Yearbooks </em>are controlled stock items and will be charged to the literature account at $1.00 each, which is the rate for publishers and the public. (See the 1983 <em>Cost List, </em>paragraphs 22-24.) Regular and special pioneers on the list before July 1, 1983, may receive a free copy for which the congregation may request credit on the Remittance and Credit Request (S-20). Pioneers may obtain additional copies at 25c each. (Note to secretary: Please have announcement made to the congregation when the <em>Yearbooks </em>are received so that all who ordered can obtain their copies.)</p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sn">● The Society has begun publishing <em>Awake! </em>in the Hebrew and Russian languages as quarterly (four issues per year) editions. Congregations may order distributor copies of these magazines. We will not take subscriptions for them since they are quarterly editions. The cost will be the same as for other magazines.</p>

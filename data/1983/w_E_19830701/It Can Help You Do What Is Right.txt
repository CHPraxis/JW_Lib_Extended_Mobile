It Can Help You Do What Is Right
Recently a letter addressed “Dear Publishers” was received at the printing headquarters of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society. It said:
“I have just completed reading your book which is entitled Your Youth​—Getting the Best out of It. I wanted to let you know I thoroughly enjoyed reading it. The book helped me to understand many things in life that puzzle and frighten me.
“Every day I try to do the right things, but oftentimes I fall short of perfection. After I began reading this book, I was tempted by some people who wanted me to go and see some X-rated movies with them. I almost went along, but because of this book I decided not to go and see these movies.
“This book is easy to understand because it gives examples that I can relate to. I am interested in reading more of your books. Please advise me on where I can acquire more of these wonderful books. Thank you!”

Please send me, postpaid, the hardbound, 192-page book Your Youth​—Getting the Best out of It. I enclose 75 cents (U.S.).

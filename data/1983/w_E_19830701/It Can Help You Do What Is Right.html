<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Recently a letter addressed “Dear Publishers” was received at the printing headquarters of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society. It said:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“I have just completed reading your book which is entitled <em>Your Youth​—Getting the Best out of It. </em>I wanted to let you know I thoroughly enjoyed reading it. The book helped me to understand many things in life that puzzle and frighten me.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“Every day I try to do the right things, but oftentimes I fall short of perfection. After I began reading this book, I was tempted by some people who wanted me to go and see some X-rated movies with them. I almost went along, but because of this book I decided not to go and see these movies.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">“This book is easy to understand because it gives examples that I can relate to. I am interested in reading more of your books. Please advise me on where I can acquire more of these wonderful books. Thank you!”</p>

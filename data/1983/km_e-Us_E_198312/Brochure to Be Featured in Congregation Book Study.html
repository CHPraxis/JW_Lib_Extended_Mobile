<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>As announced in the October issue of <em>Our Kingdom Ministry, </em>Congregation Book Studies for the weeks of January 1 through February 5, 1984, will be conducted in the brochure <em>Jehovah’s Witnesses in the Twentieth Century </em>(1979 revised edition). The material in this publication is especially designed to inform inquiring people about Jehovah’s Witnesses—their background, work, beliefs and goals. A careful study of this brochure will help equip us to use it effectively in field service.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>It will be necessary for the study conductors to prepare appropriate questions, since none are provided. Simple questions designed to emphasize the Scriptural basis for our work would be best. Time should be allowed to look up and make application of some of the cited scriptures.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>The study for the week of February 5 has been set aside for considering page 13, dealing with “What Jehovah’s Witnesses Believe.” Forty-two fundamental beliefs are listed along with supporting Scripture texts. In covering this material, we recommend that the conductor state each belief; then comments should be made on the cited Scriptural references, pointing out how they support the belief. Key Scripture texts can be read as time permits.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>The study of this brochure should heighten our own appreciation for Jehovah’s modern-day organization. Endeavor to be present at the Congregation Book Study each week and become equipped to use this information to good advantage in the field ministry.</p>

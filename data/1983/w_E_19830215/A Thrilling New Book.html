<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">That is the immediate impression when one examines <em>You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth. </em>Its rich red cover and some 150 teaching illustrations make it immediately appealing. But then when people begin to read the text itself, they are thrilled by the clearly presented Bible truths it contains. As a reader wrote:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“I have never seen or read a publication more thrilling than this new release because it will be so helpful to honest-hearted persons. I am referring to the fact that it states Bible truths, anticipates commonly held ideas and then deftly pushes these aside with conviction that is irresistible. I learn new ways of presenting Bible truths on almost every page.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">We feel that when you open this new publication you, too, will be excited by its attractive appearance and the clear and easy-to-understand way that it presents difficult Bible subjects.

Unity in a Disunited World
It’s happening
Come and see for yourself . . .
Attend the “KINGDOM UNITY” District Convention
Disunity is bringing the world to the brink of self-destruction, but you can witness something amazing this year.
Millions of people of different nationalities, tribes, languages and races will meet together in hundreds of locations around the world. And they will be UNITED. The united Christian community that will exist for the four days of the convention will mirror the real unity that exists among true Christians worldwide.
Do Not Miss the Experience!
In many locations, missionaries will relate experiences from their assignments, further emphasizing the worldwide unity of true Christians. You will also enjoy the two moving Bible dramas that highlight family unity and God’s support for our Christian work.
Be present at 1:20 p.m. Thursday when the convention program begins. You will receive something you will want to share with others in the community that very evening.
On Friday families with children will benefit from special consideration given to school-related situations. On Friday and Saturday afternoons there will also be a special feature that conventioners will not want to miss. And on Sunday you will enjoy the public talk entitled “Who Are United in This Strife-Torn World?”
Be There All Four Days
Since over a hundred conventions are scheduled in the United States alone, there will be a convention not far from your home. Check with Jehovah’s Witnesses locally for the time and place of the one nearest to you.

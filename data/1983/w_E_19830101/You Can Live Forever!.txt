You Can Live Forever!
An appreciative reader wrote regarding the new book You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth that it is packed full of “life-sustaining truths.”
As a full-time Christian evangelizer who conducts a number of Bible studies with families, she said: “This new book is the answer! It is simple enough for the children to grasp the truth and intelligent enough for the parents to make their decision. It is concise and to the point. It does not beat around the bush! It expresses the ‘Truth’ as it truthfully is. It fills in all the fine points necessary for reaching the hearts of honest-hearted individuals. This new publication is like putting all the Society’s literature in one small volume.”
You, too, will be excited when you open this easy-to-read new book designed for Bible study. In its 256 pages, which are the same size as this magazine but with larger type, it contains some 150 beautiful illustrations, mostly in four colors. These serve as excellent teaching aids that help impress important points on the mind of the reader. Receive your copy by filling in and mailing the accompanying coupon.

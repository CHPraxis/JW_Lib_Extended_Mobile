<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">“I had made up my mind that this morning I was going to commit suicide,” said a woman to her friend over the telephone. She said she was going to get into her car and drive it off the bridge.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">This account was related by the friend to two of Jehovah’s Witnesses as they were calling on her one morning. Continuing, the friend said she proceeded to ask the woman what changed her mind.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“I got ready and walked out my door,” the woman replied. “But as I did so, I found a leaflet that spoke about there being someone who cares, someone who loves you, referring to God.” That leaflet, or tract, stopped her from going through with her plan. But where did it come from?</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">“The leaflet had been left by one of Jehovah’s Witnesses,” the woman explained. It had saved her life!</p>

They Can Powerfully Affect Your Life
Dramatized Bible accounts on cassette tapes can. To illustrate their value, a 13-year-old who had been studying the Bible for only six months wrote:
“Not long ago in school some kids wanted me to go to a Halloween party with them. I told them no because I don’t celebrate Halloween. Then they said, ‘You don’t have to celebrate it if you don’t want to, just come and eat and dance with us.’
“Immediately I thought of that tape [Beware of Losing Faith by Drawing Away From Jehovah] and how the Midianite women were trying to get the Israelite men to go to the festival of their pagan gods. And when they told them that they worshiped the true God, they said, ‘Well, you don’t have to offer sacrifices if you don’t want to. Just come and enjoy the food and the dancing. What could be wrong with that?’ But then the high priest, Phinehas, reminded them that they couldn’t do it without getting involved with their women and their gods. And those that went down to the festival lost their lives. After remembering all of this I knew what to tell them, and I was glad I had made the right decision.
“Thanks so much for your faith-strengthening Bible tapes.”

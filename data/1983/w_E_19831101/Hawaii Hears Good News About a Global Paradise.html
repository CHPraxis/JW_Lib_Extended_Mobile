<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">WAIKIKI Beach, Diamond Head, Pearl Harbor. What do they bring to your mind? Mark Twain described it as “the loveliest fleet of islands that lies anchored in any ocean.” Others have used the expression “the paradise of the Pacific.” Yes, the Hawaiian Islands are well known for their natural beauty​—white and black sand beaches, coconut palms, exotic flowers, volcanic craters, waterfalls, rolling surf and colorful sunsets.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">While many think of Hawaii as being in the South Seas, it is actually more than 1,000 miles (1,600 km) north of the equator in the Pacific Ocean. The entire Hawaiian archipelago is made up of 132 islands, atolls, reefs and rocks, stretching over a distance of some 1,500 miles (2,400 km) northwest to southeast. A multiracial population of 981,000 inhabit seven of the largest islands​—Niihau, Kauai, Oahu, Molokai, Lanai, Maui and Hawaii.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">It is believed that Hawaii was first discovered and settled by Polynesian natives of the Marquesas Islands, followed by the Tahitians. From the Tahitians came the name Hawaii, first given to the largest island of the group and later becoming the name of the whole island chain. Once ruled by a monarchy and called the Kingdom of Hawaii, it is now the 50th state of the United States.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="ss"><strong>Good News Reaches Hawaii</strong></p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">The good news was introduced to these islands in 1915, when “pilgrim” Walter Bundy and his wife, along with Ellis Fox, arrived in Hawaii. They held the first meeting of the Bible Students (as Jehovah’s Witnesses were then called) on the first Sunday in February 1915, with five in attendance. Subsequent pilgrim visits in the early 1920’s played a part in the expansion of true worship in Hawaii. By 1928 the first convention in Hawaii was held at McKinley High School auditorium, with 150 persons attending.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Another milestone was reached in 1935, with the visit of J. F. Rutherford, then president of the Watch Tower Society. Hawaii then had only 12 Kingdom publishers. However, for the newly established <span id="page9" class="pageNum" data-no="9" data-before-text="9"></span>branch in Honolulu, Brother Rutherford approved the purchase of the property at Pensacola and Kinau streets. The preaching work in Hawaii is still directed from this site.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">While here, Brother Rutherford also arranged for the construction of a hall in connection with the new branch building. That meeting place was designated “Kingdom Hall,” and from 1935 onward, Jehovah’s Witnesses worldwide have been calling their meeting places Kingdom Halls.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Six years later, Hawaii and the United States were plunged into World War II as the result of the attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941. A few days after the bombing, soldiers came to the branch and took away Don Haslett, the first branch overseer, for lengthy questioning at army headquarters. He was later released. Despite fuel rationing, curfews and shipping difficulties, the Witnesses continued to put Kingdom interests first. In 1946 the brothers in Hawaii emerged from years of martial law and wartime conditions with a peak of 129 publishers.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">In the postwar years, missionaries trained at the Watchtower Bible School of Gilead began to arrive in Hawaii. Their zealous and whole-souled service brought marvelous increases, and by 1957 Hawaii had reached 1,019 publishers. The fine example of the missionaries also did much to stimulate others, especially the younger ones, to take up the full-time preaching work. A large number of pioneers (full-time Kingdom proclaimers) have left the islands to serve at Brooklyn Bethel, the Society’s headquarters, and in missionary fields in Japan, Taiwan, Micronesia, Samoa, Africa and South America.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="ss"><strong>Giving a Thorough Witness</strong></p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">Hawaii has often been called a melting pot of many races. According to the 1980 census, the population is made up of 26.3 percent Caucasians, 23.5 percent Japanese, 18.9 percent Hawaiians or part Hawaiians and 11.2 percent Filipinos. Included also in this diverse mixture are others, such as Chinese, Koreans, Samoans, Puerto Ricans, blacks and, more recently, Vietnamese, Cambodians and Laotians.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Special efforts are made to preach the good news to those of this great variety of language groups. Already there are Japanese, Korean, Spanish and Samoan <span id="page10" class="pageNum" data-no="10" data-before-text="10"></span>congregations, as well as eight Filipino congregations using the Iloko dialect. When individuals who do not understand English show interest in the good news, they are referred to the appropriate congregation. Even the local telephone directory is used to locate foreign-speaking people. In this way, no stone is left unturned in presenting Kingdom truth to “all sorts of men.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:2:4-54:2:4" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Timothy 2:4</a>.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">In recent years, condominiums and high-rise apartments have sprung up to fill the increasing demand for housing. Congregations have had to use various approaches to see to it that residents of these “lock-outs” receive a witness. One such approach is magazine street work. On certain mornings of the week, publishers are out in front of the condominiums at six o’clock. As tenants leave for work, the <em>Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>magazines are offered. Results of this activity have been gratifying. A pioneer sister relates how a brief morning witness led to a home Bible study:</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="si">“A couple with a baby came out of their condominium and headed for their car. I approached the husband and started to explain why we were there. He was familiar with the magazines and was surprised that we were doing magazine work so early in the morning. He was so happy to see the magazines because he had not got them for a while. . . . I took the opportunity to offer the couple a home Bible study, which they readily accepted, and they gave me their apartment number. After not finding them at home six times, I was finally able to start the study with them. Now, every Sunday my husband and I consider the book <em>The Truth That Leads to Eternal Life </em>with this couple.”</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">Most condominiums have an intercom that allows a visitor to call a resident. Some publishers make use of this arrangement to make some calls, giving a short presentation to anyone who answers.</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">One brother decided to try this method. On the first call he found no one at home. When a man answered the second number he dialed, the brother said: “Good morning. I’m sharing a message of hope found in the Bible, and I’m looking for people who are still interested in God and the Bible.” The man invited the brother to his apartment where over an hour was spent answering his questions.</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">When the brother returned the following week, the man’s wife also was there, with questions of her own. Before agreeing to a home Bible study, the couple decided to observe a meeting at the Kingdom Hall. That Sunday they attended the public talk and <em>Watchtower </em>study. Not only did they enjoy both meetings but they were so impressed by the warmth and friendliness of the Witnesses that they readily agreed to have a home Bible study. They progressed quickly and made changes in their lives. Even though they later moved back to the mainland, the study was continued and within one year they were baptized. The young man is now a ministerial servant, and his wife is a regular pioneer.</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">Rewarding experiences such as these have encouraged the brothers to persevere in using every avenue available to give a thorough witness. This has contributed to a fine coverage of the territory. On an average, congregations work <span id="page11" class="pageNum" data-no="11" data-before-text="11"></span>their assigned area once every four to six weeks, with some doing so every two weeks.</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="ss"><strong>Growth of “Pioneer Spirit”</strong></p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">Over the years the pioneers have been of great help to the congregations. Despite the high cost of living and other economic difficulties, persons from various backgrounds and different age groups have taken up the full-time service. Reports for 1982 indicate that an average of 20 percent of Hawaii’s publishers were in the regular or auxiliary pioneer service, working with almost all the 59 congregations in the state.</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">One of these congregations has 95 publishers and 29 pioneers. An elder in that congregation, who has been pioneering for 20 years (17 of those years as a special pioneer), says this about how he helps others to take up the pioneer work:</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="si">“An advantage of being a pioneer as well as an elder is that I am able to work with the publishers in the field service each day and get to know them and their circumstances well. . . . But before working with someone to encourage him to pioneer, I always make it a point to pray for Jehovah’s direction and guidance to say the right things and for Jehovah’s spirit to be on the publisher to open his heart. With Jehovah’s help I try to reach the person’s heart, explaining from the Scriptures the urgency of the times, the importance of the preaching work, why pioneers are needed and how pioneering would be of great help to him.</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="si">“If he feels he can’t spend 90 hours a month in the preaching work, I go over a practical schedule with him, showing how 90 hours can be met, with time left over for himself and other responsibilities he might have.</p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="si">“If he lacks confidence because of the economic situation, from the Society’s publications I share with him experiences of those in similar circumstances who are now pioneering. Additionally, I use scriptures that would help him draw closer to Jehovah and that would give him the needed encouragement to look on the positive side.</p>
<p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="si">“When he feels that he will be without transportation or other assistance, I assure him that all the brothers and sisters in the congregation will help him in any way possible to enjoy the pioneer service. Negative thinking is thus removed by the practical solutions offered.”</p>
<p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb">Among the 90 whom this elder has assisted to enroll as pioneers are brothers and sisters now serving at Brooklyn Bethel and as missionaries in Japan and Micronesia. In conclusion the elder makes this observation: “The main thing is to work with different ones in the field and to instill the ‘pioneer spirit’ in the congregation.”</p>
<p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="ss"><strong>Rejoicing Over Progress</strong></p>
<p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="sb">Much has been accomplished since that first meeting held in Honolulu in 1915. On March 29 of this year, on the occasion of the Memorial of Jesus’ death, the total attendance for the islands of Hawaii was 14,151, an increase of 9 percent over 1982. As a peak, 4,937 Kingdom publishers were busy in the field during July 1983. Over a million hours are being spent in the Christian ministry each year. The branch in Hawaii is now able to report that the ratio of publishers to the population is approximately 1 to 200 persons in the state. The growth is truly a reflection of the 68 years of Jehovah’s blessing on the preaching activity.</p>
<p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="sb">There is still a great deal to be done in these beautiful islands. The field is still fruitful. With joyfulness, the Kingdom proclaimers in the islands of Hawaii invite others: “Come, . . . let us go up to the mountain of Jehovah . . . and he will instruct us about his ways.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:2:3-23:2:3" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Isaiah 2:3</a>) It is hoped that many more will respond to this invitation and thus be privileged to live at the time when not only Hawaii but the entire earth will be transformed into a Paradise.</p>

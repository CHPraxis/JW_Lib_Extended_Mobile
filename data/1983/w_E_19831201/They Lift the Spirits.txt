They Lift the Spirits
Certain music really can. Many people, for example, say that the Kingdom Melodies do. These are recorded on cassette tapes. One woman wrote:
“They’re a real lift to listen to when I’m doing housework​—whoever thought I’d be joyful while folding laundry? I plan to play this music when I find my spirits down. The music has such an exhilarating effect! I am so delighted with the various types of melody. Some are light and bouncy, others strong and supportive. But most of all, every song evokes happiness.”

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Certain music really can. Many people, for example, say that the Kingdom Melodies do. These are recorded on cassette tapes. One woman wrote:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“They’re a real lift to listen to when I’m doing housework​—whoever thought I’d be joyful while folding laundry? I plan to play this music when I find my spirits down. The music has such an exhilarating effect! I am so delighted with the various types of melody. Some are light and bouncy, others strong and supportive. But most of all, every song evokes happiness.”</p>

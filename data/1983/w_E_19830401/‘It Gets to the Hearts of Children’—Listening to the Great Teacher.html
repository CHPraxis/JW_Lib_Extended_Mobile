<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“I would like you to know that the pink book <em>Listening to the Great Teacher </em>really does manage to get to the hearts of young children. My daughter is always reading the <em>Teacher </em>book and quite often my son Paul reads his.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“I must congratulate you and your staff on how you have compiled the book. My two children, Paul 11 years old and Dawn Caroline 9 1/2 years old, are truly delighted with their books. It is also making my job easier, ours being a one-parent family, because the books are guiding them to the straight paths.”</p>

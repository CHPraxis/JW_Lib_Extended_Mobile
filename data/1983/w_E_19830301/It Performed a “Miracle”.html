<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A 29-year-old woman wrote: “I do not have children but my sister has two young sons. She being an atheist, I didn’t think she would take <em>My Book of Bible Stories, </em>but she did very reluctantly. I had tried to reason with her on the existence of God but nothing helped. A few weeks after I gave her the <em>Bible Stories </em>book she called me and said she read it from cover to cover.”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">What was the result? “She now takes our Bible literature,” her sister relates. “This beautiful book performed this miracle so that I now have a greater hope that some day she will love our heavenly Father with me.”</p>

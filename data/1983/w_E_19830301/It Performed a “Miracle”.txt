It Performed a “Miracle”
A 29-year-old woman wrote: “I do not have children but my sister has two young sons. She being an atheist, I didn’t think she would take My Book of Bible Stories, but she did very reluctantly. I had tried to reason with her on the existence of God but nothing helped. A few weeks after I gave her the Bible Stories book she called me and said she read it from cover to cover.”
What was the result? “She now takes our Bible literature,” her sister relates. “This beautiful book performed this miracle so that I now have a greater hope that some day she will love our heavenly Father with me.”
My Book of Bible Stories has been helping millions of people to come to a better appreciation of God’s Word. It contains 116 Bible accounts that give the reader an idea of what the Bible is all about. The book has large type and over 125 pictures, most of them in beautiful color. You can receive this valuable 256-page publication by filling in and mailing the accompanying coupon.
Please send me, postpaid, the hardbound book My Book of Bible Stories, for which I enclose $2.50 (U.S.).

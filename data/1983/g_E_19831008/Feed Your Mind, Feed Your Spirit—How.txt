Feed Your Mind, Feed Your Spirit​—How?
Would you pay $7 to learn how alcoholism can be overcome? What the secret of happiness is? What the design in nature proves? How TV serials can corrupt your heart? Why we can be confident the time will soon come when no one will say, “I am sick”?
These are just a few of the thought-provoking subjects covered in the Watchtower and Awake! magazines last year. Do not miss the next issues. It is a rich and strengthening spiritual diet. After all, man does not live by bread alone.
Please send a year’s subscription for the Watchtower and Awake! magazines. I enclose $7 (U.S.) for 48 issues.

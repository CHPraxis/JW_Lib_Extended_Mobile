<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A young man who accepted some magazines published by the Watch Tower Society explained why he could not refuse them. “A few years ago I was in Florence, Italy, taking exams in a contest for a job,” he said. “The day before an exam I was told that we would have to do an essay on the problem of pollution.”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">That evening, the man noted, his landlady gave him some magazines, including <em>Awake! </em>When he saw that <em>Awake! </em>featured the problem of pollution, he said: “My fatigue immediately vanished and I read those articles until I knew them by heart. The next day I went to take the exam and did my essay. The board of examiners, formed by high-ranking army officers and university lecturers analyzed it and then congratulated me for my knowledge in this field. Actually I had simply written down the facts obtained from the magazine​—thanks to <em>Awake! </em>I won the job.”</p>

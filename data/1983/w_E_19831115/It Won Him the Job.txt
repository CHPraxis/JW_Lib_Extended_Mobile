It Won Him the Job
A young man who accepted some magazines published by the Watch Tower Society explained why he could not refuse them. “A few years ago I was in Florence, Italy, taking exams in a contest for a job,” he said. “The day before an exam I was told that we would have to do an essay on the problem of pollution.”
That evening, the man noted, his landlady gave him some magazines, including Awake! When he saw that Awake! featured the problem of pollution, he said: “My fatigue immediately vanished and I read those articles until I knew them by heart. The next day I went to take the exam and did my essay. The board of examiners, formed by high-ranking army officers and university lecturers analyzed it and then congratulated me for my knowledge in this field. Actually I had simply written down the facts obtained from the magazine​—thanks to Awake! I won the job.”
Awake! is for the enlightenment of the entire family. It shows how to cope with today’s problems. It reports the news, tells about people in many lands, examines religion and science. But it does more. It probes beneath the surface and points to the real meaning behind current events. You, too, can benefit from this magazine published in 51 languages and read by millions of people.
Please send a year’s subscription for Awake! I enclose $3.50 (U.S.) for 24 issues of this magazine (2 copies a month).

Question Box
● Should the Theocratic Ministry School be conducted before the Service Meeting on the day that these two meetings are held, or is this left for the elders to decide?
Some elders have written to the Society asking if it is permissible for them to schedule the Service Meeting first on the evening that the Theocratic Ministry School and Service Meeting are held. Some congregations apparently have made this arrangement. We encourage all congregations to have the Theocratic Ministry School first, followed by the Service Meeting. The way the Service Meetings are outlined in Our Kingdom Ministry indicates this preference. The outline shows a song with no prayer at the beginning of the Service Meeting, indicating that this is not expected to be the first meeting for the evening. The outline concludes the Service Meeting with a song and prayer, indicating the close of the program for the day’s meeting.
We recognize there may be some advantages to having the Service Meeting first. However, after reviewing various reasons presented, we feel that the arrangement outlined herein is the best overall. We feel that it is best to end the two meetings with the fine encouragement contained in the Service Meeting.
If congregations have arranged to have the Service Meeting first, we encourage them to make adjustments in harmony with what is outlined here. We want to maintain a uniform arrangement wherever this is possible. All should be urged to be in attendance at both meetings. Encourage everyone to be there to share in the opening song and prayer and to remain to benefit from the closing prayer.

It Helps Her Husband
Do you have members of your household you would like to help in a spiritual way? There now is a powerful source of help, as shown by letters received, like the following one:
“I just couldn’t contain my happiness any more about the new book You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth. It is so great I felt I just had to write. I was baptized in December 1981 and appreciated this book for myself, of course. But my husband, who had tried to listen to other books but just couldn’t get interested, has been listening almost every night to a chapter and he loves it! The style of writing is so appealing, so logical, so interesting that it’s a real pleasure to see what’s coming in the next chapter! Thank you so much again for this fine book.”
Already, in just a year, over 12 million copies of this new book have been printed in more than 30 languages. Get your copy and you will understand why it is so popular.
Please send, postpaid, the 256-page, hardbound book You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth. I enclose $2.50 (U.S.).

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Lloyd S. Etheredge, associate professor of political science at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, stated not long ago: “Col. Edward House, who was a senior political adviser to Woodrow Wilson, was once asked about his unfailing courtesy to other people . . . The colonel explained that he had grown up in the Old West when most people you dealt with packed six-guns. Under those conditions, he thought, people learned fast that being arrogant was not very smart.”</p>

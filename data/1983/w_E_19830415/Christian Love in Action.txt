Christian Love in Action
THE Philippines is a country that is repeatedly struck by typhoons and heavy monsoon rains, which, from time to time, result in heavy flooding. At such times what is truly appreciated is Christian love in action, as the following experience illustrates.
In the southern municipality of Carmen, Davao del Norte, Jehovah’s Witnesses in the Mabuhay Congregation were not severely affected by a flood. However, they responded at once to the needs of their Christian brothers in the town proper who were seriously affected. Rice and other foodstuffs were gathered together and taken there. When the needs of the brothers in the affected area had been met, there was so much left over that the remaining supplies were given to the town officials for distribution to other needy individuals.
Such loving concern prompted the town officials to make a resolution of commendation to Jehovah’s Witnesses, which reads, in part, as follows:
“WHEREAS, the Jehovah’s Witnesses of Mabuhay, . . . upon knowing the plight of the flood victims of this municipality, . . . immediately extended food assistance in order to alleviate them from their hardship and miseries;
“BE IT RESOLVED, . . . to pass a Resolution expressing the highest degree of thanks and gratitude to the Jehovah’s Witnesses of Mabuhay . . . for the food assistance they have extended to the flood victims.”
How heartwarming it is to hear of genuine Christians who, in times of need, respond with not “words and talk” but with “true love, which shows itself in action”!​—1 John 3:18, Today’s English Version.

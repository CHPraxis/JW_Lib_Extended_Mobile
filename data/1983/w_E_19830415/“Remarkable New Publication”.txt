“Remarkable New Publication”
That is what readers have been saying of the new book You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth. A woman from Pennsylvania wrote:
“I am absolutely stunned by this remarkable new publication . . . The pictures are exactly right and perfect in color and drawing to match the sheer reasonableness of the arguments. And being rather a ‘perfectionist’ by nature, I’m not easily impressed.”

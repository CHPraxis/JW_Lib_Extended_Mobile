Memorial Plans
1 On Tuesday, March 29, after sundown, we expect upwards of a million and a half people to meet with us in the United States to commemorate the most important event that ever took place on earth. This is the Memorial of the death of Jesus. (Luke 22:19) Are we planning now in such a way as to demonstrate our appreciation for the significance of that event?
2 Here is a list of some things to be cared for in advance (1Â Cor. 14:40):
(1) Are there any special needs for cleaning and repairs so that the Kingdom Hall will reflect well on the importance of the occasion?
(2) Is there need for adjustments or additions to the seating arrangements?
(3) Has someone been assigned to obtain the bread and the wine? Also, have the attendants and brothers who will serve the Memorial emblems been assigned and instructed?
(4) Final arrangements for the Memorial speaker.
(5) Reminders to all to invite relatives, Bible students, inactive ones and others.
(6) Encouragement for all to increase personal field service activity and, for those who can, to enroll as auxiliary pioneers during the months of March and April.
3 It was pleasurable to see the response to the Memorial in 1982. We had an all-time peak attendance of 1,499,284. In April we also had an all-time peak in auxiliary pioneers of over 75,000. What will 1983 bring? May Jehovah bless our diligent efforts as we plan for this most important event.

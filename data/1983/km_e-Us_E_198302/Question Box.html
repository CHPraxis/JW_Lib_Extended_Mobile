<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"><strong>● What factors should be considered in selecting homes for use as book study locations?</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">What a fine privilege it is to have a Congregation Book Study in one’s home! The book study is an extension of the congregation and is appropriately viewed as a part of Jehovah’s arrangement to instruct his people. At times, new or additional locations are needed due to some homes no longer being available or due to expansion. Any in the congregation who desire to volunteer their home as a book study location should inform the elders. Even if your home is not chosen, you can be confident that your offer was greatly appreciated.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Besides considering the convenience of location, the elders should also give some thought to the matter of safety. After choosing what appear to be the best locations, arrange for and encourage the brothers to travel together so as to assist one another. We are always grateful for whatever accommodations the brothers are able to provide. Good judgment should be exercised to see that the Congregation Book Studies are in the best possible locations.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The home that is neat and orderly is always appreciated. When there is sufficient light and ventilation, this is good. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:20:8-44:20:8" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Acts 20:8</a>) The family whose home is used should themselves be setting a good example. It is preferable not to meet in a home where there is a possibility of coming in contact with a disfellowshipped person or one opposed to the truth. Also, there is usually some preparation needed each week before the study, such as setting up chairs, and we appreciate those who take care of such necessary matters.</p>

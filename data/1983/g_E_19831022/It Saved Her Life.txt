It Saved Her Life
An 18-year-old who had become involved in all kinds of trouble wrote:
“I lost all hope. I felt so helpless. I tried to take my life many times. But you know what saved me from doing that? The publication Happiness​—How to Find It. Tears just fall from my eyes every time I think of how this publication made me happy.”
This 192-page book can benefit you too. It provides the best possible advice on dealing with problems involving money, sex, family, sickness and death.
Please send me, postpaid, the hardbound book Happiness​—How to Find It, for which I enclose 75 cents (U.S.).

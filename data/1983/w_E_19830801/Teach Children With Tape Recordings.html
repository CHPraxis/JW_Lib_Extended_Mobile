<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">The minds of children are like sponges. They absorb what they hear, and they <em>repeat </em>what they hear. How fine it is when they <em>want </em>to listen to what is wholesome and beneficial! Parents who have obtained the cassette tapes of <em>My Book of Bible Stories </em>are now enjoying this experience. The tapes of this marvelous publication really hold young ones’ attention, as a mother from New York State explains:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“My 17-month-old son loves to listen to them. Whenever he stops at the end of the tape he will start complaining and pointing to the tape recorder for more.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“My daughter, who has just turned three, has benefited greatly from them. She can tell the experience of David and Goliath; she even gruffs up her voice when Goliath is supposed to be speaking, just as the speaker on the tape does. And she can tell me so many more of the stories, which surprises me each day.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">“Now when I read <em>My Book of Bible Stories </em>to them, my 17-month-old son will listen and my three-year-old daughter will say many of the sentences with me. All because she remembers from <em>My Book of Bible Stories </em>tapes.”</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Since the tapes of the 116 Bible accounts of <em>My Book of Bible Stories </em>give the listener an idea of what the Bible is all about, what a truly marvelous way this is to teach young ones! The album with the four cassettes is only $8.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Please send me, postpaid, the brown vinyl album with the four cassette tapes of <em>My Book of Bible Stories. </em>I enclose $8 (U.S.).</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">“I WILL never visit this country again,” said the man sitting next to me in an opera house in Leningrad, U.S.S.R. He had just finished relating some irritating experiences he had had while touring the Soviet Union and was blaming the country for them. At the time I agreed with him, having had some uncomfortable experiences there myself. But, really, who was to blame​—the country or the tourist? May you be the judge.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="ss"><strong><em>Camera Etiquette in Russia</em></strong></p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">As we traveled in from Finland, the first Soviet town my friends and I stopped at was Vyborg. We were to go into the train station to rest or to change some of the currency. But, since this was my first opportunity to see the typical Russian in his environment, I could not resist the temptation to take a few photographs of the crowds of people walking up and down the sidewalk.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Two soldiers were walking toward me among the crowd as I shot the picture. But by the time I put my camera down, they were right in front of me, staring at my camera. One of them pointed at it and made some quick, sharp gestures. It was obvious that they wanted me to open the camera, but since they were not specific and had not said a word, I gave them a puzzled look to try to discourage them. They simply repeated the same gestures, this time in a firmer way. I could see they were getting impatient, so I opened my camera, thinking that all they wanted was to expose the film to light. I was hoping that at least some of the pictures I had already taken would survive the exposure. What a surprise when they seized the whole roll of pictures I had taken for the past two days!</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">My first reaction was to blame the country for this incident. But who should take the blame? A little research on my part prior to my visit would have been enough to learn about Russian regulations on picture taking. When traveling abroad it is good to keep in mind that many nations forbid photographs in certain sensitive places or circumstances. One travel guidebook on Russia simply states: “Don’t photograph anything that is clearly a ‘sensitive’ installation​—airports, factories, military installations or personnel, prisons, railway junctions or stations, . . . etc.” And ‘don’t photograph people before asking their permission.’ So there I was, taking a picture of soldiers in a train station! Who should be blamed for this embarrassing situation​—the country or the tourist? A little reading on the local customs and regulations <span id="page16" class="pageNum" data-no="16" data-before-text="16"></span>would have spared me embarrassment. But there were more surprises coming my way.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="ss"><strong><em>Museums​—How to Get In</em></strong></p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">We were now in Leningrad, called by some the Venice of the North. Our visit to the Winter Palace reminded me that it was there that the last czar ruled. It was also there that the first Soviet (from the Russian word meaning “council”) government established its headquarters. It was a thrilling experience for me to be standing on the exact location where some of the most important events in Russian history took place. Right before our eyes was one of the most famous art museums in the world, the Hermitage, where one can see outstanding paintings by da Vinci, El Greco, Titian, Rubens, Velázquez, Van Dyck, Rembrandt and others. But imagine how disappointed we were to learn that the Hermitage was not included in our tour.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">The same was the case with the Kanzansky Cathedral on Nevsky Prospect, now converted into the Museum of the History of Religion and Atheism. After inquiring we found out that we could try to visit the latter on our own. One day we walked over to find a large crowd of people trying to get in. Once in a while the doors would open and only certain ones were admitted. We tried to decipher the system but gave up and finally got in only after some arguing with the doorkeeper. Who should be blamed?</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">In a recent conversation with a Soviet government official stationed in New York, I found out that even though museums might be crowded on some days, all a foreigner has to do is show his passport to the doorkeeper and he will be admitted without having to stand in line, and sometimes even free of charge. Regrettably, at the time I was in Russia I did not know this and I paid the price of not being prepared for my travel into a different country. Honestly, now I have no choice but to blame myself, the tourist.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="ss"><strong><em>What About Shopping?</em></strong></p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">The mistake that many tourists make is to expect exactly the same circumstances abroad that they have in their home country. That happened to us one day when we decided to go out to buy some groceries on the nearby Nevsky Prospect. It did not turn out to be as easy as we thought it would be. After trying several stores we still couldn’t figure out the procedure to follow to make a purchase. We tried making gestures and pointing out exactly what we wanted, but it didn’t work. Finally, after two hours and several stores, we were able to get a loaf of bread and some cheese!</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Some months later I read in a travel guidebook how the shopping system works in the U.S.S.R.: “You will find that you have to line up three times​—first to pick out what you want to buy and collect a ticket, then at the cashier’s desk to pay and get the ticket stamped, and finally to collect your purchase.” Yes, the information was there available, but it was of little use for me to read it after the trip was over. The time for getting acquainted with the country you will visit is not after, nor during, but <em>before </em>you visit it.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="ss"><strong><em>The Language Barrier</em></strong></p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">It is obvious that most of these occurrences would never have happened if I had spoken the language. Of course, no <span id="page17" class="pageNum" data-no="17" data-before-text="17"></span>one is expected to learn the language before visiting Russia, or any other country. But if one has the opportunity, it surely helps to learn the basics. At least, a pocket phrase-book should be a must. You can always point at words when trying to communicate.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">The language barrier was the cause for some of my frustrations in Russia. But why blame the country for that? It is good to recognize that the same frustrations are sometimes experienced by tourists that visit one’s own country.</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="ss"><strong><em>Illegal Activities</em></strong></p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">Some tourists end up going through very embarrassing situations because of purposely engaging in illegal activities just to make some easy money. This shows lack of respect for those who have opened a hospitable door into their country.</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">More than once we were approached by men who tried to buy some of our clothes or our currency. I remember one coming to me, asking, “Don’t you have anything at all to sell?” No wonder travel books warn not to deal with the black market, whether it involves currency, clothing, cameras or something else.</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">Although many others did, we, being Jehovah’s Witnesses, never cooperated with the black market nor knowingly participated in any other illegal activity. (The camera incident was due to ignorance on our part.) As Christians we have to show respect for the local authorities. We ‘render to Caesar what is Caesar’s.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:22:21-40:22:21" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matthew 22:21</a>) If one is in doubt about anything, perhaps it would be better to follow this rule: If you are not certain something is permitted, it is safer to assume it is definitely forbidden. Such an attitude serves as a protection when traveling, regardless of the country one visits.</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="ss"><strong><em>What Is Your Verdict?</em></strong></p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">So, now, what is your verdict? Who is to blame​—Russia or the tourist? No doubt the tourist, and not the country, should take the greater blame. And this is probably the case with many others who have visited Russia and other countries having cultural and governmental differences. The fact of the matter is that many travelers, although well prepared in other ways, may not be ready to come in contact with a foreign country. So, when preparing for your next trip abroad, ask yourself: How much do I know about the people I will meet, their language and customs? You may find that although your luggage may be ready your mind may not be.</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">But you might ask, is all this information really available? Yes, and in what an abundant way! For example, if you are traveling to the U.S.S.R. you will find that the Intourist Travel Agency, owned and operated by the Soviet government, has offices in most countries and is willing to help in whatever way it can. From it you can get official data on the latest regulations, as well as other useful information.</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">Guidebooks on travel to many countries are also abundant and available in many bookstores and libraries. Why not read one on the country you are planning to visit <em>before </em>making your trip? It will help you to enjoy your vacation, avoid unnecessary embarrassment and even return without having a precious roll of film confiscated!</p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">So, next time you go through an irritating experience while vacationing abroad, whom will you blame? The country or yourself?​—<em>Contributed.</em></p>

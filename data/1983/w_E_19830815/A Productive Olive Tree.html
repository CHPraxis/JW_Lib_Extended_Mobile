<p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu"> 1. What can be said about olive trees?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb">OLIVE trees are known to grow for hundreds of years. Even when the aged, often hollow, trunk finally dies, new stems sometimes spring from the roots, producing one or more new olive trees. Be that as it may, there exists an olive tree that was planted nearly 4,000 years ago and that is still alive and producing fruit today!</p>
<p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu"> 2. In connection with what promise does Paul speak of the olive tree, and what does it illustrate?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>In his letter to the Romans, the apostle Paul uses the olive tree as an illustration of the wonderful manner in which Jehovah fulfills part of a promise He made to Abraham centuries before:</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="si">“I shall surely bless you and I shall surely multiply your seed like the stars of the heavens and like the grains of sand that are on the seashore; and your seed will take possession of the gate of his enemies. And by means of your seed all nations of the earth will certainly bless themselves due to the fact that you have listened to my voice.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:22:16-1:22:18" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Genesis 22:16-18</a>.</p>

<p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="qu"> 3, 4. (a) How had Abraham just proved his faith? (b) What was prefigured by this episode?</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>Abraham had just proved that he was willing to sacrifice Isaac, his only son by his first wife, Sarah.

From earliest times Christians have seen in this episode a prefiguration of Jehovah’s sacrificing his Son and then receiving him back by means of the resurrection. Yes, “God loved the world [of mankind] so much that he gave his only-begotten Son, in order that <em>everyone exercising faith in him </em>might not be destroyed but have everlasting life.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:3:16-43:3:16" data-bid="5-1" class="b">John 3:16</a>.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>So in this prophetic picture Abraham prefigured Jehovah God, and Isaac​—a young man who could have resisted his 125-year-old father—​pictured Jesus Christ, who willingly laid down his human life as the ransom sacrifice.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:7:27-58:7:27" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Hebrews 7:27;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:10:12-58:10:12" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 10:12</a>.</p>

<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>Because of Abraham’s great faith, Jehovah had earlier made with him a covenant that took effect in 1943 B.C.E.

This fully expressed Abrahamic covenant supplied details as to the outworking of God’s <span id="page15" class="pageNum" data-no="15" data-before-text="15"></span>wonderful purposes. It showed that the seed of deliverance promised in Eden would appear on earth as a descendant of Abraham, that it would be a multiple seed (the precise number not being revealed at that time), that it would vanquish its enemies and, finally, that by means of that seed all nations of the earth would get blessings for themselves.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:3:15-1:3:15" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Genesis 3:15</a>.</p>

<p id="p50" data-pid="50" class="qu"> 6, 7. (a) Scripturally, who is the primary Seed of Abraham? (b) How do we know that there was to be a secondary seed of Abraham? (c) When was the exact number revealed, and what was it?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup>Every detail of that promise is of interest to persons who share Abraham’s faith and who want to be blessed by Jehovah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:4:16-45:4:16" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Romans 4:16</a>) Who, primarily, was the seed of Abraham, by means of whom all nations of the earth would eventually bless themselves? The apostle Paul identifies this primary Seed as being Christ.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:3:16-48:3:16" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Galatians 3:16</a>.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><sup>7 </sup>Further, since Jehovah promised Abraham that he would multiply his seed, what persons would make up the secondary part of Abraham’s seed? Who would be the “heirs with reference to a promise,” “joint heirs” with the primary Seed, Christ?

<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><sup>8 </sup>Still, from among whom would these 144,000 “sons of Israel” be chosen and sealed? If sufficient fleshly Israelites had followed the Law covenant as a “tutor leading to Christ [the primary Seed of Abraham],” they could have supplied the entire 144,000 members of the secondary seed of Abraham and thus become “a kingdom of priests and a holy nation,” for the blessing of all nations of the earth.

<p id="p52" data-pid="52" class="qu"> 9. How did John the Baptizer show that the spiritual seed of Abraham would not necessarily be composed exclusively of Jews?</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[52]" class="sb"><sup>9 </sup>Even before Jesus began his earthly ministry John the Baptizer warned Jewish religious leaders: “Do not presume to say to yourselves, ‘As a father we have Abraham.’ For I say to you that God is able to raise up children to Abraham from these stones. Already the ax is lying at the root of the trees; every tree, then, that does not produce fine fruit is to be cut down and thrown into the fire.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:3:9-40:3:10" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Matthew 3:9, 10</a>) By Paul’s time the wonderfully wise manner in which Jehovah would raise up the full number of the secondary seed of Abraham had been revealed.

<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[53]" class="sb"><sup>10 </sup>The Jews were very conscious of being God’s chosen people. Regarding the expression “chosen people,” <em>The Concise Jewish Encyclopedia </em>states: “A designation expressing the belief that the Jews have a special relationship with God. The concept is based on the covenant with Abraham.” Proud of being Abraham’s offspring, the Jews thought they were the seed whereby all other nations would be blessed, and that they could justify themselves before God by <span id="page16" class="pageNum" data-no="16" data-before-text="16"></span>works carried out under the Law covenant.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:8:33-43:8:33" data-bid="18-1" class="b">John 8:33,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:8:39-43:8:39" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> 39;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:9:31-45:9:32" data-bid="18-3" class="b"> Romans 9:31, 32;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:10:3-45:10:4" data-bid="18-4" class="b"> 10:3, 4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:11:7-45:11:7" data-bid="18-5" class="b"> 11:7</a>.</p>

<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[54]" class="sb"><sup>11 </sup>It was against this background that the apostle Paul wrote to the Christian congregation in Rome. Some of the Jews in Rome had become Christians, but by far the majority of them refused to put faith in Jesus as the Messiah. The Christian congregation in Rome was made up also of many non-Jewish Christians.</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[54]" class="sb"><sup>12 </sup>For different reasons both Jews and Gentiles had feelings of superiority​—the Jews because they came from the original Abrahamic stock—​the Gentiles because they had been admitted into special Abrahamic-covenant privileges as a result of lack of faith on the part of the unbelieving Jews. Paul sought to convince Christians of Jewish and non-Jewish origin that both groups owed their righteous standing before God to their faith in Christ rather than to works. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:3:21-45:3:27" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Romans 3:21-27</a>) In writing his letter, Paul’s aim was Christian unity and productivity, to the glory of Jehovah for the wonderful manner in which he moves forward in fulfilling the promises of the Abrahamic covenant.</p>

<p id="p55" data-pid="55" class="qu">13. Why did Paul express grief, and what did he illustrate by means of a cultivated olive tree?</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[55]" class="sb"><sup>13 </sup>The apostle Paul expresses grief that “not all who spring from Israel are really ‘Israel,’” and states: “Neither because they are Abraham’s seed are they all children [part of Abraham’s spiritual seed].” Then he goes on to illustrate how Jehovah ‘raises up children to Abraham.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:9:1-45:9:2" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Romans 9:1, 2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:9:6-45:9:7" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> 6, 7</a>) To describe how the Abrahamic covenant produces the full number of members of the spiritual seed of promise, he uses the symbol of a specially cultivated olive tree.​—Please read <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:11:13-45:11:26" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Romans 11:13-26</a>.</p>

<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[56]" class="sb"><sup>14 </sup>Paul mentions the root before speaking of the tree itself, and he says “the root is holy.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:11:16-45:11:16" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Romans 11:16</a>) Jehovah God is the “Most Holy One.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/28:11:12-28:11:12" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Hosea 11:12</a>) He is frequently called “the Holy One of Israel,” particularly in the book of Isaiah.

<p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[57]" class="sb"><sup>15 </sup>As the patriarch Abraham was the root of the nation of Israel, so Jehovah gives life to spiritual Israel. As the 12 tribes of Israel stemmed from Abraham through his son Isaac, through Jacob and the 12 patriarchs, the 12 symbolic tribes of spiritual Israel stem from Jehovah through the Greater Isaac, Christ Jesus. He, as the primary Seed of Abraham, is symbolized by the olive tree’s stock, or trunk. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:3:16-48:3:16" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Galatians 3:16</a>) Jehovah, the root, produces the full number of members of the secondary seed through his Son, Christ Jesus. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:3:29-48:3:29" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Galatians 3:29</a>) But how or in what manner does Jehovah produce the required number of symbolic branches?</p>

<p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[58]" class="sb"><sup>16 </sup>Paul goes on to explain this wonderful arrangement.

Jehovah would “raise up children to Abraham” by admitting into the secondary seed of Abraham the required number, or “full number of people of the nations [Gentiles].” By showing “the faith of Abraham” this limited number of non-Jews would prove to be spiritual Jews, part of spiritual Israel, “the Israel of God.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:4:16-45:4:16" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Romans 4:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:2:28-45:2:29" data-bid="30-2" class="b"> 2:28, 29;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:6:15-48:6:16" data-bid="30-3" class="b"> Galatians 6:15, 16</a>.</p>

<p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[59]" class="sb"><sup>17 </sup>Paul illustrated the outworking of this “sacred secret” by an unusual horticultural procedure. The normal procedure is to graft shoots from a cultivated tree onto a wild stock, in order to make it productive, as Paul was well aware. He told the Gentile Christians that they had been “grafted contrary to nature into the garden olive tree.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:11:24-45:11:24" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Romans 11:24</a>) He thus likened the non-Jews who would be admitted into the Abrahamic covenant to scions, or shoots, from a wild olive that would be grafted onto the trunk of a “garden olive tree.” They would replace the natural branches that had been lopped off, these representing the fleshly Jews who had been rejected because of their lack of faith. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:11:17-45:11:17" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Romans 11:17,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:11:19-45:11:20" data-bid="32-2" class="b"> 19, 20,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:11:24-45:11:24" data-bid="32-3" class="b"> 24</a>) This unusual illustration served as a forceful exposure of the proud and haughty <span id="page18" class="pageNum" data-no="18" data-before-text="18"></span>unbelieving Jews, who considered the Gentiles to be as lifeless as stones or as incapable of producing fine fruit as wild olive branches.

<div id="fn1" class="fcc"><p id="p32" data-pid="32">“καὶ οὕτως = and thus; not merely temporal.” (<em>The Expositor’s Greek Testament</em>) Compare <em>Today’s English Version </em>(“and this is how”), <em>Authorized Version, Revised Standard Version </em>and <em>New International Version </em>(“and so”). Those who believe in the ultimate conversion and salvation of the entire Jewish nation make <em>kai houʹtos </em>mean “and then,” timewise. (See <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:11:26-45:11:26" data-bid="41-1" class="b">Romans 11:26</a>, <em>The Jerusalem Bible.</em>) Many of Christendom’s Bible commentaries give this interpretation, even though it goes against Paul’s whole line of reasoning and against the facts of history, past and present.​—Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:2:28-45:2:29" data-bid="42-1" class="b">Romans 2:28, 29;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:9:1-45:9:6" data-bid="42-2" class="b"> 9:1-6,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:9:27-45:9:27" data-bid="42-3" class="b"> 27;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:10:1-45:10:1" data-bid="42-4" class="b"> 10:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:10:21-45:10:21" data-bid="42-5" class="b"> 21;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:11:5-45:11:5" data-bid="42-6" class="b"> 11:5,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:11:7-45:11:10" data-bid="42-7" class="b"> 7-10,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:11:14-45:11:14" data-bid="42-8" class="b"> 14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:13:45-44:13:46" data-bid="42-9" class="b"> Acts 13:45, 46</a>.</p></div>

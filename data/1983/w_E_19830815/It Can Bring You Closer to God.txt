It Can Bring You Closer to God
That is what one person said regarding the publication Happiness​—How to Find It. She wrote:
“Just had to take out a few minutes from a busy day to say thanks in ink! My heart is feeling a closeness that I’ve never felt for our Father Jehovah. Why? It is due to reading the Happiness book. The book is compiled in a most heart-stirring manner.”

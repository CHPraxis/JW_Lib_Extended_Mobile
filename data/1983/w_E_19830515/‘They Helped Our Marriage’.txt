‘They Helped Our Marriage’
THAT WAS the comment of Glenn, a Louisiana man. “When I first met Glenn,” writes one of Jehovah’s Witnesses, “he was underneath his pickup truck, but he got out and gave good attention to my presentation. Without any resistance he accepted subscriptions to the Watchtower and Awake! magazines. Weeks went by before we could find anyone at home again. Finally we met his wife, who said: ‘Yes, he told me about subscribing to those magazines. I was surprised because he never subscribes to anything. But they have started to arrive and, boy are they good! We read them at night together. When they run out, we’ll surely renew them!’
“We arranged to call back when both husband and wife would be home, and they were waiting for us at the appointed time. We started a Bible study. Glenn commented: ‘Those magazines are sure good. They have already helped our marriage. When I come home at lunchtime, I ask Becky if another one has arrived.’”

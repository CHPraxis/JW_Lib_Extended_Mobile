<p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>However, writing under divine inspiration, the Christian apostle Paul presented a different picture when he urged fellow believers: “Let . . . those making use of the world [be] as those not using it to the full; for the scene of this world is changing.” Another rendition is: “Those who have to deal with the world should not become engrossed in it.

While recommending singleness as the better course, he acknowledged that those who enter wedlock “commit no sin.” Yet he added that they would have “tribulation in their flesh,” for marriage is attended by certain anxieties. For instance, the illness of a loved one can bring about stress. Although Paul did not here mention persecution, added tribulation can result to married people during such a time if mates are separated or if parents are separated from their children.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:7:25-46:7:28" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 7:25-28</a>.</p>

<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><sup>8 </sup>Even as righteously disposed humans survived the Deluge, however, so Jesus showed that some will survive the rapidly approaching “great tribulation.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:21-40:24:22" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Matthew 24:21, 22,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:36-40:24:39" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> 36-39</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:7:9-66:7:17" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Revelation 7:9-17</a>.)

<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu"> 9. In what balanced ways can witnesses of Jehovah properly use the world?</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><sup>9 </sup>As witnesses of Jehovah living in this system of things, we cannot actually “get out of the world.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:5:9-46:5:10" data-bid="20-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 5:9, 10</a>) So we can appropriately use the world in balanced, proper, limited ways. For instance, since we pay our taxes, we are entitled to certain services furnished by the governmental “superior authorities.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:13:1-45:13:7" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Romans 13:1-7</a>) We properly use postal, police and other lawful services, such as transportation systems. For what purpose? For proper living and to carry on the God-given work of Kingdom witnessing. But since we are not to use the world <em>“to the full,” </em>all such things are used only to the extent that they serve Christian interests.</p>
<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu">10. (a) Around what should we center our lives? (b) How did Jesus illustrate the great value of the Kingdom? (c) If Kingdom interests and intimacy with Jehovah mean much to us, how will this affect our use of the world?</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><sup>10 </sup>We cannot afford to let worldly interests dominate us. Rather, we need to center our life on our relationship with Jehovah, on our worship of him and our service to him. Do our actions reveal that “intimacy with God” is really important to us? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:29:4-18:29:4" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Job 29:4</a>) And do we recognize the superlative value of spiritual things? Jesus Christ illustrated the preciousness of the Kingdom by “one pearl” so valuable that a merchant “promptly sold all the things he had and bought it.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:13:45-40:13:46" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Matthew 13:45, 46</a>) Thus Jesus showed that a person appreciating the true value of gaining the Kingdom would be willing to part with any earthly treasure to do so. If the Kingdom and its interests, and particularly intimacy with Jehovah, mean that much to us, we will keep “every contact with the world . . . as light as possible.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:7:31-46:7:31" data-bid="24-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 7:31</a>, <em>Phillips.</em></p>

<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><sup>11 </sup>Another reason not to use the world to the full is that it is impossible to enjoy intimacy with Jehovah while having “the spirit of the world.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:2:12-46:2:12" data-bid="25-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 2:12</a>) The spirit or energizing force that controls the world of unrighteous human society is demonic and alienated from God. Under the Devil’s control, the world caters to selfishness and the desires of the fallen flesh, resulting in enmity toward Jehovah God.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:14:30-43:14:30" data-bid="26-1" class="b">John 14:30;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:2:1-49:2:3" data-bid="26-2" class="b"> Ephesians 2:1-3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:5:19-62:5:19" data-bid="26-3" class="b"> 1 John 5:19</a>.</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><sup>12 </sup>The apostle Paul contrasted the world’s spirit with the spirit of God and said concerning Christians: “Now we received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is from God.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:2:12-46:2:12" data-bid="27-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 2:12</a>) Since the world’s pattern of thought and conduct runs counter to the influence of God’s holy spirit and the instruction found in his Word, godly persons must shun its spirit. Instead, lovers of Jehovah properly cultivate and manifest the holy spirit’s fruitage of love, joy, peace, long-suffering, kindness, goodness, faith, mildness and self-control.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:5:22-48:5:23" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Galatians 5:22, 23</a>.</p>

<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><sup>13 </sup>Interestingly, the aged apostle John showed that God’s true “inspired expressions” came through the genuine Christian congregation, not through unchristian worldly sources. Then he said: “He that gains the knowledge of God listens to us; he that does not originate with God does not listen to us.” True, John’s subject was “inspired expressions.” But he made the point that Christians do not “speak what proceeds from the world.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:4:1-62:4:6" data-bid="29-1" class="b">1 John 4:1-6</a>) So why should we use the world to the full?</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:1:13-51:1:14" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Colossians 1:13, 14</a>) By obedience to the revealed truth of Jehovah’s Word, anointed Christians have been sanctified, or made holy, set apart for God’s use in his service. Thus they, as well as their dedicated associates of the “great crowd,” stand out as being “no part of the world” that does not adhere to Jehovah’s truth.

<p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><sup>16 </sup>Jehovah’s people differ from the world as regards hopes, aspirations and compliance with the will of their holy God. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:39:30-2:39:30" data-bid="36-1" class="b">Exodus 39:30</a>) They should prove holy to God. Accordingly, the people of ancient Israel were to make “fringed edges upon the skirts of their [robelike] garments,” with a blue string above the fringe. They were to do this so as not to be ‘in style’ with Moabites, Egyptians or others and to be reminded that they were to be different as Jehovah’s people and that they should obey him, ‘proving holy to their God.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:15:37-4:15:41" data-bid="37-1" class="b">Numbers 15:37-41</a>) The desire to be ‘holy to our God’ should prompt us to be cautious in using the world.</p>

<p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><sup>17 </sup>Worldly objectives involve wealth, fame and spiritually unwholesome activities that can undermine Christian faith. For instance, the pursuit of material things and wealth, if allowed to take the dominant place in our life, may even entice us to do wrong for selfish advantage, thus endangering our relationship with Jehovah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:28:20-20:28:20" data-bid="38-1" class="b">Proverbs 28:20</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:5:26-24:5:28" data-bid="39-1" class="b">Jeremiah 5:26-28;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:17:9-24:17:11" data-bid="39-2" class="b"> 17:9-11</a>.) Indeed, those using the world to such an extent that they make material pursuits their prime concern are in danger of becoming involved in dishonest practices and of losing their faith because of neglecting spiritual matters. Someone who becomes successful in business or becomes wealthy may also become “high-minded,” proudly esteeming his own views above counsel from God’s congregation.

But people seeking their own glory are likened in the Scriptures to those who eat too much honey, which can cause nausea.

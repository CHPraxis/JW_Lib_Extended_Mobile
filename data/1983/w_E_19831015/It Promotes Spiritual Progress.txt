It Promotes Spiritual Progress
Efforts were being made to help a Chinese woman living in England, but who speaks very little English, to learn the teachings of the Bible. “I was finding no real progress,” the teacher reports. “Then the lady’s friend in Australia sent a Chinese version of My Book of Bible Stories. The woman is now eager to attend our meetings and to study more. She also understands things better due to the simple statements of fact in the book. I am so thrilled! With this book a great step forward was made with no effort on my part.”
My Book of Bible Stories contains 116 Bible accounts that give the reader an idea of what the Bible is all about. It is published in over 50 languages. You can receive this valuable 256-page book by filling in and mailing the coupon.

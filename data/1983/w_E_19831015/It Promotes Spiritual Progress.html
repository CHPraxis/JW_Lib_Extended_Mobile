<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Efforts were being made to help a Chinese woman living in England, but who speaks very little English, to learn the teachings of the Bible. “I was finding no real progress,” the teacher reports. “Then the lady’s friend in Australia sent a Chinese version of <em>My Book of Bible Stories. </em>The woman is now eager to attend our meetings and to study more. She also understands things better due to the simple statements of fact in the book. I am so thrilled! With this book a great step forward was made with no effort on my part.”</p>

Gestapo Tactics and Bans Fail
The Portuguese secret police (P.I.D.E.) under the Salazar regime were patterned after the Nazi Gestapo and trained by them. The police agents constantly hounded Jehovah’s Witnesses, to stop their preaching of God’s Kingdom and their meeting together for Bible study. Like the persecuted early Christians, the Witnesses had to assemble in secret places, such as out in the woods. Read the thrilling story of how Gestapo tactics failed against these modern Christians in Portugal.

Auxiliary and Regular Pioneer Ranks Reach New Highs
Outstanding Increases in Other Activity
Jehovah’s blessings upon our activity during April were truly bountiful. We greatly rejoice in the following report that shows what was accomplished:
Total Publishers: 642,286. This is 27,293 more publishers than our last peak in January 1983.
Total Auxiliary Pioneers: 84,285. An increase of 11.6 percent over the outstanding total of 75,538 for April 1982.
Regular Pioneers: For the eighth month in a row we have had a peak in regular pioneers.
Total Hours: 11,902,964. This is 1,286,697 more than our peak in April a year ago—a 12-percent increase.
Return Visits: 4,048,481. Exceeds our previous peak by 6,311.
Home Bible Studies: Our fifth peak this service year and 23,445 more than the peak last month.
Surely, all of this is evidence that Jehovah’s spirit is moving his people to give a tremendous Kingdom witness. As long ago foretold, those having spiritual insight are letting their light shine with ever greater brightness as they turn many to righteousness. (Dan. 12:3) Let us continue to make the most of our privilege to share without letup in this glorious work!

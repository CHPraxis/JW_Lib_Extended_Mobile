<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Many have expressed appreciation for the 1983 calendar with its practical features and reminders relative to the preaching work. At present the 1984 calendar is being prepared. It will have the same basic features as the one for 1983, with pictures that illustrate the theme of the 1984 yeartext by showing the courageous preaching work being done around the world. The calendar will be printed on a more expensive, coated paper, which will enhance its beauty. The cost for the 1984 calendar will be $1 each. Calendars will be printed in English, Chinese, Danish, Dutch, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Spanish and Swedish. Congregations should send in their orders during the first week of August, using the regular Literature Order form (S-14) and indicating the number of English calendars desired under “Controlled Stock Items.” Calendars in other languages should be listed under “Other Language Publications,” showing the quantity for each language separately. Additionally, specify 1984. Do not send the remittance with the order. Calendars are controlled stock items and payment is to be included in the regular remittance sent to the Society following receipt of the calendars. See <em>Cost List, </em>paragraphs 20 and 21. Until shipments are made beginning in late October, the 1984 calendar will appear as “Back-ordered” on congregation invoices.</p>

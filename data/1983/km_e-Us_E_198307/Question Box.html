<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"><strong>● When the service overseer visits a Congregation Book Study group, who conducts the meeting for field service?</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The service overseer will conduct the meeting for field service. In this way he can set an example for each study conductor as to how to conduct a meaningful meeting for field service based upon the current outline in <em>Our Kingdom Ministry. </em>Also, he can effectively organize the groups for field service. He will thus demonstrate that in no more than 10 to 15 minutes an informative meeting can be conducted and the group properly organized.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">It would be helpful if the service overseer would make specific arrangements to work with various ones in the Congregation Book Study group. He can give them general encouragement in connection with the field ministry. Likewise he can provide specific suggestions to help them improve the quality of their service.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The book study conductor and all in the book study group look forward to the visit of the service overseer. They will want to put forth extra effort to give full support to this special week of activity for their study group. In this way they show appreciation for the arrangement by the organization to have the service overseer make meaningful visits to each Congregation Book Study group.</p>

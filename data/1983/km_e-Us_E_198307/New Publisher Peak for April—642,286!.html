<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Jehovah’s blessings upon our activity during April were truly bountiful. We greatly rejoice in the following report that shows what was accomplished:</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="si">Total Publishers: 642,286. This is 27,293 more publishers than our last peak in January 1983.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="si">Total Auxiliary Pioneers: 84,285. An increase of 11.6 percent over the outstanding total of 75,538 for April 1982.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="si">Regular Pioneers: For the eighth month in a row we have had a peak in regular pioneers.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="si">Total Hours: 11,902,964. This is 1,286,697 more than our peak in April a year ago—a 12-percent increase.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="si">Return Visits: 4,048,481. Exceeds our previous peak by 6,311.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="si">Home Bible Studies: Our fifth peak this service year and 23,445 more than the peak last month.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Surely, all of this is evidence that Jehovah’s spirit is moving his people to give a tremendous Kingdom witness. As long ago foretold, those having spiritual insight are letting their light shine with ever greater brightness as they turn many to righteousness. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:12:3-27:12:3" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Dan. 12:3</a>) Let us continue to make the most of our privilege to share without letup in this glorious work!</p>

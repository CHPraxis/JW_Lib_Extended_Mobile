How can we prepare to answer?</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Elder leads discussion based on <em>Aid, </em>page 655 (Gifts of the Spirit) and page 656 (“Tongues”), also <a class="xt" data-xtid="1" href="jwpub://p/E:101982083/1-10:75$p/E:101982084/$p/E:101982085/">February 8, 1982, <em>Awake! </em>pages 7 to 11</a>. Highlight the following: Gifts of the spirit served to establish early Christian congregation as having God’s approval. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:2:2-58:2:4" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Heb. 2:2-4</a>) Gift of speaking in tongues enabled Christians at Pentecost 33 C.E. to reach foreign-speaking Jews. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:2:1-44:2:47" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Acts, chapter 2</a>) Gifts of spirit transmitted only by an apostle chosen directly by Jesus. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:8:18-44:8:18" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Acts 8:18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:19:6-44:19:6" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 19:6</a>) Thus, with death of the apostles the transmittal of miraculous gifts ceased. Paul foretold cessation of such gifts, including gift of tongues. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:13:8-46:13:8" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 Cor. 13:8</a>) Those speaking in tongues today usually not understood by others. Apparently not God’s spirit working through them. Identification marks of love (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:13:35-43:13:35" data-bid="5-1" class="b">John 13:35;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:13:13-46:13:13" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 1 Cor. 13:13</a>) and separateness from world (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:15:19-43:15:19" data-bid="6-1" class="b">John 15:19</a>) not found in charismatics but in Jehovah’s Witnesses. Witnesses also show love for Jehovah (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:22:37-40:22:38" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Matt. 22:37, 38</a>) and continue with God-given work of making disciples. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:14-40:24:14" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Matt. 24:14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:28:19-40:28:20" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 28:19, 20</a>) Thus prove they are true Christians.</p>

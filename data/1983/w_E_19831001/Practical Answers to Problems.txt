Practical Answers to Problems
This is what the Watchtower magazine provides. The following is a sample of the appreciative letters received:
“Thank you from the depth of my heart for The Watchtower dealing with sexual morality. I feel it was an answer to my prayers. I especially appreciated the straightforward and firm way you deal with the problems we are seeing all around us.
“Having learned firsthand that the world has nothing of value to offer us, I have been strict with my children. This ‘morality’ magazine not only helped them to see the dangers of certain courses, but helped me also because it reaffirmed my deeply felt convictions on certain matters. I’m grateful you put these in print for us parents so that our children can see that mom and dad haven’t been unreasonable after all.
“So thank you for dealing frankly with situations that exist. We parents would appreciate having more of these articles.”
The Watchtower deals in a practical way with the real problems of the day​—alcoholism, divorce, incest, profanity, and so forth—​showing how the Bible can really solve these problems. Do not miss the next issues!

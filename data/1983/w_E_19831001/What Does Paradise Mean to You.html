<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">HOW would you enjoy living in paradise​—<em>right now? </em>‘Don’t be ridiculous!’ you say. ‘There’s no paradise on this earth!’  Or is there? Well, that really depends on what is meant by “paradise.”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">What does that word mean to you? The beauties of the natural scenery? Majestic rivers and peaceful valleys uncontaminated by deadly pollution? Animals​—lions, tigers, lambs and deer—​all living at peace with one another? True, it would be most delightful, to say the least, to live in such paradisaic conditions. But the sad truth is that, while there are still some very lovely spots on this earth, we are far from living in paradise. Or are we?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Consider this: “Paradise” in the fullest sense of the word involves far more than just trees and plants​—beautiful surroundings. It takes more than lovely scenery to make life enjoyable. Much more. To illustrate: Suppose you could pick any spot on earth to live​—the most beautiful part of the open country or the loveliest tropical island. Could you really be happy if your neighbors were hateful, mean, selfish, spiteful, with no respect for your person or property? Hardly! Such people <span id="page4" class="pageNum" data-no="4" data-before-text="4"></span>could make your life miserable no matter how pleasant your surroundings!</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Logically, then, “paradise” is dependent not just on physical surroundings but also on <em>people. </em>For when you think of paradise, do you not also think of happy people, with peaceful dispositions, getting along with one another in love? Therefore, before a beauty spot on earth can be called a paradise in the fullest sense, the people who are going to live in it must develop Godlike personalities.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">The Bible gives indication of such a change in the dispositions of people, describing the spiritual condition of people​—people who make over their personalities and their lives for the better. But perhaps you are wondering: ‘Does such a figurative paradise <em>really </em>exist today? If so, where?’</p>

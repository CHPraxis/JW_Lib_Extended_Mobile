<p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="qu"> 1. (a) Before either pre-Christian servants of God or the 144,000 receive their reward, what must they experience? (b) But what will be possible for a great crowd who are living when the “great tribulation” strikes?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb">ALTHOUGH faithful servants of God from Abel to John the Baptizer put the doing of God’s will first in their lives, they all had to die and wait for a resurrection. The 144,000 who will be with Christ in his heavenly Kingdom must also die before they can receive their reward. In contrast, the apostle John was shown in vision that there would be a great crowd that would actually survive the “great tribulation” and, without dying, have the prospect of living forever.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:7:9-66:7:17" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Rev. 7:9-17</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="ss"><strong>Identifying the “Great Crowd”</strong></p>
<p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="qu"> 2. What led up to a clear understanding of the identity of the “great crowd” of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:7:9-66:7:9" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Revelation 7:9</a>?</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>For centuries the identity of this “great crowd” was not understood. But the progressive understanding of related prophecies prepared the way. In 1923 it was discerned that the “sheep” of Jesus’ parable at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:25:31-40:25:46" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matthew 25:31-46</a> and the “other sheep” to which he referred at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:10:16-43:10:16" data-bid="3-1" class="b">John 10:16</a> were persons now living who would have opportunity to dwell forever here on earth. In 1931 the ones described in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:9:1-26:9:11" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ezekiel 9:1-11</a> as being marked in their foreheads by the man with the secretary’s inkhorn were identified with the “sheep” of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:25:1-40:25:46" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Matthew chapter 25</a>. Then, in 1935, the “great multitude,” <span id="page104" class="pageNum" data-no="104" data-before-text="104"></span>or “great crowd,” of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:7:9-66:7:17" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Revelation 7:9-17</a> was seen to be the same as the “sheep” of Jesus’ parable of the sheep and goats. Although back in 1923 it was realized that some such sheeplike individuals had already begun to manifest themselves, it was not until 1935 that their numbers began to grow rapidly. Today there are literally millions who are seeking to be identified as part of that divinely favored “great crowd” of the “other sheep.”</p>
<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu"> 3. Why does their “standing before the throne” not mean that they are a heavenly class?</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>Those of the “great crowd” are distinguished from the 144,000 members of spiritual Israel, referred to earlier in the same chapter of Revelation. In his vision John did not see this “great crowd” as being in heaven. Their “standing before the throne” (Greek: <em>e·noʹpi·on tou throʹnou, </em>“in sight of the throne”) of God does not require that they be in heaven. Their position is simply “in sight” of God, who tells us that from heaven he beholds the sons of men. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:7:9-66:7:9" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Rev. 7:9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:11:4-19:11:4" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> Ps. 11:4</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:100:1-19:100:2" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Psalm 100:1, 2</a>, also <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:1:74-42:1:75" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Luke 1:74, 75 and</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:10:33-44:10:33" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> Acts 10:33</a>, <em>Kingdom Interlinear.</em>) Likewise, it is not necessary for “all the nations” to be in heaven for them to be before the throne of Christ (literally, “in front of him”), as described at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:25:31-40:25:32" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Matthew 25:31, 32</a>. The fact that the “great crowd, <em>which no man was able to number,” </em>is not a heavenly class is shown by comparison with <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:7:4-66:7:8" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Revelation 7:4-8 and</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:14:1-66:14:4" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> Re 14:1-4</a>, where the specific number of those taken from the earth to be in heaven is revealed.</p>
<p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="qu"> 4. (a) What is the “great tribulation” that they survive? (b) As stated at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:7:11-66:7:12" data-bid="36-1" class="b">Revelation 7:11, 12</a>, who observe the “great crowd” and share with them in worship?</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>In identifying the “great crowd,” John writes: “These are the ones that come out of the great tribulation.” What they survive will be, indeed, <span id="page105" class="pageNum" data-no="105" data-before-text="105"></span>the greatest tribulation ever experienced on earth. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:7:13-66:7:14" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Rev. 7:13, 14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:21-40:24:21" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> Matt. 24:21</a>) Survivors of that fear-inspiring day of Jehovah will have no doubt as to who is responsible for their deliverance. When they thankfully attribute their salvation to God and to the Lamb, then, as John saw in vision, all the faithful creatures in heaven will unite their voices with them in worship of the only true God, saying: “Amen! The blessing and the glory and the wisdom and the thanksgiving and the honor and the power and the strength be to our God forever and ever. Amen.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:7:11-66:7:12" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Rev. 7:11, 12</a>.</p>

<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>The preservation of the “great crowd” takes place in harmony with Jehovah’s own righteous standards. Clear indications of the identifying traits of those who will be delivered are embodied in the Bible’s prophetic references to them. Thus it is possible for lovers of righteousness to act now with a view to surviving. We have already referred to the scriptures that follow. But now analyze them carefully, with the help of the additional texts cited, and consider what you must do in order to fit these prophetic descriptions.</p>

They have proved by their way of life that they are loyal upholders of his rulership. The fact that they have “washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb” indicates that they have recognized their need of the sin-atoning merit of Jesus’ sacrifice as the Lamb of God.

<p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><sup>9 </sup>Are you one who hopes to survive as part of the “great crowd”? If you have conformed to Jehovah’s righteous ways, then you are no doubt already beginning to enjoy the promised conditions that have appropriately been termed a spiritual paradise. The apostle John was told: “They will hunger no more nor thirst anymore, neither will the sun beat down upon them nor any scorching heat, because the Lamb, who is in the midst of the throne, will shepherd them, and will guide them to fountains of waters of life. And God will wipe out every tear from their eyes.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:7:16-66:7:17" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Rev. 7:16, 17</a>) How has this proved true in your case?</p>

Rather, it signifies that you are safeguarded from the scorching heat of God’s own displeasure. And when he rains down divine destruction on the wicked, it will not bring you to ruin.

<p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu"> 1. (a) Who is the true God? (b) As we learn about him, how should our own lives be affected?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb">TO FELLOW Christians the apostle Paul wrote that, even though there are many who are called gods, “there is actually to us one God the Father . . . and there is one Lord, Jesus Christ.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:8:5-46:8:6" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Cor. 8:5, 6</a>) The “one God” to whom Paul referred is Jehovah, the Creator of all things. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:6:4-5:6:4" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Deut. 6:4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:4:11-66:4:11" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Rev. 4:11</a>) Appreciative persons who learn of his qualities and the things that he has done for humankind find themselves irresistibly drawn to him. With what result? It is only natural for them to magnify the One that they so deeply admire, doing so by both words and deeds. As their love for God grows, they feel impelled to tell others about him, and to the extent possible for them as humans they want to imitate him. The Bible encourages all of us to do that, saying: “Become imitators of God, as beloved children, and go on walking in love.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:5:1-49:5:2" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Eph. 5:1, 2</a>) To apply that counsel, we need to get to know Jehovah as he truly is.</p>

<p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>Throughout the Bible are found numerous direct statements identifying the outstanding qualities <span id="page13" class="pageNum" data-no="13" data-before-text="13"></span>of God. When you read these, take time to think about what the qualities really are and how important they are to you. For example: “God is love.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:4:8-62:4:8" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 John 4:8</a>) “All his ways are justice.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:32:4-5:32:4" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Deut. 32:4</a>) ‘With him there is wisdom.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:12:13-18:12:13" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Job 12:13</a>) He is “vigorous in power.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:40:26-23:40:26" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Isa. 40:26</a>) As you reflect on these attributes, are you not moved, out of admiration for God, to praise him?</p>

<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>Further acquainting us with his appealing personality, the Bible tells us that Jehovah is “a God merciful and gracious, slow to anger and abundant in loving-kindness and truth.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:34:6-2:34:6" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Ex. 34:6</a>) “You, O Jehovah, are good and ready to forgive.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:86:5-19:86:5" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ps. 86:5</a>) “As regards Jehovah, his eyes are roving about through all the earth to show his strength in behalf of those whose heart is complete toward him.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:16:9-14:16:9" data-bid="10-1" class="b">2 Chron. 16:9</a>) “God is not partial, but in every nation the man that fears him and works righteousness is acceptable to him.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:10:34-44:10:35" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Acts 10:34, 35</a>) Jehovah “gives generously” and is “the happy God.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:1:5-59:1:5" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Jas. 1:5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:1:11-54:1:11" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> 1 Tim. 1:11</a>) How refreshing it is to serve this incomparable God and to experience his loving care!</p>

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>Consistent with his attributes is the fact that he is “a God exacting exclusive devotion.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:20:5-2:20:5" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Ex. 20:5</a>) To serve him acceptably we must give him our full devotion.

<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup>Consider here just one example. When the Bible says, “God is love,” what does it mean? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:4:8-62:4:8" data-bid="17-1" class="b">1 John 4:8</a>) There are, of course, a number of kinds of love. The Greek word used in this text is <em>a·gaʹpe, </em>which refers to the highest form of love, as exemplified in Jehovah God himself. Such love is an expression of complete unselfishness. With that in mind, frame your own answers to the questions below, using the scriptures cited.</p>

<p id="p52" data-pid="52" class="qu"> 8. (a) What gods do people of the world worship? (b) Who is behind all this confusion, and why do you say so?</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[52]" class="sb"><sup>8 </sup>In opposition to the worship of the true God, literally millions of other gods are worshiped by humans. In the fourth century, Christendom adopted belief in a “Trinity,” taught by Babylonians, Egyptians, Hindus and Buddhists before then. In addition to this concept of God, there are powerful rulers, outstanding athletes and singers who have been idolized like gods. Money, self and sex have also become gods to which fervent devotion is given. Who is behind it all? “The god of this system of things,” Satan the Devil.

One of the finest ways is to show them in a helpful manner what the Bible itself says about the identity of the true God and the kind of person he is.

<p id="p54" data-pid="54" class="qu">10. When talking to a Trinitarian, why is it not wise to assume that we know exactly what he believes?</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[54]" class="sb"><sup>10 </sup>But what if some who are members of Christendom’s churches contend with you, claiming that their belief in the “Trinity” is Scriptural? First of all, realize that, although there are official statements of the “Trinity” doctrine, many persons have their own ideas. Invite them to express themselves, and then help them to compare their beliefs with what is in their own Bible. In time, also encourage them to compare official church teaching with God’s Word.</p>
<p id="p55" data-pid="55" class="qu">11. Taking just one of the five main points at a time, use the questions and scriptures listed with this paragraph to reason on the unscripturalness of the “Trinity” doctrine.</p>

<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="si">(<em>1</em>) <em>Some Trinitarians emphasize the idea that there are three divine Persons </em>(<em>Father, Son and Holy Ghost</em>) <em>but just one God.</em></p>

<p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="s6">But how many persons are spoken of in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:1:1-43:1:1" data-bid="30-1" class="b">John 1:1</a>? Three? Or two?

<p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="s6">It is true that Greek has no indefinite article, but many languages do, and it is used in those languages in order to express thoughts correctly. If someone feels that it is wrong to use the indefinite article when translating <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:1:1-43:1:1" data-bid="32-1" class="b">John 1:1</a>, would he also want it left out at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:28:6-44:28:6" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Acts 28:6</a> according to the <em>King James Version </em>and others? (Another way of rendering <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:1:1-43:1:1" data-bid="34-1" class="b">John 1:1</a>, as shown in <em>An American Translation, </em>is “the Word was divine,” that is, he had the same divine qualities that God has.)</p>
<p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="si">(<em>4</em>) <em>Trinitarians also argue that at </em><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:1-1:1:1" data-bid="35-1" class="b"><em>Genesis 1:1,</em></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:26-1:1:26" data-bid="35-2" class="b"> <em>26</em></a> <em>the Hebrew word translated “God” is </em>El·o·himʹ <em>and that this is the plural in Hebrew and actually means “Gods.”</em></p>

<p id="p37" data-pid="37" data-rel-pid="[57]" class="sb"><sup>13 </sup>After years of confusion as to the identity of God, many persons find it thrilling when first they see God’s personal name, Jehovah, in their Bible. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:6:3-2:6:3" data-bid="42-1" class="b">Ex. 6:3</a>) But they will be lastingly benefited by this knowledge only if they ‘walk in the name of Jehovah forever.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/33:4:5-33:4:5" data-bid="43-1" class="b">Mic. 4:5</a>) This involves much more than simply knowing the name Jehovah or claiming that they are Jehovah’s Witnesses.</p>
<p id="p38" data-pid="38" data-rel-pid="[57]" class="sb"><sup>14 </sup>Regarding the significance of God’s name, <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:9:10-19:9:10" data-bid="44-1" class="b">Psalm 9:10</a> states: “Those knowing your name will trust in you, . . . O Jehovah.” What does <span id="page19" class="pageNum" data-no="19" data-before-text="19"></span>that involve? It involves more than just knowing the name Jehovah, which does not automatically mean trusting in Jehovah. “Knowing” God’s name here means appreciating the kind of God that Jehovah is, respecting his authority, obeying his commands. Similarly, ‘walking in the name of Jehovah’ implies being dedicated to him and representing him as one of his worshipers, truly using one’s life in harmony with God’s will.

It manifests loving attachment to him because of appreciation for him and his ways. It causes us to want everyone to hold his name in high esteem. We must cultivate “godly devotion” as the goal or aim in our lives if we are going to walk in the name of Jehovah, the true God, forever.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:37:4-19:37:4" data-bid="47-1" class="b">Ps. 37:4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:3:11-61:3:11" data-bid="47-2" class="b"> 2 Pet. 3:11</a>.</p>

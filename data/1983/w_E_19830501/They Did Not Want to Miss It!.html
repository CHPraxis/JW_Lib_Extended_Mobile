<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">MORE THAN 4 million people attended last year’s “Kingdom Truth” conventions arranged by Jehovah’s Witnesses. For many it was not easy.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">For example, 13 Australians hired two small airplanes, at a cost of $2,600, and flew 750 miles over trackless and waterless desert to attend the convention nearest them.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">A group in Brazil braved the heat, humidity and mosquitoes of the Amazon jungle during a 37-hour bus trip to reach their closest convention location.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Eight Christians in Guyana traveled in canoes for seven days to get to the only convention held in their country.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Why? Because the convention was the highlight of their year, and they wanted nothing to stand in the way of their attending it.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Now we invite you to attend the “Kingdom Unity” District Convention of Jehovah’s Witnesses this coming June and July. We hope you will not miss it. In the United States alone, more than 100 conventions have been arranged at convenient locations. Check with Jehovah’s Witnesses locally for the one closest to you.</p>

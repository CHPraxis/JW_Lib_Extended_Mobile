<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Disaster struck ten years ago, when I was in my early 20’s. Heavy drinking and other abuses to my health had simply taken their toll. I became totally blind. With so much of my life still ahead of me, I often wondered what I could possibly make of it.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Concerned over world events and the future for our daughter, my wife started to study the Bible with Jehovah’s Witnesses. Although I was skeptical at first, I eventually joined in the discussions. It did not take us long to recognize that what we were studying was the truth, and so in 1978 we were baptized.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The desire to share my newly found faith soon became overwhelming. With the help and encouragement of my wife, I learned Braille in seven months. It brought me great joy to be able to call from home to home with other Witnesses, proclaiming the good news of God’s Kingdom. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:14-40:24:14" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matthew 24:14</a>) But, what could I do to become more active in this vital work?</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">A Braille Bible is extremely bulky and heavy; using one in public preaching was quite impractical. The suggestion of putting a marker in the Bible and memorizing the text was good, but limiting. Then I had an idea! If I got some thin sheets of clear plastic I could type on them in Braille the gist of any text I wished to use. By sticking these sheets into my Bible I could point to the scriptures through the plastic at the same time as I read the texts with my fingertips. I experimented, and it worked well. My prayers to expand my Christian ministry had been answered!​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:4:3-51:4:3" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Colossians 4:3</a>.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">As my ability to handle the Bible grew, so did my confidence. Soon I was witnessing alone from house to house in some areas. For the past year, I have had the pleasure of serving as a pioneer (a full-time Kingdom proclaimer) and of conducting many home Bible discussions.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Blessed now with spiritual sight, how I rejoice in being able to help those who are still blind to the good news! (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:4:4-47:4:6" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 4:4-6</a>) How happy I am, despite my handicap, to have such a full share in praising Jehovah!​—<em>Contributed.</em></p>

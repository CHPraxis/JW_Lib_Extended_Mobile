<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">The printed word really can be that powerful; especially has the message in the Bible changed many lives. How valuable, then, is a publication that makes the Bible message understandable for all! The book <em>You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth </em>is just such a publication, as letters like the following note:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“Even more than its lovely presentation and abundant illustrations I just love the powerful use of scriptures and questions and the very personal approach​—to make the student see all things in connection with his relationship to Jehovah God. The clear-cut contrasts made should help people see the need of making decisions, yes, changes in their beliefs, conduct, attitudes and religion. Thank you for such a wonderful new aid.”</p>

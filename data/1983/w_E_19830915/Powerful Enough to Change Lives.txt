Powerful Enough to Change Lives
The printed word really can be that powerful; especially has the message in the Bible changed many lives. How valuable, then, is a publication that makes the Bible message understandable for all! The book You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth is just such a publication, as letters like the following note:
“Even more than its lovely presentation and abundant illustrations I just love the powerful use of scriptures and questions and the very personal approach​—to make the student see all things in connection with his relationship to Jehovah God. The clear-cut contrasts made should help people see the need of making decisions, yes, changes in their beliefs, conduct, attitudes and religion. Thank you for such a wonderful new aid.”
Already, in just a little more than one year, over 12 million copies of this new book in over 30 languages have been printed. Get your copy and you will understand why it is so popular.

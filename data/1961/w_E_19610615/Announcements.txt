FIELD MINISTRY
Watchfulness is necessary to direct our lives in such a way that we will engage in right works. Watchfulness will aid all servants of Jehovah God to find and make time in June to present the splendid Bible-study aid From Paradise Lost to Paradise Regained with a booklet, on a 75c contribution.

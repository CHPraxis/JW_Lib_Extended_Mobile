<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Would you walk a mile to read a Bible if it were available only in a church, chained to a table? A few centuries ago many humble persons did and considered it a great privilege. Today everyone can have his own copy and carry it wherever he likes. Do you? We highly recommend the <em>American Standard Version </em>in the now popular pocket-size edition. A complete Bible, it has a cyclopedic concordance of words and expressions and helpful footnotes. Size: 6 1⁄4” x 4 1⁄4” x 1”. Get your copy today for only $1.50. Enjoy God’s Word. Read it daily.</p>

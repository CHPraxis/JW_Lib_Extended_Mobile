Announcements
FIELD MINISTRY
Ordained ministers must let their light shine to glorify and praise God. This Jehovah’s ministers will do throughout this final month of the Watchtower campaign by offering a year’s subscription for this outstanding Bible journal, The Watchtower, and three Scriptural booklets on a contribution of $1.
YOU CAN TAKE IT WITH YOU
Would you walk a mile to read a Bible if it were available only in a church, chained to a table? A few centuries ago many humble persons did and considered it a great privilege. Today everyone can have his own copy and carry it wherever he likes. Do you? We highly recommend the American Standard Version in the now popular pocket-size edition. A complete Bible, it has a cyclopedic concordance of words and expressions and helpful footnotes. Size: 6 1⁄4” x 4 1⁄4” x 1”. Get your copy today for only $1.50. Enjoy God’s Word. Read it daily.

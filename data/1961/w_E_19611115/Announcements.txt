FIELD MINISTRY
Recognizing the vital importance of Bible knowledge and understanding, Jehovah’s witnesses are very active in distributing Bible literature at every opportunity. During November they will offer to all persons the newly released Bible-study aid “Let Your Name Be Sanctified,” with a booklet, for 50c.
1962 YEARBOOK AND CALENDAR
Available after December 1, the 1962 Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses presents the stirring report of another productive year of Christian preaching. It will thrill all of those who shared during 1961 in making it a part of the permanent record and will encourage others to share in the sanctifying of God’s name through this life-giving work of the Christian ministry. Available also at the same time will be the 1962 calendar. Obtain the Yearbook for 50c. The calendar is 25c. If you are associated with a congregation of Jehovah’s witnesses, order through the congregation servant.

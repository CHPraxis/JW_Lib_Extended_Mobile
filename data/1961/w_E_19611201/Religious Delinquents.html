<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">“Virtually all of the 761 delinquents examined in Passaic, N.J., by sociologist William C. Kvaraceus of Boston University were affiliated with some church, and three quarters of them attended church regularly or occasionally. Of the 2,317 delinquents studied by Dr. William Wattenberg of Wayne University in Detroit, 43.5 percent attended church regularly and 25.5 percent occasionally. And a surprisingly high proportion of the juvenile delinquents brought to the courts of Boston and New York city have also been found to be regular church attenders, according to a study of the Harvard Divinity School,” says <em>Parent’s Magazine </em>of November, 1960. Does this not suggest that there is a decided deficiency in the educational program of these churches? Yes, there is a “famine . . . for hearing the words of Jehovah.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/30:8:11-30:8:11" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Amos 8:11</a>.</p>

FIELD MINISTRY
The Bible says, “The one listening to me, he will reside in security and be undisturbed from dread of calamity.” (Prov. 1:33) The need for such security is great, and it is available to those who listen to the wisdom of God. To listen to God, one must have his Word the Bible to read and study in understandable language. Therefore, during this month Jehovah’s witnesses will make a special effort to offer to all persons the modern-English New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures, the complete Bible in one volume, for $1 a copy.

It has a comprehensive concordance, maps and drawings, is bound in a beautiful green cover with gold-imprinted title, yet it is only $1.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">“While the church pays lip service to the absolute moral demands of Jesus, the actual operative moral standard in the average Protestant church, the standard by which church members judge each other, is a curious and unholy mixture of pagan morality, primitive folk ways, and bourgeois middle-class respectability, seasoned by a few maxims drawn from the Bible.”—Quoted in <em>The Theology of Evangelism </em>by Taito Kantonen from <em>The Apostolic Preaching.</em></p>

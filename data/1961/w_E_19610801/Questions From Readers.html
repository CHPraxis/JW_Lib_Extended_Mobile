<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"><strong>● Is there anything in the Bible against giving one’s eyes (after death) to be transplanted to some living person?—L. C., United States.</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The question of placing one’s body or parts of one’s body at the disposal of men of science or doctors at one’s death for purposes of scientific experimentation or replacement in others is frowned upon by certain religious bodies. However, it does not seem that any Scriptural principle or law is involved. It therefore is something that each individual must decide for himself. If he is satisfied in his own mind and conscience that this is a proper thing to do, then he can make such provision, and no one else should criticize him for doing so. On the other hand, no one should be criticized for refusing to enter into any such agreement.</p>

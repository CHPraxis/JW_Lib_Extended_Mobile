FIELD MINISTRY
The peaceful, happy and fruitful work of preaching the good news of God’s kingdom increases world-wide day by day. Jehovah’s witnesses will continue to carry on this work in August by offering to people at their homes the book “Your Will Be Done on Earth,” with a booklet, for a 50c contribution.
FROM GENESIS TO REVELATION
“From Genesis to Revelation.” That could well describe the comprehensive Bible-study aid From Paradise Lost to Paradise Regained. That is because, as its title implies, it outlines man’s hope of everlasting life as it is found in the Bible from the first book to the last, from the garden of Eden to the millennial reign of Christ Jesus. With this book you will want the revealing study of Daniel’s prophecy as found in the book “Your Will Be Done on Earth” to learn how you can survive the world crisis just ahead and share in the blessings of God’s paradise restored. Both books are hard bound and total 640 pages. Send only $1.25.

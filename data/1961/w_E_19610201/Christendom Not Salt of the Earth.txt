Christendom Not Salt of the Earth
● “From my standpoint of view I see communism as a phenomenon of consequence caused by the fact that the Christian churches have not been as the salt of the earth according to their great calling,” wrote clergyman Voitto Viro. Jesus said that when salt has lost its strength “it is suitable neither for soil nor for manure. People throw it outside.” Should not this Scriptural principle be applied to Christendom, which it is evident has not been as the salt of the earth?—Luke 14:35.

FIELD MINISTRY
To safeguard our thinking ability for effective service of God is of great importance. Study of the Bible is necessary to do this. During February Jehovah’s witnesses will call on people everywhere with a Bible-study aid of real worth, The Watchtower, offering a year’s subscription and three booklets on a contribution of $1.
DO YOU KNOW YOUR BIBLE?
How well do you know your Bible? Do you know who wrote each of its sixty-six books or when each was written? Do you know the main contents of each book? Do you know how hard has been the Bible’s fight to live or how it has been preserved down to our day? Read the answers to these and many other fascinating questions in the hard-bound, 384-page book, “Equipped for Every Good Work.” Send only 50c.

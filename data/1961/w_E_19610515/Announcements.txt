FIELD MINISTRY
Through Jehovah’s undeserved kindness he has made provision for paradise to be restored on earth under the kingdom by Christ. Jehovah’s witnesses everywhere demonstrate kindness by directing the attention of sheeplike persons to Jehovah’s own loving-kindness. This they will do during May by offering the book From Paradise Lost to Paradise Regained, with a booklet, for a contribution of 75c.

FIELD MINISTRY
Devoted servants of God stay spiritually awake in these critical times. (Luke 12:37) They keep busy doing the work assigned them by God. In fulfilling their God-given commission, during September Jehovah’s witnesses will be offering to all persons the latest Bible study aids published by the Watch Tower Society.

The regular letters of notice will be sent to all the members, and in order to insure delivery of the letters all members should be certain that the secretary’s office has their present addresses.

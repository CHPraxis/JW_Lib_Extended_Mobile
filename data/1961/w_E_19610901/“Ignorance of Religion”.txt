“Ignorance of Religion”
“In the Philippines, well-meaning Catholics often ask the question: How are we going to check the growth of Jehovah’s Witnesses and other similar sects? The only sure way would seem to be for Catholics to get to know more about their own religion and to practice their religion. Actually, it is ignorance of religion that is the organization’s strongest incentive in countries where it is introduced. For only when we get to know our own religion, and are not merely born into it, when we practice our religion as good Catholics everywhere are expected to, can we never fear that knock on the door by those who aim to present us with a substitute for the Faith in which we were born, nurtured, and live.”—Home Life, a Catholic magazine printed in the Philippines.

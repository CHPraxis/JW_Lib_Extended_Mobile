FIELD MINISTRY
Our hearts must be in harmony with God and his Word to speak good things for salvation. Jehovah’s witnesses are pleased to aid others toward salvation by sharing Bible knowledge. During January they will do this by offering a year’s subscription for The Watchtower, along with three Scriptural booklets, on a $1 contribution.
BE SPIRITUALLY WELL FED
Is this copy of The Watchtower that you hold the first you have ever seen? Whether it is or not, leaf through its pages again. Notice the great variety of Scriptural material, the sound Bible counsel, the interesting and informative experiences, items of prophetic significance. Would you like to receive such instructive and stimulating spiritual fare regularly? Send only $1 for a year’s subscription and receive free three booklets on timely Bible subjects. Be spiritually well fed.

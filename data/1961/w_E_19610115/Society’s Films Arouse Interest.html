<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">GREAT interest is being shown in God’s truth in the African land of Cameroun. Excellent aids in arousing this interest are the Society’s films “The New World Society in Action” and “The Happiness of the New World Society.” A report from the district servant in Cameroun shows the results from showing these films.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn">● “One of the most remarkable circuit assemblies where these films were shown was the one held in the town of L———. The film was seen by 6,800 people, including several high officials from the Prefecture. It was a sensational event for that town where, beforehand, the people had not listened to the special pioneer who was preaching the message of salvation. The Superior Chief of the Urban Council had previously forbidden Jehovah’s witnesses to preach the Kingdom good news in the town, and the special pioneer had trouble getting his work done. The showing of the film has done a fine job, for now the ban is lifted and permission has been given to Jehovah’s witnesses not only to preach but also to build what the authorities call a ‘church’ right in the center of the town.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn">● “The local authorities are now convinced that the work of Jehovah’s witnesses is international. A prominent Moslem stated: ‘Your work will really conquer the world; I myself will become one of Jehovah’s witnesses.’</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn">● “The governmental authorities in the departments of A——— and E——— have come to appreciate our work through the films. They have been shown with a special permit. Policemen, soldiers and even their officers have been present and have seen the majestic work accomplished by Jehovah’s witnesses throughout the world. These high personalities expressed their joy at seeing how our great preaching work is carried on peacefully throughout the earth.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn">● “At A——— the deputy sub-prefect has decided to become one of Jehovah’s witnesses. He showed great interest and asked many questions. He invited me to his home and assured me of his desire to have a full share in the theocratic work. He practiced polygamy, having seven wives, but he has promised to cease having relations with his other wives and to choose just one to be his wife, according to the divine will. He is now attending meetings and supporting the work with voluntary contributions. Another man, who has ten wives and eighty-two children, has asked what he must do to become a member of the New World society. A monitor who ran the Adventist mission school has been dismissed by the director for having attended our meetings and the showing of our films. This man is now a zealous publisher of the Kingdom message.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sn">● “At S——— a crowd of 1,050 persons saw the film. Many persons of good will expressed their joy and their desire to associate with the New World society. It was the first time we had been able to show these films in this region, and I think they will do much to bring future increase.”</p>

Christ Would Condemn Modern World
● “If the historic Jesus were to return today,” said Aldous Huxley, “he would unquestionably condemn our civilization for its inhumanity, its systematic and organized lovelessness—in a word, for all the vices on account of which, two thousand years ago, he condemned the civilizations of Rome and the Near East. He would also, in all probability, talk about the end of the world and the day of judgment, but in contemporary terms and in the light of world history since Hiroshima.”—Cosmopolitan, December, 1958.

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Servants of God copy his Son and their Master in the way they perform their ministry. They employ the Master’s manner of teaching. During March Jehovah’s witnesses will continue to do that as they present a year’s subscription for this journal, <em>The Watchtower, </em>and three booklets on a contribution of $1.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="ss"><strong>LORD’S EVENING MEAL</strong></p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">“This do in remembrance of me,” said Jesus as he introduced the Memorial of his death, replacing the annual observance of the Passover. This year the date for the observance is Thursday, March 30, after 6 p.m., standard time. All of Jehovah’s witnesses, both those of the anointed remnant and the other sheep, will assemble at their meeting places to hear a discourse on the subject, after which the emblems, the bread and the wine, will be passed separately after Jehovah’s blessing has been asked upon each. In conclusion all will be invited to share in the field service. All persons of good will are invited and encouraged to attend. If you do not know where the nearest Kingdom Hall is located, write this office for information.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="ss"><strong>MAN’S PERMANENT HOME—WHERE?</strong></p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Life savings are often spent to provide a comfortable and attractive home for retirement and old age, even though in time it must be passed on to others. Would it mean something to you to know that God himself is now making available a <em>permanent </em>home for man?—not in another world but here on earth, a home that need never be forfeited through death! It is a provision that God promised almost six thousand years ago when man’s only home was a paradise. To learn why it has waited until our generation to be realized, read the fascinating 256-page book <em>From Paradise Lost to Paradise Regained. </em>Send only 75c.</p>

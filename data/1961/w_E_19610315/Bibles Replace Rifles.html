<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">In two small adjacent villages in Guanajuato, Mexico, consisting of a total of but 153 souls, there are 150 witnesses of Jehovah and the remaining three are of good will toward Jehovah God. It came about in this way. Some time ago a special representative of the Watch Tower Society began to preach to these people and found them all armed with rifles and pistols because of feuds in which whole families killed one another. When government tried to prosecute the guilty, they found no one willing to testify. At first these people also suspected even the minister of Jehovah sent into their midst; then one of the villagers agreed to having a Bible study in his home, and soon he and all his family became Jehovah’s witnesses. Eventually all the neighbors accepted the truth about Jehovah God and his kingdom.

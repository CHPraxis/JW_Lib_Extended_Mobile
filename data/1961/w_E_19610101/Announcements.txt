FIELD MINISTRY
Our hearts must be in harmony with God and his Word to speak good things for salvation. Jehovah’s witnesses are pleased to aid others toward salvation by sharing Bible knowledge. During January they will do this by offering a year’s subscription for The Watchtower, along with three Scriptural booklets, on a $1 contribution.

Have you received your copy of the 1961 Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses, only recently released? You will want to begin reading at once the thrilling report of Christian educational work carried on world-wide during 1960. Additionally, you will be eager to consider the Scriptural information included as inspirational reading for every day of the new year.

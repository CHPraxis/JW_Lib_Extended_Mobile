<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">“Under God, every Christian should be on the witnessing team. Already in the fourth century the noted church father Jerome declared: ‘Baptism is the ordination of the laity.’ More recently Dr. John R. Mott wrote: ‘The great periods of the church have been those when the lay people have taken their place in the ministry of the church. . . . All have been called to witness for Christ. More than 235 passages in the Bible lay this responsibility squarely on the shoulders of the faithful.”—<em>The Lutheran Witness, </em>October 20, 1959.</p>

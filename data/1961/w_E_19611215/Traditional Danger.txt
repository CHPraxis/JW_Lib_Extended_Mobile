Traditional Danger
“To follow imperfect, uncertain, or corrupted traditions, in order to avoid erring in our own judgment, is but to exchange one danger for another.”—Richard Whately, archbishop of Dublin.
“I am well satisfied that if you let in but one little finger of tradition, you will have in the whole monster—horns and tail and all.”—Thomas Arnold, nineteenth-century educator.

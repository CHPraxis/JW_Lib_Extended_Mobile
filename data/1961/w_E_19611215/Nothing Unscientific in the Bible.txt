Nothing Unscientific in the Bible
In his Studies in Creationism, Frank Lewis Marsh, professor of biology, Union College, Lincoln, Nebraska, observes: “As scientists come to a careful study of the Guidebook of the Christian religion, they find that actually no ground exists for any conflict whatsoever between scientific facts and the Christian religion. Although the Bible contains some of the greatest truths, still it is not a scientific treatise. This situation in the Bible is most worthy of careful consideration. If Moses had written down the very best scientific opinion of his day, advancing science would have discovered its inaccuracy long ago. But the scientific facts stated in nonscientific language thousands of years ago are still completely accurate scientifically. That is one of the marvels of the Bible. That Moses, who was ‘learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians,’ and that Daniel, in whom the Babylonians considered that the spirits of the gods of wisdom dwelt, should write into their messages nothing of the accepted doctrines of beginnings of their day places the Bible outside of natural sources. Only those things were stated which evidently were everlastingly true. To the present moment no scientific inaccuracies have been discovered. True science can have no conflict with such a book.”—Pages 206, 207.

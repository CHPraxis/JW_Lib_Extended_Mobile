A Closed Corporation
“A church which has ceased to be the agency of his creative love, which knows no barriers, and has settled down to be a closed corporation of nice, respectable, middle-class people, a bourgeois ghetto, as someone has called it, has ceased to be Christian.” So stated Taito A. Kantonen in his work A Theology of Evangelism.

The peaceful, happy and fruitful work of preaching the good news of God’s kingdom increases world-wide day by day. Jehovah’s witnesses will continue to carry on this work in August by offering to people at their homes the book “Your Will Be Done on Earth,” with a booklet, for a 50c contribution.
ANNUAL MEETING OF MEMBERS OF WATCH TOWER BIBLE AND TRACT SOCIETY OF PENNSYLVANIA
In Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, the annual meeting of members of Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania will be held at ten o’clock in the forenoon of Sunday, October 1, 1961, at the Society’s office located at 4100 Bigelow Boulevard. The regular letters of notice will be sent to all the members, and in order to insure delivery of the letters all members should be certain that the secretary’s office has their present addresses.
The proxies, which will accompany the notices of meeting, should be returned by the members promptly, in order to reach the office of the secretary of the Society not later than September 15. Each member should return his proxy whether he is going to be at the meeting personally or not.

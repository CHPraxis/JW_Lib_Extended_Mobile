Money Problem
Kenneth Scott, vicar of Midsomer Norton, Somerset, is quoted as having said: “It is time the Church announced that sixpences are no longer accepted, except from children. From others, sixpence today is an insult to God. Two shillings or 2s. 6d. should be a minimum. Five shillings and 10s. should be usual.”

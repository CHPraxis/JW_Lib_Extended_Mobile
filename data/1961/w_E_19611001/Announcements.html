<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Never has mankind in general been better informed. By radio, television, the printed page and by specialized schools and employment training programs, men are not only better equipped for their role in life but are better acquainted with rapidly occurring events. Yet how much of this vast area of education is designed to inform us of the outcome of this world’s affairs? No man can foretell the future, but the Bible holds the key, and its counsel is regularly being transmitted to inquiring persons through the pages of <em>Awake! </em>In this journal, along with other publications of the Watchtower Society, is found education that will equip you for life in God’s new world. Keep informed with information that counts for life. Read <em>Awake! </em>each issue. Send only $1. You will receive free three timely booklets on Bible subjects.</p>

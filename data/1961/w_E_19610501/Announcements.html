Jehovah’s witnesses everywhere demonstrate kindness by directing the attention of sheeplike persons to Jehovah’s own loving-kindness. This they will do during May by offering the book <em>From Paradise Lost to Paradise Regained, </em>with a booklet, for a contribution of 75c.</p>

<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Men are seeking every means of “controlling” space and “colonizing” its planetary systems. But this generation has a far grander prospect of “peopling” a new world—one that is overlooked by the world’s rulers, yet a way that is far more realistic and rewarding. Would you like to know what part you can have in it? Then send for the beautiful and revealing book <em>From Paradise Lost to Paradise Regained. </em>Act now and receive also the booklet <em>After Armageddon—God’s New World. </em>Send only 75c.</p>

FIELD MINISTRY
Through Jehovah’s undeserved kindness he has made provision for paradise to be restored on earth under the kingdom by Christ. Jehovah’s witnesses everywhere demonstrate kindness by directing the attention of sheeplike persons to Jehovah’s own loving-kindness. This they will do during May by offering the book From Paradise Lost to Paradise Regained, with a booklet, for a contribution of 75c.
WHY GO TO THE MOON?
Men are seeking every means of “controlling” space and “colonizing” its planetary systems. But this generation has a far grander prospect of “peopling” a new world—one that is overlooked by the world’s rulers, yet a way that is far more realistic and rewarding. Would you like to know what part you can have in it? Then send for the beautiful and revealing book From Paradise Lost to Paradise Regained. Act now and receive also the booklet After Armageddon—God’s New World. Send only 75c.

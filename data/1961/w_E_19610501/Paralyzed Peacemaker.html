<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“The attempts to secure peace by an international government of sovereign nations have all been the victims of a contradiction inherent in these very attempts. The establishment of effective government of sovereign nations seems to be a contradiction in terms which can be eliminated only by a direct attack upon national sovereignty itself.”—<em>The Encyclopædia Britannica, </em>Volume 17, page 414 (1959).</p>

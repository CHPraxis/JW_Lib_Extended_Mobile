Paralyzed Peacemaker
“The United Nations as a peacemaker was paralyzed from the very beginning by the conflict between the western world under the leadership of the United States and the Soviet bloc.
“The attempts to secure peace by an international government of sovereign nations have all been the victims of a contradiction inherent in these very attempts. The establishment of effective government of sovereign nations seems to be a contradiction in terms which can be eliminated only by a direct attack upon national sovereignty itself.”—The Encyclopædia Britannica, Volume 17, page 414 (1959).

All Should Witness
“The evangelism program of a congregation is off center when all witnessing is left to the pastor. It is also off center when the pastor expects his people to witness and does not equip, train and organize them for this basic work. He is to be a witness to witnesses and a trainer and organizer of witnesses.”—The Lutheran Witness of October 20, 1959.

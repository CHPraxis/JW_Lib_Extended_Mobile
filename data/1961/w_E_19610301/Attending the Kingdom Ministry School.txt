Attending the Kingdom Ministry School
Among the recent advances made by the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society in the training of its ministers is the Kingdom Ministry School at which congregational overseers are given a month’s special training wholly without cost to themselves. But the problem of many overseers who have families to support is being able to get off from their regular secular jobs so as to attend the school for four weeks. In the British Isles one such overseer was quite doubtful about getting additional time off from his work to add to his vacation so he could take the course. However, he decided to take the Society’s invitation letter to his boss to read. The boss was so impressed with it and the whole idea of free training that he told the overseer he could have the extra two weeks and that on full pay.—1961 Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

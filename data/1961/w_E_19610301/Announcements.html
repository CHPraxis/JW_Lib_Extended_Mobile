<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Servants of God copy His Son and their Master in the way they perform their ministry. They employ the Master’s manner of teaching. During March Jehovah’s witnesses will continue to do that as they present a year’s subscription for this journal, <em>The Watchtower, </em>and three booklets on a contribution of $1.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="ss"><strong>MEMORIAL</strong></p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The date for celebrating the Memorial of the Lord’s evening meal in 1961 is Thursday, March 30, after 6 p.m., standard time. Each congregation should start making arrangements. A qualified speaker, one of the remnant if available and capable, should be assigned the discourse. All of Jehovah’s witnesses and persons of good will toward God will make arrangements to attend.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="ss"><strong>READ THIS. IT TAKES ONLY 30 SECONDS</strong></p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Newsstands and bookstores are overflowing with printed matter. No one person could possibly read it all, yet much of it holds out some claim of value in your busy schedule. Do you choose your reading out of habit? Why not be selective? Become regular in choosing those two journals that are based on the highest authority, the Bible. Read <em>The Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>each issue. Millions do. You too can be spiritually stimulated as well as highly enlightened on world events in the light of Bible prophecy. Send only $2 for a year’s subscription to each and receive free six booklets on Bible subjects. Your time will be well spent.</p>

FIELD MINISTRY
Watchfulness is necessary to direct our lives in such a way that we will engage in right works. Watchfulness will aid all servants of Jehovah God to find and make time in June to present the splendid Bible-study aid From Paradise Lost to Paradise Regained with a booklet, on a 75c contribution.
UNITED WORSHIPERS DISTRICT ASSEMBLIES
The year 1961 will mark a new milestone in the unity of Jehovah’s servants on earth. Contributing in large measure will be the series of United Worshipers District Assemblies now completed as to arrangements. For rooming accommodations, five weeks before assembly date write the Watchtower Convention at the rooming address of the convention city nearest you; then join the thousands of other worshipers of Jehovah all six days at this grand assembly. Plan now!

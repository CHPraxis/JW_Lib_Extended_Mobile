<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">ON MARCH 9, 1959, the Kingdom Ministry School began its first class at South Lansing, New York, providing special instruction for overseers in the New World society of Jehovah’s witnesses. Since then similar schools have been opened in many parts of the world. How has this provision been received? Just read the following expressions of appreciation and see!</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn"> One of the groups of overseers in the United States, on finishing the school term, said: “We have been taught basic Scriptural principles and their application to our work . . . as overseers. This instruction has been imparted in a most loving and practical manner, similar to the instruction given by Jesus and the apostles to the first-century Christians.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn"> A group that attended the School in the Netherlands said this about it: “In four short weeks we have been given a superb training in truths, policy and principles which should enable us to appreciate more fully our responsibility toward Jehovah. The clarification of our exact relationship to Jehovah and his theocratic organization was certainly an eye-opening experience to us.”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn"> At the conclusion of their schooling, a group in France appraised it in this way: “We are grateful for the timely counsel that has been assembled together in the instruction book, proving to us that the organisation has attained a maturity never known before and that it is to our eternal welfare to recognise and respect Jehovah’s organisation at all times, keeping in step with that organisation and so making progress in our Christian maturity.”</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn"> Overseers in Germany too expressed keen appreciation: “Several weeks of intensive training, loving admonition and upbuilding lie behind us, all of which surpassed by far our excited expectations and the joy we experienced when first invited. . . . The united pulsation of the heavenly and earthly organizations was certainly well expressed in school. We are sure that this arrangement will reach out and affect the organization for many years in the future, and we wish to dedicate ourselves anew to showing our appreciation for our Father’s undeserved kindness by loyally taking up the Kingdom interests, to the honor of Jehovah and for the assistance of thousands of our brothers.”</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sn"> A brother from the Society’s Brooklyn headquarters, who is a congregation servant in New York and who attended the School, said this: “The opportunity to enjoy the 96 hours of classroom discussion, coupled with about the same amount of time in private study, added up to a spiritually enriching experience. My life as an overseer has taken on new meaning; my appreciation of Bethel has deepened.”</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sn"> From Switzerland comes this expression of appreciation: “We consider this training as a further proof that Jehovah is the Great Shepherd of his people, that He is directing his earthly organization and that He is interested in the welfare and progress of every one of His servants. . . . We hope that many more servants may be privileged to receive this training. . . . Our stay here at Bethel has enabled us to look into the very clockwork of the Society and has made us appreciate even more the unselfish service of our brothers at Bethel. Working together with these brothers has been a great joy and enrichment to us. Then too, this course has been a unique occasion to have close contact with other overseers from many parts of the country.”</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sn"> And showing how much even those in the congregations appreciate the benefits from the School, a sister in a congregation in British Columbia, Canada, wrote this: “I want to express my appreciation for the special training our circuit servant has received, for we surely benefited from it this past visit. Although we have always been uplifted and helped by his visits, this time was so different. The only way I can find to express it is that I feel as though the warm oil of love has been poured on my aching wounds and now I heal without pain. We have suffered much from Satan’s onslaughts and the trials of the flesh in the last year or so, and somehow we rather expected to be told definitely that our offerings were lame and blind, but instead, praise and appreciation for what we have done; and, of course, you know the result: we want to do more and more, and we will with Jehovah’s help. So thank you for answering our every need as Jehovah directs.”</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sn"> Surely it is true, as <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:54:13-23:54:13" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Isaiah 54:13</a> says: “All your sons will be persons taught by Jehovah, and the peace of your sons will be abundant.”</p>

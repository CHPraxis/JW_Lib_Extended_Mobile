<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Toward the end of the Vancouver United Worshipers District Assembly the public relations department sent a special letter of thanks to each hotel and motel. These letters were followed up by a personal visit. One manager said it was the first time that a convention group had ever sent such a letter. The manager of the Vogue Hotel telephoned as soon as he received the letter, expressing thanks for sending such fine people to his hotel. About forty books were placed with these managers after the assembly, and many of them said that they had already received literature from the delegates before they checked out.</p>

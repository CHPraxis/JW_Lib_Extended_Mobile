<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Recognizing the vital importance of Bible knowledge and understanding, Jehovah’s witnesses are very active in distributing Bible literature at every opportunity. During November they will offer to all persons the newly released Bible-study aid <em>“Let Your Name Be Sanctified,” </em>with a booklet, for 50c.</p>

<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">“Hallowed be thy name” are words of Jesus’ model prayer as translated in the <em>King James </em>and <em>Douay </em>versions of the Bible. But whether in this more familiar form or in the more expressive form of the modern English, “Let your name be sanctified,” they were given to us to repeat with meaning. Do you know what Jesus was teaching <em>you </em>to pray for in this regard? How is God’s name going to be magnified above all others? Read the 384-page book <em>“Let Your Name Be Sanctified.” </em>Send only 50c. You will receive free the booklet <em>God’s Way Is Love.</em></p>

What Country Can Be Called Christian?
● “People are asking,” says B. A. Tobin in the Victoria Times, “if we should call a country a ‘Christian country’ if only a small fraction of its inhabitants really believe the doctrines of that religion. H. L. Mencken once wrote that ‘Christendom is that part of the world in which, if a man stand up and say he is a Christian, all his auditors will laugh.’ That was thirty years ago. Today, they aren’t even interested enough to laugh.”

FIELD MINISTRY
One who is whole-souled about New World interests will work hard to advance these interests. (Col. 3:23) Is that the way you feel about the interests of God’s new world? Then share with Jehovah’s witnesses during October as they endeavor to make information concerning God’s new world available to all persons by offering to them a year’s subscription for Awake! for $1. New subscribers will receive three booklets free.

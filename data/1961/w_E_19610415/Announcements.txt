FIELD MINISTRY
Ordained ministers must let their light shine to glorify and praise God. This Jehovah’s ministers will do throughout this final month of the Watchtower campaign by offering a year’s subscription for this outstanding Bible journal, The Watchtower, and three Scriptural booklets on a contribution of $1.
DRAW WISDOM FROM YOUR BIBLE
Ever since the Bible was written it has provided the most practical and upbuilding counsel for every activity of life. But drawing from its wellsprings of wisdom unassisted does not always produce the desired results. Have you found it so? You need never have that problem, This magazine you hold is constantly helping hundreds of thousands of persons to walk in God’s standards. Read The Watchtower regularly. Send only $1 for a year’s subscription and receive three timely booklets free. The hard-bound book You May Survive Armageddon into God’s New World has also helped thousands. Send only 50c for this 384-page Bible-study aid and learn God’s way for security and life everlasting.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Not returning “evil for evil” tends to destroy opposition. One man turned his dog loose on a Witness, in Tobago, West Indies, but she calmly stood her ground until the man’s wife came and called the dog off. The wife accepted some Bible magazines and invited the Witness to come back. When later meeting the same man on the street, the Witness gave no evidence of a grudge but greeted him as if nothing had happened. When the Witness made her return call on his wife she said that her husband admitted: “These people have what it takes. I treated her badly at my house, but she still speaks to me on the street.” He now listens and even reads some of the magazines.</p>

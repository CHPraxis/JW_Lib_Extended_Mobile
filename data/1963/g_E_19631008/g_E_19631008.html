<p><span class="font25">A</span><span class="font16"> STUDY of the material universe inspires awe for its Creator in the minds of honest men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">When one appreciates its staggering size and complexity, its order and unity, he realizes his own smallness and the unspeakable greatness of the One who created it all. His image of himself shrinks to insignificance as he contemplates the depths of space and realizes that the earth he stands on is less than a mere grain of sand by comparison.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">From the very largest heavenly bodies to the very smallest atomic particles, we are confronted with an order and design so marvelous that many who study it express themselves as one Harvard geology professor, who said: “We live in a universe not of chance or caprice, but of Law and Order. Its administration is completely rational and worthy of the utmost respect.</span></p>

<p><span class="font30" style="font-weight:bold;">Leaming from the Marvels of Creation</span></p>
<p><span class="font30" style="font-weight:bold;">—This is the fascinating theme developed in the articles on pages 3 to 23 of this special issue of “Awake!”</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div><img src="g_E_19631008_files/g_E_19631008-4.png" alt="" style="width:53pt;height:66pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font16">Consider the marvelous mathematical scheme of nature that permits us to give consecutive atomic numbers to every element.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">The </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Universe</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">When astronomers began mapping the heavens centuries ago they never dreamed of its size and complexity. What at first appeared through that telescopes to be distant stars were later found to be entire “island universes” of stars, called galaxies, where billions of stars were collected together in orderly systems.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">More advanced telescopes revealed thousands, millions, yes, billions of these galaxies. So colossal has the size of our universe proved to be and so vast the distances within it that the most advanced scientific methods have only scratched the surface in understanding it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">The billions of galaxies, each containing innumerable stars, planets and other bodies, were also found to be in orderly arrangement For example, our galaxy, called the Milky Way, containing about 100,000,000,000 stars, is associated with at least seventeen other galaxies in what might be called a galactic group. Other galactic groups contain hundreds, or even thousands, of galaxies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">King David of ancient Israel, with far less knowledge of the heavens than we now have, was compelled to exclaim: “When I see your heavens, the works of your fingers, the moon and the stars that you have prepared, what is mortal man that you keep him in mind?”—Ps. 8:3, 4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Distance</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Despite the existence of so many heavenly bodies, there is little danger of collision, for the spaces in between them are immense.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Our closest neighbor, the moon, is over 238,000 miles away. But since there are about 100,000,000,000 stars in our own galaxy, the Milky Way, are not some of them close enough to endanger earth? No, because the nearest star is the sun, and it is 93,000,000 miles away. The next closest star is about 270,000 times as far away from us as the sun is!</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">So vast are distances in the universe that they are measured in “light years,” the distance light travels in one year at its speed of over 186,000 miles per second. This amounts to about six trillion (6,000,-000,000,000) miles a year! That closest star other than the sun, one of the Alpha Centauri group, is over four light years away, or about twenty-five trillion (25,-000,000,000,000) miles distant!</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Our Milky Way galaxy measures about 100,000 light years in diameter, which helps explain why its myriads of stars are in little danger of colliding. Beyond that, the distance from our Milky Way galaxy to the next closest galaxy like it, called Andromeda, is about 1,400,000 light years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">That means that if you traveled at the rate of 186,000 miles each second, it would take you almost 1,400,000 years to reach this neighbor galaxy!</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">The stars that make up the bulk of these galaxies are self-illuminating bodies like our sun. Each is a huge sphere of intensely glowing gas. Some are so dense that one , cubic inch of their material weighs several million pounds. The density of the star most familiar to us, the sun, is only about one and a half times that of liquid water.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">While the size of our sun is impressive, it is only average as stars go. Its diameter of 864,000 miles seems very large compared to earth’s diameter of about 8,000 miles, but one star in our Milky Way, Antares, has a diameter of about 350,000,000 miles, 400 times that of our sun. If one edge of Antares were placed at our earth, it would reach to the sun and nearly three times beyond it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Making the entire arrangement even more awesome to our finite minds is the fact that no end to these stars and star systems can be detected. Each time more powerful instruments peer into the universe, it is seen to stretch beyond that new limit of vision.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">The entire gigantic mass is precisely arranged and accurate in its movements. Day after day, year after year, century after century, the stars and planets follow their paths through the skies in such orderly fashion, and are so regular in their orbits, that eclipses may be predicted centuries in advance. Even our finest timepieces can be set by their movements. So orderly are they that men stake their lives on the laws that govern their regularity when they use them as navigational aids to cross dark oceans by air and sea. The book </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">The World We Live In</span><span class="font16"> states: “For all its complexity, the solar system also reveals an order and harmony that has ever impressed scientists contemplating the laws that govern the motions of the skies.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">This magnificent expanse shouts out the glory and power of its Creator, of whom Isaiah said: &quot;Raise your eyes high up and see. Who has created these things? It is the One who is bringing forth the army of them even by number, all of whom he calls even by name. Due to the abundance of dynamic energy, he also being vigorous in power, not one of them is missing.” —Isa. 40:26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">The Smallest</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">About a century ago English physicist John Dalton’s experiments showed that the various elements behaved as if they were composed of tiny units. He called these units atoms, and thought they were indivisible, solid particles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Through the century that followed, further experiments disclosed that the atom was not the smallest unit. Step by step three basic building blocks were discovered inside the atom: protons, neutrons and electrons. These three particles were found to have the same orderliness as the rest of the universe. Like a miniature solar system, electrons were discovered to be speeding around a nucleus of protons and neutrons in a law-abiding system.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">How big is an atom? Only a few billionths of an inch in diameter! Most of its mass is concentrated in the nucleus of protons and neutrons. The size of this nucleus, however, is 100,000 times smaller than the entire diameter of the atom with its orbiting electrons. Incredibly, as in the arrangement of stars and galaxies, the atom consists mostly of space between the nucleus and its orbiting electrons. Even with 6,000,-000,000,000,000,000,000 (six sextillion) atoms in one drop of water, there is far more space than matter!</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Yet, this is not all. Until recent years it was thought that the protons, neutrons and electrons were the tiniest building blocks of creation. However, modem research has brought to light many other small particles inside the atom. Scientists number them at more than thirty. Some are thought to relate to that mysterious force holding the nucleus of the atom together, which, when split, produces the fantastic quantities of energy seen in atomic explosions. There is also some evidence now that even the protons and neutrons themselves may be minute systems, with a central core or nucleus surrounded by clouds of smaller particles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Declare the Glory of God</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">So whether we examine the universe or the atom we observe amazing power, order, unity and complexity far beyond our ability fully to comprehend. What we can comprehend is that the same order and harmony in both testify to their having the same Creator.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">As a professor of biology stated: &quot;From the drop of water seen through the microscope to the distant star observed through the telescope I marvel at .the exact orderliness that I observe—so exact that laws have been formulated to express its consistency. . . . Somewhere back of all this order must be a Supreme Being, for there can be no order and no laws without a Supreme Mind.” Einstein said he had &quot;a deeply emotional conviction of the presence of a superior reasoning power, which is revealed in the incomprehensible universe.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">From the large to the'small, from star to atom, our universe strikingly demonstrates the power and harmony of God’s work and underscores the expression of the psalmist who wrote*. “The heavens are declaring the glory of God; and of the work of his hands the expanse is telling.”—Ps. 19:1.</span></p>

<p><span class="font25">E</span><span class="font16">ARTH is man's home, his only home. Try as he will, he cannot stay away from it in space for any length of time. His life depends upon it. His need for it stimulates his hunger for knowledge about it. What he has learned reveals that life on the earth is no accident, but that earth was specifically designed for human habitation. There are ever so many of its characteristics that, as far as is known, are peculiar to it and that are imperative to the life of man and beast.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">First of all, there is earth’s temperature. This depends primarily upon its distance from the sun, some 93 million miles, with a variation of three million miles in the course of a year. Were the earth as far removed from the sun as are the planets Neptune and Pluto, no life of the type fou&amp;d on. earth would be possible. The temperature would be far too cold. On the other hand, If the earth were much closer to the sun, life likewise would be impossible because of the extreme heat. The Mariner II space vehicle, shot into space within the</span></p>

<p><span class="font16">as it rotates on its axis. Were the earth to rotate on its axis only once a year, as is the case with its sister planet Mercury, one half of the earth would be a frozen subzero waste and the other half a burning furnace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Concerning the importance of temperature to the maintenance of life upon the earth, A. R. Wallace once well said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">“The essential features of the structure of organized beings are, continuous growth and repair of tissues, nutrition by the absorption of dead or living matter from without, and its transformation into the various unstable compounds of which their bodies are built up. For these purposes a double system of circulation, gaseous and liquid, has to be continuously in operation, and this is carried on by means of minute tubular or cellular vessels which permeate every part of the body. These wonderfully complex and ■exquisitely adjusted circulating systems are entirely dependent on the continuous maintenance of a very narrow range of temperature somewhere between the extremes of the boiling and the freezing points of water.”<sup>1</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">The Atmosphere</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Only slightly less important than the right temperature of the earth is its atmosphere, which gives no less striking evidence for earth’s</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font16">past year, revealed that the surface of Venus, a planet that is one-third closer to the sun than is the earth, has a surface temperature of 800° F., a temperature that is far above the melting point of lead. Clearly, the earth’s distance from the sun is evidence of design.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">And so is the very speed of the earth being designed for human habitation. Thus concerning the nature of earth’s atmosphere one authority states;</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">“The signal fact is that the rare gases are present here in only small amounts, much smaller than those known elsewhere in the universe. At the same time, oxygen, nitrogen . . . and water vapor are present in much greater abundance than elsewhere. The relative distribution of the elements in the universe </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">has been determined by spectroscopic analysis </span><span class="font15">of meteorites. These show that the rare gases are present here only In a few millionths to </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font15">billionth of their cosmic abundance. Now, since the solar system and probably the Known universe are generally assumed to have been formed simultaneously, the Earth should have contained a reasonably proportionate share of the various elements.”<sup>2</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font16">But such is not the case. Why? And what is the origin of atmospheric oxygen, which is found in such abundance in earth’s atmosphere (21 percent) and which is so indispensable to life? Scientists cannot answer. They offer various hypotheses, but there are objections to all of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Yes, no other known planet has an atmosphere capable of sustaining human life. Was this a mere accident, something that happened by chance, a product of random?</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Nor is that all. The atmosphere not only makes human life possible on the earth but it is a most vital factor in preserving it According to the </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Larousse Encyclopedia of the Earth,</span><span class="font16"> the atmosphere does this by acting, first of all, “as an insulating blanket, keeping temperatures in middle and high altitudes from dropping to extremes during night and winter.” Secondly, according to this same authority, “the atmosphere serves to protect us from those of the Sun’s rays which are harmful. The ultraviolet end of the spectrum in particular, while important and necessary for life, is nevertheless fatal below certain wavelengths.”<sup>3</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font16">What protects the earth from these rays is a thin layer of ozone some 100,000 miles above the surface of the earth. Who but the Designer of the earth and Creator of man could have foreseen the vital need for such a shield? Nor are the sun’s harmful rays the only ones against which the earth’s atmosphere furnishes protection. When the earth passed through the tail of Halley’s comet in 1910, it was feared that harm would come to the human race because that tail contained cyanogen, a deadly gas. But even as the atmosphere protects man from the sun’s harmful rays so it prevented this gas from reaching the surface of the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Acting like a protective canopy, the atmosphere further protects man from the multitudes of meteors that fall upon the earth. At times thousands fall in one night. They could cause great harm and damage to the earth and its inhabitants if they were not burned up by friction due to the earth’s atmosphere. The condition on the moon highlights this fact. Thus we are told:</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">“The utter contrast between the surfaces of the Moon and the Earth, whose environments in space are so similar, is particularly striking. The Moon’s surface is dry and without air. On it are no continents, no long ranges of mountains, and no active volcanoes, but instead a multitude of meteorite craters of all sizes, which are almost lacking on the earth.’’*</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">■Not to be overlooked is the role that the atmosphere plays in the earth’s water cycle. The waters drawn from the ocean by the rays of the sun form clouds that float or are driven by winds in the atmosphere over the land areas, where they fall as rain. Without such rainfall, man could not live. Surely these varying and vital roles that the atmosphere plays in making human life possible upon the surface of the earth could not be the result of blind chance but, rather, argue eloquently in favor of the earth’s being designed-for human habitation by a great Designer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Other Vital Cycles</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">In addition to the water cycle there are also the phosphorus, nitrogen and oxygen cycles, all indispensable to the life of man and beast and giving further eloquent testimony that the earth was indeed designed for human habitation. For example, if there is any truly mineral element more important to life than any other it is phosphorus. It Is comparatively rare and transient, being easily lost by being combined with other elements. Man and beast get it especially by eating grains, which take it from the soil. It is returned to the soil by manure and decaying bodies. Because of man’s carelessness much precious phosphorus is washed into the sea, impoverishing the land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">However, this phosphorus is not lost entirely, for the sea has its own phosphorus cycle. Plankton absorbs phosphorus, zooplankton eats the plankton, small fish eat the zooplankton, and large fish the small fish. When sea plants and animals die they sink to the bottom of the ocean to build up reserves of phosphorus, to which is add</span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">ed </span><span class="font16">that which comes into the sea by soil erosion and sewage. In temperate climates cold weather causes an inversion of the upper and lower layers of water, thus bringing the phosphorus up. so that it can be eaten by the plankton. This starts the cycle all over again. Large numbers of the human race depend upon fish for protein, and the abundance of fish in the ocean largely depends upon this inversion of the upper and lower layers of water, this phosphorus cycle of the &amp;a. Likewise indispensable to human life is the oxygen cycle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">There is no question about oxygen being vital to man’s habitation of the earth. It is kept in equilibrium by the oxygen cycle. Plants maintain this cycle by taking carbon dioxide out of the air and releasing oxygen. Man and beast, in turn, take in the oxygen and release carbon dioxide.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Still another cycle indispensable to man’s earthly existence is that of nitrogen, a gas that comprises 78 percent of the earth’s atmosphere. Nitrogen is a comparatively inert gas that man does not utilize. It is fortunate for man that nitrogen is so inert, that it does not readily mix with other elements. If it did. the oceans would all be a weak solution of nitric add, making life on earth impossible. In the nitrogen cycle the thunderstorms as well as bacteria found on the roots of such plants as peas, beans and clover, introduce nitrogen into the soil in the form of nitrates that can be absorbed by plants. As plants and animal matter decay they release nitrogen to the atmosphere, thereby completing the cycle. Another valuable purpose served by nitrogen is that of a dilutent of the air’s oxygen so that there is just the right amount of free oxygen to support life and for the burning of combustible materials. Surely all these cycles, so vital to life on earth, could not possibly be the product of blind chance but forcefully argue that the earth was indeed designed for human habitation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Other Factors</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Among other factors that argue in behalf of the earth’s being designed for human habitation are the size and location of the moon. Were the moon twice its present size, it would cause such tides and bulgings In'the earth’s crust that man and beast could not exist upon the earth, that is, upon the land. The same is true if the moon were half the distance from the earth that it presently is.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">The lowly, humble dust particle furnishes still another proof of design. Dust enters the earth’s atmosphere by means of meteors, volcanoes and desert winds. Without dust, life would not be possible upon earth. Says </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">The Encyclopedia Americana:</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">&quot;No condensation of moisture, as in rain, mist, fog, could occur without nuclei such as dust particles. If the atmosphere were not impregnated with dust there would be no cloud effects, no radiant sunsets, no soft after* glow; the sun would go down instantly, the harmonious colorings, which lend a halo to the quiet evening would never have been.’’<sup>5</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Intelligent design is also evident in the tilt of earth’s axis at </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">an angle </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">at</span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;"> 23 de</span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">grees.</span><span class="font16"> Consider what a past president of the New York Academy of Sciences and a life member of the Royal Institution of Great Britain had to say about this:</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">&quot;The earth is tilted at an angle of twenty-three degrees. This gives us our seasons. If it had not been tilted, the poles would be in eternal twilight. The water vapor fromthe ocean would move north and south, piling up continents of ice and leaving possibly a desert between the equator and the ice. Glacial rivers would erode and roar through canyons into the salt-covered bed of the ocean to form temporary pools of brine. The weight of the unbelievably vast mass of ice would depress the poles, causing our equator to bulge or erupt or at least show the need of a new waistline belt. The lowering of the ocean would expose vast new land areas and diminish the rainfall in all parts of the world, with fearful results.”<sup>0</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Much more evidence could be adduced, would space permit, but the foregoing should suffice to prove that the earth was designed for human habitation. Such an amazing number of conditions and balances could not by any means have come about by chance. Only because of design are men of science able to say regarding it:</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">“Man’s home—the surface of the Earth —is a small and temperate shelter set in a vast and alien universe . . . Well may mankind glory in its fertile plains, its snow-capped pinnacles, its mighty oceans, for they are rare examples of moderation in a universe where extremes of heat and cold prevail ... On earth the greatest miracle is life, but the combination of circumstances which have made life possible is hardly less remarkable.”<sup>4</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Man Designed for the Earth</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Yes, it is no less true that man was designed for earthly habitation. As the Bible makes clear, “To Jehovah the heavens belong, but the earth he has given to the sons of men.” (Ps. 115:16) Man’s arms, legs and hands are ideally suited for him to move about on this earth, to provide for himself food, clothing and shelter. The earth abounds with sounds; man’s ear is constructed so as to pick up the greatest possible number of sounds useful and enjoyable to him. The earth also abounds in colors, and man has color vision. More than all this, man has an intellect, a brain, making possible his appreciating of beauty, so that al] this beauty is not wasted on him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Man has been given a set of teeth, and the earth abounds with all manner of fruits, vegetables, cereals, on which to use his teeth, as well as such sweets as maple syrup and honey to delight his sense of taste. Water is indispensable to man’s existence, and what an abundance of it there is upon earth! There was a time when “scientists” blithely speculated that someday man would content himself with a few concentrated pellets. But now he knows better, for both taste and bulk are essential for proper digestion and elimination, and the food’s being pleasing to the eye also aids in digestion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Earth designed for human habitation and man designed for earthly habitation —by whom? By the Creator, Jehovah God, even as we read in his Word, the Bible, at Isaiah 45:18: “This is what Jehovah has said, the Creator of the heavens, He the true God, the Former of the earth and the Maker of it, He the One who firmly established it, who did not create it simply for nothing, who formed it even to be inhabited: ‘I am Jehovah, and there is no one else.’ ” And as we note </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">how</span><span class="font16"> He made all things we are compelled to exclaim, in the words of the psalmist: “How many your works are, O Jehovah! All of them in wisdom you have made. The earth is full of your productions.”—Ps. 104:24.</span></p>

<p><span class="font24" style="font-variant:small-caps;">A</span><span class="font17" style="font-variant:small-caps;">lthough</span><span class="font16"> this planet is called earth, 71 percent of its surface is covered by the seas. The volume of water that they contain is so great that, if the earth were bulldozed smooth, seawater would inundate it to a depth of over two miles. But far from being a vast wasteland, the seas swarm with life. In fact, the first living creatures on this planet were de-rigned so as to live comfortably in the seas. To this end “God blessed them, saying: ‘Be fruitful and become many and fill the waters in the sea basins.’&quot;—Gen. 1:9,20-23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Those that have explored the ocean depths are amazed at the beauty of design and the mobility of these countless sea creatures. There Seems to be no end to their variety, and each one is equipped so as to live in Its particular habitat; wheth</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">er </span><span class="font16">that be at the seashore, in warm surface waters, or in the near-freezing depths of undersea valleys beneath more than six miles of water.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Exploring Seashore Life</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Although one may be inspired by the majestic waves pounding a rocky shore, a careful examination of the many living creatures that make their home along the shore can be equally rewarding. Many of the animals have remarkable behavior cycles that are repeated with the ebb and flow of the tides. The regular changing of color of the common fiddler crab is a good example. The </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Scientific American</span><span class="font16"> of April 1954 reported the following interesting results of some experiments conducted on these creatures:</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">“Sometimes the crab is darkest in the morning, sometimes at noon and occasionally both early in the morning and early in the evening. The time of</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">greatest darkening tends to occur about 50 minutes later each successive day. Now it is common knowledge that high and low tides in any given locality also occur about 50 minutes later each day. We found that the maximum darkening of the crabs in our laboratory came at about the time of day when the tide was low in the place where they had been collected. In other words, at the very same time that crabs bn the beach were taking on their darkest hue as protection from the sunlight and predators, their captured relatives in the laboratory, who had been kept in a darkroom for as long as a month, also were becoming their darkest.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">How marvelously these creatures are designed for their protection! To emphasize how remarkably precise is the mechanism that triggers this change of color, “fiddler crabs from Woods Hole were kept in the darkroom side by side with crabs from Martha’s Vineyard, where low tide comes four hours later in the day. The Vineyard crabs turned their darkest just four hours later than the Woods Hole crabs!” Where do sea creatures get the wonderful timing mechanism that is triggered by the ebb and flow of the tides? Evading the answer that God is responsible, scientists say “that such biological clocks are inherited.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Another wonderful creature that is found attached to rocks or in tide pools along the shore is the sea anemone. How beautifully colored they are! Some are olive green, others are flesh-colored or orange, while still others are pink or crimson. Slender undulating tentacles arranged around a central disc give them the appearance of lovely flowers. But let tiny shrimps or minnows in the vicinity beware! Those colorful tentacles possess minute .“lasso threads” that dart out and paralyze unsuspecting victims with poison. The petallike tentacles then reach out and pull the stunned prey into its center, where it vanishes into the mouth of the anemone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Thus the beautiful, heiplesS-looking anemone is wonderfully designed for survival. But perhaps even more marvelous is the way that it contributes to the support and well-being of the daddy-longlegs of the shore creatures, known as the sea spider. After the anemone has finished dining, this eight-legged, spiderlike creature emerges from some secret lair among the weeds and pebbles and confidently crawls over the anemone's colorful tentacles. Surprisingly, no poisonous threads dart out to strike him. Instead, the sea spider proceeds unmolested to the center of the anemone, where it inserts its long snout into the anemone’s mouth, and calmly sucks up the contents of the latter’s stomach!</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Why does the sea anemone allow this robbery? That is no more puzzling than why certain fish and shrimp make their home in the anemone’s stomach and are never digested, while similar little creatures are consumed. In tropical waters sea anemones grow to huge sizes, having tentacles two feet in length. Amazingly, they allow brightly colored coral fish to dart in and out of their stomachs, even though their everyday food consists of similar fish.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Hospitals and Beauty Parlors</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">An article in </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Scientific- American</span><span class="font16"> of August 1961 suggests that the sea anemone may, in some way, benefit from the probing into its entrails by other sea creatures. The magazine explained that studies have revealed that a large number of marine organisms either live by cleaning other flsh or benefit from being cleaned by them. Cleaner fish, which are now known to include twenty-six species, are specially equipped for their work with pointed snouts and tweezerlike teeth. Since other fish do not molest them, they are generally brightly colored and stand out in their environment. Host fish of many kinds travel long distances in order to receive treatment at these hospitals and beauty parlors of the underworld.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">“Even a small cleaning station,” this scientific journal reported, “may process a large number of fish. to. the eeus^e. of a day. I saw up to 300 fish cleaned at one station in the Bahamas during one six-hour daylight period. Some of the fishes pass from station to station and return many times during the day; those that could be identified by visible marks, such as infection spots, returned day after day at regular time intervals.” This amazing behavior called “cleaning symbiosis” is recognized as an important activity that occurs throughout the marine world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">But scientists wonder “what mechanism prevents ordinarily voracious fishes from devouring the little cleaners.” Clearly, it is all part of God’s marvelous design, which design becomes so evident when one explores “his wonderful works in the depths.” —Ps. 107:24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Designed for Their Habitat</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Consider, for instance, fishes that inhabit cold northern waters. Recently scientists took some of them from the Hebron Fiord in Labrador, where both the water</span></p>

<p><span class="font16">and the flsh were a few degrees below freezing. The fish, however, were protected by a built-in supply of antifreeze.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Then there are sea birds and turtles that are </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">able to</span><span class="font16"> drink salty seawater, which would dehydrate and sicken their landdwelling cousins. How is this possible? Recent studies reported in the January 1959 </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Scientific American</span><span class="font16"> show that, in addition to their kidneys, sea birds have “a special </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">gland in </span><span class="font16">the head which disposes of salt more rapidly than any kidney does.” Similar experiments with sea turtles revealed that their tears come from a large gland behind their eyeball, which produces a liquid about the same as that of the salt gland secretions of the sea bird.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">The more man learns about the creatures of the sea, the more he is impressed with the wonderful way they are made to live in their environment. Fish gills, for instance, are so marvelously designed for extracting oxygen from the water and throwing off carbon dioxide, that scientists are studying the possibility of constructing an artificial gill like the fish’s. Swim bladders and other devices that allow sea creature </span><span class="font17" style="font-variant:small-caps;">b</span><span class="font16"> to float, and adjust to various ocean depths are equally amazing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">True, not all flsh have swim bladders, but those that do not are the bottom-they are in some way specially equipped, as are the streamlined, wellmuscled mackerel and tuna, who find constant motion practically effortless. Most other fish v possess swim bladders that expand as the fish ascends, helping it to rise, and compress when the fish descends, allowing it to sink. The flsh can then adjust </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font16">volume of gas in the bladder so as to bring itself into equilibrium with the depth it desires.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Some sea creatures, however, have special floating devices. </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Scientific American of</span><span class="font16"> July 1960 described how the cuttlefish “uses its cuttlebone [a large absorbent bone along its back] as a submarine commander uses the buoyancy tanks of his craft. When the submarine is to submerge, its buoyancy tanks are filled with water; when it is to surface, compressed air blows the water out of the tanks. ... In its eutl Rebone the cuttlefish thus possesses a buoyancy-regulating device of a most ingenious kind.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font16">The squid, on the other hand, possesses a large cavity that is filled with just the right amount of fluid of the proper density to give it buoyancy. Interestingly, the deep-diving bathyscaphe bears a resemblance to the squid, and for that reason cranchid squid are sometimes called “bathyscaphoid squid.” “Though the etymology of the term is dubious,” the abovequoted science magazine observed, “it may serve to remind us of an important lesson: Our pride in man’s latest discoveries must be tempered by the knowledge that other animals may have been using them from time Thus the exploration of the sea is not only fascinating, but it also teaches man that the Master Designer of the marvelous wonders found there should be looked to for guidance and wisdom.</span></p>

<p><span class="font25">H</span><span class="font16">UMAN engineers usually require a college degree, since they need to learn how to plan or build roads, bridges, dams, canals and tunnels. But in nature there are amazing engineers that do not have school for engineers to learn how to build dams, canals or tunnels; they just </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">know </span><span class="font16">how.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">An expert in tunnel construction is a kind of ground squirrel of western North America called the prairie dog. This underground engineer excavates an almost straight vertical shaft eight to sixteen feet deep. The tunnel’s entrance is given special attention. It is situated in the middle of a kind of small volcano of earth. This elevation serves as a barrier against floods, preventing heavy rains from inundating the tunnel. What if the rain is so heavy that even the elevated entrance is temporarily submerged? Nature’s flood-control engineers make arrangements for such an emergency.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Besides the regular tunnels, the prairie dogs construct, not far from the surface, lateral tunnels off the vertical main passageway. As the floodwater pours into the burrow, the prairie dogs hurry into the ends of the emergency tunnels. Water rushing into the burrow forces air up into the emergency tunnels, forming air pockets. These prevent water from advancing farther into the tunnel, thus providing these underground engineers with a place of safety.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">For amazing speed in tunnel construction few of nature’s underground engineers exceed the moles and certain armadillos. One mole was observed to dig a tunnel five feet or more in twenty-six minutes, a rate of about twelve feet an hour. An armadillo has been observed to bury itself completely in two minutes—this in soil so hard that one needed a pickax to dig a hole. Not only can armadillos dig with prodigious speed, but the eleven-banded armadillo excavates tremendous warrens in the forest floor that go down as much af fifty feet, coming out at water level at the bottom of river cliffs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Perhaps the strangest of nature’s underground engineers is the duckbilled platypus. This egg-laying mammal constructs a burrow that penetrates the riverbank to a length of from five to upward of sixty feet. Several exits are usually built in. Mrs. Platypus also barricades her burrow with a series of loose earth stoppers at intervals along the main tunnel leading to the outside. All this ensures privacy for the platy-pusery, which the mother does not leave till the young have learned to suck from her fur milk that seeps through certain special pores in her skin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Expert in Building Dams</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Tunnel construction is just one of the many engineering works of the beavers. These bark-eating rodents, found chiefly in North America, weigh from thirty to fifty pounds and are noted for their construction of dams. These dams are not trivial affairs, as some people view them, but they construct what one naturalist calls “serious engineering feats on a very large scale.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Yes, some beaver-built dams are more than a thousand feet long, the height varying from two feet to as much as fifteen or even more. An amazingly skilled beaver colony once built a dam on the Jefferson River in Montana that spanned 2,140 feet! Beaver-engineered dams may be built straight, curved or even in an S-shape. Some contain thousands of tons of materials.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Much of the dam construction material is wood. For cutting down trees, beaver engineers are well equipped. They have a built-in ax; four yellow-orange, chisellike teeth.<sup>1</sup>' With these self-shaipening teeth, they can cut down a tree four inches in diameter in about fifteen minutes. Cutting trees down* is not a rare occurrence. A study of beaver colonies in Michigan revealed that each beaver cut down an average of six trees every ten days! With their two nimble front paws, beavers manipulate the sticks, mud or other building material needed for a dam.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Nature’s engineers usually begin a dam by cutting willow or other branches, carrying them to the bottom of the stream, fixing them in place with their butt ends upstream. They add mud, gravel and stones; then another layer of brush and saplings; then more mud and stones, and so on until the dam is as high as needed. The result Is a strong watertight dam that will stand for many years. A spillway is also usually provided.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">The pond is usually made in an area where food trees are plentiful, trees such as the poplar and aspen, since the bark of these trees is their favorite food; but they dine on most hardwood trees. The ponds made by the beaver dams may be only an acre or so in extent, or they may be several hundreds or even several thousands of acres.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Home and Canal Building</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Why do beaver engineers work so diligently to build a complex dam? The purpose centers around the beaver’s need to store up food for the winter and to build a suitable house or lodge. Though some beavers, especially those in Europe, live in burrows dug in the banks of streams, most beavers in North America have as their final aim a dam, pond and house.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Beavers build houses that vary from eight or ten feet to nearly forty feet in diameter. The lodge may have two levels or floors, the dining room being just a few inches above water level. The second level is floored with peeled sticks or shredded wood, especially cedar, since it is unlikely to harbor pesty insects. In the center of the roof of the house there is a ventilation shaft. Near the house itself beavers store up underwater supplies of food. Also underwater are the entrances to the beaver’s house. The beaver needs a dam, then, so it can have a pond with a constant level of water to keep the underwater tunnel entrances to its house permanently concealed from unwelcome visitors, such as hungry foxes. Moreover, with a pond at a constant level, freezing weather never prevents these furry engineers from having free access to their sunken stores of wood and bark.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">When it comes time to plaster their house, beavers continue to display skill. They do the plastering only after the first hard frost, the whole building except the ventilation opening being coated with mud, which freezes hard and forms a solid protection against attacks by enemies. If the beavers plastered their house before the frost, they would risk the plaster’s being washed away by rain; but the beaver engineers avoid that mistake.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Another display of beaver engineering wisdom lies in the fact that sometimes they build a smaller dam in addition to the main dam. They build it downstream in order </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">to back up some water against</span><span class="font16"> the original dam and thus decrease the pressure of water on it from the other side.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Amazing engineers? So much so that they have repaired a dam that human engineers could not repair. “A few years ago,” reports the New York </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Times Magazine</span><span class="font16"> of January 24, 1960, “an atomic energy storage dam on Canada’s Chalk River developed a leak that engineers couldn’t find. Stumped, they brought in a pair of beavers and loosed them on the dam. In less than a week the beavers had found the leak—and repaired it.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">But building and repairing dams is just one </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">of the many</span><span class="font16"> ways beavers Sttsplay engineering skill. Some naturalists view their construction of canals as an even greater feat. Yes, it is true that beavers, usually in western North America, sometimes build canals on which to float their food supplies, sections of branches and tree trunks, to their pond. The canals may be from three to five feet in width, three feet deep and may be as long as 750 feet! Beaver-engineered canals may have two or even three water levels and little dams that serve as locks. Yes, not without reason </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Hammond's Nature Atlas of America</span><span class="font16"> calls the beaver “An Engineering Genius.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Thinking Done for Them</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">How do nature’s engineers do it? How does the prairie dog build an underground home with several flood-control devices? How do beavers know the basic laws of hydraulic engineering? The answer is that nature’s engineers have had their thinking done for them. They have built-in patterns of behavior, usually called instinct or instinctive wisdom. Animals can learn something from experience, of course, but such learning is extremely limited. True instincts, on the other hand, are neither taught nor transmitted by example from one generation to the next; they are part of the genetic code determining the species. “An animal is born,” says the volume </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">The Animal Kingdom,</span><span class="font16"> “with an inherited sense that it obeys without question. It comes into the world with the ability to act and protect itself according to its immediate needs—without instruction or learning gained from experience.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Just as the spider's ability to make an intricate web is inborn in the spider, so that baby spiders make small webs correct in almost every detail, so likewise is the beaver’s ability to build a dam. This is shown by the fact that a beaver raised from infancy by the French naturalist Cuvier was able to perform its woodcutting, hauling and construction work as efficiently as members of its kind that grew up in the wild.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Since engineering wisdom is inborn in nature’s engineers, how did they get it? How did the prairie dog become a floodcontrol engineer? How do nature’s underground </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">engineers dig with amazing</span><span class="font16"> rapidity complicated burrows? How did the beaver become “an engineering genius&quot;? Was it “blind chance” or an unreasoning force? No, but those amazing animal engineers point to the Great Engineer and Architect of all things who imparted to the animal creation a marvelous variety of instinctive wisdom. Little wonder, with every new engineering concept developed by man it usually turns out that nature’s engineers had it first!</span></p>
<p><span class="font25">B</span><span class="font16">Y WRAPPING the earth in a green, colorfully decorated mantle, plant life makes man's planetary home a delightful place in which to live. In fact, its presence spells the difference between the earth's being what it is and its being a barren, lifeless chunk of matter floating in space. Without it no life could exist on earth, because, either directly or indirectly, all living creatures are dependent upon plants for life. They alone are able to synthesize food from air, water and elements from the soil. The marvelous manner in which they do this is clearly no accident.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Every green plant is an astonishing factory that does what no human factory or scientific laboratory has been able to do. It extracts carbon from carbon dioxide gas in the atmosphere, hydrogen and oxygen from the water it draws from the soil, and then combines these elements into a great variety of complex products. The energy it needs for doing this it gets from sunlight.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Without university training in chemistry and, in fact, without the ability to think and reason, a plant combines carbon, hydrogen and oxygen atoms to make complicated foods such as starch, protein, oil, fat and sugar. Through small pores called stomata, a plant takes in air from the atmosphere. Out of the carbon dioxide in the air it extracts carbon. In fact, it is estimated that plants remove 100,000,000,000 tons of carbon from the atmosphere every year. But oxygen, needed by men and animals, is liberated from the leaves as a waste product resulting from their breaking down water into hydrogen and oxygen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Not all the water taken up by a plant is used by it. A large amount is transpired or evaporated from its leaves. A sunflower, for example, might give off a quart of water in a single day. Necessarily, transpiration must be regulated so the plant will not lose water when it needs it.- This is accomplished by an increase or a decrease in the swelling of the two crescent-shaped guard cells that surround the mouth of each pore. Thus wilting causes the pores to close, stopping the plant’s loss of water. The guard cells of many plants open the pores or stomata when the air is moist but close them when the air is dry or when darkness stops photosynthesis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Did the plants reason out for themselves that transpiration must be controlled and that it can be done by means of guard cells? Did they conceive the complex process of using sunlight, carbon dioxide and water to make sugar, starch, fats, proteins, and so forth? How did they come to master the complicated process of photosynthesis without intelligence when the greatest minus, among men are unable to duplicate the process, much less understand how it is carried on?</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Pollination</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">The manner in which flowers are fertilized shows all the evidence of clear thinking and thorough understanding of natural laws. Their structure could not have been accidental. The male organs of a flower are its pollen-bearing stamens, and the female organs are the pollen-catching stigmas along with the ovules that produce seeds. When the stamen and the stigma are in the same blossom, the flower is usually designed in such a way that it is not selfpollinating but must be pollinated by another flower. Self-pollination is commonly prevented by a condition in which the stamens and jristil of a flower mature at different times. In the case of the flreweed, the style, which bears the stigma, is curved backward during the period that the stamens are producing pollen. After </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font16"> while it straightens out and extends itself beyond the stamens so that it can receive pollen from another plant. Is this not obviously the product of intelligent designing?</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Some plants are pollinated by insects, and their blooms show evidence of having been designed for that very purpose. Certain flowers attract bees, others moths, and still others butterflies, flies or beetles. There are types that specialize in birds as their pollinators.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Bee flowers are generally blue or yellow or some mixture of these colors. This is the part of the color spectrum to which a bee’s vision is limited. In the case of many of the flowers that use moths as pollinators, they do not open until dusk or night, when the moths coniie out. Also, their color tends to run mainly in the white shades so they can be seen by the moths under the poor light conditions when the moths are flying about. How did they get this sense of timing and insight on color?</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Flowers that use short-tongued flies as pollinators have odors that attract them. The large-blossomed Rafflesia of Malaysia gives off a smell like that of putrefying flesh, and the black arum has an odor like that of human dung. Since these flies live on such things, they are attracted to the flowers, and as they crawl over them, they pollinate them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Some of the flowers that use bees as pollinators have a special lever or trigger device that brings the anther down so that it can dust pollen on the back of the bee when it enters the flower. At this time the female organ, the stigma, is not mature. It stays in the upper part of the flower, but later it will open and curve down so that it will rub a bee’s back. In this way the flower picks up pollen from a bee or, with the anthers, gives it a load of pollen for another flower. Did the flower foresee the necessity of giving pollen for other flowers as well as receiving it for itself? Did it devise this means of using insects as pollinators?</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">In the case of the lady’s slipper, the bloom forms a sac with the opposite sides curling upward and then inward where the sides meet at the top. The bumblebee that lands on the top of the blossom falls into the sac, where it feeds on the nectar of the flower. Nectar, incidentally, is produced by flowers for the specific purpose of attracting insects or birds. Flowers that are wind-pollinated produce neither nectar nor aroma. Once a bumblebee falls into the sac of a lady’s slipper, the only way it can get out is to crawl out the opening at the end of the blossom near the stem. As it does so, it must first brush against the stigma, which takes pollen from its back, and then it brushes past the anthers, which give its back a new supply of pollen for the next flower. It is evident that the lady’s slipper did not devise by itself this clever way of fertilizing its seeds and passing pollen on to other blooms. In itself it was incapable of knowing the necessity of having the stigma placed ahead of the anthers so it would not be self-pollinated by the insect. But the arrangement is therfe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Seed Distribution</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">As with plant pollination, so with the distribution of the mature seeds, thoughtful design is clearly evident. What else can explain why some plants produce seeds that have fluffy tufts attached to them so they can float in the air and be carried great distances by the wind? Others, like the ash and maple, have seeds with wings that allow the seeds to glide through the air. Still others have hooks or barbs that attach to the fur of animals or have explosive pods that shoot seeds away from the parent plant as they explode. How could nonthinking plants recognize the need for seed dispersal, much less devise these ways of accomplishing </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">it?</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Some seeds even have the ability to crawl after they drop to the ground. The seed of the cranesbill has a long tail or awn. In dry weather the awn curls up like a corkscrew, but in damp weather it uncurls. This movement with changing humidity causes the seed to move along the ground. When the seed reaches a suitable spot to plant itself, it drives itself into the ground, and protruding bristles hold it firmly in place. The same is true of the seeds from certain grasses. Did these plants reason out for themselves that changing humidity could cause a tail or awn of the right material to curl and uncurl and that this action would disperse their seeds as well as plant them in the ground?</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Insect Eaters</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Intelligent design is very evident in such plants as the pitcher plant, the bladderwort, Venus flytrap and the sundew. These plants are constructed in such a fashion that they can trap insects.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">The pitcher plant has vase-shaped leaves that hold rainwater. The upper half of the pitcher has an inner surface that is smooth and slippery, and below this region there is a zone of stiff hairs that point downward. Insect? venturing onto the slippery surface lose their foothold and fall into the pitcher and drown in the water at the bottom. The down-pointing hairs prevent them from getting out. As the insect decays and is acted upon </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">by digestive enzymes</span><span class="font16"> secreted by the plant, the plant absorbs it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">The Venus flytrap has an entirely different system of catching insects. Attached to a flat leaf it has a two-lobed blade that is hinged down its middle. Along the outer edges of the lobes is a row of needlelike spines that interlock when the lobes are </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">closed. Three short bristles on </span><span class="font16">each half act as triggers. When an insect touches these sensitive bristles the two halves of the blade spring together like a steel trap. The imprisoned insect is then digested by fluids secreted by the plant. Such insect-eating plants usually grow in marshy areas where there is insufficient nitrogen in the soil, and the bodies of the captured </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">insects supply the plant’s nitrogen</span><span class="font16"> needs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">There seems to be no end of examples of intelligent design in plant life. Wherever a person m^y look he will find nonthinking plants doing things and making use of natural laws in ways that exceed the intellectual ability of average humans and, in some cases, aven of the most skilled scientists. When the knowledge man has accumulated about plants is assembled, it makes an impressive array of evidence that argues that plants are no accident. They were created by God.</span></p>

<p><span class="font25">H</span><span class="font16">OW marvelous are the laws that govern the movements within the tiny atom, as well as the rotation of the stars and their planets! What wisdom is manifest in the creation of the animals, birds, plants, and the other countless wonders in the earth! How wonderfully the creatures of the sea are designed for their habitat! Is it not natural that a person should want to become acquainted with the One responsible for all these marvels of creation?</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">However, strange as it may seem, many persons do not believe that anyone is responsible. They believe that life sprang spontaneously from nothing and that it continues without any intelligent direction. But certainly science, which is “knowledge concerned with the physical world and its phenomena,&quot; does not indicate this conclusion. To the contrary as Brigadier General David Sarnoff, chairman of the Board of the Radio Corporation of America, not long ago said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">“Science begets humility. Its every discovery reveals more clearly the Divine Design in nature, the remarkable harmony in all things, from the infinitesimal to the infinite, that surpasses mortal understanding. The physical processes and laws of the universe are logical, all-embracing and wholly dependable. They imply a Supreme Architect, and the beauty and symmetry of His handiwork inspire reverence.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">The most noted names in science agree with this observation. Dr. Albert Einstein said that it was enough for him “to try humbly to comprehend even an infinitesimal part of the intelligence manifest in nature.” The famous inventor Thomas Edison once said: “After years of watching</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">IjiHH in </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">hi</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">.....mm 11 iiuimiiiiiiiiiiiimimtMiHtiuiHui</span></p><a name="caption2"></a>

<p><span class="font16">the processes of nature, I cannot doubt the existence of a Supreme Intelligence. The existence of such a God can, to my mind, almost be proved from, chemistry.” And the famous British physicist Lord Kelvin concurred: “If you think strongly enough, you will be forced by science to believe in God.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">There is plan, design and order everywhere one looks in the universe, and “it is incontrovertible that where there is a plan there is intelligence,” observed Nobel Prizewinning physicist Arthur H. Compton, “An orderly, unfolding universe,” he said, &quot;testifies to the truth of the most majestic statement ever uttered—‘In the beginning God’!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Nineteen centuries ago a keen student of the physical world and its phenomena wrote in similar vein: ’“For his invisible qualities are clearly seen from the world's creation onward, because they are perceived by the things made, even his eternal power and Godship, so that they are inexcusable.”—Rom. 1:20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Unquestionably a blind unreasoning force is not responsible for the marvels of creation, but, rather, an all-powerful intelligent God is. Increased knowledge of the physical world impresses this fact upon one. But who is this Master Craftsman? What is his name? What does he expect from us in the way of praise and worship ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">No matter how much knowledge of the physical world and its phenomena scientists obtain, they can never from this </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">source find the</span><span class="font16"> answers to such questions as these. But, then, there are many persons who do not want to know the answers. Why so? Because if they knew about God's purposes and what he required of man, they would feel obligated to serve Him and to live in accord with His righteous principles. So to avoid any restrictions, many refuse to examine the Creator’s inspired revelation about himself in his Word, the Bible, They claim that the Bible is merely </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">the</span><span class="font16"> work of men, and is subject to errors like any other book.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">The Bible Identifies the One</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">But if one dismisses prejudices and examines the Bible with an open mind, he will find that there is as much evidence that attests to its Divine Authorship as there is evidence that shows that the heavens and earth were designed by a Supreme Intelligence. Both originate from the same Source. As the famous scientist and discoverer of the law of gravity, Sir Isaac Newton, said: “No sciences are better attested than the religion of the Bible.’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font16">careful' reader of this infallible book of the Supreme Architect will find that it does not attribute the marvels of creation to a nameless, impersonal “Mother Nature,” but that it says: </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Jehovah God </span><span class="font16">made earth and heaven.” (Gen. 2:4) Open your Bible to Psalm 83:18 and read his name for yourself: “That people may know that you, whose name is </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah,</span><span class="font16"> you alone are the Most High over all the earth.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">It is true that a study of this physical world and its phenomena reveals that a Superior Intelligence made all these marvels, but only the Bible tells us that that One’s name is Jehovah. This Divine Name overshadows every other name in the Bible, occurring a grand total of 7,199 times. In prayer to Jehovah, Jesus showed the importance of that name, saying: “I have made your name manifest.” Yes, Jesus made known to people that the name of the great Creator is Jehovah.—John 17:6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Should not our desire be the same as that of Jesus and the psalmist, ‘to let people know that he whose name is Jehovah is the Most High God'? Most certainly? However, some modern Bible translators leave God’s name out of their translations and substitute in its place the titles “Lord” and “God.” In explaining this omission, the </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Revised Standard Version</span><span class="font16"> says in its foreword: “It is almost if not quite certain that the Name was originally pronounced ‘Yahweh’ [in Hebrew]And since, according to these translators, “the word ‘Jehovah’ does not accurately represent any form of the Name ever used in Hebrew,” they leave God’s name out of their Bible translation altogether.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">But what about other proper names such as Jehoshaphat, Jehoram, or even Jesus? Why are these retained, since these names also do not accurately </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">represent the form </span><span class="font16">originally used in the Hebrew? The name “Jesus,” for instance, is based on the Greek equivalent of the Hebrew “Jehoshuah.” Why, it is simple; these names are retained so as to identify the person spoken about, even though the form used in various languages does not represent exactly the form used in Hebrew. Then why not, on the same basis, retain God’s name so as to identify the One responsible for all the marvelous works of creation?</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">It is because of man’s efforts to obsure the identity of the Creator of this wonderful universe. But happily, all such efforts will fail, and when God takes action to destroy those who </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">fail to give him honor, </span><span class="font16">everyone that lives will know that “Jehovah is in truth God.”—Jer. 10:10.</span></p>

<p><span class="font16">ed in creation. Everywhere he looks—in the seas, on the land or in the air—the marvels that meet his eye bespeak a Master Designer. Such evidence causes the discerning person to feel humble, and to join in wholehearted agreement with the psalmist’s sentiments: “The senseless one has said in his heart: 'There is no Jehovah.’ ”—Ps. 14:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">However, Jehovah God requires more than mere acknowledgment of his creatorship and existence; he also requires our wholehearted devotion. But it is evident that we cannot give this to him without finding out what his purposes are and what he expects of man in the way of worship. Although the many marvels of the physical world give irrefutable evidence that God is, they do not tell us who he is or what our obligations are toward him. For this vital information we need to go to His written Word, the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">This inspired Word of God makes it clear that, unlike the animals, man needs to listen to his Creator. “Man must live, not on bread alone,” the Bible says, “but on every utterance coming-forth through</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Jehovah’s mouth.” (Matt. 4:4) The fish of the sea, the birds of the air and the beasts of the field need only material sustenance to live and fulfill their purpose in life. But man is different. Something is missing when he has only material things; his life is empty. That is why it is recorded in the famous Sermon on the Mount: “Happy are those conscious of their spiritual need.” (Matt. 5:3) They are happy because knowledge of Jehovah and his purposes enables them to satisfy properly the need that they have to worship. Animals were not created with this iH'ge to worship a superior power. They are unlike man, who desires to know where he came from, why he is here and what hope there is for life in the future.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Listening to God</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">But it is evident that the majority of people are not conscious of their spiritual need. They have no desire to learn about Jehovah or what he requires of them. This, however, does not alter the requirement that we listen to God by studying his Word, the Bible. Jehovah makes this clear when he says: “Listen intently to me . . . Incline your ear and come to me. Listen, and your soul will keep alive.”—Isa. 55:2, 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Just because a person does not feel the need to listen to God does not mean that it is not necessary for him to do so in order to keep alive. His position is similar to that of one who has no desire for physical food. Such a person may feel all right, but if, in time, his appetite does not return and he does not eat something, death will eventually ensue. So it is with a person that is not conscious of his spiritual need.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">He may have no desire to study the Bible, and, because he feels no ill effects, he may not think it is necessary to do so. But just as surely as that person who neglects physical food will die, so will one who neglects his spiritual needs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Children well illustrate the fact that education is needed in order for huuiana to discern what is good for them. If it were left to' their own choice, many youngsters would eat only candy and ice cream and cake. They would enjoy this diet temporarily, but in time they would suffer and die prematurely. On the other hand, children that accept proper training from wise parents develop an appetite for nourishing, body-building foods. Not only do they learn to enjoy such a diet, but they reap lasting benefits </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">from</span><span class="font16"> it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">In the same way, all of us need guidance from the One whom Jesus Christ called “our Father in the heavens.” (Matt. 6:9) We are like children in that, unless we have been instructed, we do not know how to direct our own steps. (Jer. 10:23) So instead of taking a know-it-all or couldn’t-care-less attitude, typical of many persons today, how much better it is to accept guidance and direction humbly from the One who is so infinitely wiser than we are! He governs our marvelous solar system and cares for all the plants and animals in such a wonderful way. Can we not therefore have confidence that he will direct our steps in the best way if we go to His written Word?</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Yes, what greater teacher could we have than the One who designed fish to swim and birds to fly and who perfectly placed the earth in orbit? All honest persons will have to confess, ‘There is none.’ Well, then, </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">do you listen</span><span class="font16"> to this “Grand Instructor”? (Isa. 30:20) Do you regularly read the Bible? When was the last time you sat down and listened to God speak to you through His Word? Yesterday? Last week? Was it a whole month ago? We need direction and correction from God every day, even, as literal children need daily parental guidance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">And we should not let the words go in one ear and out the other. We must think while we read: How does this apply to me and to circumstances in my life? What instruction is God giving me in this passage? “Apply your hearts,” the Bible counsels, “for it is no valueless word for you, but it means your life.&quot;—Deut. 32:46, 47.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">The Source of Life</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">In what way does applying our hearts to God’s Word mean our life? Does not the “God that made the world and all the things in it” give to </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">“all</span><span class="font16"> persons life and breath and all things”? (Acts 17:24,25) That is true, but at present mankind enjoy these things for only a few short years. Yet Jehovah God has made provision for those who listen to his Word and live in harmony with it to live forever in a new order of righteousness.—2 Pet. 3:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">The marvelous wonders of creation are silent on this provision that God has made for everlasting life. True, we learn from his material works that he is wise enough and powerful,- enough to sustain our lives forever, but it is only in his written Word that we learn that it is his purpose to do this. It is only there that we are told: “This means everlasting life, their taking in knowledge of you, the only true God, and of the one whom you sent forth, Jesus Christ.”—John 17:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Did you notice that besides learning about “the only true God,” one must also take in knowledge of Jesus Christ in order to gain everlasting life? Yes, Jesus Christ is </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">the provision made by Jehovah God to </span><span class="font16">ransom mankind from sin and death. “God sent forth his only-begotten Son into the world that we might gain life through him,” the Bible explains. In fact, “there is not another name under heaven that has been given among men by which we must get saved.&quot;—1 John 4:9; Acts 4:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">How wonderful everlasting life will be when this earth is transformed into a global paradise! Gone will be the problems that plague old-world living, such as sickness, unemployment, insecurity and housing shortages. Gone will be all doers of wickedness, because God will root them out in what the Bible calls “the day of judgment and of destruction of the ungodly men.” (2 Pet. 3:7) How grand, then, living in a world without crime, war and ungodliness of any kind! Mankind will then be able to enjoy forever the beauties of God’s creation.—Rev. 21:3, 4; Ps. 37:9-11, 29, 34; Isa. 11:6-9; 65:21-24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">According to God’s original purpose, man was not meant to die after seventy or eighty years, but was created to enjoy forever the things that God had made. God instructed the first human pair, Adam and Eve, to “be fruitful and become many,&quot; to have children, and, as they increased, to extend the boundaries of their God-given paradise until finally the entire earth would be subdued.—Gen. 1:28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Do you know why that original purpose has not as yet been carried out? Could you explain to someone else why God has allowed wickedness and death to continue? Do you know why it was necessary for Jehovah to send his Son to the earth in order to make life in a restored paradise possible for man? God explains these things in his written Word, and it is vital that we understand them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Praise Him</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Truly the material creations of God are awe-inspiring, and what loving consideration it shows on his part to make provision for us to enjoy these marvels forever! The fragrant smells of springtime, or of new-mown hay in the summer, a gorgeously colored sunset, a silvery moon, majestic mountains, forests, trees, flowers—just think of all the incomparable things that God has made! He has done so much for us, and what he requires in return is so reasonable.</span></p>

<p><span class="font16">When you see a masterful piece of art, is it not only natural and reasonable to praise its maker? Certainly it is. Well, that is what God requires that his servants do to him. “Praise Jah, you people!&quot; his Word tells us. “Offer praise, O you servants of Jehovah, praise the name of Jehovah. From the rising of the sun until its setting Jehovah’s name is to be praised.&quot; —Ps. 113:1, 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">All the inanimate things that God has made praise him by reason of their beauty and perfect workmanship. Even the way fish, birds and animals are designed for their habitat and are equipped with instinct reflects the wisdom of God. But how about yourself? You are the highest of God's earthly creations, being endowed with the ability to utter intelligible words of praise to Jehovah. Do you do this? When was the last time you spoke about his wonderful works to someone else? Have you spoken to others about his name and his glorious provisions for salvation </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">today?</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Although you cannot help but be impressed by the marvels of creation, have you learned what you should from them? If they remind you that there is a Grand Creator, that you should listen to him by studying his Word and praise his name by talking about him, you have learned well from the marvels of creation.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font25">F</span><span class="font16">REEDOM of worship is still considered the sacred right of all persons, even in this space age. When this right is trampled on by the powers that be, whether political or religious, then God-fearing people become disturbed anti righteously indignant, and rightly so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Hie worship of God is a sacred thing, not a tool to be toyed with. In civilized countries freedom of religion and freedom of assembly are generally regarded as sacred rights worthy of deepest respect. Securing these basic human rights is the first order of business.- It is the standard of civilization. It is an open witness that a country’s institutions are truly and in fact free. Therefore, these rights are not only acknowledged and cherished but also safeguarded for its citizens.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Little wonder, then, that free people throughout the world were shocked to hear what took place recently in Greece, the “cradle of democracy.” Londoners and others were visibly puzzled by the news item that appeared in the London </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Times,</span><span class="font16"> July 27,1963. It said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">“Athens, July 25th</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">“Jehovah's Witnesses or members of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Greece, numbering some 20,000, have been prevented from holding a mass-rally in Athens Stadium next Tuesday. The Under-Secretary for the Interior today issued orders to police to ban all meetings of the sect. Earlier the Jehovah’s Witnesses had asked for permission to organize an international congress in Athens.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">“The ban follows strong protests from the Greek Orthodox Church and a message from Archbishop Chrysosto-mos, Primate of Greece, to the Prime Minister, Mr. Pi-pinelis. Several Orthodox organizations threatened to stage a march from Salonika to Athens if the Jehovah’s Witnesses were allowed to meet.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">This same report was published in other countries, which has caused people the world over to ask, Why the ban? What reason did Archbishop Chrysostomos, primate of Greece, have for wanting the gathering of Jehovah’s witnesses canceled? What did he fear? Why did the Greek Orthodox Church resort to extreme unchristian tactics, even threatening the Government with riots if the assembly were permitted?</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">From all outward appearances Greece is a democratic nation. It belongs to the extolled group of “free nations.” It is a member of the United Nations and doubtles subscribes to the Declaration of Human Rights, which guarantees the right of woi&gt; ship and the right of peaceable assembly for all people. In fact, the nation’s own Constitution champions these rights in print. How, then, was it possible for a Christian assembly to be banned in Greece? Who was responsible for such a deplorable action? Does this mean that religious freedom no longer exists in Greece?</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">These questions are not confined to Greece, but aro now on the minds of people everywhere, calling for an answer. Religious discrimination, like racial and labor discrimination, cannot be hid, nor Is it easily forgotten. There are too many minorities concerned, for what touches one touches them all. Therefore, </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font16"> considers it a duty to inform its readers about this human-rights tragedy and the way it happened in Greece.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Petition Granted</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">In September, 1962, Jehovah’s witnesses in Greece, through the Athens branch of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society, filed a petition with the Sub-Direction of General Security in Athens for a permit to gather at the Panathinaikos Stadium, for July 30, 1963. Because this gathering would also be attended by Witnesses from other lands, especially would there be a large number of delegates from the United States of America, mention of this was made in the.petition and the gathering was called an “international congress.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">In view of the precedent of gatherings held by Jehovah’s witnesses.jn Greece and the orderly manner in which they were conducted, the Sub-Direction of General Security referred the petition to the Athens Police Direction as being competent to grant a permit, and it did so without expressing any objection thereto. Similarly the police authority asked the Direction of Religions at the Ministry of National Education and Religions about granting a permit. No objections were made. The Greek Ministry of National Education and Religions simply expressed the opinion that it would be well if Jehovah’s witnesses assembled in an enclosed space. Since the fenced grounds of Panathinaikos Stadium, though uncovered, are considered an enclosed space, there was no more question about issuing a permit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Because the gathering was to be attended also by Witnesses from other nations, the whole case was referred to the General Direction of National Security. In turn this branch of authority thought well to apply to the Direction of Churches at the Greek Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Even the Legal Council of the State was consulted. These eminent Greek jurists agreed unanimously that Jehovah’s witnesses did have a right to assemble and that the Greek administration had no right to refuse the permit for which they had applied.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">In part their impartial opinion said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">“The freedom of assembling is a public right, by individuality, belonging to all Greeks, in principal, without any discrimination whatever. . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">“Those belonging to minorities of certain political, philosophical, or religious doctrines do equally enjoy the right to assemble, so that the meetings called by them, legally in other respects, are not unlawful. Be it noted that, as an assembly of Greeks (a Greek assembly) is also considered the one participated in by for-eignerg, without being thereby changed into an assembly of foreigners (a foreign assembly), and if in such case there are legal restrictions against foreigners, the police intervention consists in simply removing the latter. But even an assembly of foreigners, such as the one convened or organized by them, or the one consisting by majority of foreigners, is not forbidden.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">“We believe that the petition filed on September 20th 1962 by the Athens Branch of the Society under the style of /Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society’, with head Offices in New York, United States of America, for a permit to this Society to hold an international congress in Athens, in enclosed space, on the strength of individual invitations and for the said purpose, is lawful, the Administration having no right to refuse the permit applied for.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Thus, in pursuance of this Opinion, on March 20, 1963, the Athens Police Direction finally granted to Jehovah’s witnesses the permit to assemble on July 30, 1963, tn the “enclosed” space of the Panathinaikos Stadium.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Preparations Under Way</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Having received the permit, Jehovah’s witnesses then, through the Athens branch of the Watch Tower Society, proceeded to rent the stadium, for which rental they paid $2,000. In addition, rooming accommodations were arranged at various hotels in Athens for the many Witnesses who were coming to the assembly from other countries. Along with these arrangements there was also a special accommodation service organized to care for the thousands of Witnesses who would be attending the Athens assembly from the many provinces of Greece. Locations for the majority of these had to be found in the homes of friends living in Athens and Piraeus. Since the Panathinaikos grounds are entirely open, providing no protection from the hot summer sun, plans were drawn to cover the side rows of the stadium’s tiers of seats. As an additional practical provision, refreshments were arranged for.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">But while Jehovah’s witnesses in Greece were busy getting ready for their lawful assembly, others in the land were busily planning to undo all their hard work by subverting law and order.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Ominous Signs</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">About the middle of June the responsible political government of C. Karamanlis, which had been in authority for about eight years, resigned. A so-called caretaker government, under P. Pipinelis, took over. This change of rule seemed to have encouraged religious circles to press, in every way possible, for a cancellation of the assembly of Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">First, there was started a well-organized press campaign against Jehovah’s witnesses. This was noticeable in Athens and in almost all Greek towns in the early part of July. Press comments were as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">“THE GRANTING OF PERMIT FOR ‘JE-HOVITES’ CONGRESS RECONSIDERED&quot; </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">—Macedonia,</span><span class="font15"> Salonlca, July 17, 1963.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">“A committee of theologians protested to the under-secretary of the Presidency. If the Congress is finally permitted, the theologians and other ecclesiastical factors, according to information, threaten to organize manifestations of protest.”—</span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Eleftherua,</span><span class="font15"> Athens, July IS, 1963.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">“The Millennial!sts’ international congress which is to be held in Athens within a few days must be forbidden as there is danger of popular uprising for its cancellation: this is pointed out in an announcement by 14 organizations. A telegram is also sent to the Government, the Archbishop and the Holy Synod. ‘The convocation of the congress is not to be tolerated in any case, because it is a challenge to the Orthodoxy’.”—</span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Messimvrini,</span><span class="font15"> Athens, July 20, 1963.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Now there was some question as to whether a “permit of </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">calling together</span><span class="font16"> a congress” was required in addition to the police permit. The Sub-Direction of the General Security of Athens advised the Athens branch manager of the Watch Tower Society to look into this matter, which was done immediately. Written and signed assurances to the Sub-Ministry of Press and the Athens Police Direction were made, emphasizing that this was to be merely a gathering of fellow believers and so. did not come under the law requiring an additional permit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">For a moment it appeared that these signed statements would suffice, that the assembly would be allowed to be held. At least the press left this impression. In part an Athens newspaper, </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Vimct,</span><span class="font16"> July 24, 1963, had this to say:</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">“The uproar created around the gatherings </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">of</span><span class="font15"> Jehovah’s Witnesses is being </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">continued in</span><span class="font15"> a more intensive way. The religious organizations were particularly angered at the communication made by </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">the Ministry of</span><span class="font15"> Government’s Presidency to the effect that no permit of calling a Conference was granted to Jehovah’s Witnesses, but that they are permitted to have a gathering in the enclosed space of </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">‘Panathi-</span><span class="font15">naikos.’ ...</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">“Meantime, the week of the Church’s mourning is considered as continuing in token of protest against the Government's decision. The movement of the religious organizations of Athens against the gathering of these heretics is followed by similar organizations of Thessa-lonica, and according to what is made known, a march of protest is being planned by members of these organizations from </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">ThessaJonica </span><span class="font15">to Athens. .. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">&quot;The presidents of 40 corporations in the capital sent telegrams to the President of the Government and the Minister of Education claiming cancellation of the permit granted and forbiddanee 6f any form of gathering of Jehovah’s Witnesses. In case of not recalling the permit, the corporations will take steps to frustrate the gathering.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Religious Pressure Applied</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Now religious circles would neither accept a “congress” nor any other kind of gathering of Jehovah’s witnesses! Let the Greek Constitution promise what it will; as far as they were concerned, these Constitutionally guaranteed rights did not apply to Jehovah’s witnesses. These intolerant religious organizations were now demanding by resolutions and declarations, which were daily reported in the press, that the Greek government revoke the permit granted Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">The campaign of hatred and intolerance that was launched against Jehovah’s witnesses can be read in the following newspaper excerpts:</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">&quot;THE CHURCH TAKES UP FIGHT AGAINST MILLENNIAL!STS . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">“Church-bells to ring mournfully. Marches of protest too. . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">“Now the Archbishop [Chryspstomos] issued </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font15">strong communication, protesting the event and declaring that 'we are obliged to defend ourselves fighting for sacred and holy things. We shall take the lead of elergy and people in this sacred fight.' . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">&quot;A march of protest from the joint-capital to Athens is threatened by the religious organizations there. In all provinces the metropolitans will take the lead in antimillennialistic manifestations, and in case of effectuation of the Jehovites’ gathering, the church-bells of all towns and villages will be ringing mournfully.” </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">—Athinaiki,</span><span class="font15"> Athens, July 23, 1963..</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">“THE CHURCH DECLARED A WEEK OF MOURNING</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">“The Archbishop of Athens and the Holy Synod declared the current week a week of mourning for the Church of Greece, in token of protest against the effort to convoke in Athens an international congress flf the followers of the heresy ‘Jehovah’s Witnesses’.”—</span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Vima, </span><span class="font15">Athens, July 23, 1963.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">“It is finally announced that tomorrow at Pe-traki Convent an overnight prayer will be made in token of protest against the gathering. Alongside this, the religious organizations of Athens are moving toward a bulky show of protest.”—</span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Messlmvrini,</span><span class="font15"> Athens, July 27, 1963.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">The extent of clergy disrespect for law and order and for their government’s decisions is shown in their threats. The newspaper </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Vima,</span><span class="font16"> Athens, July 25, 1963, reported the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">“The demonstration of the Christian </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">organi</span><span class="font15">zations would be backed by the Holy </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">Synod </span><span class="font15">which would meet extraordinarily. Typical of the Athens Archbishop's determination to insist on the fight against the gathering was his declaration that in case the gathering of Jehovah’s Witnesses is effected the whole clergy of the Archbishopric would be clothed in their sacerdotal vestments and proceed to a show of protest arraying themselves in Alexandras Avenue.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Thus for about ten days, morning and evening, the newspapers of Greece were reporting with impressive headlines about the “congress” of Jehovah’s witnesses. Besides the local papers, Reuters and other foreign news agencies were daily phoning to the-branch office of the Watch Tower Society in Athens for stories. In this way tremendous publicity was given to the proposed assembly of Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Press Failure</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Despite this fact, it is sad to say that the press, with only a few bright exceptions, reported only one side of the issue. It did not defend the right of assembly guaranteed by the Constitution of Greece. Instead, it devoted much space to claims made by freedom-hating clergymen. The press simply did not see or did not wish to see the constitutional issue involved, that the human rights of a heterodox Christian minority in Greece were -being threatened by lawless, religious pressure groups. The branch office of the Watch Tower Society put forth every possible effort to inform the newspapers on this subject by written texts and also by providing well-documented information, but, for the most part, these went unheeded. Thus a free press failed its people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Government Bows</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">In spite of everything that was done, the Greek government yielded to the “ultimatum” of the Greek Orthodox Church. It canceled the permit that had been granted earlier. The Government’s decision was published in the newspapers and announced over the radio, but only upon request was a written note of the ban sent to the Athens branch office of the Watch Tower Society. The text of the ban reads as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">KINGDOM OF GREECE</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">ATHENS CITY POLICE</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">SUB-DIRECTION OF GENERAL SECURITY INFORMATION SERVICE</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">NOTIFICATION</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">We let you know that in consequence of a decision taken by the Government it is not permitted to call together the International </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Congress of members nf</span><span class="font15"> the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society, which was announced for the 30th of this month in Athens, and also any other and in any form similar gathering for the same object in enclosed or open space.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Dated in Athens, this 25th day of July 1963.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">THE CHIEF COMMISSIONER (Signed) John Karahalios (Seal Impression)</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Police Director I</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">In this way religious pressure forced the Greek government to bow, to deny its own people eonstitutiMially guaranteed, cherished, human rights. The right to assemble for the purpose of worship was denied a Christian minority in this “cradle of democracy.” What a blow to the glory of Greece!</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Witnesses Reaction</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">How would Jehovah’s witnesses react in the face of such religious intolerance and discrimination? Would they defy the law, render evil for evil, and thus take upon themselves the unchristian image of their opposers? No, none of that. </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah's witnesses</span><span class="font16"> are Bible Christians. They will obey the orders of the government as a superior authority, “not only on account of that wrath,” as the Christian apostle Paul says, ‘but also on account of their conscience. (Rom. 13:1-5) Thus their conduct and position stands out in bold contrast to the threatening, </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">unruly</span><span class="font16"> and unseriptura? methods of the Orthodox Church and its clergy in Greece.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">With regard for lawful methods of petition, urgent personal telegrams of protest, in the name of the community of Jehovah’s witnesses in Greece, were sent to the president of the Greek government, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, the president of the Greek Parliament, the Minister of Interior, and to many other responsible persons. But all of this was to no avail.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">Whose </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Victori/?</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">The Greek Orthodox Church considered </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">the banning of Jehovah’s witnesses from </span><span class="font16">assembling together as a great triumph for her, but. was it? Some might have thought Christ impaled a triumph too. But how sadly mistaken they were! When human rights are denied a minority because of religious threats and pressure, is that something for a nation and its people to glory over? By what twist of the imagination can a miserable surrender of human rights be termed a victory? Is it not in fact a time for sackcloth and ashes and an hour of shame for what was once the pride of Greece—her freedom?</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">What has happened in Greece cannot be hid, nor will it be quickly forgotten. For it was shocking news to freedom-loving people from many lands who had enjoyed the privilege of assembling with Jehovah witnesses in New York, London, Stockholm, Munich and Milan to learn upon arrival in Athens that this basic human right would be denied not only them but the Greek people as </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">well. The shock of this disappointment</span><span class="font16"> now reverberates around the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Know that the world today is extremely sensitive as to what happens to minorities and freedoms. This flagrant violation of constitutionally guaranteed rights in Greece has not gone unnoticed. News dispatches have gone around the world. Even within the borders of Greece strong disapproval is noted. Such medieval clergy tactics are passe. The weekly journal </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Tachydrotnos,</span><span class="font16"> Athens, August 3, 1963, posed this question:</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">&quot;Was the ban of Jehovites’ gathering jn enclosed space a liberal and Constitutional expression? Or contrariwise was it a show of intolerance and swerving from the Constitution? It is up to the Constitutional Law specialists to speak.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">What happened to Jehovah’s witnesses in Greece was not only a blow against this minority, but a crushing stroke against minorities everywhere. It was an overt act against freedom, an invasion of human rights, weakening the trust of many in government and constitutional guarantees. For if religious pressure and prejudice could negate a constitutional right in democratic Greece, what guarantee do free people and minorities the world over have that these same powerful pressure groups will not cancel out rights and freedoms elsewhere when it suits their fancy?</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">It has long been true that the Government of Greece has denied its citizens who are Jehovah’s witnesses the freedom to have Kingdom Halls in which to assemble for worship. They may meet only in small groups in private homes. Now the Government has added to this a further denial of freedom, canceling a lawful permit for a “private” religious gathering of fellow believers from various lands, and that. because of the lawless demands of intolerant religious elements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">What You Can. Do</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">It is your privilege as a lover of liberty to voice your feelings on this mhtter in behalf of those in Greece who are being denied the right to worship God freely. This you may do by writing letters of protest to the Greek Premier’s Political Bureau, Athens, Greece; also to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Athens, Greece. In each case the designation given here is sufficient to reach the individual who is to receive the letter. Let them know that you deplore the discriminatory actions of the Greek government against Jehovah’s witnesses in canceling their Christian gathering in Athens and in forbidding them to have Kingdom Halls in which to meet openly for worship. Appeal to them to uphold constitutional rights and to champion freedom for all their people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Greece ?an yet demonstrate to the world that its constitution has not been reduced to mere scraps of paper. It cannot undo the harm that was done by its cancellation of the assembly of Jehovah’s witnesses scheduled to be held in Athens July 30. But it can see that it never repeats such an act of suppression of constitutional freedom; and it can take steps right now to prove its sincerity in the matter by granting to Jehovah’s witnesses the right to have religious meeting places in which to assemble openly for worship, even as the Greek Orthodox Church in that land has its edifices for worship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Since freedom of worship has been trampled underfoot in Greece, written assurances of freedom no longer completely satisfy. The world looks for genuine evidences of these freedoms. It awaits news that in actual fact religious minorities in Greece are enjoying the freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution.</span></p>

Rescue crews worked day and night drilling an escape shaft. On August 27 the two men were hauled up the 18-inch rescue shaft. As i8-year-old Throne was being raised to the surface, he said, through an attached microphone: &quot;I feel Jibe a banana.” ‘‘Boy, what a ride this'.” Fellin, 58, was hauled up a short time later. Louis Bova, the third man trapped below, had been separated from his two companions by eighteen feet of fallen rock'.

<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">U Thant’s Report</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">In a 6,000-word introduction to his annual report the Secretary-General of the United Nations U Thant said that the U.N. had </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">weathered</span><span class="font15"> a “crisis of confidence” during the last year and had come </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">out stronger.</span><span class="font15"> He mentioned the Cuban crisis of last October, stating that it provided the U.N. with the opportunity to help avert what appeared to be impending disaster. He held out hope that soon U.N. troops would be withdrawn from the </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">Congo. </span><span class="font15">But, he said, the U.N. still faces a financial crisis and it is also concerned over South Africa’s racial policy.

<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">Anthem Case Won</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">® Two years ago three youths were expelled from the Fine-top Elementary School in the American state of Arizona be-. cause they would not stand for the national anthem; yet they were respectful and sat quietly. The youths, Daniel M. Sheldon, 12, Merle W. Wingo, 14, and Jere B. Wingo, 13, all of whom are Jehovah’s witnesses, contended that it was a religious act, a form of idolatry, that violated their Christian consciences. Therefore, they could not conscientiously stand during the playing of the national anthem. On August 29 United States District Court Judge William C. Mathes, from California, ruled in the youths' favor, stating that the Arizona school board requirement for students to stand for the </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">na-</span><span class="font15">tional anthem was unconstitutional. Judge Mathes stated: &quot;The key of our freedom </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font15">expression is that there is individual freedom to believe, </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font15">speak and to act.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">Book Crooks</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">To reduce a loss of 200,000 books a year, the Brooklyn Public Library has hired eleven detectives to catch book crooks. Their stealing and mutilation of books cost the library each year $600,000. Instead of taking notes, some students will cut out of books the pages that have the information they want. </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Life </span><span class="font15">magazine of July 12, 1963, stated: &quot;&nbsp;‘Often the thieves simply don’t look on this sort of trickery as stealing,' said one library official. 'They’re a unique type.’ It is ironic that high on the list of mutilated works are essays on honesty and copies of the Bible.”</span></p>

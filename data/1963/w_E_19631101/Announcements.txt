FIELD MINISTRY
“Persons taught by Jehovah” daily add to their knowledge of him and enjoy peace in their relationship with him and with others who love and serve him. This knowledge from his Word they gladly share with others. During November Jehovah’s witnesses will do this by offering to all persons a Bible-study aid that has enabled tens of thousands to gain precious knowledge of Jehovah God and his purposes. It is the book From Paradise Lost to Paradise Regained, which, with a booklet, will be left on a contribution of 75c.
PEACE? PROSPERITY? UNITY?
Yes, all this and more God has promised to men of goodwill from all nations in this generation. ‘But, what must I do?’ you ask. To find out, read the thrilling new 64-page booklet Living in Hope of a Righteous New World. It will give you the Bible answer to satisfy your fondest hopes for the future. 5c each; 7 for 25c.

FIELD MINISTRY
These are days when materialism makes such demands that it easily crowds spirituality out of one’s life. Avoiding this snare, Jehovah’s witnesses will demonstrate their devotion to Jehovah God during September by sharing fully in the ministry, presenting to all persons the books Your Will Be Done on Earth” and “Let Your Name Be Sanctified,” together with two booklets, on a contribution of $1.
A REVIEW OF SPIRITUAL BLESSINGS
Around the world the “Everlasting Good News” Assemblies of Jehovah’s Witnesses have made history. In an international circuit of twenty-four cities, hundreds of thousands of persons of goodwill toward God and their neighbors have joined in a spiritual feast of stimulating Bible instruction. Whether you shared these blessings or not you will want to read the principal talks as they are published in The Watchtower, starting with the next issue. Subscribe now for one year. Send only $1.

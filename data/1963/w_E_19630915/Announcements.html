Avoiding this snare, Jehovah’s witnesses will demonstrate their devotion to Jehovah God during September by sharing fully in the ministry, presenting to all persons the books <em>Your Will Be Done on Earth” </em>and <em>“Let Your Name Be Sanctified,” </em>together with two booklets, on a contribution of $1.</p>

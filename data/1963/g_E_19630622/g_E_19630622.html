<div>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">WHICH?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Q</span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">uantity</span><span class="font1"> or quality—which impresses you the most? Fallen human nature is prone to be impressed by quantity rather than by quality. Superlatives as to size or number may appeal to the inherent selfishness in man. But quantity is not everything.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">While it often appears to be in the interest of some to stress quantity, the wise person knows that more often than not it is not in the fitness of things that the most goes with the best, or even that the most represents the best value. In fact, it might be said that nature has a way of compensating matters as to quantity and quality.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Thus the largest fruits and vegetables are not always the most tasty, nor do they necessarily contain the most vitamins and minerals. A traveler may be struck with the fact that in certain places fruits with which he is acquainted are smaller than those at home, but it may be true that they have a better flavor than fruits of larger size.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">To be unduly impressed by quantity without reflecting as to quality is most immature. It calls to mind the young child that prefers three coins of small value to one coin of higher value. So, whenever a</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">bargain tempts you in food, clothing, furniture or something else, ask yourself, Is the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">quality</span><span class="font1"> such as to make it a bargain? At times, however, quantity must be considered before quality, such as when a father must feed and clothe a large family.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The question of quantity or</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">quality is by no means limited to the procuring of material things. For one thing, it applies to your work. Do you merely put in time or do you produce? Do you produce merely quantity or are you concerned with quality? The Bible encourages quality, as can be seen by its stress on the “man skillful in his work,” working “whole-souled,&quot; doing “hard work&quot; and doing “good work.”—Prov. 22:29; Col. 3:23; Eph. 4:28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Almost everyone is concerned with living many years. Yet, while long life is a blessing, what really counts is not so much how many years we live as what we do with our years. History records that among the composers of music who died young were Schubert, Mozart, Bizet and Mendelssohn. All died in their thirties. Yet what legacies they left behind in beautiful music for humankind to enjoy! The man who lived longer than any other mortal was Methuselah. His 969 years are, as far as the Bible record shows, his only claim to distinction. Jesus Christ, the Son of God, lived as a man only 3.5 percent as long, but look at what he accomplished in his thirty-three and a half years!—Gen. 5: 27; Luke 3:23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The question of quantity or quality is particularly pertinent when it comes to considering the claims of a religious organization. Why? Because here numbers are not proof of true worship. Often they are an evidence of low standards. This is to be expected in view of the fact that “the whole world is lying in the power of the wicked one,” Satan the Devil. It has been that way from the time of ancient Babylon down to our day.—1 John 5:19; Rev. 12:9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">With good reason Jesus said: “Broad and spacious is the road leading off into destruction, and many are the ones going in through it; whereas narrow is the gate and cramped the road leading off into life, and few are the ones finding it.” Regarding our very day he said: “Because of the increasing of lawlessness the love of the greater number will cool off.”—Matt. 7: 13,14;24:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Jesus said that his true followers would be distinguished, not by their numbers, but by their Christian fruits and brotherly love.—Matt. 7:20; John 13:34, 35.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Appreciating those words of Jesus are the witnesses of Jehovah. It has often been said that theirs is the fastest-growing religion. Whether this continues to be true year after year or not, let it be noted that they put the stress on quality, not on quantity, which they keep high by preaching and enforcing Bible principles among themselves. Among the many examples that might be given are the Witnesses in the Copperbelt of Northern Rhodesia, where the ratio of Witnesses to population is one of the highest in the world—five thousand Witnesses to one quarter million population, or one to fifty. But has this increase been at the cost of quality? Not by any means!</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">A recent publication entitled “Christians of the Copperbelt” stated that “the Watchtower families we learnt to know seemed to be exceptionally well-adjusted and happy together.” Why? Because the African Witnesses have embraced the Scriptural teachings regarding sex and marriage, and that with good results. And that this emphasis reached even to the children is apparent from what that report further said about them: “A schoolteacher said he could always easily discover children who belonged to the Watchtower when he taught a new class. ‘They are the ones who ask many questions? ” Yes, with the Witnesses Christian quality is of first importance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The stress on quality is, without doubt, to be preferred in all affairs and aspects of life.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">SOUND SLEEP</span></p>
<p><span class="font26">* According to a recent survey of nearly 2,500 people in the Glasgow and Dundee areas, Great Britain, it was found that women generally have more difficulty sleeping than their husbands do. Women lie awake longer before falling asleep, awaken more often during the night, feel more tired the next day and take more sleeping pills than do menfolk. Other results from the poll indicated that sixty out of every hundred persons sleep seven to eight hours, about twenty slumber nine hours or more and the remaining ones get less than seven hours of rest. After passing the age of sixty-five, many individuals could get along on five hours of sleep or less, due to a reduction in their dally activity.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font1">wonder how they can bring them up to be true Christians and not delinquents. Ilie</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Bible’s reasonable answer is that fathers and mothers should copy the example of “our Father in the heavens.” (Matt. 6:9) He is the Originator of the family and for our guidance he has set forth in the Bible sound principles for well-regulated families. Chief of these principles is love.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">SHOWING LOVE</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">&quot;God is love.” He brought forth children because he loved them. He did not choose to have a large family to gain personal prestige and standing, as is done in some countries. Nor did he decide to restrict his family to one or two for selfish reasons or because it is the fashion. His motive was entirely unselfish; he was concerned with the best interests of the children. Human parents can expect success in child training if their motive in having a family is true love for the young ones,—1 John 4:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This love must be enduring. It cannot wear off when the first thrill of parenthood wanes and the hard truth dawns that this is not just fun but hard work. That Jehovah has this enduring love is shown by the words of his first Son, the Logos: “I came to be the one he was specially fond of day by day, I being glad before him all the time.&quot; (Prov, 8:30) This constant, daily expression of love forged such a bond that Jehovah could have complete confidence in the obedience of his Son.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">What fether would not delight to have such a oneness with his son? It can be</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19630622_files/g_E_19630622-4.png" alt="" style="width:192pt;height:192pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font1">done, but it must be built up through many years of close personal friendship, not just a few minutes of casual contact each day. It means being together as much as possible—if possible, at work, certainly in relaxation, in Bible study, prayer and worship, in hard times and good, in joy and sorrow. It calls for the highest personal integrity and example from the father, but this is an expression of love.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This also demands time, something that many parents, otherwise good providers, are reluctant to give freely. Loving means giving our time. What young man ever told his girl friend, “I don’t have time&quot;? A child would hear this as *T don’t have time for you,&quot; and no one could blame him for interpreting it as “I don’t love you.&quot; A parent’s ungrudgingly giving his time to his child is an assurance of love to the child, and this is upbuilding.—1 Cor. 8:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Families founded on love stick together and do things together. This is Jehovah’s way, as shown in his instruction to Israel. (Deut. 6:7) In some countries of Africa and South America parents give away their children to other family members or friends to train and educate, persons who profess to be Christians even giving their children into the care of unbelievers who can give the young ones more material privileges. This is a wrong evaluation of things, as the Bible clearly shows that spiritual needs come first.—Matt. 5:3; 4:4; 6:33.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Nor is mis wrong animae confined to these countries. In some Scandinavian lands some allow their teen-age sons and daughters to leave the parental home in these highly impressionable years to live far away in homes of unbelievers for the purpose of getting training in some trade or profession, sometimes without even checking personally to see what kind of people their children will be living with. Also, in many Western lands parents who want to enjoy the privileges of marriage while retaining some of the freedom of singleness surrender their young children, sometimes several times a week, into the hands of baby-sitters, or allow children still in their teens to leave home and rent flats, either alone or with another youngster, thus exposing them to immoral temptations and shipwreck of their faith. These practices are clearly violations of the Bible requirements of parental love and family togetherness as well as of the principle that “each one will carry his own load?'—Gal. 6:5; 1 Tim. 1:19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Real love “does not look for its own interests/’ choosing the easy course or what temporarily seems to be more expedient, but always puts the child’s spiritual welfare first. (1 Cor. 13:5) The child, of course, is often too immature to appreciate this view, and it requires the exercise of firmness on the part of the parent. This brings to mind another vital principle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">administering discipline</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Why do children need discipline? The Bible answers: “Foolishness is tied up with the heart of a boy; the rod of discipline is what will remove it far from him.” (Prov. 22:15) Our sinful tendencies, inherited from our first parents, make it easier for us to go wrong than to go right. Your son may not like discipline, but it is kinder to give it in his childhood, while his mind and heart are receptive, than to let him grow up in a fixed, sinful mold leading him to death. “True, no discipline seems for the present to be joyous, but grievous; yet afterward to those who have been trained by it it yields peaceable fruit, namely, righteousness.”—Heb. 12:11,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Once again we see Jehovah, the great Father, setting the example in this. “My son, do not belittle the discipline from Jehovah, neither give out when you are Corrected by him; for whom Jehovah loves he disciplines.” Yes, administering discipline is a requirement for every parent and is a sign of true love.—Heb. 12:5, 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Discipline should always be given according to right principle and not in outbursts caused by annoyance. Heavy-handed punishment of petty irritations is not good discipline. The big things to correct are violations of principles of headship, obedience and love of God and neighbor. Make sure, too, that the child knows just what is expected of him and what will merit punishment and correction. Be consistent. To condone or ignore something today and then punish it tomorrow will exasperate a child and make it downhearted and cause it to lose confidence in its parents.—Col. 3:21</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Keep in mind that if discipline is to be profitable it must include instruction as well as punishment. Explain to the child why discipline is being given and what profit comes from obedience. Listen to his side of the matter if he has one. The worst criminal gets a hearing, so why not a mere erring child? Show him where he went wrong and how to correct it, and wherever possible support your counsel from the Bible, as this will teach the child to respect Jehovah’s law.—Heb. 12:10; 2 Tim. 3: 16, 17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Love requires that parents be slow to anger, because the child will not leam everything the first time anymore than its parents do. Even though the same mistake is made over and over again, love calls for patient correction. (Matt. 18:21, 22) When you get weary, think of Jehpvah’s repeated forgiveness of Israel and his patient correcting of them for many years. (Acts 13:18; Ex, 34:6, 7) So discipline should never be administered with rigid justice, but always with an allowance for mercy. Extremes have to be avoided. Harsh, severe discipline accompanied With shouting and a domineering attitude will not teach the child love of Jehovah.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">A third vital principle in child training is recorded at Ephesians 6:4: “And you, fathers, do not be irritating your children, but go on bringing them up in the discipline and authoritative advice of Jehovah.” So parental failure to teach God’s Word is what results in dissatisfied, irritated and unhappy children who are left without a goal in life and clear standards to live by. Even the very best secular education cannot begin to make up for lack of Bible teaching.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">But where, today, can a child get a Bible education? Why, the same place Israelite children got it, as shown at Deuteronomy 6:7: “You must inculcate them in your son and speak of them when you sit in your house and when you walk on the road and when you lie down and when you get up.” Yes, from morning to night, inside the house and outside, the Bible puts the responsibility squarely upon the shoulders of the parents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Note that this was not just a casual Bible reading. It had to be inculcated in the child. According to </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Webster’s Dictionary., </span><span class="font1">this means ‘to teach and impress by frequent repetitions, to fix in the mind, to cause to become impressed or instilled with something.’ It indicated a planned schedule of daily Bible study, with regular reviews and repetitions until the young mind was properly impressed and instilled with love and respect for God and his Word. Do you have a family schedule-for Bible study? You must, if you are to fulfill your parental duty and raise a united, happy, Christian family.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This will make great demands on you as a teacher. You will have to develop new skill in instructing and in answering questions. It will be a test of your devotion to Jehovah and your love for your children. And you will have to be so aglow with God’s spirit that teaching will be a delight not only to you but to your children. —2 Tim. 4:2; Rom. 12:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Sooner or later your child is going to have to face the trials and temptations of this world alone. He will not always have you around to give him the answer. Without Bible training he will be in trouble. But if you have prepared him to make his own decisions on the basis of God's Word, then he will never bring shame on you or on Jehovah but will make straight paths for his feet.—Prov. 29:15; Heb. 12:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">True, being a parent is not easy, but by training your children according to godly principles you can raise a fine Christian family and enjoy the approval of “our Father in the heavens.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">F</span><span class="font1">^EW persons pause to question what is widely said about the so-called ice ages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Were there really ice ages? Was it ice, rivers of ice, that dug deep valleys and canyons in the earth? Is it Scriptural, even reasonable, that slow-moving sheets of ice, vast glaciers, carved out the face of our planet?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Whatever they are called, glacial epochs or ice ages, they are a favorite shaping tool in the hands of many theorists. The last great ice age, it is said, covered about 27 percent of the world’s land area, blanketing Europe and North America with vast continental ice sheets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Actually the teaching of ice ages rests upon the shaky foundation of speculation and unacceptable theory. How so?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Theories Fail to Inspire Confidence</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In a book that teaches the theory of ice ages, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">1001 Questions Answered About Earth Science,</span><span class="font1"> published in 1962, Richard M. Pearl asks the question as to what could cause ice ages. The answer:-“We do not know. There is a great deal of speculation, there are any number of scientific hypotheses, and there are even a few facts! Changing climate sounds at first like a simple enough explanation—just let the sun's heat decrease for a while, and glaciers should begin to form. But parts of the earth have turned cold without accompanying glaciation.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">What about this speculation that is offered to account for ice ages? How sound is it? The volume </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Geology, Principles and Processes</span><span class="font1"> concludes: “Many hypotheses have been offered to account for the climate which resulted in continental glaciation, but none is generally accepted.” Similarly, W. B. Wright declares in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Quaternary Ice Age:</span></p>
<p><span class="font26">It must be admitted that among the theories which have been brought forward to account for the phenomena of the Ice Ages, there is not a single one which meets the facts of the case In such a manner as to inspire confidence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Problem of Causes</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Accounting for the extreme cold required to produce the ice ages is one of the great problems of the theory. Wherever factual evidence is found about the earth's past, it points to the fact that the earth once enjoyed a warm climate from pole to pole. Consider what Dr. F. H. Knowlton wrote in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Relations of Paleobotany to Geology:</span><span class="font1"> “Relative uniformity, mildness and comparative equability of climate, accompanied by high humidity, have prevailed over the greater part of the Earth, extending to or into polar circles, during the greater part of geologic time since at least the Middle Paleozoic,” and paleozoic rocks are said to contain the earliest forms of life. So how did the change to a climate cold enough to produce ice ages come about? Was it slowly? No. The quick-frozen carcasses of mammoths in Arctic regions point to a climatic change of catastrophic quickness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Yet no matter how quick or gradual was the formation of ice, the ice-age theorists are faced with the problem of water. From where did such a prodigious quantity of water come to produce vast ice sheets hundreds and thousands of feet thick to cover the land? The oceans are said to be the source. The theory involves evaporation, condensation and snow. The fallen snow is believed to have turned into ice sheets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The supposition that glaciers were made slowly is not in agreement with the existence of the quick-frozen carcasses already referred to, and arguing that the glaciers were formed quickly from ocean waters provides no remedy either. The faster they were made the greater the heat of the climate needed to step up evaporation, so vital to the snowfall needed to create ice sheets. If we choose to allow twenty years for glacier making, staggering quantities of water would have to be liberated from the oceans into the atmosphere. Why, simple arithmetic shows that such exorbitant evaporation would require oceans to boil! All this, at a time when freezing temperatures are called for by the ice-age theory! And still it would not be fast enough to fit the facts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Movements—Another Problem</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Like causes, movement is a serious problem for the ice-age theory. How could ice sheets thousands of feet thick move over a thousand miles? The theory is that such a colossal ice sheet was not merely coasting but working all the way like a mammoth bulldozer. Do present glaciers operate that way?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Glaciers move only by virtue of the gradient of their mother mountain, down which they slide. The slant provides for movement much as a hill does for the skier. Visualize a tabletop: Imagine pouring a steady stream of sand on it. Pretend that the sand is ice-age snowfall. What happens? It piles into a hill that becomes higher and covers more area at its base as you continue to pour. As it gets higher the sand pours over itself, thus spreading the base wider. Similarly ice could “move’* by such a piling up of ice in the center, causing its base to spread out fanwise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">To provide a hill steep enough to sustain glacial movement of the alleged spread of the so-called Laurentide ice sheet of North America, let us imagine a high pile-up of ice. Let us say the height of the hill is two and a half miles (13,200 feet), since the ice that forms on it must travel vast distances. Each year great quantities of ice will need to form—so much that ice would creep downward, eventually causing an ice sheet to form three thousand miles in diameter, with its depth averaging 2,000 feet. The ice sheet of the last great ice age is thought to have been that thick or thicker.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Now to attain such an ice sheet in a period of a thousand years we will need to imagine tremendous winter snowfalls enveloping the central area of the ice mountain, say for an area 500 miles in diameter. We would need, mathematically, a yearly ice accumulation of 72 feet. This much ice would require about 720 feet of snow per year, season after season, decade after decade, without missing one such fantastic winter for a thousand years!</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Grinding and Carrying Power</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Besides the problems of causes and movement, there is this; How could ice grind and carry billions of tons of earth and stone? Says Sir Henry Howorth in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Glacial Nightmare and the Flood:</span></p>
<p><span class="font26">Ice^ polishes, st nates, and adds the veneer or polish to the surface, but its action as an erosive agent is merely superficial. Like the sandpaper employed by the cabinet-maker, or the burnisher applied by the sculptor, it merely finishes the surface. . . . Ice moving as a solid mass cannot transmit more than a certain pressure without crushing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Ice, though not completely plastic, will mold itself to the surface upon which it lies, much like sealing wax; so its action certainly furnishes no evidence of glaciers' bulldozing our earth. Existing glaciers display within themselves this plastic quality, as evidenced by stones they have enveloped. Rather than shearing off these stones, the glaciers slide over them, continuing on their great white ways, much as a snail would creep over an obstruction in its path.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Even now glaciers are seen obeying the contour of their bed, not defying gravity and solid stones by climbing over the flanking mountains, much less crushing or moving them. The lake-shaping, valley-creating and mountain-making force attributed to laboring, tortoiselike glaciers is an unconvincing theory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">As far as carrying power, the glacier seems limited to what may fall onto it or be incidentally trapped within its frigid bowels. But piling boulders on one another in fantastic formations, some boulders weighing hundreds of tons, and perching them on the side of a granite hill, is something else. A slow-moving glacier would not throw boulders around like that. How much less would creeping glaciers shape the face of the earth! What is called the “drift”—sand, gravel, boulders—is located all over the globe, requiring a Herculean moving job, a lashing force of prodigious dimensions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">So, then, ice seems to have been only incidental to the shaping of the earth's crust</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Power of Water in Violent Motion</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Great driving waves of water in violent motion, on the other hand, are the most feasible force of nature that could crush and strew abroad tremendous rock formations. Racing as an uncontrolled flood, water levels cities in moments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Flooding water at work is terrifying. Mighty waves have hit city walls, carrying pieces from them that weigh eight or ten tons forty or fifty yards. One swollen river developed such power that nine girders weighing eighty tons apiece were washed off their piers, one being carried two miles down river and nearly buried in sand—all in just six hours. Describing a flood in Britain, in July, 1829, R. Hewitt writes in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">From Earthquake<sub>}</sub> Fire and Flood:</span></p>
<p><span class="font26">Nothing could resist the flood. Cottagers fled in panic and stood helplessly by as they watched houses, farms and bridges, great mills and factories, sucked Into the water and demolished. One enormous wave lifted a 65-foot stone arch from a bridge bodily into the air and carried it forward on the flood for quite a distance. . . . The beautiful 340-foot bridge of Spey at Fochabers, with its four great arches, was also carried away by the flood. .. . Great boulders were washed down the valleys.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Such power could explain the widespread phenomenon of the “drift,” and yet these were merely local, small floods of short duration. But the great flood of Noah’s day Is something else; it was a global flood. Concerning that God-sent Flood, the Bible record says: &quot;The waters overwhelmed the earth so greatly that all the tall mountains that were under the whole heavens came to be covered.” (Gen. 7:19) That flood was gathering depth and momentum, not for a few hours, but for forty violent days! Imagine whole continents of water thick with sediment as they surged about angrily, smashing mighty boulders together. What colossal awls and mighty chisels all this would prove to be! Here was a power that could dig deep valleys and canyons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">That Flood was a miraculous act of Jehovah God, of whom it is written: “He has founded the earth upon its established 'places.... The waters were standing above the very mountains. At your rebuke they began to flee; at the sound of your thunder they were sent running in panic— mountains proceeded to ascend, valley plains proceeded to descend—to the place </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">that</span><span class="font1"> you have founded for them.'*—Ps. 104:5*8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Earth's Climate Changes with Flood</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">What was the source of the vast waters that overwhelmed the earth in Noah’s day? The Bible account indicates that it was a great quantity of water that was suspended above the earth. We read at Genesis 1:7: “God proceeded to make the expanse and to make a division between the waters that should be beneath the expanse and the waters that should be above the expanse.” Those waters that were “above the expanse” were doubtless responsible for a hothouse-like condition existing in the whole earth. They could let light and heat rays in, diffusing them everywhere, and keep the heat from escaping.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">But when Almighty God caused this canopy of water to fall at the time of the Noachian flood, earth’s climate changed. It is first after the Flood that the Bible speaks of “cold and heat, and summer and winter.” (Gen. 8:22) So the Flood brought an end to the earthwide, mild climate and a quick change took place from hothouse temperatures to arctic coldness in the far northern and southern parts of the earth. In those areas, the water congealed to form vast icecaps. Many forms of animal life were destroyed and their carcasses were put into the deepfreeze of arctic ice so suddenly that grass they were eating did not have time to digest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Ice-age theorists who hold that a gradual decrease in the earth’s climatic temperature caused the so-called ice ages, from ordinary winter snows, tend to ignore or play down the significance of such frozen carcasses. But the carcasses cannot be ignored. Too many of them have been found. Dolph Earl Hooker writes in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Those Astounding Ice Ages:</span></p>
<p><span class="font26">In spite of long continued efforts to prove that ice sheets accumulated because climate had deteriorated, little if any actual evidence has been discovered to validate the theory. On the contrary, there is evidence that glacial ice appeared with catastrophic suddenness. There is evidence that at a time when temperate climatic conditions extended even into polar regions, the world, teeming with warmth-loving species of floral and animal life, was overwhelmed by fall of snow, ice and rain, so violent, so sudden, so chilling, that great numbers of creatures were forthwith destroyed; so vast, so violent that it brought to an abrupt end one geologic age and ushered in another.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The ice ages, then, rest upon a foundation of speculation; hence the theory is filled with misconception and exaggeration. The theorists have too much ice for too long a period, ice from the wrong cause and ice doing more earth-shaping than it can do!</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Glaciers did develop in parts of the earth, such as the far northern and southern areas, as well as the high mountainous parts of the earth; but this came about after the Flood, after the sudden change in earth’s climate. Ice was only incidental to the shaping of the earth. The ice-age theorists flounder in a sea of speculation. Why so? Because they ignore God’s Word on the matter, and as God's prophet Jeremiah said: “They have rejected the very word of Jehovah, and what wisdom do they have?”—Jer. 8:9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Holy Scriptures, gouged canyons, strewn holders and frozen animal carcasses tell of the time when a catastrophic deluge poured down from on high. Raging water in the form of a global flood, not creeping ice, played the prime role as the natural force that was earth’s sculptor.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">CC’iyrOT blindness, but the attitude of </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">11 </span><span class="font1">the seeing to the blind is the hardest burden to bear,” said deaf-blind Helen Keller. It is not the handouts that count, or the sympathy, or the pity, but the fact that one is accepted as a normal human creature that brings the greatest joy to the blind. Sightless Bernice Clifton underscores this truth in her warm and candid autobiography </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">None So Blind.</span><span class="font1"> In it she tells of her fiance bumping into her one afternoon. Apologizing, he said: “When I do a thing like that, honey, it's because I forget you can't see.” “That made me feel good,” Bernice said. “He was thinking of me as a normal individual, not as a blind person who needed special treatment.” To be accepted as a normal person and to have one’s reserve faculties developed to compensate for the visual loss is the hope of many blind. The big challenge to the seeing world is to see that such hopes are fulfilled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Blind persons have the same emotional, physical and spiritual needs as those who can see. They not only have the need to be understood and loved, but they have the need to work and play as well. Responsibility is of an inestimable value to them. It does not give them a chance to bemoan their fate and slip into the snare of accepting an invalid’s life. The blind are often excellent homemakers. They wash dishes, cook, bake and serve food, often with elegant efficiency. Some can readily thread a needle, knit and sew, design and repair their own clothes. The women often wash and set their own hair. They dance and sing, attend theaters, go on picnics,</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">water-ski. In fact, there is very little that they cannot do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">As a rule blind people have a great love for the outdoors. On their hikes they may stop to pick huckleberries or strawberries. They enjoy the water lilies and the other wild flowers by feels and smells. They get the same sense of excitement as do the sighted. The grandeur of mountain scenery, the oceans in their various moods, the beauty of the desert in bloom, the glory of a setting sun, when described to them, are all unforgettable scenes that they cherish and enjoy most dearly. How they will laud the Maker of the eye when he restores sight to the blind in the kingdom of his Son Jesus Christ!—Prov. 20:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Blind children and blind young people behave very much like those with sight. There is the usual horseplay among them. They run and jump, skip rope, swing and swim, climb, tumble and roller-skate. Yes, they even canoe, bowl, play card games, dominoes, checkers and chess. At school they learn everything from reading and writing to trigonometry.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Problem and Causes</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Despite these facts, the problem of blindness is no small one. To begin with, there is still considerable uncertainty about who can be considered blind. A number of people still think a blind person is one who cannot see at all. This, of course, is not true. In Britain a person is considered blind if he cannot read at a distance of more than three feet a test card that normal sight reads at sixty feet. In the United States a person is considered blind when he can see at twenty feet, with his better eye and with proper correction, only what one with normal vision can see at two hundred feet. There are many places in Europe where a person who is unable to count fingers at a distance of one meter in any circumstances is considered blind. So you see, a person can have limited vision and still be technically blind. He may even avoid the appearance of being blind, as many do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the British Commonwealth there are upward of 3,000,000 blind people. Some 600,000 inhabit Britain’s dependent territories; about 80,000 live in Ghana and Malaya. There are approximately 2,300,000 blind people in the Indian subcontinent; yet in Britain, Australia, New Zealand and Canada put together there are only about 145,000. In England and Wales there are approximately 77,390 blind people, of whom 54 percent are over sixty-five years of age. In the United States the number of blind people exceeds 230,000 and nearly two-thirds of this estimated number are over sixty years of age. These facts show that blindness in a peculiar degree is a problem of old age and of the underdeveloped territories.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The causes of blindness in Great Britain, America and elsewhere are not easily determined. The chief specific causes appear to be cataracts, glaucoma and optic nerve atrophy. Tuberculosis, meningitis, arteriosclerosis, diabetes, tumors and cancers, vascular diseases and syphilis may also affect the sight to the extent of total blindness. Wars too have made their fateful contribution to the blind. Approximately 1,200 American military men were blinded in World War II.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the northern parts of Ghana there are about 30,000 blind people, most of whom suffer from a disease called river blindness, which is caused by the bite of a fly bred in the tributaries of the Volta. A scheme to destroy the fly by insecticide is now in effect. Trachoma, one of the main causes of blindness in the British Commonwealth, is stubbornly yielding to research. Much visual loss in the world, however, is due to substandard living and lack of adequate medical care. A British report says: “There can be little doubt that with present medical knowledge two-thirds of the blindness in the Commonwealth’s less developed territories could be abolished in a comparatively short time, but at present there are only about 30 full-time government eye specialists in Britain’s Dependencies.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Some say there is no telling what could be achieved for the blind through a proper expenditure of effort and resources by government and charitable agencies throughout the world. Although governments spend riches for making fantastic weapons of destruction, there is a shortage of funds for helping the blind and for efforts to diminish blindness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Meeting the Challenge</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Concern for the blind stretches back to the days of the ancient Hebrew patriarchs. Isaac, the son of Abraham, was cared for by his wife and children in his old age when “his eyes were too dim to see.” That was the way the blind were cared for in those days. (Gen. 27:1-4) Later, the law of Moses commanded: “Before a blind man you must not put an obstacle,” and “cursed is the one who causes the blind to go astray in the way.” (Lev. 19: 14; Dent. 27:18) But it was not until the coming of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, that it could be said: “The blind are seeing again.” (Matt 11:5) However, Jesus, who opened many blind eyes, gave no charge concerning them other than that man ‘must love his neighbor as himself.' The hope of the blind as well as of the sighted, Jesus taught, was not in some human scheme but in the kingdom of God.—Matt. 22:39; 6:9,10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">History offers more than enough proof that the blind have been loved little. In the Middle Ages in Europe and Asia opportunities for the blind were extremely limited, leaving them with no occupation or source of income. Many were rejected outright from society. They lived lonely lives. A few emerged as wandering minstrels, playing harps and pipes and singing songs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">If the blind seem not to have bettered their lot in life, the seeing world has only itself to blame. As in the past so today, it is not ready to accept them as fully employable. As a rule the blind worked at home or in isolated workshops sponsored by charitable organizations. In these segregated or “sheltered shops,” as they were sometimes called, they made rope mats, knitted shawls and stockings, weaved baskets or made brushes. As for developing high intellect and scholarly attainment among the blind, this was considered impossible until very recent years. Only the indomitable spirit of a few held open any hope of this possibility.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">There was Nicholas Saunderson, blind from infancy, who braved all opposition to become the Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at the University of Cambridge, a post he held for nearly thirty years. As a professor of physics he filled the position previously occupied by Sir Isaac Newton. Then there was John Metcalf, blind at six, who operated a stagecoach business. He became a road builder and a bridgebuilder. Volumes could be written about Francois Huber, who, although totally blind, undertook the study of bees. His discoveries were profound. The nuptial flight, the bee’s use of antennae, the genesis of swarms and the true meaning of periodic migrations were all his findings. By the time of his death in 1831, he was recognized as- the world's best authority on the life of bees.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Perhaps equally as remarkable were the achievements pf a young blind woman Melanie de Salignac who learned astronomy, algebra and geometry. And no doubt just as astounding were the accomplishments of Elizabeth Waldkirch. Although blind, she learned to speak and write Latin, French and German and kept up a voluminous correspondence in all three languages. She was also an exceptional musician, skilled at playing the violin, the flute and other instruments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">These and others proved beyond all doubt that the blind can master almost any skill, if properly taught. They paved a way for a life of greater opportunity for the blind, so that today blind men are doing research in chemistry, biochemistry and physics. A survey of forty-five blind college instructors shows them teaching classic and modem languages, music, history, economics, speech, philosophy and psychology, political science and government, religion, mathematics, physics, sociology, anthropology, chemistry, clinical medicine, engineering, geology, law and social science. A few of the blind are practicing law, medicine, physiotherapy, osteopathy and even building their own homes. In fact, one employer said: “Every time I think I have hit on some job that a blind man couldn’t conceivably hold, I find a blind man holding it,” Still the sighted world asks, as it did in the past, What can the blind do?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Biffffest Obstacle</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">in the path of the sightless is not the job, but the attitude of the sighted world toward them. It continues to deny many of them an opportunity to prove their ability. “Overcoming employer prejudice is one of the major problems in placing blind labor/’ wrote D. H. Dabelstein in his article “Vocational Rehabilitation of the Blind?’ In many cases it is simply impossible to convince employers that the blind can do the work. For example, a blind attorney says: “They [the blind] could undoubtedly learn to do the work adequately but in many cases the training would be wasted as employers are reluctant to employ blind attorneys.” In the teaching profession the story is much the same. An instructor says: “I do not recommend this profession for blind people, but only because of almost universal and insuperable prejudice on the part of those who have the power to employ. The attitude of college students is fine.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In industry employers argue that the blind worker would create new accident perils, or they say that the blind are happier when working among their own kind in a group situation. Blind people and many who work with them are firm that these objections are not sound. The results of integrated programs in most cases are making the traditional group arrangements distinctly uneconomical. As for accident perils, statistics show that blind employees have a lower accident rate and a higher attendance rate than the sighted. And if placed on the basis of matching ability and job requirements, the records reveal that the blind employee makes an efficient and productive worker. Yet only about 2 or 3 percent of the blind in the United States are holding normal jobs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Those in the business of helping the blind are convinced that at least twenty times that many could be doing so if they had the chance. On the European continent industrial placement of the blind in factories with the seeing is even much less common than in America.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Nevertheless, progress is being made, however modest. Many activities that used to be closed to the sightless are now opening up to them. At rural training centers blind men have been successfully taught to grow crops and tend cattle and poultry. Many of these trainees are now farming their own strips of land and raising their own poultry. In Greece blind homeworkers compete with seeing home handworkers rather than with organized factory machine workers. In England and Wales a few new industries have been introduced to the blind, such as engineering, soapmaking, plastics, machine carpentry and upholstery. The number of blind factory workers and the range of clerical and professional employments for the blind remain narrow despite prolonged efforts to change the situation. W. M. Eagar in his work entitled “Blindness in Great Britain” says: “In Britain, as in other countries, we have far to go before blind people with more than manual ability have the choice of occupations they deserve.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Will that day ever come? Will it arrive before that time when even in a physical way will come to pass the blessing of which the psalmist was inspired to write, namely: “Jehovah is opening the eyes of the blind ones; Jehovah is raising up the ones bowed down”? If the past is any indication of what the future holds for the blind, then there is a strong inclination to think not. God is still their only hope. —Ps. 146:8.</span></p><a name="caption1"></a>
<h3><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font31" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>SOMETHING NEW IN CONVENTIONS</span></h3>
<p><span class="font26">CONVENTION that travels to many cities, going around the world in a relatively short time—this is something new. Yes, never before has there been a convention like the Around-the-World Assembly of Jehovah’s Witnesses. It is actually one assembly that stops at twenty-four different cities, as it moves around the world in just ten weeks!</span></p>
<p><span class="font26">What makes this assembly singular also is that not only do some of the main speakers travel with the assembly around the world but so also do a large body of delegates! Almost six hundred in number, they will also share in the assembly activities, as they circle the globe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font26">Known as the &quot;Everlasting Good News” Assembly of Jehovah’s Witnesses, this international convention begins in Milwaukee, Wisconsin (June 30-July 7), and then moves to New York city’s Yankee Stadium (July 7-14). As the assembly travels to London’s Rugby Union Ground, Twickenham (July 14-21), about a dozen regular-flight airplanes will carry some five hundred convention delegates on world tour to Europe. At the various cities in Europe where the assembly stops, such as London, Stockholm and Munich, more than eighty other delegates will join the group traveling with the assembly around the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font26">Then as the assembly moves to other cities, the group of around-the-world-assembly delegates will travel by regular flights in jet airliners, sometimes by Boeing jets, at other times by DC-8’s, Comets or Caravelles. These jettraveling delegates will represent many countries at the assembly. They will be from Mexico, Canada, the United States, England, France, Denmark, Sweden, West Germany, Belgium, Italy, Austria, Switzerland, Japan, the Caribbean Islands and South America.</span></p>
<p><span class="font26">From city to city, the assembly will be thrill-ingly different in international flavor. At Delhi, India, for instance, there will be people of many different language groups, with many from outside India and others from places such as Ceylon and Mauritius,</span></p>
<p><span class="font26">The group of delegates on world tour will travel and stay together as much as possible. In fact, at Delhi, India, one hotel will house the large group of delegates. Likewise one hotel in Seoul, Korea, will provide rooms for about 450 delegates.</span></p>
<p><span class="font26">Another singular aspect of this assembly is that the delegates who go with it around the world will call on the homes of the local people to tell them about the good news of God's kingdom. They will also take educational tours In the various countries, which will help the delegates leant about local customs and religious practices. A high point of the tour will be a stop in Palestine, where the delegatesjwill see Jerusalem and the land where Jesus Christ himself preached the Kingdom good news.</span></p>
<p><span class="font26">Still another unusual aspect of this global assembly is the dual route it takes after reaching Bangkok, Thailand. One group of delegates, about 450, will go with the assembly to Hong Kong, then to the Philippines, Taiwan, on to Japan and then to Korea. Moving this large number of delegates within two days from Manila to Taiwan and from Japan to Korea will require special flight arrangements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font26">About 125 of the delegates will go with the assembly via the southern route, when the assembly stops at Singapore; Djakarta, Indonesia; Melbourne, Australia (August 16-20); Auckland, New Zealand (August 21-25), and Suva, Fiji; then on to Hawaii, where the two groups of delegates converge for the assembly, August 28-September 1, at the Waikiki Shell, Kapiolani Park, in Honolulu. Joining the assembly in Hawaii will also be delegates from the United States mainland, carried by seven chartered planes. There will also be many other Witnesses who are making their own travel arrangements to Hawaii, From Hawaii the assembly moves to the Rose Bowl, in Pasadena, California, where the Around-the-World Assembly concludes September 1-8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font26">How can you participate in this singular assembly and benefit yourself spiritually? You may be able to attend the assembly as it comes to or near your locality. Wherever it Is held, there will be the feature lecture on the climactic day, a talk entitled &quot;When God Is King over All the Earth.’’ Even though you may have to travel some distance to a convention city, it will be worth It for the spiritual benefits you will reap. Yes, do not miss the Around-the-World Assembly, something memorable and something new in conventions.</span></p><a name="caption2"></a>
<h2><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>TyglUEPtffyN/z has come</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">r</span><span class="font1">f AUGUST of 1960 a tremendous step was made in telephone communications.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">A human voice in the form of radio energy was beamed at the new satellite Echo I and was picked up some 3,000 miles away in California. At the same time the voice' of a scientist in California was reflected. from the satellite and received in New Jersey. This marked the first telephone conversation via man-made satellite. The success of experiments like this prompted the vice-president of the American Telephone &amp;&nbsp;Telegraph Company to predict that in 1964 telephone communications by satellite would be in commercial use.</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19630622_files/g_E_19630622-8.png" alt="" style="width:125pt;height:128pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font1">It is anticipated that soon a system of orbiting satellites will handle the ever-increasing number of overseas phone calls, which are predicted to reach nearly 300,-000 a day by 1980. Already the present worldwide network of telephone wires is crowded with hundreds of millions of conversations daily. The world total of telephones has surpassed 150,000,000, and in the United States they are installed at the rate of 230,000 per month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Its Beginning</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It is almost unbelievable that just eighty-nine years ago the telephone was only an idea in the mind of a young twenty-eight-year-old teacher of deaf mutes. Alexander Graham Bell had the idea that if a current of electricity could be made to vary in intensity precisely as the air varies in density during the pro-</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19630622_files/g_E_19630622-9.png" alt="" style="width:314pt;height:246pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font1">sound, human voice could be transmitted over wires. The sound waves produced by the human voice would be converted at one end of the wire into electrical oscillations, and they would speed along the wire to the other end, where they would be reconverted to sound waves. This was a new and revolutionary idea!</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The way to make this idea workable dashed into Bell’s mind while conducting some unusual experiments during the summer of 1874. He had been experimenting with a human ear and part of a skull that he had obtained from a doctor friend. He noted that the ear drum, although small and thin, would send vibrations through heavy bones. This made him reason that if this tiny disc could vibrate a bone, then an iron disc could vibrate an iron rod, or at least an iron wire. So the picture formed in his mind of two iron discs, modeled after ear drums, set far apart and connected by an electric wire. Vibrations of sound at one end would be caught and reproduced at the other.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Once on the right track Bell devoted all his energies to developing this revolutionary idea. His efforts were rewarded on a hot, sultry afternoon the following June when the full </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">twang</span><span class="font1"> of a clock spring was carried by electric current over a wire and reproduced at the other end. The telephone was born! But it had a long way to go. For forty long, exasperating weeks Bell and his assistant Thomas A. Watson toiled over their new invention, but it would only gasp and utter inarticulate noises. It could not convey speech; but finally, on March 10, 1876, it unexpectedly did: “Mr. Watson, come here, I want you.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Rapid Development</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">As a new baby rapidly increases in its ability to speak after uttering its first words, so the telephone quickly improved in its ability to transmit speech. A few months later it was brought to the attention of the scientific world at the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia, where it was hailed as an achievement of ‘'transcendent scientific interest?’ But the general concensus was that the telephone was merely a scientific toy with no practical value. The following year, when it was decided to sell Bell’s patents to Western Union for $100,000, President Orton refused the offer: “What use,” he asked pleasantly, “could this company make of an electrical toy?” That was, perhaps, one of the most regrettable mistakes a company ever has made. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Soon the telephone’s potential began to be realized. By January of 1878 the first commercial switchboard was installed in New Haven, Connecticut, making it possible for the few telephone owners to ring an operator who would connect them with the person they wanted. In a short time many other cities had telephone service, and in 1884 the first long-distance telephone line was constructed, between New York and Boston, a distance of some two hundred miles. Six years later New York and Chicago were linked together, and on January 25, 1915, the epoc-making first transcontinental telephone call between New York and San Francisco was made by Watson and Bell. In 1927 the first commercial overseas telephone service, between New York and London, was opened for public use, and in 1935 the first around-the-world telephone call was made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Although telephones were eventually installed in other countries, the telephone has enjoyed its greatest success in America. Even today the United States has 52 percent of the world’s total, with New York city having nearly as many as the entire country of Russia. Soon after the turn of the century their rapid increase in number made it necessary for New York city to employ more than 5,000 girls to operate the switchboards. One telephone spokesman explained that if the automatic dial system had not been put into use the telephone company would now “need to employ every girl graduate of every high school in New York city just to keep creaking along.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Automatic Dial System</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">To solve the problem of increasing volume in calls, the first completely automatic dial system was installed in 1921, making it possible for telephone users to lift their receivers and dial their number without the aid of an operator. Today nearly all the telephones in the United States are on the dial system, but the changeover has not been made without opposition. When dial phones were installed in the Capitol in 1930 one senator tried unsuccessfully to push through a resolution to ban them. Said he: “I object to being transformed into one of the employees of the telephone company without compensation.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">But how is it that by dialing a number you can almost immediately contact the person in the city with whom you want to speak? It can be appreciated how in the old days an operator could make the connection by taking a plug attached to your line and inserting it into a socket on her switchboard, thereby connecting you with the number you wanted. But how is this done automatically?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The operation of modern electrical switching equipment is truly a marvel of ingenuity. When you pick up the receiver your call is automatically connected to a piece of equipment called a ‘‘sender,” which produces the dial tone. As you spin the dial, the sender, which is the heart, brains and memory of the system, records pulses generated by the turning dial. After registering the Information, it contacts an electrical scout, called a “marker*<sup>1</sup> or “decoder,” which quickly analyzes the information and lets the sender know which route through the maze of electrical equipment the call can take to reach the desired number. The sender then triggers the operation of many electrically operated switches called “relays.” These relays serve the same purpose as a switchboard operator, automatically connecting you with the desired person.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Lifesaving Instrument</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Many people look upon the telephone as an indispensable, lifesaving instrument, and not without good reason. Within seconds one can contact a doctor, the fire department or the police. In fact, help of practically any kind is at one’s very fingertips, which is especially comforting to invalids and older persons. But, then, even little babies have been known to save the lives of others by using the telephone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">For instance, not long ago a mother inadvertently locked herself in a closet. From behind the locked door she was able to coax her small child to take the phone off the hook and dial “O.” “Mamma/* the baby said, and the operator knew something was wrong. Help was sent, and soon mother was released. Every year some 30,-000 persons in the United States dial the operator for help.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Again it is the marvelous design of the telephone equipment that allows babies, or someone incoherent because </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">of</span><span class="font1"> fright, to summon help. When one dials “O” the sender records ten pulses and passes the information to the decoder. The decoder understands that an operator is wanted and so finds a pathway to a switchboard. The sender and decoder then drop out of circuit to serve other calls, but the operator now has a permanent link with the caller. Even if the caller hangs up without giving her sufficient information, she can have a technician check the relays, and within minutes the name and address of the caller can be ascertained and help sent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Direct Distance Dialing and</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">All Numbers Calling</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Until recent years dialing was limited to local calls. If one wanted long distance, he had to call the operator. But now the majority of the telephones in the United States are equipped for long-distance dialing, and it is anticipated that in another couple of years virtually every phone will be in dial contact with every other phone. Even direct distance dialing to Europe and other continents is expected in the not too distant future.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It was with the national and international distance dialing in mind that the United States embarked upon a program of uniforming telephone numbers about four years ago. Since letter and number combinations are not common in other countries, and since exchange names mean little to most people and can be confusing to persons living in other communities, it was deemed advisable to make the change to All Numbers Calling. This is a system where, instead of having an exchange name, such as MAin 5-1240, the phone number is changed to all numbers, 6251240.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Already upward of twenty million telephones have been changed over to this new system, but not without opposition. Some resent having their cherished exchange names taken away. As one anti-digit patriot protested: &quot;Give me Liberty or take the blinking phone out.” In San Francisco some citizens went so far as to form an Anti-Digit Dialing League to oppose &quot;creeping numeralism.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">But despite the opposition, it will not be long until all telephones are changed over to seven numbers, instead of the two letters and five numbers. However, in direct distance dialing one must dial ten numbers. This is so because each area has an assigned code, which must be dialed as a prefix to the local number. When this three-number code is dialed, the sender passes the information along to the decoder, which, in turn, notifies the sender to prepare this for a long-distance call. But since normal telephone pulsing is impossible over great distances complex special equipment is necessary to select a number and ring the phone in a home 3,000 miles away.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Telephones of the Future</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the eighty-seven years since it first spoke, the telephone has indeed come a long way. It was claimed in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Reader’s Digest</span><span class="font1"> last summer that &quot;the president of the United States is never more than two minutes away from a telephone.” Wherever he is—in an automobile in a foreign country, flying at 40,000 feet in a jet, boating off Cape Cod or on a golf course—his White-House communicators can reach him almost immediately by telephone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">But telephone scientists have been working on equipment that will make present marvels seem obsolete. Already they have built a completely new electronic switching system that eliminates all mechanical switching devices and operates a thousand times faster than present equipment Th* speed of electronic switching will make possible all sorts of new services.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">For instance, you will be able to reach frequently called numbers by dialing two digits instead of seven. Incoming calls will be routed to another phone if the first line is busy. If you are going visiting, calls will be transferred to a friend's house by simply dialing a special code and then your friend’s number. When you return home, you will be able to switch them back just as easily. You may be discussing a business transaction and want to consblt some associates, so without either party hanging up, you will be able to call up your associates. All of you will then be able to discuss the matter over the phone together. This new electronic system was given a successful test-run in Morris, Illinois, from November 17, 1960, to February 16, 1962, By mid-1965 it is expected to be put into commercial use in at least one eastern community.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In view of recent progress, the ultimate dream in telephone service once described by a top technician does not seem so farfetched. Said he: &quot;Whenever a baby is born anywhere in the world, he is given at birth a telephone number for life. As soon as he can talk, he is given a watchlike device with ten little buttons on one side and a screen on the other. When he wishes to talk with anyone in the world, he will pull out the device and punch on the keys the number. Then, turning the device over, he will hear the voice of his friend and see his face on the screen, in color and in three dimensions. If he does not see him and hear him, he will know that his friend is dead.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Yes, the telephone has come a long way, but apparently it has a long way yet to ga</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">conquistadores swept through the Americas in the sixteenth century they brought with them not only their religion but members of the Roman Catholic clergy* Wherever they established the authority of the Spanish Empire from Mexico to South America, they al^o established the authority of the church. For more than four hundred years the Catholic church has exercised a powerful influence upon the lives of the peoples in this part of the world. In view of this, why is the church worried about Latin America? Why did Auxiliary Archbishop Dom Helder Camara of Rio de Janeiro state: “There is grave danger that the people of Latin America may cease to be Catholic or even Christian?”<sup>1</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font1">To understand why the Catholic church is in danger of losing her position in Latin America, it is necessary to look at the record she has made for herself there. A number of things she has done or has failed to do bear directly upon the circumstances that now trouble the Latin-American people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Education</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">During the colonial period, education was in the hands of the Catholic clergy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Such religious orders as the Dominicans, Augustinians and Jesuits established schools and opened a number of colleges been founded in 1551, Among the Indians, schools were set up so the clergy could indoctrinate them with the Catholic faith. Glowing reports were sent back to Spain by these priestly educators on how well Indian children were learning Latin* But the early effort to educate the natives lost its vigor within less than half a century. Many of the In</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19630622_files/g_E_19630622-11.png" alt="" style="width:134pt;height:305pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font1">dian schools were closed because the Spaniards felt that too much instruction endangered their domination of the Indians.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Despite the various schools that were established and operated by the church, illiteracy and ignorance persisted at a very high rate among most classes throughout the colonial period. Between 80 and 95 percent of the people were illiterate. This was due not only to lack of schools but also to the fact that those schools that existed were, as a whole, restricted to the wealthy upper classes- On this facet of colonial education, Alfredo Espinosa Tamayo wrote, with regard to Ecuador: “Public education was reserved solely for the privileged and</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">and universities* In fact, the universities was restricted to reading and writing and</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">of San Marcos in Peru and the National University in Mexico are the oldest in the Western Hemisphere, having elementary . . * arithmetic in the lower grades; to the study of Latin and grammar in tjtie middle grades, and of law or theology in the university. . . . Instruction was entirely in the hands of the clergy.... The people remained submerged in ignorance/’<sup>2</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Even among the preferred class of Spaniards and Creoles education was for those who could pay for it. As for the lower classes, they did not benefit from the clergy-operated schools but continued to be illiterate. In his book </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Latin America, </span><span class="font1">J. Fred Rippy, professor of history at the University of Chicago, wrote: “The some twenty universities in existence in 1800 were probably sufficient in number to accommodate such of the sons of the upper classes as were able to attend them, even if the course of study was limited and defective. But comparatively little had been done to educate the masses/’ With regard to the clergy’s rigid censorship of reading matter, which helped to cripple effective education, he states: “Sometimes the clergy stood with flaming swords at the gates of knowledge.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The inquisition was the principal sword used by the clergy to keep intellectual growth cut to a low level. Lists of prohibited books were issued regularly by the clerical directors of the Inquisition. Its famous Index contained thousands of forbidden books. Anyone who dared to read one of these books was liable for punishment. Even the reading of God’s Word was forbidden. Bibles were included in a list of forbidden books by the Edict of Delaciones.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Sometimes the power of the Inquisition was used against a person merely because his possessions were coveted by the Inquisitors. In Lima the Inquisitors were eventually tried for fraud. As long as the church kept the Inquisition functioning, she acted as an oppressive damper on intellectual advancement in Latin America. Educated people were afraid to do creative thinking.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">During the eighteenth century practically ail the primary and secondary schools in Brazil were operated by the church, but the church failed to use its control of education for uplifting the people intellectually. The viceroy of Brazil, Marquis de Lavradio, stated that his subjects were “devoid of education/’<sup>3</sup> Historian Roy Nash writes: “Ignorance formed the bulk of the social heritage bequeathed to the Republic by the Empire in 1889.”<sup>4</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font1">When liberal Mexican leaders were<sup>-</sup> successful in instituting reforms that curtailed the power of the church, public education began to progress, although at a slow pace because of lifnited funds. In 1875, near the close of the Juarez government, Mexico had one school for every 1,110 inhabitants. Later, in 1920, with the beginning of the administration under Alvaro Obregon, a concerted effort was made to educate the masses. The guiding principle was that every citizen had a right to an education, a principle that had no place in the clergy-operated educational system during colonial days.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Throughout the history of Latin America, the church has insisted on the exclusive right of educating the people, but she has left a very poor record as an educator even since the conclusion of the colonial period, The schools she has established and maintained have been little more than a token effort in the field of education. Her failure to meet the educational needs of the common people is certainly a contributing factor to the high rate of illiteracy that still persists in much of Latin America.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Wealth</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">From the beginning of the colonial period, church leaders seemed to have the same obsession for wealth that consumed the conquistadores. Notwithstanding poverty among the common people, the clergy amassed huge landholdings and became fabulously rich. Historians estimate that the church owned as much as one third to one-half of all the property in use in the colonies. She also carried on lucrative businesses that contributed measurably to her vast riches.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the book </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">A History of Mexico,</span><span class="font1"> Henry Parkes relates: “Early in the nineteenth century it was estimated that more than half the land in use in Mexico had become the property of the clergy. The church, moreover, was a money-lending institution, owning at least two-thirds of the capital in circulation. It gave loans to hacen-dados, and acquired mortgages on their estates. From rents and interest, and from tithes, fees and the sale of papal bulls, it enjoyed an enormous revenue; and since it was exempt from taxation, its holdings steadily increased. . . . The income from these various sources of revenue was unevenly distributed. Many of the parish priests earned barely one hundred pesos a year. . . . But the friars often lived luxuriously; and the archbishop, who in the eighteenth century enjoyed a salary of one hundred and thirty thousand pesos, and the bishops of Puebla, Valladolid and Guadalajara, who received almost as much, were among the richest men in Mexico.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Not long after Spain's conquests in the Americas, Martel Santoyo wrote: “All the Dominicans and Mercaderian monasteries have repartimientos. . . . They try to extract from them [the Indians] as much as they can. . . .With this and with alms they grow rich.”<sup>2</sup> Complaining to Pope Innocent X in 1647 about the wealth of the Jesuits, Bishop Joan de Palafox y Mendoza of Puebla said that just two Jesuit seminaries possessed “three hundred thousand sheep with many head of cattle.” They had six of the best sugar mills, with each mill being worth “a million and a half pesos.” Besides six haciendas that earned more than 100,000 pesos a year, they had</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“haciendas of wheat and grain, four to six leagues across, and very rich silver mines.”<sup>2</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Jesuits in Chile during the eighteenth century controlled more than fifty of the richest haciendas there. The sale of one of them brought over 130,000 pesos. In Peru the church had gained possession of immense landholdings, thousands of slaves as well as a great amount of cash which she lent out for interest as she was doing in Mexico. Regarding the commercial activities of the clergy in Peru, the history book </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Growth and Culture of Latin America</span><span class="font1"> says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“Thousands of acres of the best agricultural land had come under their ownership and while much of it was put to useful exploitation, it was effectively removed from the competitive market and worked under conditions of special privilege that placed the private owner at an everincreasing disadvantage. . . . There was scarcely any economically profitable field of activity in which the orders did not engage,”<sup>5</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font1">With so much untaxable wealth in the possession of the church and with business ventures by the religious orders competing unfairly with private businesses, the economy of Latin America was certain to be affected adversely. The church had made herself an economic hobble on national economies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Failure</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In many ways the Catholic church has failed the people of Latin America. Even in what she is supposed to be chiefly concerned—the spiritual instruction of the people—she has failed. Her religious instruction has not created spiritual depth in the people or a clear understanding of what Christianity really is. She has not even produced what might be called good Catholics. In an article about the church in Latin America, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Look</span><span class="font1"> magazine stated: “Spiritually, the church has largely failed in its mission to make what it would consider 'good* Catholics out of the residents of the Latin American countries, at least 90 percent of whom call themselves Catholic?’<sup>1</sup> Historian Carleton Beals wrote: “On the spiritual side, it cannot be said to have been entirely successful in diffusing Christianity, Its own practices have become infused with pagan rite?’<sup>3</sup> The pagan religion of the Indians and Catholicism were blended, producing a religion that the Indians could easily accept. On this point the book </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Growth and Culture of Latin America</span><span class="font1"> states: “The religion which the subjugated Indians of New Spain had acquired was a blend of their own paganism and the ritualistic aspects of Catholicism. A sincere appreciation of the principles of Christianity was not easily theirs, and the social conditions of the period were not conducive to Christian behavior. Exhortations of sincere priests often were nullified by the unchristian actions of the citizenry and even by a segment of the priesthood itself. The association of one of the Indian deities with the Virgin of Guadalupe, patroness of the Indians, helped to bridge the gulf between the religions of the conquerors and vanquished?’<sup>5</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The people of Latin America are not blind to the fact that the church has been more concerned with her personal advantage than with their best interests. Julio Navarro Monzd observed that in some South American republics “a clergy, as ignorant as it is corrupt, arbitrarily imposes its will on the governing officials, with no other thought than that of clinching its own authority and defending its own economic interests?’<sup>0</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Anticlericalism and even the growth of Communist organizations in Latin America have been the reaction to the indifference the church has shown over the centuries for the welfare of the common people. She has only herself to blame when these movements grow among her people and threaten her existence. Note what the Latin labor leader Emilio Maspero said: “In the face of the image of the church’s historic compromises with money, power and privilege, the working masses developed a hostility, not only to the unjust economic and social institutions, but also to the church, which in their eyes has been systematically and relentlessly supporting the established order, and unjust and inhuman social and economic institutions. This has stirred a deep-seated anticlericalism, drawing the masses away from faith in Christianity and pushing them toward faith in communism?’<sup>1</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Pointing out the church’s fear that she might now reap in Latin America what she has sown over the past centuries, a prominent Catholic layman in the United States remarked: “Is the present concern of the church for social and economic reform in that critical sector of the world the voice of leadership or rather a desperate cry, a bejeweled episcopal finger in the dike, hoping thus to stave off the flood in which the church may well be washed away?”<sup>7</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The record that the Catholic church has made is a record that can seriously affect her future in Latin America. Since the heritage she has brought to the present generation there has been one of illiteracy, ignorance and poverty, is it any wonder that persons who regard her as representing Christianity are in “danger” of ceasing “to be Catholic or even Christian”? Indeed, the church has good reason to be worried in Latin America.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">some 220 of these vicious storms having lashed the island in the past sixty years. With just a little imagination one can picture the tremendous forces unleashed when water from a heavy rain rushes down these steep slopes, through gorges and over waterfalls to the coastal plains below.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Hard pressed for both space and resources, man has begun his attack on this giant. He seeks to force it to give up to him dwelling places, arable land, timber, minerals and power.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Harnessing Its Power</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Striking at the giant's heart, the country’s best engineers and technicians are hard at work on the Tachien reservoir project. The purpose of this project is to trap the water of the Tachia River, high up in the mountains, by means of a gigantic</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">as Formosa. Here more than eleven million people, most of them Chinese, crowd together on a strip of land 240 miles long and 88 miles across at its widest point. But actually only part of the island’s 13,889 square miles is habitable by man, because a tremendous giant spreads itself over two-thirds of the land area, stretching its long frame from one end of the island to the other, and spreading out to a width of as much as fifty miles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The uneven backbone of this huge giant towers above the island, separating the low plains on either side where the majority of the people are crowded together. Taiwan’s giant is, of course, her lofty mountain range, which supports more than sixty peaks that soar over 10,000 feet into the air. In fact, there are few passes through these mountains that are below an altitude of 8,000 feet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The giant’s backbone has been deeply scarred by heavy rainfall and typhoons, concrete dam. When complete, this dam will be one of the highest of its type in the world, rising some 780 feet into the air. It will back up a lake with a storage capacity of 400,000 acre-feet of water.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The flow of water from this reservoir will be regulated so as to run a series of six power plants built at different levels so as to utilize a 4,000-foot drop of the river in less than thirty miles. The water will leave the dam by means of huge tubes and will drop hundreds of feet to go through the generator turbines of the first power plant. From there the water will empty into the river and will eventually flow through each of the successive power plants to generate a combined capacity of 1,384,000 kilowatts of electricity. But that is not the end of the water’s usefulness. It will then enter an irrigation system to serve some 131,000 acres of farmland. Thus, when the giant sheds water from its back into the Tachia River, it will bring benefits instead of destruction to the people on the plains below.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The giant, however, has not yielded its tremendous waterpower for man’s use without a struggle. The Tachien project will, in fact, stand as a memorial to the many lives that were lost in the effort to construct it. The fury of typhoons and torrential rains deposited as much as forty inches of rain in twenty-four hours and swept men and equipment down steep mountainsides. The giant took its toll of those who sought to conquer it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Spanning Its Back</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">For a long time Taiwan’s mighty giant challenged men to cross its rugged back. It defiantly blocked man’s movement between the east and west coasts. The Japanese, during their occupation of the country, tried! to span the 10,000-foot mountain range with a road, but without success. It was not until 1956 that the Chinese Nationalists began construction that eventually made the long-dreamed-of road a reality. But victory came only after four long years of strenuous struggle that cost $13,500,000 and two hundred human lives. That represented more than one casualty for every mile of the 192-mile road! One can appreciate why the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">China Yearbook </span><span class="font1">says: “The east-we st cross country highway . . . was the greatest achievement ever undertaken in Taiwan.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Although Taiwan’s east-west highway is no super expressway—being only a narrow twelve-foot-wide track made of dirt and gravel—what it lacks in size it more than makes up for in scenic splendor. Travelers on this highway follow along the Tachia River gorge, and then gradually climb up the mountain cliffs until the river looks like a tiny thread below. On rounding a mountain turn they may be suddenly faced with a gracefully curved wall of gleaming granite that is set off by towering mountain cliffs clothed with rich tropical greenery. Brilliantly colored flowers are everywhere, along with cascading waterfalls, giant fems and multicolored birds. How breathtakingly beautiful!</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Incidentally, any who may fear the danger involved in taking a trip over this narrow, scenic mountain road may be reassured by the fact that the well-equipped Chin-Ma (golden horse) highway buses that travel the route enjoy a record that is relatively free from accidents. The road is restricted to alternating one-way traffic with cutoffs for passing, and traffic rules are strictly enforced by the authorities to maintain a good safety record.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Along the route travelers pass through eighty-eight tunnels hewn from solid rock and cross 112 bridges. Most of the laborers who built them were retired servicemen who worked under the Vocational Assistance Commission for Retired Servicemen. This commission plans to establish some twenty-nine villages along the highway in order to help develop the mountain resources and at the same time provide homes for retired military men. Soon these men hope to establish farms and orchards and raise their families in this rugged mountain country. Already a new sixtyroom hotel has been built at one of the most scenic mountain spots, providing a fine retreat for coastland dwellers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Thus, by means of an admirable effort Taiwan is striving to tame her lofty giant by controlling its destructive deluges, tapping its resources of timber, gold, iron and other minerals and by harnessing its power to run her factories. Instead of being a liability, this giant is now infusing new life into the country's economy.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Jesus<sup>1</sup> Prophecies on the Sign of His Presence</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5">C</span><span class="font1">ERTAIN of Jesus' disciples once asked him: “What will be the sign of your presence and of the conclusion of the system of things?” (Matt. 24:3) In reply Jesus gave his great prophecy as recorded at Matthew, chapters 24, 25; Mark, chapter 13, and Luke, chapter 21, that foretold happenings that together constitute the sign of his presence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">While there have been listed as many as thirty-nine happenings that mark Christ’s second presence and the ‘end of the world/ not all of these were given by Jesus himself and in answer to his disciples’ question.* However, among the happenings that Jesus did foretell on that occasion are the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Widespread war: “Nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom.”—Matt. 24:7; Mark 13:8; Luke 21: 10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Widespread famine: “There will be food shortages ... in one place after another.” —Matt 24:7; Mark 13:8; Luke 21:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Widespread pestilence: “There will be ... in one place after another pestilences.” —Luke 21:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Widespread earthquakes: “There will be . . . earthquakes in one place after another.&quot;—Matt. 24:7; Mark 13:8; Luke 21:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Christ’s followers hated worldwide: “You will be objects of hatred by all the nations on account of my name.” —Matt. 24:9.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">Christ's followers persecuted: “People will lay their hands upon you and persecute you.”—Luke 21:12-17; Matt. 24:10; Mark 13:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Worldwide preaching of “this good news” of God’s kingdom: “This good news of the kingdom will be preached in all the inhabited earth for a witness to all the nations.” —Matt. 24:14; Mark 13:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Worldwide enlightenment of God’s people: “Just as the lightning comes out of eastern parts and shines over to western parts, so the presence of the Son of man will be.”—Matt. 24:27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“Increasing of lawlessness.”—Matt. 24: 12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Cooling oft of love for God by professed Christians: “The love of the greater number will cool off.”—Matt 24:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">False prophets and false Christs: “False Christs and false prophets will arise.”—Mark 13:21, 22; Matt. 24:11, 23-26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Man's substitute for God’s kingdom: “When you catch sight of the disgusting thing that causes desolation standing where it ought not . . . begin fleeing.” —Mark 13:14; Matt. 24:15, 16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Men without any guiding light: “The sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light, and the stars will fall from heaven,”—Matt. 24:29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Confusion and perplexity of nations: “On the earth anguish of nations, not knowing the way out.”—Luke 21:25.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Fear and apprehension regarding the future: “Men become faint out of fear and expectation of the things coming upon the inhabited earth.”—Luke 21:26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Widespread grief and distress: “All the tribes of the earth will beat themselves in lamentation.”—Matt. 24:30.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Fearful sights resulting from knowledge of as well as increase in sunspots and cosmic rays, and knowledge<sup>1</sup> of radioactive belts: “There will be fearful sights and from heaven great signs.”—Luke 21:11, 25,26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Tribulation on Satan's invisible organization (first seen with understanding of Revelation chapter 12): '‘Then there will be great tribulation such as has not occurred since the world's beginning until now.”—Matt. 24:21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">People on earth ignoring the warning being given regarding the conclusion of the system of things and continuing as usual: “Just as the days of Noah were, so the presence of the Son of man will be. For as they were in those days before the flood, eating and drinking, men marrying and women being given in marriage, until the day that Noah entered into the ark; and they took no note until the flood came and swept them all away, so the presence of the Son of man will be.”—Matt 24:37-39.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The separating work among anointed Christians: “Then two men will be in the field: one will be taken along and the other be abandoned; two women will be grinding at the hand mill: one will be ‘taken along and the other be abandoned.”—Matt. 24:40, 41.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The gathering of the approved anointed Christians into an organization: “He will send forth his angels with a great trumpet sound, and they will gather his chosen ones together from the four winds, from one extremity of the heavens to their other extremity.”—Matt. 24:31; Mark 13:27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The 'discreet virgins/ anointed Christians, made manifest by having 'oil in their vessels/ namely, the joy of Jehovah. —Matt. 25:1-13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The individual faithful users of their talents, anointed Christians, rewarded and distinguished from the unfaithful ones. —Matt. 25:14-30.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Faithful anointed servant body manifested and put in charge: “Who really is the faithful and discreet slave whom his master appointed over his domestics, to give them their food at the proper time? Happy is that slave if his master on arriving finds him doing so. Truly I say to you, He will appoint him over all his belongings.” —Matt 24:45-47.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The evil slave class manifested and exposed: “But if that evil slave should say in his heart, ‘My master is delaying/ and should start to beat his fellow slaves and should eat and drink with the confirmed drunkards, the master of that slave will come on a day that he does not expect,.&lt;. and will punish him with the greatest severity and will assign him his part with the hypocrites.”—Matt. 24:48-51.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">And lastly, a separation work as that of a shepherd dividing the sheep from the goats on the basis of the treatment people on earth today accord Christ's spiritual brothers: “When the Son of man arrives in his glory, and all the angels with him, then he will sit down on his glorious throne. And all the nations will be gathered before him, and he will separate people one from another, just as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.” —Matt 25:31-46.<a name="footnote1"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark19">1</a></sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The physical facts in fulfillment of the foregoing prophecies have been pointed out time and again in this magazine and its companion, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font1"> the latter presenting quite a comprehensive discussion of these prophecies in the issue of October 15, 1961, pages 626-632.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">These are not all the prophecies that relate to Christ’s second presence and the conclusion of this system of things. Jesus himself gave many more, such as that which is recorded at Luke chapter 17 and that which appears in his<sup><a href="#bookmark19">1</a></sup> parables. And as has been noted, other Bible writers give us many such prophecies. However, these would not, strictly speaking, be </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Jesus' </span><span class="font1">“sign” prophecies.</span></p>

<p><span class="font24" style="font-weight:bold;">Racial Explosion</span></p>
<p><span class="font26">&lt;$&gt; Negroes clashed with police in Birmingham, Alabama (U.S.), in May. In less than a week nearly 2,500 Negroes were arrested. Police dogs, high-pressure hoses and an armored car were used to disperse the crowds. There were riots and bombings. Negroes’ demands were listed by the United Press International as follows: “Better employment opportunities. Desegregation of downtown lunch counters. Release of the estimated [2,500] Negroes still in jail as a result of the protest marches. Creation of a bl-radal committee to work out plans for gradual desegregation of public schools.&quot; On Sunday, May 12, federal troops were ordered to stand by to move into Birmingham to maintain order if necessary. Several churches were jam-packed with Negroes being exhorted and admonished by their leaders.</span></p>
<p><span class="font24" style="font-weight:bold;">Historian Speaks Out</span></p>
<p><span class="font26">&lt;$&gt; On May 4 historian Murray Ballantyne spoke to the first &quot;Regional Congress of the Lay Apostolate.&quot; Addressing 655 delegates from English-speaking dioceses in Ontario and Quebec, Canada, he said: &quot;It’s about time somebody got around to considering the place and role of the laity.” The Goaette, May 6, further quoted him as saying: “Emasculation is everywhere. We have dressed our priests in skirts and lace. We have sung soupy hymns to treacly tunes. We have bought abominable plaster statues. We have festooned our churches with gaudy streamers and paper flowers. We have run away from the blood, sweat and tears of real life. . . . Our purpose In life is not to be soldiers, sailors, salesmen or professional people or any other career or job. Our main purpose is to carry on Christ’s work,” He charged that the laity needs to realize its calling and responsibility, that “the church has never really 'got around to considering the role of the layman,” “We need to work out a theology of the lay state,” he stated. &quot;Up until now the layman has been the odd man out.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font24" style="font-weight:bold;">Atheism Outside Russia</span></p>
<p><span class="font26">German theologian Dr. Martin Niemoeller, who Is also one of six vice-presidents of the World Council of Churches, said that the Soviet Union is generally looked upon as the world’s capital of atheism. But, he said, that nation deserves the title less than Western Europe. &quot;In a recent survey conducted by a West German newspaper,” Niemoeller stated, “questionnaires circulated only among nominally</span></p>
<p><span class="font26">Christian people in West Germany revealed that 70 percent of them did not believe in the existence of God. This is why I say there are probably more atheists Ln Western Europe than in Russia.”—Tulsa, Okla. (U.S.), </span><span class="font26" style="font-style:italic;">Daily World,</span><span class="font26"> March 25, 1963.</span></p>
<p><span class="font24" style="font-weight:bold;">A New Plasma, Substitute</span></p>
<p><span class="font26">&lt;$&gt; Clinical researchers in Germany report a new plasma substitute called </span><span class="font26" style="font-style:italic;">Haemmoccel. </span><span class="font26">The compound, according to Drs. J. Moeller and A. Sykudes, was given to 110 patients and 16 controls with “no toxic or allergic side effects whatsoever.” </span><span class="font26" style="font-style:italic;">Medical World News, </span><span class="font26">March 15, said: &quot;By contrast, side effects occurred in 10% of patients given plasma and over 20% of those given whole blood at the same institution.” This journal further stated that Dr. Moeller noted that beneficial effects of the plasma expander lasted up to nine hours. Furthermore, “there were no adverse changes in the blood picture and no shift in either the serum protein spectrum or the white cell counts, even after repeated administrations.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font24" style="font-weight:bold;">111th U.N. Member</span></p>
<p><span class="font26">&lt;$&gt; From the United Nations, New York, comes word that Kuwait on May 7 was approved by the Security Council to become the 111th member of the U.N. And on May 14 the U.N. General Assembly unanimously approved the admission of Kuwait as its 111th member.</span></p>
<p><span class="font24" style="font-weight:bold;">Of Mice and Men</span></p>
<p><span class="font26">&lt;$&gt; A giant testing program of anticancer chemical is under way at Battelle Memorial Institution in the U.S. To date, said an Associated Press release, over 500,000 mice have been used, 15,260 chemicals have been screened and more than 5,000,000 injections have been given. The cost of this operation so far—$250,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">Addicts</span></p>
<p><span class="font26">&lt;$&gt; A published United Press International report stated that “ten cities account for 70 percent of the known narcotics addicts in the United States?' New York is listed as first, with 21,566; Chicago and Los Angeles follow in order. A recent U.N. bulletin stated that there are 47,489 known addicts in the United States, including 1,619 persons under twenty-one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font24" style="font-weight:bold;">Political Setback</span></p>
<p><span class="font26">&lt;$&gt; Italy's Premier Amlntore Fanfani’s Christian Democratic party suffered a severe political setback in April’s general election. In percentage the party’s vote fell from 42.4 , percent to 38.3 percent. Perhaps more startling and far more unexpected was the great Increase of Communist strength in the heart of Christendom. The Communists added 1,059,000 votes. Some have felt that Pope John XXIITs </span><span class="font26" style="font-style:italic;">“Pacem</span><span class="font26"> in Terris” encyclical and his audience with Russian Premier Nikita S. Khrushchev’s son-in-law, Aleksei I. Adzhubei, contributed to a relaxing of tensions and a deserting of the Catholic party for communism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font24" style="font-weight:bold;">Surplus Milk for Japan</span></p>
<p><span class="font26">&lt;$&gt; Milk that cost the U.S. Agriculture Department about $28,000,000 under a dairy pricesupport program was sold on April 30 to the Japanese government for $9,400,000. The 187,391,000 pounds of surplus nonfat dry milk was purchased to support the Japanese schoollunch program.</span></p>
<p><span class="font24" style="font-weight:bold;">London Bridge Leans</span></p>
<p><span class="font26">&lt;$&gt; The famous London Bridge is reportedly leaning very definitely to one side, but it is not falling—not yet. The Bridge is settling into the soft clay on which it was built. In the last five years It has settled an eighth of an inch. There is no cause for alarm, because It has been sinking at this rate ever since It was opened for traffic by King William IV and Queen Adelaide on August 1, 1831,</span></p>
<p><span class="font24" style="font-weight:bold;">West Irian</span></p>
<p><span class="font26">At 12:30 p.m., May 1, West Irian was transferred from United Nations to Indonesian administration. The jungle and mountainous land was once known as Netherlands New Guinea. The Indonesians renamed the territory West Irian. Irian is Papuan for “hot land.” Thus the U.N. divested itself of the first trust territory it ever administered directly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font24" style="font-weight:bold;">Typhoon Olive</span></p>
<p><span class="font26">The Pacific island of Saipan was severely hit by typhoon Olive on April 30. A radio report from the Island said that ’only 5 percent of the island’s 2,000 buildings escaped major damage.’ Half the homes and all the crops on the island were said to have been destroyed. Peak winds of 110 miles an hour reportedly swept directly over the island.</span></p>
<p><span class="font24" style="font-weight:bold;">Sweepstakes Lottery Legalized </span><span class="font26">&lt;$&gt; On April 30 Governor John W. King of New Hampshire legalized America’s only sweepstakes. The signed bill gave New Hampshire the first legal sweepstakes lottery in the U.S. since 1894. Receipts from the lottery are intended for school aid.</span></p>
<p><span class="font26">The Irish sweep stakes have paid $420,000,000 in prize money since they started in 1930. The French government operates a weekly national lottery, with the top prize 1,000,000 francs ($200,000).</span></p>
<p><span class="font24" style="font-weight:bold;">Pulitzer Prizes</span></p>
<p><span class="font26">William Faulkner, who died last July, received the 1963 award for his novel </span><span class="font26" style="font-style:italic;">The Reivers.</span><span class="font26"> The general nonfiction prize went to Barbara Tuchman for her book </span><span class="font26" style="font-style:italic;">The Guns of August,</span><span class="font26"> which analyzed the early daya of World War I. There was no 1963 award for drama.</span></p>
<p><span class="font24" style="font-weight:bold;">Atomic Reactors</span></p>
<p><span class="font26">&amp; There are now some 500 research, test, power and special purpose atomic reactors in use or being built in 46 countries. Twenty years ago there was only one. More than half the estimated total of 518 reactors are in the United States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font24" style="font-weight:bold;">Disarmament—When ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font26">«$&gt; For nearly six years the United States, Britain and the Soviet Union have been trying to negotiate a suspension of nuclear tests. During that period there have been at least 235 tests in the atmosphere and unnumbered tests underground. These tests have been accompanied by warnings and debates about the hazards of radiation stemming from such tests. There have been times when the Big Three have appeared close to a test-ban agreement, but final agreement always foundered on the issue of inspection. In early May Soviet test-ban negotiator Semyon Tsarapkin called the test-ban talks a “waste of' time.&quot; And U.S. president Kennedy, speaking about a nuclear test-ban agreement, had this to say: “If we don't get it now, I would think perhaps the genie is out of the bottle and we’ll never get it back in again.&quot;—New York </span><span class="font26" style="font-style:italic;">Times, </span><span class="font26">May 12, 1963.</span></p>
<p><span class="font24" style="font-weight:bold;">Everest Conquered Again</span></p>
<p><span class="font26">&lt;$&gt; The first American to get atop Mount Everest (29,028 ft.), the highest mountain in the world and the closest thing on earth to the moon, was 34-year-old, 6' 5&quot; James W. Whittaker. The feat was accomplished on May 1. With him was Sherpa guide Nwang Gombu, who stands only 5' 2&quot;. The peak was first scaled in 1953 by Sir Edmund Hillary and Tensing Norgay. The National Geographic Society was a sponsor of the present $400,000 venture. Dr. William Siri, a University of California physiclat, who ia deputy leader and scientific director of the nlneteen-man team, said: &quot;We brought along everything but a psychiatrist’s couch,&quot; By the way, Whittaker was the tallest man and Gombu the shortest of the American expedition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22" style="font-weight:bold;">Telstar II Launched</span></p>
<p><span class="font26">&lt;$&gt; The U.S. satellite, Tel st ar H, was sent into orbit on May 7. Space agency officials reportedly stated that the satellite had been thrust into a higher orbit than anticipated. The error they said was “not serious.” While there was nothing wrong with Tel star II, its first real test was pronounced only partly successful. Scientists expect to learn from it how to extend the useful life of communications satellites in the damaging radiation of space. If some 40 such satellites could be orbited at altitudes of up to about 6,000 miles, it would be possible to establish a communications network linking every part of the earth. Almost 2,000 U.$. firms, three fourths of them small businesses, have furnished equipment or services for this latest achievement in space communications. Telstar I was launched July 10, 1962.</span></p>
<p><span class="font24" style="font-weight:bold;">Soviet Ship Blessed</span></p>
<p><span class="font26">&lt;$&gt; On March 31 a Roman Catholic priest in Genoa, Italy, intoned at the launching of the 48,000-ton tanker: “In the name of God, I name you Leonardo da Vinci.&quot; The ship was one of six tankers being built in Italy to be added to the Soviet petroleum fleet. A Soviet official said his atheist government had no objections to the blessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">Nile Disaster</span></p>
<p><span class="font26">A motor launch sank in the Nile River. One hundred and eighty-five persons drowned and only 15 survived. The passengers were Moslems returning from Bair am feast observations. A published Associated Press dispatch said “the launch was equipped to carry 80 passengers.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font24" style="font-weight:bold;">Suicides</span></p>
<p><span class="font26">A Reuter’s report from Copenhagen, Denmark, May 4, says: “Protestants commit suicide seven times as often as Roman Catholics or Jews.&quot; The American National Institute of Mental Health reported that West Berlin had the world’s highest suicide rate —33.9 per 100,000 inhabitants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font24" style="font-weight:bold;">Cost of Dying Up</span></p>
<p><span class="font26">It costs more to die today than it did a decade ago. Living costs have gone up some 24 percent since 1950, but funeral costs have almost doubled in that time. According to U.S, government figures, funeral costs have increased 42 percent during the same period.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font1">Each year, with increased efficiency pf travel, the circumference of the earth is shortened. And each year with increased appreciation of God’s Word, true Christians are brought closer together. This year, 1963, both of these modern-day miracles will be emphasized as never before through the Around-the-World Assembly of Jehovah’s Witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In past years, especially from 1946 to 1958, a succession of international assemblies of Jehovah’s witnesses demonstrated to even the casual observer that overcoming national, racial and religious barriers is not only possible, but that it is a reality. Time and again these peaceful gatherings of sincere Christians from widely differing political, social and cultural backgrounds have given concrete evidence of the unifying effect God’s Word can have on the lives of all kinds of men who are willing to make God's will and purpose their motivating force.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Now, in 1963, a new and exciting chapter will be written in this record of Christian unity. The first assembly will be in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and then the second assembly close on its heels in New York city. Jehovah’s witnesses and their friends will be flocking to Milwaukee’s County Stadium and New York’s Yankee Stadium from all over the central, eastern, and southeastern parts of the United States, Canada and South America. In quick succession, at a total of twenty-two other assembly cities around the world, they will be joined by hundreds of thousands of others, all interested in advancing in knowledge of God and in association with others of the same mind. The assembly will reach its finale in Pasadena, California, ten weeks after it begins.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Arrange your affairs now. Plan to be at one of these gatherings with your entire family. It will be a rewarding experience, one you will never forget.</span></p>

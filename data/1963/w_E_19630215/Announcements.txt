FIELD MINISTRY
Everyone who has a knowledge of God’s Word has the responsibility to share its message with others. During February Jehovah’s witnesses will carry out that responsibility by offering to all persons a subscription for The Watchtower, with three booklets, for $1.
WHOSE WILL WILL WIN OUT?
Since the days of Jesus Christians have prayed, “Thy will be done on earth.” But today, it would seem that many have completely forgotten the meaning of those words. The individual will of men and nations seems far more important to most persons, especially to those who have to do with shaping the future of men’s affairs. In these days of struggle for supremacy of will, this prayer of sincere Christians is not forgotten, and God’s Word reveals God’s purpose to make his own will known in this generation. How is it to be done? Read “Your Will Be Done on Earth.” It is a fascinating book of history in the making, based on Bible prophecy. Send only 50c.
LORD’S EVENING MEAL
The date for observing the Lord’s evening meal in 1963 is Monday, April 8, after 6 p.m. Standard Time. Each congregation should start now to make arrangements so that all of Jehovah’s witnesses and other persons of goodwill can gather together for this occasion. A qualified speaker, one of the remnant of Christ’s anointed followers, if available and capable, should be assigned to deliver the discourse.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A Witness called at the home of a clergyman in Virginia and was invited to return. The back-call included a discussion of the doctrines of hell, trinity and what would happen to the earth. He agreed that the Witnesses taught the truth. After several discussions, a study was started in the <em>Paradise </em>book. During a period of bad weather, the Witness did not go to the clergyman’s home for a study. The clergyman thereupon came to see the Witness and informed him that he had left his book <em>“Make Sure of All Things” </em>at the clergyman’s home the last time he called. This turned out to be of great benefit to the clergyman, since he read it and now agrees on two subjects that he could not see before; namely, that the soul is not immortal and that Jehovah is using only one organization. One day the clergyman said: “I’m coming, it’s slow but I’m coming. The Bible says, ‘Make sure of all things.’”</p>

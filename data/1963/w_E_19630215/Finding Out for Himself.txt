Finding Out for Himself
In Arkansas a Witness placed some Bible literature with a Baptist minister and later called back. “I quickly began to marvel at his meekness and humility,” reports the Witness. “When he learned something new he was quick to acknowledge it. We discussed Bible manuscripts and translations, and I made comparisons using the New World Translation; he ordered a copy. Later he ordered the Diaglott. Recently he told me why he started to study with the Witnesses. He had heard so many bad things he just wanted to see if they were true. He confessed that he now knew they were not true. One time he told me about his sermon at his church. He said he told his congregation that most people thought some were to be teachers and preachers and others were only supposed to listen. But, as he told them, this is not true: All of you should be witnesses! He said the congregation looked at one another, then at him. . . . He grinned at me.”

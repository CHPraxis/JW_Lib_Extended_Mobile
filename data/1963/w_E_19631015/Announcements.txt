FIELD MINISTRY
During the month of October, Jehovah’s witnesses, with courage and faith in their God, will take advantage of every opportunity to acquaint others with Jehovah’s kingdom and the blessings in store for all who love and serve him. As an aid in this work, they will offer a year’s subscription for the Awake! magazine, together with three booklets on Bible themes, on a contribution of $1.
IT’S NEW! IT’S THRILLING!
The Bible-study aid “All Scripture Is Inspired of God and Beneficial” will prove to be a new experience for you. It contains an intensive heartwarming study of the Bible as a book. It reveals the origin of the Bible, its writers and the evidences of its inspiration. It acquaints you with the background and contents of every one of its books. It is not an interpretative study. It makes the Bible live for you. Send for your copy today for only $1.

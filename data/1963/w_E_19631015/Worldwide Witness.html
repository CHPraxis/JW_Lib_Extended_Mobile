<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">◆ One of Jehovah’s witnesses in the United States, in Illinois, reports: “One Saturday morning while working from door to door in Oak Park, spreading the Word of life, I came across a woman who was very busy. The luggage, she indicated, had just returned from a trip. With a few words to help her appreciate the need of the Word of life, I showed her <em>The Watchtower. </em>‘Oh, no, not <em>The Watchtower,’ </em>she said in a sighing tone. ‘I have just returned from a world tour and in every country that I visited, people were approaching me with <em>The Watchtower.’”</em></p>

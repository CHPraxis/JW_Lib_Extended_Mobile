<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="sn"><strong>● Why should one who commits a serious sin confess it to his Christian overseer?</strong></p>
<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="sb">Not because he thinks that overseer can grant him forgiveness, but because Jehovah requires it. Until the matter is set straight, he will always be plagued with a guilty conscience. He cannot acceptably serve Jehovah under such circumstances. If he has sinned, Jehovah knows that, and if the sinner tries to cover over his wrong without accepting the discipline from Jehovah, God sees that lack of true repentance and humility, and He will see that such a person is eventually cleaned out of his organization unless he undergoes a change of heart.—Pp. 473, 474.</p>

Demonism at Ephesus
 One of the earliest inscriptions found at Ephesus was a form of divination by omens from birds inscribed on a block of marble. “If the bird is flying from right to left, then whether it rises or settles out of sight, it is unlucky,” and so on.—The Bible Was Right, by Hugh J. Schonfield, chapter 37, “The Home of Magic.” See Acts 19:18, 19, where it reports that Ephesus was known for its “magical arts.”

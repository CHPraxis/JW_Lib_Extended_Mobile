<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"> One of the earliest inscriptions found at Ephesus was a form of divination by omens from birds inscribed on a block of marble. “If the bird is flying from right to left, then whether it rises or settles out of sight, it is unlucky,” and so on.—<em>The Bible Was Right, </em>by Hugh J. Schonfield, chapter 37, “The Home of Magic.” See <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:19:18-44:19:19" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Acts 19:18, 19</a>, where it reports that Ephesus was known for its “magical arts.”</p>

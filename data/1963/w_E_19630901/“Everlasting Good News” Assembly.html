<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">FOLLOWING very successful assemblies in Milwaukee and New York, the Around-the<em>-</em>World Assembly of Jehovah’s Witnesses moved to Europe, opening simultaneously in London and Stockholm. A high point at these assemblies was the adoption of a stirring resolution, by 22,009 conventioners in Stockholm and 39,663 in London. It was resolved that “under the propaganda and programs inspired by demons and voiced by political systems serving the ‘ruler of this world,’ the kings of the earth and their armies are being led . . . to the battlefield with the Hebrew name Har–Magedon (or, Armageddon). We . . . will not obstruct them in their military preparations, and yet we will not march with them to Har–Magedon, for we refuse to fight against God Almighty and his kingdom by Jesus the Messiah . . . it is our resolution to remain immovable on the side of the established Messianic kingdom of Jehovah God.”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">At Stockholm 766 persons were baptized, and at London 1,369 symbolized their dedication by immersion. It was Britain’s largest baptism.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Sunday, July 21, was the climactic day with the public talk, “When God Is King over All the Earth.” The day began at Stockholm with beaming sunshine, and 25,160 persons heard this talk that was translated simultaneously into Swedish, Danish and Finnish. The Norwegian Witnesses took their seats among the Swedes, to make room for the public. At London, with clear blue sky, 50,111 assembled for the public talk, overflowing Twickenham’s Rugby Union Stadium.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">As the assembly closed at London and Stockholm, it opened simultaneously in Munich and Milan. The Milan assembly reported a fine attendance of 14,199 delegates on the first day. Of these, 7,237 listened in French, 5,345 in Italian, 1,171 in Spanish and 446 in Portuguese. At Munich, the first day’s afternoon attendance was 75,846 persons; the conventioners had come from 34 different countries.</p>

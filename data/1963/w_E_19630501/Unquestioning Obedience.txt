Unquestioning Obedience
Catholic priest James J. Navagh, bishop of the Ogdensburg Diocese, New York, told delegates to the 67th annual state convention of the Knights of Columbus that Catholics should obey church orders without question. Quoting a Catholic scholar, he said: “If you believe something is white and the church says it is black, believe it is black.”

FIELD MINISTRY
Servants of Jehovah must be faithful and dependable during this “time of the end” of Satan’s wicked system of things. In December Jehovah’s witnesses will continue to prove their faithfulness to God by sharing fully in the ministry, offering to all persons the New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures, and a Bible study booklet, on a contribution of $1.
GROW IN SPIRITUAL STRENGTH DAILY
Begin each day of the new year with a thought from the Bible. A timely and extremely helpful selection of texts has been made a part of the 1964 Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses. Furthermore, a brief analysis of each text is presented as quoted from The Watchtower. You will grow in knowledge and spiritual strength by taking advantage of this provision contained in the annual report of preaching activity of Jehovah’s witnesses. Send 50c. You will also want a copy of the 1964 calendar, which beautifully illustrates the year’s text. Send an additional 25c.

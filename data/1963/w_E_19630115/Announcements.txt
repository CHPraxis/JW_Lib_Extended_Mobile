FIELD MINISTRY
Jesus Christ, who is the Ruler out of the House of Bread, has abundant provision of Bread to sustain the lives of all who seek Jehovah God. Distributing Bible-study publications that direct attention to this spiritual Bread supply is the privilege of his followers on earth. During January they will do this by offering a year’s subscription for The Watchtower, with three booklets, for $1.
HOW STRONG IS YOUR FAITH?
How strong is your faith? In the crucial days ahead the faith of all Christians will be tried to the limit. If yours is to be an unwavering faith it must be fed the pure Word of God regularly. No magazine is so dedicated to this lofty purpose as is The Watchtower. This is proved each year as thousands of its newer readers dedicate their lives to God, relying in faith on God’s promise to direct their steps in security. You can share their joys this coming year by subscribing now. One year, one dollar.

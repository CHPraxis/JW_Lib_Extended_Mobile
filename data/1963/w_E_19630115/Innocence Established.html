<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">In Brazil one of Jehovah’s witnesses was employed, along with a worldly man, to dig a well. They worked until the well got to be quite deep; then an accident occurred. The working companion of the Witness fell into the well and was killed. The police took the Witness into custody to be questioned and possibly charged with murder, since oftentimes murders are committed under these circumstances. It looked very bad for the Witness, since there were no persons to prove him innocent. Finally the police asked him to show his identification documents. He did not have them with him. The only thing he had with him was his minister’s identification card signed by the congregation servant and which identified him as being one of Jehovah’s witnesses. He showed it to them. When they discovered that he was in fact one of Jehovah’s witnesses, the attitude of the police changed entirely. They said, “We know that Jehovah’s witnesses do not kill. You are an innocent man.” The Witness was immediately released.</p>

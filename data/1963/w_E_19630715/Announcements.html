<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">In their ministry during July Jehovah’s witnesses will continue to manifest faith, to the preserving alive of their souls and to the blessing of men of goodwill. To that end, they will joyfully embrace the opportunity of presenting everywhere the fine Bible study aids <em>“Let Your Name Be Sanctified” </em>and <em>“Your Will Be Done on Earth,” </em>with two booklets, on a contribution of $1.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="ss"><strong>ARE YOU SEEKING HAPPINESS?</strong></p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Happiness is not the goal in life. It is the reward for right living. What are true Christian principles? Is just the “golden rule” necessary? If so, why was the rest of the Bible provided? Read the book <em>“This Means Everlasting Life.” </em>It could well be called a Christian’s guidebook to right living. That is because it is truly based on the Bible. Send 50c. Learn the way to genuine happiness.</p>

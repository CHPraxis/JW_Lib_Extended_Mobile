<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">The first Bible ever printed in America is no longer intelligible to anyone. The last man who could read it died in 1895. It was translated by John Eliot into the language of the Massachusetts Indians in 1663. It was entitled: “MAMUSSE WUNNEETUPANATAMWE UPBIBLUM GOD naneeswe NUKKONE TESTAMENT MEQUOSHKINNUMUK kah wonk WUSKU TESTAMENT—THE WHOLE HOLY HIS BIBLE GOD both OLD TESTAMENT and also NEW TESTAMENT.” Book collectors gladly pay up to $7,500 for a copy of the translation, even though it cannot be read by them.</p>

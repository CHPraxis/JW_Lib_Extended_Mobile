Glory to God?
◇ A candid observation in The New Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge testifies how ineffective Christendom’s Christmas celebration is in bringing glory to God: “The religious significance of Christmas has been too commonly minimized among Christians, the day among adults being degraded into one merely for the exchange of presents, often neither given nor received in any affection, but out of a sense of obligation or as barter. In too many homes the children, whose day it more particularly is, are not taught to link their merrymaking on Christmas with the gift of God to the world in the person of his Son Jesus Christ. Although some of our denominations hold service on that day, the vast majority of Protestants do not attend, and most of our denominations keep their churches closed.”—Volume III, page 48.

Modern Bible Translation
A schoolgirl in Ohio tells this experience: “One day in English literature class, we read some parts from the King James Version Bible as an example of English style of writing. Our teacher asked several of us to bring in some modern translations of the Bible and compare them with the King James Version. So I brought the New World Translation and pointed out some of the differences between it and many other translations. I showed them that many times the King James Version uses unfamiliar words that make it hard to understand the Scriptures. I cited the word ‘shambles’ as an example (1 Cor. 10:25, AV), and I also explained about our Creator’s name. My teacher seemed very interested, and the class listened very well. Later in the day a boy approached me saying he enjoyed my report. I showed him the New World Translation, and he asked if I could get one for him at a bookstore. So I placed one with him. I also showed it to a girl whom I had witnessed to before. She too wanted a copy. So I was able to place two Bibles and tell about Jehovah’s name as a result of a classroom assignment.”

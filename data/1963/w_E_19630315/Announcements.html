<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="ss"><strong>MEMORIAL</strong></p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">“Do this in remembrance of me,” said Jesus as he instituted the evening meal memorializing his death. This year the date to observe the Memorial is Monday, April 8, after 6 p.m., Standard Time. On this evening all of Jehovah’s witnesses, both those of the anointed remnant and the “other sheep,” will assemble at their places of meeting to hear a stimulating discourse appropriate to the occasion, following which the emblems, the bread and the wine, will be passed separately after Jehovah’s blessing has been asked upon each. In conclusion those present will be encouraged to arrange their affairs to have a share in making known to others the good news of God’s kingdom through Christ. All persons of goodwill are invited and encouraged to attend. If you do not know where the nearest Kingdom Hall is located, write the publishers of this magazine for information.</p>

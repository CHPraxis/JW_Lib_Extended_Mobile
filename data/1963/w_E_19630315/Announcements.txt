FIELD MINISTRY
Jehovah’s witnesses, as followers of the “Lion of the Tribe of Judah,” display lionlike courage in carrying out their commission to preach the Kingdom good news in the face of intense opposition from wicked men. As they share in this preaching work during March they will offer a year’s subscription for The Watchtower, with three Bible-study booklets, for $1.
MEMORIAL
“Do this in remembrance of me,” said Jesus as he instituted the evening meal memorializing his death. This year the date to observe the Memorial is Monday, April 8, after 6 p.m., Standard Time. On this evening all of Jehovah’s witnesses, both those of the anointed remnant and the “other sheep,” will assemble at their places of meeting to hear a stimulating discourse appropriate to the occasion, following which the emblems, the bread and the wine, will be passed separately after Jehovah’s blessing has been asked upon each. In conclusion those present will be encouraged to arrange their affairs to have a share in making known to others the good news of God’s kingdom through Christ. All persons of goodwill are invited and encouraged to attend. If you do not know where the nearest Kingdom Hall is located, write the publishers of this magazine for information.
READING WITH A PURPOSE
For many centuries sincere men have looked to God’s Word for their answers to life’s problems. Yet today, in a world where God’s Word, the Bible, has had its widest circulation, comparatively few men read the Bible with any serious purpose. Do you? The New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures is a modern-English version that provides the best in Bible reading because it enables you to read with understanding. Obtain your copy for $1. You will be glad you did.

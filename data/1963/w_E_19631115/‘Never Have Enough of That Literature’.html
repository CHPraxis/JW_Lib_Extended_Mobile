<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"> Two witnesses of Jehovah in Texas called at a prison to talk to the assistant warden. Their report says: “We sat and talked for about an hour. We asked if the prisoners needed some <em>Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>magazines to help them in their Bible reading and study. He promptly replied, ‘We never have enough of that type of literature. We would be glad to have it, and I will go to your car and bring it in.’ So we left seventy copies of <em>The Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>I asked about the <em>New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures </em>that we had left on a previous call. His reply: ‘It has just come back from the lower wing where it was widely used and now I am sending it to the upper wing where we have gotten a lot of requests for it.’ I asked him if the only copy was adequate for that unit, and he said, ‘They could use several more copies.’ The assistant warden spoke with keen appreciation for our calls and for the <em>New World Translation, </em>as well as the magazines. He stated that while in the air force he had read the literature while flying back and forth. We look forward to calling again at the prison.”</p>

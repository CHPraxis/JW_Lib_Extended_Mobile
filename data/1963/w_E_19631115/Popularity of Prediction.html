<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">◆ Reporting on the popularity of the art of prediction, an evidence of the operation of wicked spirit forces throughout the world (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:16:16-44:16:18" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Acts 16:16-18</a>), Léon Christiani writes in <em>Evidence of Satan in the Modern World: </em>“The present popularity of various forms of prediction is almost unbelievable. The following figures are given for all forms of fortune-telling in France: 6,000 practitioners registered with the police in Paris alone, and 60,000 for the whole of France, with an annual turnover estimated at, at least, 60 milliard francs. The ancient forms of divination . . . have given way to the cards, the lines of the hand, the study of coffee dregs and all kinds of other methods, all equally imposing. And, as in antiquity, there is still astrology, considered to be the most satisfactory way of foretelling human destiny. . . . We are none the less entitled to consider that the Devil is well satisfied with such aberrations, and that prediction, in its contemporary forms, is one of the devices of Satan to ensnare humanity.”</p>

Chapters and Verses in the Bible
About 1250 (A.D.) Cardinal Hugo de Sancto Caro divided the Bible into chapters. In 1545 Robert Stephens, a French printer, divided the Christian Greek Scriptures into verses. The first complete English Bible to have both chapter and verse numbers was the Geneva Bible, published in 1560. Most of the Bibles published today still use the same divisions.

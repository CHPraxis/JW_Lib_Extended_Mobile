FIELD MINISTRY
Everyone who has a knowledge of God’s Word has the responsibility to share its message with others. During February Jehovah’s witnesses will carry out that responsibility by offering to all persons a subscription for The Watchtower, with three booklets, for $1.
WATCH TOWER PUBLICATIONS INDEX, 1962
One of the most valuable features of The Watchtower is its use as a ready reference for answers to Bible questions. Thousands of interesting and vital points are highlighted throughout a year, yet you cannot possibly remember just where they all are to be found. Now, with the new Watch Tower Publications Index, 1962, you can find all the outstanding points published for the entire year, whether in The Watchtower, Awake! or the Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses. Send for your copy today and become acquainted with this rewarding aid in getting the most from your publications of the Watchtower Society. Send only 10c.

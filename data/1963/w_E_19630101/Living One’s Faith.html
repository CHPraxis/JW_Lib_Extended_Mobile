<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">✔ The Catholic column of the São Paulo, Brazil, newspaper <em>Diário da Regiāo </em>of June 15, 1962, urged Catholics to take their religion more seriously and proclaim it to others. Pointing to a modern-day example, it said: “We see in this respect the Jehovah’s Witnesses getting thirty times as many conversions as the Catholics. And why? Because each Witness is an apostle who sacrifices himself for the belief he professes; because he is not undermined by that false shame that the majority have to go from house to house advertising his faith.”</p>

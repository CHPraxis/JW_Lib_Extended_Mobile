<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sn"><strong>● Is extrasensory perception for Christians?</strong></p>

<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sn"><strong>● What is relative subjection?</strong></p>

<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sn"><strong>● What is the “human creation” to which Christians are to subject themselves?</strong></p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">A ruling office created by humans of this world or the one occupying such an office.—P. 660.</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sn"><strong>● To whom is “relative subjection” due?</strong></p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">It is due to husbands, parents, masters of slaves and political governments.—Pp. 665, 666.</p>

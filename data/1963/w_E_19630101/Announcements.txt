FIELD MINISTRY
Jesus Christ, who is the Ruler out of the House of Bread, has abundant provision of Bread to sustain the lives of all who seek Jehovah God. Distributing Bible-study publications that direct attention to this spiritual Bread supply is the privilege of his followers on earth. During January they will do this by offering a year’s subscription for The Watchtower, with three booklets, for $1.
1963 YEARBOOK AND CALENDAR
For years, one of the highlights of each year’s preaching activity for Jehovah’s witnesses has been the annual report of the Society’s president, the Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses. This year is no exception. And with good reason! The 1963 Yearbook contains one of the most gratifying reports to date. Over 142 million hours of zealous labors of love by 989,192 faithful ministers! And, as might be expected, all those hours have brought heart-stirring experiences. Read them. Send for the 1963 Yearbook. It is only 50c. Send also for the beautiful 1963 calendar depicting Jehovah’s deliverance. It is 25c.

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font0">The well-known Bible character Jonah is an example of one who experienced a rapid succession of severe reproofs. Could he take it? As you read the account in the Bible book bearing his name you may truly wonder. But, then, you recall that it was Jonah him</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font24" style="font-style:italic;">CattywiiaCeit?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">a mistake and were &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font0">reprimanded for it. How did you feel? Likely, a little disturbed, most of all with yourself, and that is quite natural, for ‘no discipline seems for the present to be joyous, but grievous; yet afterward ...” Ah, yes, afterward—that is the important thing. So how did you feel afterward? How do you feel now, for instance? Are you grateful that someone had the kindness and the courage to call your faults to your attention? Have you benefited from the reproof? Have you befriended your reprover more than ever before? Or, do you feel sorry for yourself, belittle the reproof by making excuses for yourself and avoid your reprover? Can you take reproof?—Heb. 12:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">If you find it difficult to take reproof it would be good for you to reflect seriously on the matter. One who does not readily respond to reproof may find himself being reproved repeatedly, perhaps severely so, and this can be very grievous indeed, both for the one reproved and for his loving reprover.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">self who wrote the record of how and why he was so reproved. Yes, at first he too was quite disturbed and engulfed in self-pity, yet afterward—and remember this is what matters—Jonah recaptured the proper perspective and he benefited by the reproof. ‘But,’ you may say, ‘Jonah’s reprimand came from God. He had no reason to object.’ Yes, it does seem that the reaction of some persons to reproof depends on who the reprover is. Whew they are inwardly reproved in their personal reading of the Bible or some publication that they regard as entirely authoritative, everything is just fine. They have no qualms about administering self-discipline in harmony with what is read. But let the very same words of counsel come from the lips of a close acquaintance and things change. There is a begrudging of the reproof, an inward or outward counteraccusation against the reprover, a harboring of animosity and an excusing of oneself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Is this the way things should be? Are not such persons failing to remember that most of the written counsel available to us on proper conduct and the Christian way of life has been transmitted through the services of imperfect humans? It is true that the Bible is an inspired book, but this cannot be said of other sources of reproof often readily accepted. Not inspiration, but God’s spirit, acquired through prayer and study, is frequently behind acceptable written sources of reproof. But can we not say </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">the same for </span><span class="font0">those closely associated with us, especially if they can point to the Word of God as the authority for the reproof they administer to us?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Bible abounds with examples showing the folly of adopting a “who are you </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">to be</span><span class="font0"> talking?” attitude. The danger of adhering to human thinking and a challenging frame of mind in our dealings with those around us can often minimize the amount of advice we are willing to apply to ourselves. In case of reproof, it can lead to turning a deaf ear to what is being said, because of concentrating on the one who is saying it. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Dismiss personalities from your </span><span class="font0">mind when being reproved. If the shoe fits, wear it. You may suffer some discomfort while the shoe of reproof is new, but, remember, “afterward to those who have been trained by it it yields peaceable fruit.”—Heb. 12:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Others may not impugn counsel and reproof but may brood over it and fall into a state of dismay and unnecessary loss of self-confidence. This is not taking reproof. In fact, although it may seem to indicate deep sorrow, it can lead to a defeating of the very purpose of reproof. Some develop wha t seems to be an almost perennial state of worry and an inability to dismiss the matter from their minds. The reprover may have had some very loving thoughts and expressions surrounding the reproof, but these are forgotten and lost to mind while the words of counsel are turned over and over in the mind, but not in a constructive way. It is like a person who sits and looks at a problem but does not do anything about it. He looks and looks, but all he sees is the problem, and the chances are that it is growing in his mind. What a waste of time it is! How much more upbuilding it is if one will simply try to see things in their true light, analyze and appraise the situation property and initiate corrective measures at the earliest possible moment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A defeatist frame of mind is not to be confused with the attitude of King David of Israel, another receiver of severe reproof administered through close acquaintances and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">subordinates.</span><span class="font0"> Was </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">David </span><span class="font0">grieved when reproved? Yes. But he was grieved because he had, indeed, taken his reproof to heart. He was not so much sorry </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">for</span><span class="font0"> himself as he was sorry </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">because </span><span class="font0">of himself and the way in which he had offended God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">But what can be done to recover proper </span><span class="font0">thinking when one becomes despondent because of having been reproved? Well, one of the first steps is a heart-to-heart talk with your reprover. So if you are severely disturbed because of reproof and you find that “yet afterward” the disturbance does </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">not leave you,</span><span class="font0"> talk </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">to your</span><span class="font0"> reprover; to the great Reprover, God, and to your immediate reprover, man. Your trouble is probably no more than a feeling that he no longer cares for you. But he does. God does. You may feel that your reprover misunderstands you, but perhaps you are the one who misunderstands him. The easiest course for him would have been to ignore your mistaken action or words, but he made himself do otherwise because of having your interests at heart. Do not tum away from such a friend.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">T</span><span class="font0">HE modem world is a strange para d o x. It shows intellectual brilliance in the field of science but madness in its social relations. It develops remarkable machines and drugs for saving lives and at the same time works feverishly to find ways to destroy lives. Its madness is reflected in the daily actions of the people in its many cities where crime, immorality and juvenile delinquency flourish despite the efforts of law-enforcing agencies. To maintain a clear mind that is not corrupted by the mad thinking of this world is not an easy task.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">When man stepped into the age of atomic power, his existence became threatened, not because of atomic power, but because of the world’s madness. Instead of wisely using atomic power for the good of mankind, the world insanely has used it to develop such awful weapons of destruction that its own existence is endangered. The misuse of that power by an irrational world is what has turned atomic power into what might be called a Frankenstein monster. A writer in the New York </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">World Telegram</span><span class="font0"> of November 2, 1962, made the following comment about the world’s mad thinking in this respect. He said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“Today the befuddlement seems much worse. I find myself asking questions like ‘Whatever happened to joy in living? Whatever happened to reverence for life? Are we fatally short on these qualities? Was our destiny after all merely selfdestruction?’ I read the pronouncements, but they don’t make sense. Yes, there’s a specious logic. There’s a demonstrable chain of cause and effect, if that’s any comfort. ... Do people really want to live? Or is every affront a fate worse than death? . . . Since 1945 a lot of our specialized knowledge has been about the fine art of destruction. Don’t we like our environment? . . . With all the wealth and knowledge and resources on both sides—or on every side—of the crises, the best we seem able to suggest is death, not life.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">What is wrong with the minds that can devise scientific miracles that benefit mankind and at the same time coldly invent devilish devices of mass destruction? What is wrong with the thinking that can justify the slaughtering of millions upon millions of people as well as the doing of permanent injury by radiation to millions more because heads of government cannot agree ? What is wrong with the thinking of men who advocate striking the first blow with nuclear weapons? Do they imagine that they can use such weapons without doing incalculable damage to their own nations?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The past forty-nine years have been for the world a period of trouble unparalleled in human history. During this time the nations of the world hurled themselves at one another in a mad frenzy of destruction on two occasions. These two world wars</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">snuffed out the lives of at least 35 million people. As if that madness were not enough, the world is now prepared to obliterate many times that number in a third world war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Frightful concentration camps made their appearance during this period in Germany, Russia and other countries. The revolting mistreatment given to the hordes of people herded into these camps has become a well-known fact. Only madness can explain the inhuman, sadistic treatment given to these unfortunate people.</span></p><a name="caption1"></a>
<h6><a name="bookmark17"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark18"></a>Morals</span></h6>
<p><span class="font0">The utter disregard the world has shown for the laws of God that place a high value on human life and require concern for the welfare of others is certain to be reflected in the morals of the people. Is it any wonder, then, that crime is skyrocketing the world over ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">During the past ten years crime has risen—in the United States, for example, 70 percent. It has persistently increased despite improved methods for fighting it. For the past five years it has been growing five times as fast as the population growth. Is it not madness that causes an ever-growing segment of a nation’s population to be involved in thievery, armed robbery, murder, rape, muggings and other forms of violence? Is it not madness when the public will assist a suspected criminal to escape from an arresting officer, as has been done frequently in New York city? There is something wrong with public thinking when people will interfere with the apprehension of a criminal who preys upon them and will throw bottles and bricks at the arresting policemen. What else but twisted thinking could approve disrespect for law and order?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A member of the San Francisco Police Commission observed: “We had a riot in the city hall. A large group of persons—a few of them Communists, most of them not Communists—being opposed to a committee established by the Congress of the United States, instead of proceeding against that committee by lawful means, took possession of our city hall, and there set up such a din of noise and disorder that public business in the hall had to be suspended. . . . They had to be removed by force, and in the process several law-enforcement officers were injured. And when that riot was over, I was amazed to find, and distressed and discouraged to find, that a large part of the citizenry actually ratified and approved what had happened there. What had happened was a violent rebellion against lawfully constituted civil authority in our city hall, the seat of our city government; and many citizens approved of it and disapproved of the police action which was necessitated by the rebellion.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">There is something drastically wrong with public thinking when it approves of mob violence and rebellion against civil authority. There are lawful and peaceful ways for expressing opposition to governmental decisions and actions rather than resorting to mob violence. Public resistance to the efforts ot civil authorities to maintain law and order injures the public themselves. It helps to breed criminals who prey upon them.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark20"></a>Effect on Young</span></h6>
<p><span class="font0">Reflecting the madness of the adult world, children are committing every crime imaginable. Over 40 percent of the major crimes in the United States are committed by children under eighteen years of age. In England 20 percent of the crimes of violence are committed by young men between seventeen and twenty-one. It is not uncommon to hear of children who kill their parents, of others who kill playmates and of still others who senselessly kill or injure the victims of their robberies. What these children are doing is what they see being done in the adult world, either in real life or in motion pictures and television. The world’s mad pursuit of pleasures, sex and materialism is a bad influence on young minds that have no sense of selfrestraint. The rising tide of juvenile delinquency is a somber testimony to this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The adult world sets a very poor example for the children who are being born into this world. How can it expect them to grow up to respect good standards of morality when it does not respect such standards? Is there not something warped in its thinking when it becomes so sophisticated that it regards immorality as the accepted way of life? How can wife swapping, marital infidelity, sex perversion and fornication be regarded as acceptable conduct? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Rather than being indicative of a healthy society, the existence of such practices and the increasingly tolerant attitude toward them reveals a very sick society. A doctor for the socially ill in Canada said: “Divorce, suicide, sex deviation and the growing number of people who take tranquilizers add to the depressing picture. Judging by evidence from these sources our society is very sick indeed.” According to Dr. Walter Alvarez in the United States, mental disorders affect more Americans than any other disease. In Britain nearly half the beds in hospitals are occupied by people being treated for mental disorders.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark21"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark22"></a>Maintain a Clear Mind</span></h6>
<p><span class="font0">A person must have a standard or source of guidance outside of himself in order to maintain mental balance and sane thinking in this mad world. This must be a standard that cannot be influenced by the world’s warped thinking and that does not drift with world conditions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The best standard a person could have for maintaining a level head in this mad world is found in God’s written Word, the Holy Bible. The degraded and twisted thinking of the world has no effect on it. Its laws and good counsel establish a high level of moral conduct that does not change, even though it clashes with popular practices or with sophisticated thinking. When a person feels the emotional tide around him in the world tugging at him so as to carry him along its way of abandonment, he has God’s Word that holds him firm and helps him to maintain his sense of balance and direction. It is a dependable, guiding light on his path of life. “Your word is a lamp to my foot, and a light to my roadway.”—Ps. 119:105.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">While the world becomes confused and frightened at what it sees coming upon it, God’s Word brings peace of mind to the one who trusts in its promises and follows its counsel and instructions. It provides him with a clear view of the future that puts his mind at rest and quiets any anxiety that might arise over what the nations are liable to do with their awful weapons of mass destruction. He is assured by it that God’s purposes for the earth cannot be thwarted by the madness of this world.—Phil. 4:8, 9; Isa. 55:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It is not easy to combat the influence of the world’s twisted thinking and of its way of living, but with the help of God’s Word this can be done. By striving for its high standards and by relying on its wisdom rather than on what seems right in your own eyes, you will be able to maintain a clear mind and a clear view of the best way to go despite the distorted thinking of the world. You will be able to look forward with confidence to the glowing future God has purposed for the earth and for mankind upon it.—Ps. 72:1-8.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font0">greatest assembly for redress of grievances ever witnessed in American history.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Seventy-four-year-old A. Philip Randolph, the man who </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">first suggested the March on Washington for</span><span class="font0"> Jobs and Freedom, called the giant demonstration “a sacred cause.” He declared it “a full-dress revolution, an inevitable outgrowth of the incompleteness of American history.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But what was the “revolution” to accomplish? What do the Negroes want? And what did they achieve by the march?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The road to Washington is long and well traveled by generations of crusaders. Some have been more successful than others. On March 3, 1913, Rosalie Jones’ band of suffragettes hiked down Washington’s Pennsylvania Avenue. They drew taunts and jeers from the crowds that packed the sidewalks. But the ladies came back again and again until finally they won what they were after—the right to vote.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The bonus march of 1932, however, ended in tragic failure. These were army men, veterans of World War I, who demanded immediate payment of war bonuses, averaging $50 to $100 a man. They too marched down Pennsylvania Avenue. They even camped in some of the government’s vacant buildings. But the bonus bill failed. With tear gas, tanks and fixed bayonets, these war veterans were driven back into despair.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But the 1963 march for “Jobs and</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">after the adoption of the Constitution of the United States and 173 years after the signing of the Bill of Rights, America, “the land of the free and the home of the brave,” still faces a racial* crisis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">On August 28 an impressive throng of some 200,000 Negro and white Americans, in a march on </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">the nation’s capital, Washington,</span><span class="font0"> D.C., proclaimed to the nation and the world that they were still waiting for the fulfillment of these promised rights and freedoms. This demonstration was the</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font0">Freedom” promised to be different. First of all, it was well planned, superbly organized and perfectly timed. In recent years Negro demonstrations and grievances have become well known to the world. The beatings, riots and photographs of police dogs and fire hoses used against people have </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">caused American prestige </span><span class="font0">to suffer. Especially have the Russian, African and Asian people become acutely shocked by the pictures of brutality. As Dr. Gordon W. Allport, Harvard professor</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">of psychology, has said; AH over the world, the United States has been “knocked off the pedestal.” The American image as a freedom lover has suffered badly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The march on Washington, therefore, was viewed with no small measure of apprehension by the nation’s leaders. Every precaution was taken to prevent any outbreak of violence. More than 6,000 police, parade marshals and military police were deployed throughout the city. Some 4,000 fully equipped army troops were kept on alert at two nearby bases. The sale of all alcoholic beverages, including beer and wine, was banned. All street parking was forbidden in the downtown area. Signs read: ‘‘Emergency. No Parking After 12:01 Wednesday, Aug. 28, 1963.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">On that day Washington appeared poised. The downtown streets were almost deserted. The city took on an appearance of a “ghost town.” Many shops were closed. Washingtonians, for the most part, stayed home and waited.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark23"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark24"></a>The March</span></h6>
<p><span class="font0">From dawn’s early light ■ Negroes and whites poured into the city from every part of the United States. They came by buses, autos and airplanes. Hundreds walked and a few even roller-skated their way in. The marchers came with plenty of water, sandwiches and low-heeled shoes. They brought raincoats, hats and sunglasses, but left their children home, as they were told. Every now and then a hush fell over a group as ministers offered prayers. “Help us, O Lord,” prayed one clergyman, “that we not disgrace ourselves this day.” Overhead the sky was a deep blue, and below a gentle 84 degrees made the weather ideal for the occasion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">At 11:15 a.m., when the march officially began, the inpouring was tremendous. On and on they came, walking about twenty abreast. The great crush of humanity, some 200,000 strong, did not so much march as they strolled along in quiet, loose-flowing formation, singing freedom songs, waving Bibles and placards. Like a giant lava flow they surged down Independence and Constitution Avenues to gather around the Lincoln Memorial. Suddenly, they broke out in the soft, mournful strains—“Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord.” Later they switched to “We Shall Overcome.” And still later to “Freedom, Freedom, Freedom!” Nearby were a number of congressmen witnessing this momentous event.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark25"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark26"></a>The Theme: Freedom Note!</span></h6>
<p><span class="font0">But there was a hard, impatient warning in their signs, hymns and cheers. The march signs, which waved like windblown reeds, said: “We demand voting rights now!” “We march for first-class citizenship now!” “We march for integrated schools now!” “We seek the freedom in 1963 promised in 1863!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The speeches by Negro leaders reflected the same note of impatience. The era of “the tranquilizing drug of gradualism” is past, were the shouts. Freedoms are wanted “Now!” Director A. P. Randolph warned that this is “only the first wave. . . . We shall return again and again, to Washington in ever-growing numbers, until total freedom is ours.” Speaker Walter P. Reuther, president of the United Automobile Workers Union, declared: “It is the responsibility of every American to share the impatience of the Negro Americans.” “This rally is not the end,” he shouted, “it’s the beginning.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The fiery speeches ripped into the inequalities and exposed the hypocrisies of modern American life, but they failed to set the multitude afire. The old crusading zeal did not show itself until Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., founder and president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, cried aloud his dreams: “Now'is the time to make real the promises of democracy.” “There will be neither rest nor tranquillity in America,” he exclaimed, “until the Negro is granted his citizenship rights.” When he finished, there were cries: “Make him the next president.”</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark27"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark28"></a>Religious Support</span></h6>
<p><span class="font0">The program that began with the invocation by Archbishop Patrick O’Boyle of Washington; that featured a prayer by Rabbi Yu Miller, president of the Synagogue Council of America, which represents all branches of Judaism; that offered speeches by Matthew Ahmann, executive director of the National Catholic Conference for Interracial Justice, Eugene Carson Blake of the National Council of Churches and vice-chairman of the Commission on Race Relations of the National Council of Churches of Christ in America, and Rabbi Joachim Prinz, president of the American Jewish Congress, and a benediction by Dr. Benjamin E, Mays, president, Morehouse College, Atlanta; plus the hymns and Negro spirituals that were sung —this program had all the earmarks and atmosphere of a gigantic interfaith rally.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">At least five of the “Big Ten” that headed the demonstration were prominent religious leaders. On the platform were seated thirty-four other ministers and lay representatives of religious groups. An estimated 40,000 church and synagogue members, led by 200 religious leaders, participated in the march. Many of these carried placards that said: “We march together—Catholic, Protestant and Jew—for dignity and brotherhood of </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">all men</span><span class="font0"> under God. Now.'” “God of wisdom, God of power, can America deny freedom in this hour?” The revival spirit visibly moved Roy Wilkins, executive secretary of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, to cry aloud to the multitude: “You’ve got religion here today. Don't backslide tomorrow.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">This strange mixture of religion, politics and Hollywood, spiced with promises, hopes, votes and rights, permeated the two-and-a-half-hour program. After a plea from the leaders for everyone to go home peacefully and to &quot;continue the civil rights revolution in every nook and cranny of the land until victory” is won, until “freedom [rings] from every hamlet and every village in the country,” the demonstration ended and the demonstrators went home. Within 90 minutes the 21 special trains were on their way to the four points of the compass and the 1,500 special buses were rolling in ail directions. </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Washington</span><span class="font0"> quickly returned to its former ways.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark29"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark30"></a>The Aftermath</span></h6>
<p><span class="font0">The march was over. It was peaceful and orderly, but was it a success? Few would deny that the Negro made his point. Millions, no doubt, were compelled to take a new look at the Negro, his problem and determination. Senator Kenneth B. Keating of New York called the march “an amazing demonstration of the feeling of Negroes and non-Negroes for civil rights legislation.” Senator Hubert H. Humphrey, assistant Senate Leader, told newsmen that the demonstration probably </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">had not </span><span class="font0">changed any votes, but “it’s a good thing for Washington and the nation and the world.” Dr. Ralph J. Bunche, an undersecretary of the United Nations, hailed the march as “a tremendous occasion, and a profoundly historic one.” He stated: “The number of white persons in </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">the crowd </span><span class="font0">[some 20,000] is a splendid thing.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">After the march a group of Negro leaders conferred with President Kennedy for seventy-five minutes. The president said: “The cause of 20,000,000 Negroes has been advanced” by the orderly demonstration. He assured the leadens that </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">he would push </span><span class="font0">for equal job opportunities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">From other parts of the world came reports of support. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Izvestia,</span><span class="font0"> the Soviet government newspaper, placed the news of the civil rights march on page one. It said: “The men fighting for their human dignity will never turn aside.” The British press gave the march major headlines. And it was the most publicized foreign domestic event in France. Other nations also expressed solidarity with the marchers.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark31"></a><span class="font0"><a name="bookmark32"></a>2Vot </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">All Marched</span></h6>
<p><span class="font0">Not to be overlooked is the fact that not all Negroes and whites supported the march. Why not? Some say it is not because they do not believe in civil rights, equal job opportunities and justice for all, for a greater number of them do. Many of these nonsupporters are Christians who maintain Christianity forbids the participating in interfaith movements. The principle cited is: “Do not become unevenly yoked with unbelievers.” (2 Cor. 6:14) Since the march was obviously an interfaith movement, governed and supported by a number of religions that hold conflicting views, and, by their own admission, have “failed to put their own house in order,” participation with them in their affairs, they say, is repulsive to the Christian, an act of hypocrisy to be shunned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Secondly, they argue that Christians are under command not to be a part of this world and that the demonstration was in every way, shape and form a child of this world. It had the support of politicians, the backing of the entertainment world and the blessing of worldly religions. The words of Jesus Christ are cited: “My kingdom is no part of this world.” (John 18:36; 17:16) And as a clincher, the disciple James’ words are quoted, which state that “friendship with the world” is enmity with God, “Whoever, therefore, wants to be a friend of the world is constituting himself an enemy of God.”—Jas. 4:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Thirdly, they object strongly to the twisting of Scripture texts and their meaning to fit the fancies of men. Justice and righteousness, they argue, are truly to flow someday, but not as a result of any man or organization of men, but by the direct intervention and blessing of God Almighty. The psalmist is quoted as support: “Righteousness and peace—they have kissed each other. Trueness itself will sprout out of the very earth, and righteousness itself will look down from the very heavens. Also, Jehovah, for his part, will give what is good.”—Ps. 85:10-12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">And, finally, the pledge that climaxed the freedom march, which says: I pledge “my heart and my mind and my body, unequivocally and without regard to personal sacrifice, to the achievement of social peace through social justice.” They view such a pledge as being in direct conflict to the greatest of all commandments, as stated by Jesus Christ, namely: “You must love Jehovah your God with your whole heart and with your whole soul and with your whole mind.” (Matt. 22:37) How could one, therefore, exclusively dedicated to God conscientiously take the pledge?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">So, while some may feel it their duty to demonstrate in behalf of civil rights, others, for conscientious reasons, abstain. Not that they believe or uphold &quot;gradualism” or “segregation,” but, rather, they believe that these rights and freedoms can and will ultimately come to mankind in all their reality only by means of the kingdom of God, for the Great Jehovah will open his hand and satisfy “the desire of every living thing.” (Ps. 145:16; Matt. 6:9, 10) Who can deny this? Meanwhile, what? Faith in the One who caused these words to be written: “The desire of those fearing him he will perform, end their My for help he will hear, and he will save them.”—Ps. 145:19.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">TRUTH AVERTS SUICIDES</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">A woman witness of Jehovah in Michigan reported this experience: &quot;Another Witness and I made a call on a lady who was very despondent, so much so that she was threatening suicide. The only reason why she let us in was that she has a niece who is one of Jehovah's witnesses. She realized how her niece has been helped to overcome many problems by studying the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">&quot;When we found her, she was in such a condition that she did not have enough spark in her to comb her hair. Even the simple household duties seemed like mountains to her. Her minister made matters worse by telling her that she was only imagining this condition. As a result she was trying to drown out her problems by using alcoholic beverages. She felt nothing could help her, but she let me come back anyway. The first topic we discussed from the Bible was, Who is responsible for the trouble in the world? She learned what God’s Word says about Satan the Devil. She learned how it is possible to make one’s mind over and put on a ‘new personality,’ She wanted to drink in the ‘water of life.’—Rev. 22:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">“She then started talking to others about the Bible, because she appreciated so much how God’s truth had helped her. Some would say, ‘Who are you to talk about the Bible? Look at your condition.’’ She would answer, ‘It is the sick that need a physician; Jehovah’s witnesses are helping me to do better.’ Shortly after she started to study the Bible, she was able to help a man who was very depressed. He told her that he was carrying a gun in his car, waiting for the right time to use it on himself. Right away she told him that she had felt the same way, but Jehovah’s witnesses had helped her. He is now studying with one of the Witnesses. As for the lady who had been so despondent, she is now a very happy person. Instead of using alcoholic beverages to try to make her happy, she is imbibing the 'water of life,’ God’s truths.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">A SEARCH FOR TRUTH</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">In Japan a man who had been sick for a long time was told by doctors that there was nothing they could do for him. Friends advised him to join the “PL&quot; (Perfect Liberty) organization, assuring him that this would</span></p>

<p><span class="font19">cure his troubles. But he could not find satisfaction there. When he asked one of the teachers who God is, he was told that the person who dares to ask such a question thinks too deeply. From then on he stopped going to that organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">Next he turned to Tenrikyo (Teachings concerning the Wisdom of the Heavens). He had to pay 15,000 yen ($42) as an entry fee. Every day he studied its lessons and learned how to do its ceremonial dance. Though he lived at headquarters, he could not get a satisfactory answer to the question, Who Is the true God?</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">Leaving that organization, he next joined one of Christendom’s churches. He thought the Bible a wonderful book compared with other religious books, and he was convinced it was from God. It was not long, however, before he began to find contradictions in the church. The question concerning the true God was not made clear. He kept going to the church, though not fully satisfied.</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">One Sunday morning he happened to be at home. It was then that one of Jehovah's witnesses called on him. This Witness explained fully about the true God, Jehovah, and his purposes. The man asked for all the literature published by the Society. He went to the Kingdom Hall to obtain this literature. Since then he has not missed meetings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">His wife, who had been so obedient and gone to whatever organization he had chosen, was at this time unaccountably opposed. One day she left him. However, he wrote her a letter, telling her that he had found the truth and wanted to serve the true God. Later he was informed that his wife had attempted to commit suicide. He rushed to the hospital and begged her to come home with him. Then she told him that she would go home only on condition that he would not make her join his religion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">One day some of the women Witnesses came to his home, and, as a meeting was to be held that night at the Kingdom Hall, these women kindly encouraged his wife to attend. She did. Ever since that time all his family have been attending the meetings. Now all of them are dedicated to the true God, Jehovah; and not only has the husband found answers to his questions, but he recently became the pre-siding minister of a local congregation.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">posts with a system of safe, rapid travel. Instead of being linked by narrow ribbons of concrete or rails of steel, Colombia’s states are bound into a republic by effective airways.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark37"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark38"></a>Early Beginnings</span></h6>
<p><span class="font0">Of such importance has been aviation that Colombia can date the beginning of her modern progress from the day she tried on her</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">T</span><span class="font0">HE Roman Empire thundered her way into history on the hoofbeats of her mighty legions; so she earned the title “nation on horseback.” In modern times the United States has been labeled the “nation on wheels,” and anyone who has traveled her multilaned freeways or crowded city streets will understand why. The British Empire, on the other hand, became powerful because she “ruled the waves.” In still other parts of the world, such as the South American republic of Colombia, natural barriers have forced man to take to the air.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Much of the earth’s surface can be compared to the smooth surface of a plum, where transportation is a relatively simple matter of laying down a highway or a railroad; but Colombia resembles more the wrinkled prune. With three rugged ranges of the Andes mountains thrusting their way past the clouds, and with steaming, almost impenetrable jungle to be dealt with, the building of railroads and highways in many sections is almost impossible. Aviation became the logical solution, binding together the nation’s farthest outfirst pair of wings. Nearly a decade before Charles Lindbergh awoke the imagination of the world to the possibilities of commercial aviation, Colombia formed the Western Hemisphere’s first airline. The year was 1919. The first plane was a far cry from the shining aluminum air giants of today. It was just a singleengined German Junkers, so underpowered that, with its water-cooled motor boiling over from the effort, it was barely able to climb over the mountains on its route. However, improvements in equipment and service followed in the course of the years. To the people long accustomed to travel by burro, canoe, riverboat and horseback, the coming of aviation was indeed a blessing. Not long ago, for example, a businessman on the coast who wanted to travel to Bogota, the mountain-locked capital city of the country, had a most trying journey. The one-way grind by riverboat plus several short rail links lasted about ten days. Today the same trip takes a mere two hours by air, at a fraction of the cost.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Speaking of cost, it is of interest to note that the air fares in Colombia are among the lowest in the world. Knowing how much aviation is doing for the country, the government is anxious to keep air fares low, within the reach of the majority. Fortunately this is not done at the expense of safety. The nation has had its share of accidents, but, on the average, its record is an enviable one. Avianca, the government-controlled airline, has repeatedly been presented safety awards by international aviation groups. Interested in seeing Colombia someday? You will find your travel expenses low here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">However, it would be impossible to set a dollars and cents value on the good that has come to the Colombian people on wings. Isolated outposts, rural villages and even large cities of nearly a half million population that previously were walled off from the world by natural barriers now conduct trade with the four corners of the earth by air. Were it not for aviation, would these cities have grown? Could they have produced and contributed to the welfare of the nation as a whole? Government officials think not.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark39"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark40"></a>Light Planes</span></h6>
<p><span class="font0">Mention the word “airplane’* and the average person draws a mental picture of that four-engined giant found on the travel folder, or the majestic jet that adorns the airline billboard. But progress in Colombia is more a story of light aircraft than it is of the heavy commercial giants. You may </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">be </span><span class="font0">surprised at the jobs they can do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A few years ago the cotton crop in Colombia was very small, limited to a fraction of what the nation needed, and that by a seemingly tremendous obstacle: insects and diseases that invade the crop periodically. Research has shown that almost five hundred varieties of insects find cotton irresistible as a steady diet. So it is easily seen that the difference between profit and loss in cotton farming is a matter of insect control. That means crop dusting. But by hand it was a slow and costly process. For that reason for many years the country was forced to supplement its cotton supply by purchasing from other nations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Why not put her wings to work? Small planes, flying twelve to eighteen inches above the crop at seventy miles an hour were able to do in three hours what previously required days or weeks! Production from an acre of land shot up from a half ton of cotton to three tons. Whole new sections of the country sprang into life. The textile mills began to hum a new tune, and the treasury showed decided improvement. Thousands of men found employment in various phases of the expanding industry. New life was injected into the struggling economy of the nation. All these benefits came on the wings of a few dozen planes!</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark41"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark42"></a>Varied Uses</span></h6>
<p><span class="font0">If it worked with cotton, why not with cattle? On the eastern </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">llanos,</span><span class="font0"> or plains, the problem of transportation was a serious one even though the land is flat. Getting the cattle to market was no small task; it frequently required from four to eight weeks on the trail, during which time a healthy steer would lose about four pounds of weight a day. A herd of one hundred head of cattle could lose more than two thousand dollars’ worth of weight on the way!</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Today the steers cover the distance in two or three hours instead of eight weeks, and they arrive at cattle centers in top condition because of riding in style in DC-3 aircraft Everyone is contented. The seller gets top prices. The buyer gets much better meat. And the Colombian people, who consume some two million head of cattle a year, have the “fatted calf” delivered to them on the versatile wings of their air fleet</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In yet another region of the country a different problem needed solving. One of Colombia’s principal railroads, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">el ferroca-ril del AtlAntico,</span><span class="font0"> was being built along the Magdalena River, which drains the land between two ranges of the Andes in central Colombia. Engineers had to travel to and from the construction site, samples of concrete pourings had to be speedily tested for strength, and sick or injured workers needed immediate medical attention. All these jobs, serious obstacles twenty years ago, were cared for in a routine fashion by light planes that landed on short sections of the future roadbed. The completion of this railroad was another giant step forward for the nation, and it was greatly helped by small planes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Colombian coffee is famous the world over for its full, rich flavor, and is understandably the nation’s major export. Some years ago the coffee would begin its journey to your breakfast table on the back of a sure-footed burro. But bandits soon found it a profitable business to gain control of the mule trails in some parts of the coffee-producing land, making a handsome, if dishonest, living hijacking the coffee shipments. The coffee growers solved their difficulty by flying out the sacks of precious beans in light planes. As a result the bandits were forced to move on to other parts for lack of business.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">These few instances that have been mentioned are just a beginning. There are still large areas of this beautiful country undeveloped, even unexplored. Beneath the lush green foliage of the endless jungles lie untapped resources of gas and oil. Buried in her towering mountains are vast deposits of minerals. You can be sure that aviation will play a part in the location and development of these valuable natural resources, for they are almost always located in places inaccessible to other means of transportation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Has aviation been a help to all Colombian people, or just the wealthy? Ask the family living on the eastern plains who receive their mail in four hours instead of eight weeks. Has aviation been appreciated in Colombia? Listen to the parents of a little girl in Choco, near Panama, whose life was saved by the doctor who could arrive in two hours instead of two weeks. It would be difficult to imagine where this country would, be without its versatile wings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Other countries may be better developed; many are richer. But, undoubtedly, none owe more of their progress to aviation than Colombia. Literally true is the saying, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">“Colombia ha pasada de la mula al avion”</span><span class="font0"> (“Colombia has passed from the mule to the airplane.”) Her states, long isolated from one another, her lonely cities and towns, long unproductive and poor, are bound together by the invisible yet powerful bands of her airways, giving her just claim to the title “nation on wings.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Is This Americanism?</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">Said a “Citizen of the Year”: “If I have anyone to thank for what I do today, in the area of Americanism, it is my dad. He would be known today as a ‘superpatriot.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">“In Lincoln Park in Chicago they used to have parades on Sunday mornings and dad used to take the children to see them. , . . The American flag was passing by, the hats were off and arms across the chest, when dad looked over to the man next to him, who hadn’t taken off his hat. My dad nearly knocked the man to the ground with a blow across the chest with his forearm as he demanded, ‘Take off your hat. That is the flag of our country.’ The man didn’t have to take his hat off. Dad had knocked it off. You can imagine what an inspiration in Americanism this was to a kid 8 or 9 years old.”—The </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Congressional Record,</span><span class="font19"> September 13, 1962.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">A</span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">beam</span><span class="font0"> of light lasting only one-thousandth of a second is able to bum a hole in a thin sheet of tempered steel. It can even vaporize a hole in a diamond, the hardest substance known. This incredible feat has been done repeatedly in recent laboratory experiments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Light is not usually regarded as being capable of drilling holes in superhard substances. Its gentle rays from the sun, a room light or a flashlight give no suggestion of its fantastic power. Even when a magnifying glass causes sunlight to burn paper, a person is not led to the conclusion that light can burn a hole in a diamond. Yet, a device that is a little larger than a flashlight can concentrate light to such an extent that a brief flash can produce temperatures of many thousands of degrees.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The fact that light is radiant energy should help a person to realize that concentrated light has power. It is part of a continuous range of phenomena called electromagnetic radiation. Included in this range or spectrum are the various types of radiant energy used for radar, TV and radio communications.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Each type of electromagnetic radiation is made up of waves. One complete wave at a given frequency is called a photon and it varies in length according to the type of energy being given off.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The wavelengths of the different types of electromagnetic radiation range from the astoundingly long waves of radiation recently discovered in outer space that are as much as 18,600,000 miles long to very short gamma rays that are .005 angstroms long. An angstrom is a unit of length that is one ten-millionths of a millimeter on the metric scale of measurement. It is used for measuring infinitesimally short </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">l</span><span class="font0"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;electromagnetic waves. Light is</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Fwl N </span><span class="font0">near this end of the spectrum </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">L rA </span><span class="font0">where the waves of energy are so short that they must be measured in angstrom units. It is only a small 'segment of the whole electromagnetic spec-tnW</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark43"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark44"></a>Coherent\Light</span></h6>
<p><span class="font0">The pow!h\of light is not generally evident, due to tnbsfact that ordinary light is not coherent. Its waves are not in step or in phase with the crests of parallel waves passing a given point at the same time. Instead, they radiate at random, interfering with one another. There is also a mixture of waves having different lengths. These are the many colors that go to make ordinary white light.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">When only one wavelength or color of light is amplified and caused to move in parallel waves, the astonishing energy of light can be displayed in such spectacular ways as burning holes in steel, sapphires and diamonds. Such light can be spoken of as coherent light. Its waves travel in the same direction and are all the same length,</span></p><img src="g_E_19631108_files/g_E_19631108-9.png" alt="" style="width:203pt;height:95pt;">
<p><span class="font0">with their crests passing a given point at the same time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Unlike a beam of incoherent light that rapidly spreads out as it travels from its source, a beam of coherent light moves as a compact beam with very little spread. When a twelve-inch beam of it was shot through a telescope to the moon in 1962, the spread of the beam was only about two-thirds of an inch for each mile it traveled. After covering about 238,000 miles, it was only two miles in diameter when it struck the moon. If it were possible to send an incoherent beam of light from a searchlight that far, the beam would be about 25,000 miles wide when it reached the moon’s surface.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The intensity of a beam of coherent light is so great that its brightness exceeds that of the sun by a million times. Serious eye damage was accidentally experienced by a researcher when he was struck by a pencil-thin beam of it while one mile from its source. A flash of such light in a twelve-inch beam, lasting only one-thousandth of a second, could be seen with the naked eye 20 million miles away.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark45"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark46"></a>How Made Coherent</span></h6>
<p><span class="font0">It was in 1960 that the American researcher Dr. Theodore H. Maiman produced the first beam of coherent light. The heart of his device was a pink, synthetic ruby rod about the length of your little finger. When a strong light was directed into the ruby, an intense beam of coherent red light flashed out one end of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The device that produced this unusual beam of light is called a laser. For proper pronunciation of this name substitute a “z” for the “s.” It sounds like “blazer.” The name stands for fight amplification by stimulated emission of radiation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The operation of a laser is based upon a principle discovered by Dr. Charles Townes in 1954. He found that when high-energy atoms are hit by microwaves of the same frequencies, the microwaves would be significantly reinforced or amplified by the energy given off by the excited atoms. He called his device a maser, which stands for microwave amplification by stimulated emission of radiation. The medium he used was ammonia gas, because it is rich in high-energy atoms. In 1958 Dr. Townes and Dr. Arthur Schawlow proposed that a maser for optical wavelengths could be designed. This Dr. Maiman successfully did when he produced his ruby laser.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In a ruby laser, each end of the rod is polished and silvered so that the light waves stimulated in the rod will be reflected from the ends. One end is silvered heavily and the other only lightly. Encircling the ruby rod are the coils of an electronic flashtube. An intense flash of light from the tube raises some of the atoms in the ruby to an excited state. As an atom drops down from this state it emits a wave or photon of electromagnetic energy. This wave falls in phase with the wave that caused it to be released and strengthens it. As these waves travel through the ruby they excite other atoms that, in turn, give off waves that fall in phase with the other waves and strengthen them still more. When the waves of radiant energy reach the end of the rod, the mirrored end reflects them back through the rod, where they excite the atoms again. Reaching the other end, they are reflected again by that mirrored end. Finally, this process proceeds to the point where the light is so greatly amplified that it bursts through the slightly silvered end of the rod as a beam of intense coherent light of one color and with every wave in phase. The process takes only a fraction of a second.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark47"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark48"></a>Types of Lasers</span></h6>
<p><span class="font0">The intense research that has been done on coherent light has resulted in a variety of lasers, producing coherent light in different wavelengths. Gases, liquids, plastic and various crystals are being used successfully.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A tube with mirrored ends and containing a mixture of helium and neon gases is being used to produce a beam of coherent light in the infrared region of the spectrum. Its light is a continuous beam, whereas the solid-state lasers, such as the ruby, for the most part, give </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">off brief pulses of</span><span class="font0"> light. Much less energy is required to activate or pump the gas laser. Instead of using light waves from a flashtube, energy is applied to the neon atoms by collisions with excited helium atoms, which are brought to a state of excitement by a radio frequency exciter attached to the glass tube containing the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">gases.</span><span class="font0"> The light waves given off by the neon gas are amplified as they bounce back and forth between the mirrored ends of the tube. The excited helium atoms keep recharging the neon atoms, causing a continuous beam of coherent light.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The first solid-state laser that was made to operate continuously was a trumpetshaped crystal, only one inch long. The trumpet end was a synthetic sapphire grown together with a synthetic ruby. Light from a mercury lamp was focused on the trumpet-shaped end. The sapphire funneled it into the ruby, concentrating it sixfold. The result was greatly increased efficiency in activating the atoms of the ruby to a high energy state. The use of many other types of artificially grown crystals promise further improvements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Crystals known as semiconductors are said to be from twenty-five to a hundred times as efficient as the ruby and gas lasers. They also open up the possibility of imposing a signal on a laser beam so that the beam can be used for communications. The input energy is an electric current rather than from an intense light source.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark49"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark50"></a>Communications</span></h6>
<p><span class="font0">By being able to send communications on beams of light, man will be able to solve the mounting problem of overcrowded telephone cables. In 1962 transatlantic telephone cables and radio circuits carried about 4 million international phone calls. These calls, it is estimated, will increase to about 100 million by 1980. One laser light beam is theoretically capable of carrying this fantastic number of calls simultaneously, whereas present transatlantic cables are limited to a hundred calls at a time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Like telephone cables, the radio spectrum is also crowded. Here too laser light beams can help. One beam could theoretically carry as much information as all radio communication channels in existence. </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">This</span><span class="font0"> immense carrying capacity is </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">due to </span><span class="font0">the very short wavelength of light, which causes it to have a high frequency or high number of oscillations per second. That part of the electromagnetic spectrum between 4,000 and 7,000 angstrom units, the region of visible light, could carry about 80 million television channels.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">With its tremendous capacity for carrying information, laser beams would prove to be of incalculable value as communication links between points on the earth and between the earth and satellites or space probes. They have the desirable feature of not being subject to static because they stay faithfully on </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">one frequency. A big </span><span class="font0">disadvantage, however, is the inability of light beams to penetrate clouds and fog. To overcome this problem, metal or glass tubes would have to be laid across countries, continents and oceans, through which laser beams could travel unimpeded. Mirrors would have to be used to bend them around cornel’s and over </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">hills.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Before light beams can be used for communication, researchers must first devise a satisfactory way of imposing a signal on the beam. In the case of radio, a smooth, unvarying radio beam, called a carrier wave, is used. By varying this radio beam, such </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;text-decoration:underline;">as</span><span class="font0"> in its strength, it can be made to carry a person’s voice. A radio receiver picks up the broadcast and detects these variations and causes a loudspeaker to vibrate accordingly, reproducing the person’s voice. In the same manner a light beam can be used as a carrier wave of a signal by causing it to vary in its intensity. Different methods are being devised to do this, but they are only in an experimental stage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In a recent laboratory test a television signal was impressed upon the infrared beam of a gas laser. A sensitive lightdetecting device at the other end of the beam responded to the beam’s slight variations in intensity. From it an electrical signal was sent to a television set where the picture was reproduced with good quality.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The fact that electricity can be passed through semiconductor crystals makes it possible to impose a signal on a laser beam. By modulating or varying the electrical current, a signal can be sent into the crystal, causing it to vary the intensity of a laser beam passing through it or originating from it. But much research must yet be done before lasers can be introduced into modern systems of communications.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">One of the reasons why a laser beam can be made to produce tremendously high temperatures is that it can be focused by lenses to a very small point, smaller than the edge of a surgeon’s scalpel. By using a lens with a focal length of one centimeter a beam can be focused to a spot only one-hundredth of a centimeter in diameter, delivering power at a density of 100 million watts per square centimeter.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark51"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark52"></a>Possible Uses</span></h6>
<p><span class="font0">Lasers can be made into superaccurate measuring devices, used as scalpels in delicate surgery, designed to measure the distance of objects, fashioned into weapons, employed as welders, and so on. The relative of the laser, the microwave maser, can be used as a clock with a variation of only one second in three million years. The possible uses for lasers and masers are truly astonishing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">These remarkable devices have opened up a new field of research that is just beginning to be scratched. It is a vast field with almost limitless possibilities. Contemplating this with regard to the laser, or optical maser, Dr. Arthur L. Schawlow, one of the developers of the maser, wrote: “With the advent of the optical maser, man’s control of light has reached an entirely new level. Indeed, one of the most exciting prospects for workers in this field is that this new order of control will open up uses for light that are as yet undreamed of.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The latent power of light, if wisely used, can be of real service to mankind. In addition to the benefits already envisioned, it can open a door to new knowledge about the creative works of the One who gave light its tremendous power.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">4£TyTHY do you want to go there? You’ll </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">W </span><span class="font0">just see a lot of old stuffed animals and dried bones!” &quot;I went there as a child, and I can still see that huge dinosaur in the entrance. I wonder if it is still there.” “Really, you should not miss it-^a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">must</span><span class="font0"> on every tourist’s visit to Argentina.” “The best museum in South America.” “One of the best natural history museums in the world.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Such were the conflicting reports that ran through my mind as I approached the entrance to the Museum of La Plata in Buenos Aires province, Argentina. Set in the quiet woodlands of Iraola Park, a part of the campus of the University of La Plata, this institution of public interest and higher learning, since its founding in 1877, has made a sizable contribution to scientific research in Argentina and is recognized as one of the principal scientific centers in Latin America.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark59"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark60"></a>“But, Is It the Best?”</span></h6>
<p><span class="font0">That is the question I posed. My genial host and self-appointed guide, Dr. Mario Teruggi, professor of petrology, sedimentation and mineralogy at the University of La Plata, had a ready answer. “Best in what sense? At most, best is only a comparative term. Many museums excel us in many fields. However, from the standpoint of quality of certain collections, our exhibition rooms devoted to fossil and extinct South American mammalia and to Peruvian and Argentinian archaeology are not only celebrated but unrivaled throughout the world.” With such an introduction, I was anxious to see these famed collections.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">During the Spanish colonial rule four complete skeletons of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">megatherium</span><span class="font0"> were unearthed in what is now Buenos Aires province. The remains of these giant ground sloths, the largest mammal besides the elephant, caused such interest that the viceroy sent one skeleton to the king of Spain. It is reported that the king was so delighted with the gift that he requested that a live specimen be sent! The three remaining skeletons are the property of the La Plata museum. Also of great importance in the section devoted to Argentine fossil mammals are the skeletons and carapaces of the giant armadillos. Credit for the almost perfect preservation of these fossils must go to the ideal climatic conditions found in Argentina, especially in the cold, arid regions of the Pampas, Patagonia, and western Argentina. Also, before leaving the section of fossil mammals, one should not miss the fossils of aquatic mammals, with an exhibit of the entire skeletal structure of whales.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark61"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark62"></a>Living Fauna of South America</span></h6>
<p><span class="font0">If bones are not your particular interest, perhaps the fine collection of actual living fauna, or animals, of South America will interest you. Alongside exhibits of the cat family, there is a well-known South American label, the guanaco, and his close relative the llama, more commonly called the “camel of the Andes.” How high they hold their heads!</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The order of rodents comprises the most numerous group of all mammals. Several real-life scenes depicting the rodent in his natural habitat catch our attention as we pass by. There is the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">mulita</span><span class="font0"> family (a smaller version of the armadillo) together with its burrow and the female giving suck to her young; and the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">vizcacha</span><span class="font0"> (similar in form to a prairie dog or hare), which in its dressed form frequently graces the dinner table of families living in the interior provinces of Argentina.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark63"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark64"></a>Birds and Bees</span></h6>
<p><span class="font0">Birds and bird nests next attract our attention, and remembering that we are in Argentina, we first examine the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">home-</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">ro</span><span class="font0"> (so named because its nest resembles a mud oven), the national bird, then the giant condor of the Andes, residing in the cordillera from Colombia to the Argentine Patagonia. Another exhibit includes birds with the most colorful plumage—every hue of the rainbow, from vibrant tones to softer pastels. A noted Argentine-born bird lover and naturalist who later lived in England wrote many volumes on Argentine fauna; the birds that he described are contained in a special showcase entitled Antarctic, we are not surprised to see those well-known residents of that frigid land, Mr. Penguin and his family.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Insects constitute the largest group of the animal kingdom, and perhaps one of the best known and most studied is the ant. The La Plata museum includes a very interesting and singular display of anthills and their construction, together with cutaway cross sections of the intricate labyrinth of underground passages that defy even the invasion of heavy rains.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the same section is found a fine display of wasp nests. I was informed that wasp honey has been commercially marketed in Argentina, and for that reason labels are always marked “bee honey,” “cane honey” (light molasses), or “wasp honey” to distinguish between the three varieties. Wasp honey is said to be even sweeter than bee honey.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark65"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark66"></a>The Terrible Lizard</span></h6>
<p><span class="font0">Two exhibits causing the greatest initial impact upon the visitor, as well as leaving a lasting impression, are actually nothing more than excellent imitations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The giant Wyoming dinosaur, or “terrible lizard” as its Greek name implies, measures twenty-five meters from its head to the tip of its tail. It is an exact replica of the original dinosaur skeleton located in the museum in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Seven life-size reproductions of this giant reptile were made and then donated by Andrew </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Carnegie to museums in</span><span class="font0"> London, Paris, Madrid, Bologna, Berlin, Vienna, Leningrad, and La Plata, affording the latter the distinction of being the only Latin-American museum to benefit from Carnegie's gesture.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font0">In the section of marine invertebrates we find the other wonderful imitation, a full-scale replica of an octopus dangling from the ceiling. Among the real exhibits, the collection of cockles and other seashells, together with a special exhibit of edible Argentine shellfish—the palatepleasing delicacies of shrimp, rock crab, mussels, clams, oysters, squid and octopus —are sure to capture attention.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark67"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark68"></a>Rocks, Minerals and Plants</span></h6>
<p><span class="font0">Hours and hours could be devoted to admiring the collections of marble, onyx, granite, agate, rock crystal, amethyst, quartz, feldspar and beryl crystals. These are largely of native origin, with some foreign specimens for </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">comparative study. </span><span class="font0">From the Antarctic regions we find basalt lava, slate and ferrous quartz, to mention but a few. Meteorites, largely discovered in Argentine territory, the largest weighing 114 kilograms, form another important exhibit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">I lamented that time did not allow a more careful examination of the botanical division. Samples of Argentine wood, the many species of fungi, the great variety of com and wheat, and so many other displays, all warranted more than a passing glance.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark69"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark70"></a>Indians, Peruvian and Argentine</span></h6>
<p><span class="font0">The collection of Peruvian archaeology in La Plata is the most complete outside Peru. It seems almost unbelievable that the clay pottery and woven cloth appear to be so new, even the colors have not faded! (This is again attributed to climatic conditions found in the dry coastal desert of Peru.) Rather than the coarse, rough-woven materials found in many primitive tribes, Peruvian weaving evidences a highly perfected system executed by most skillful weavers. It is said that of the ten or twelve known weaving techniques, the Peruvian Indians were acquainted with them all. Their use of dyes was also of a high order. Besides </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">their artistic and educational</span><span class="font0"> value for the general public, Peruvian pottery as exhibited here is used as study material in art courses concerned with form and color for modern ceramics.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Argentine archaeology presents a fine collection of artifacts covering the everyday life, festivals and burial customs of the numerous aboriginal tribes of Argentina. One Indian is represented in his fighting gear, the breastplate being a coat of seven animal hides, one on top of the other. Then there are the funeral urns, complete with the fossil remains of the deceased almost always in a crouched position; the canoe and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">piragua (dugout); hunting and </span><span class="font0">kitchen utensils; festival dress and headgear, together with masks. Children’s Halloween masks in many lands and the carnival masks used in most Latin countries can easily find their forerunners in many ancient tribes. Among certain tribes, the grotesque masks were thought to represent certain spirits, (upon the termination of the carnival celebration the masks were destroyed; otherwise, common belief held that hunger and pestilence would afflict the tribe.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark71"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark72"></a>Rirth and Growth of a Museum</span></h6>
<p><span class="font0">But how did all this wealth of natural history and archaeological findings come to be housed in La Plata? Francisco Moreno, civil engineer, explorer and natural history enthusiast, donated his private collection for the formation of a museum devoted to archaeology and anthropology. Later he contributed his personal library of 2,000 volumes to the museum. When the capital of the province of Buenos Aires was transferred from Buenos Aires to La Plata in the late 1800’s, a museum building to incorporate this collection was included in the city building scheme. Completed in 1889, the museum with its imposing facade of six stately Grecian columns, together with the observatory, became basic units in the founding of the National University of La Plata in 1906. To this day the museum includes the Natural Science Faculty of the University of La Plata.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">Museums, as countries, vary greatly, not only in the size and presentation of their collections, but also in the general or special subjects treated or the nature of the subject. The visitor’s approval, interest, delight, boredom or disappointment depends largely upon individual interest and taste, age, curiosity and observation. The same visitor who may be bored and weary after long hours of trudging through the seemingly unending galleries of the Louvre Museum in Paris or the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York city, may be captivated by the small Alpine museum in Zermatt, Switzerland, which, among other exhibits, has an outstanding collection of mountain boots used on famous climbing expeditions in the Alps and Himalayas. Of course, the converse is true. But for old and young alike, museums provide the opportunity to develop new interests or widen out knowledge on known subjects.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">When you plan your next visit to a museum, check the guidebooks. Note collections of special interest to you. Find out what various museums consider their specialty. (In some cases the name of the museum will indicate its specialty, such as the Bible Museum in Amsterdam or the Jewish Museum in London. But in many instances one must inquire.) Does the museum have some rare or one-of-a-kind displays or collections? Make a list of what you would like to see. Upon arriving at the museum, while your mind is fresh and alert, visit the exhibits high on your list. Be selective. Do not try to cover all the exhibits in one visit. Remember, other interesting collections can be noted for future visits.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Upon this basis of careful planning, your museum visit will be a stimulating and educational experience, not just so many stuffed animals and dried bones!'</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">D</span><span class="font0">O YOU give as much attention to how you clothe your feet as to how you clothe the rest of your body? If you are like most people you give these less honorable parts very little consideration. Yet the manner in which you clothe them can directly affect your health.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">As you most likely have found from experience, your feet can, at times, make you feel miserable. They can cause you to become nervous and irritable. They can give you headaches, make your leg and back muscles ache, create nausea, ruin your appetite and generally upset your entire body. Commenting on how feet can affect the body, Dr. Joseph Lelyveld stated in his foreword to the book </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Your Feet and Their Care</span><span class="font0"> by Dr. William A. Rossi: “No other part of the body is more continuously and more harshly used than the feet. Their delicately balanced structure composed of intricate bones, joints, muscles, tendons, ligaments, nerves, blood vessels, skin and nails cannot be disturbed in their function without seriously affecting the entire body.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">If you have foot trouble, most likely you were not bom with it but you acquired it from the shoes you have worn. Shoes appear to be the major cause of most foot problems. Dr. Simon Wikler observes in his book </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Take Off Your Shoes and Walk: </span><span class="font0">“There is now no question in my mind but that the major cause of foot trouble is the type of shoes we wear.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Remove your shoes and stockings and take a look at your feet. Are the toes pinched together, with some of them overlapping on others? Are they misshapen, with the big toe at an unnatural angle? Have the arches fallen? Do you have trouble with ingrown toenails? These are some of the things that can result from poorly fitting shoes.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark75"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark76"></a>Foot Trouble Begins Early</span></h6>
<p><span class="font0">Surprising as it may seem, the trouble many people have with their feet began while they were children. It might even have begun during infancy by having had poorly designed shoes put on them that restricted toe movements and put pressure on the soft bones of their feet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Infants that have not begun to walk do not need shoes. Pre-walking shoes are not good for their feet. On this point Dr. Rossi remarks: “While awake, the infant is constantly wiggling and exercising these toes. Any restriction of this toe action is harmful. Socks and bootees should not be worn, except on rare occasion, during the child’s first year. The same applies to shoes. Footwear shouldn’t be considered until the child is starting to walk.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Allowing the child to go barefoot is often a good way to strengthen its feet and to protect them from future trouble. During the first eighteen months of its life this is possibly the most important factor in preventing it from acquiring fallen arches.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">From the ages of two to seventeen the bones of the feet are undergoing a hardening process that makes the feet particularly susceptible to foot defects caused by ill-fitting shoes. So when buying shoes for their children, parents should be careful to select shoes that are wide enough and long enough to provide ample toe room. It is unwise to put a shoe on a child’s foot that is too large with the idea that it can grow into it. Unless the child has the right size, its foot can be damaged. Arch supports should be avoided unless a doctor recommends them. They are not needed by healthy feet but can weaken them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Foot growth has to be watched in children, as a child can quickly outgrow his shoes and damage his feet by wearing shoes that are too small. Shoes that have been outgrown by an older child should not indiscriminately be passed on to a younger brother or sister. It is important that shoes fit.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark77"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark78"></a>High-heeled Shoes</span></h6>
<p><span class="font0">Shoe styles among women in many lands cause them to wear foot-cramping shoes with high heels, but prolonged use of such shoes is not good for their feet. There are foot doctors who believe that high-heeled shoes cause the calf muscle to shorten, foot ligaments and tendons to be weakened and the metatarsal arch to break down. Dr. Rossi observes: ‘‘Practically any foot defect or symptom which the individual already has is aggravated by the habitual wearing of high heels. Bunions, corns, strained or weak feet, etc., have no opportunity to improve, and will become worse.” Of course, there are differences of opinion on this matter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Yet it might be better for women who want to wear high-heeled shoes to do so only for brief, irregular intervals. During the day when a woman is doing a lot of standing or walking, a low-heeled shoe would treat her feet more kindly. Nevertheless, if a woman wants to switch to shoes with lower heels for regular wear, it does not seem advisable to make a sudden change after habitually wearing high heels. The change should be made gradually. Due to the fact that a woman’s calf muscle has shortened by prolonged use of high heels, a sudden change to regular use of low heels can cause sharp aching and cramps in the calves of her legs from the muscles being stretched to their normal length.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark79"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark80"></a>What to Look for When Buying Shoes</span></h6>
<p><span class="font0">The right fit is the most important thing to look for when purchasing shoes. No matter how attractive a shoe may appear to you, do not buy it if it fits poorly. As has been pointed out, ill-fitting shoes can ruin your feet and damage your health. Shop for shoes in the afternoon, because your feet tend to swell slightly after having been on them awhile. Since your feet are always smaller in the morning after a night’s rest, the afternoon is the best time to get a good fit in shoes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Have the shoe salesman measure both feet while you are standing. There can be as much as a full size difference between when you are sitting and when you are standing. By having both feet measured, you will know whether you have one foot that is larger than the other. This is not uncommon. The larger foot is the one that should be fitted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Do not insist upon the size indicated in the shoes you are wearing. Sizes can differ between brands of shoes. What might be right for you in one make could be wrong in another make. Then, too, the size you are wearing may not be the best size for your feet. Still another reason for having your feet measured each time you purchase shoes is the fact that your feet can</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">change as you grow older. A woman who wears a size 74 at the age of twenty might require a size 84 at the age of forty. The feet of children ought to be measured frequently to ensure that their rapidly growing feet do not become cramped in their shoes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Check the length of the shoes you try on. They should be sufficiently long to allow a space of from one-half to three-quarters of an inch beyond your longest toe. The longest toe may not be the large one; for some persons it is the second toe. A man’s dress shoe should be as long as possible, so that the pointed toe does not squeeze the toes. To check the width, squeeze each side of the shoe between your thumb and forefinger. When a shoe is too narrow the leather will remain taut. There should be a little slack in the leather that becomes noticeable when you squeeze the shoe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The widest part of the shoe is where the sole begins to curve toward the heel. This is where the ball of your foot at the big-toe joint should be. By pressing on the side of the shoe and by moving your big toe, you can feel the big-toe joint and can see whether it rests at the turn of the sole. If it is in front of this widest part of the shoe, ask for a longer shoe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Try on both shoes and walk about the store. This is the best test of a shoe’s comfort. The sole should be firm but flexible so that it bends easily as you walk. The space over the toes should be sufficient so your toenail will not dig a ridge into the leather. For the good of your feet you need room around your toes. If you can feel the tip of the shoe against the nail of your big toe or against the side of your toe, the shoe is a very poor fit. A shoe must give your foot sufficient room to be comfortable. If it does not feel right in the store, it will not feel right outside the store when you are walking about.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">Look at the lining in the shoe. In cheaply made shoes the lining quickly becomes worn and bunches up so that the shoe becomes painful to wear. A smooth leather is the best lining. It has a strong resistance to wrinkling and tearing and is less subject to decomposition than fabric linings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">There is no real saving in buying cheaply made shoes. They will quickly wear out and are not carefully designed to give you a proper fit. On the other hand, expensive shoes are not necessary for foot comfort. There are medium-priced shoes that can provide you with a good fit along with durability.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">What you spend for a pair of shoes may not be nearly what you spend for a suit of clothes, but those shoes can have a far greater influence on your temperament and your health than the suit.

<p><span class="font3">G</span><span class="font0">OD’S Word, the Bible, tells us of a number of God’s judgment periods. These are times for the execution of justice in harmony with God’s righteous principles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Inherent in the thought of God’s judgment periods is the rule that there is “a time for every affair under the heavens.” There is a time for God to be long-suffering and patient with his erring earthly creatures and a time for him to act because their 'errors have come to their completion,’ he doing so in vindication of his sovereignty and name, that ‘people may know that Jehovah alone is the Most High over all the earth,’—Eccl. 3:1; Gen. 15:16; Ps. 83:17, 18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Another basic principle to bear in mind in regard to God’s judgment periods is that when he once executes a judgment it is final. As the prophet Samuel on one occasion told King Saul: “He is not an earthling man so as to feel regrets.” He does not change.—1 Sam, 15:29; Mal, 3:6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Fulfillment of Bible prophecies locates us today in a judgment period. Thus Matthew, chapters 24 and 25, associates a judgment with the events that have taken place since 1914. Another prophecy tells us: “The nations became wrathful, and your own wrath came, and the appointed time ... to bring to ruin those ruining the earth.” When did the nations become wrathful as never before? Was it not in 1914? It therefore marks the beginning of God’s present judgment period, which will reach its climax at Armageddon, “the war of the great day of God the Almighty.” —Rev. 11:17, 18; 16:14, 16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Because we are living in a judgment period God is having a warning sounded— he always does. “Seek Jehovah, all you meek ones of the earth, who have practiced His own judicial decision. Seek righteousness, seek meekness. Probably you may be concealed in the day of Jehovah’s anger.” (Zeph. 2:3) What will be the destiny of those who ignore this warning and die either now or at Armageddon? A look at how persons fared in previous judgment periods will give us a clue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The first judgment period involved Adam and Eve, right after they had sinned. It resulted in their being sentenced to death: “Dust you are and to dust you will return,” and that without any intimation of a resurrection.—Gen. 3:19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Other judgment periods that might be mentioned are the one that began with Noah’s preaching, most likely some fifty years before the flood, and the one at the time of Lot, when Sodom and Gomorrah were destroyed. Those who perished at the Flood and in Sodom and Gomorrah were annihilated. This is clear from the words of the apostle Peter likening the destiny of those who perished back there to that of false prophets: “These very ones will” be “bringing speedy destruction upon themselves.” For “Jehovah knows how to . . . reserve unrighteous people for the day of judgment to be eut off.”—2 Pet. 2-A-9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In view of these examples it follows that those who will die at the hands of God’s executioner at the coming war of Armageddon will also be annihilated, that is, die without a hope of living again. Some have questioned why this should be, since it may be that not all heard the warning message and it is primarily the rulers that stand opposed to God and his kingdom. (Rev. 19:11, 19) However, as Jesus said: “If, then, a blind man guides a blind man, both will fall into a pit.” The fact is that the people love to have it that way.—Matt. 15:W; Jer. 5:31.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Moreover, there is the principle of community responsibility. Did not the Egyptians support Pharaoh in his unjust oppression of the Israelites, and so did they not all suffer from the plagues? And did not all Judah repeatedly suffer because of the wickedness of their kings, whose bidding they did and whose example they followed?—Ex. 6:9 to 12:29; 2 Ki. 21:10-15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In fact, a similar principle, that of family merit, fixes the destiny of infants and small children. If these have holy parents, that is, parents who arc dedicated Christians, they are also considered holy. This principle caused the firstborn of the Israelites to be spared from the tenth plague, the little ones in Rahab’s household to be spared because of her faith, and Jonathan’s son to be spared because of his father’s love for David.—1 Cor. 7:14; Ex. 12:7, 13; Josh. 2:12-14; 2 Sam. 21:7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The principle of family merit works both ways. Since offspring not having reached the age of accountability are spared with faithful parents, it would follow that these would perish if they had unfaithful or faithless parents. For this position there likewise is much Scriptural precedent. None were spared because of their tender years at the Deluge or when Sodom and Gomorrah perished. Thus also Jehovah’s executioners at Armageddon are told to execute all those not sighing for the detestable things being done in the land, regardless of age or sex: “Old man, young man and virgin and little child and women you should kill off—to a ruination.”—Ezek. 9:1-7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">This is not contradicted by the principle stated at Ezekiel 18:20 to the effect that “a son himself will bear nothing because of the error of the father.” Why not? Because from the context it is apparent that the son here referred to has reached the age of accountability, for it mentions various kinds of sins for which each would be held accountable, such as adultery, which sin it would not be possible for a young child to commit.—Ezek. 18:1-20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">No question about it, community responsibility and family merit have a bearing on the question of human destiny during God’s judgment periods. It is therefore reasonable to conclude that those who perish at Armageddon at the hands of God’s executioner—in contrast to those who may die at that time because of physical weakness—will not have a resurrection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">What about those dying now, before Armageddon? The destiny of adults depends upon their being still amenable to righteousness. As for infants and young children, the principle of family merit governs. If the parents are judged unworthy of surviving Armageddon or of a resurrection, then their children will not have a resurrection. But if the parents either survived Armageddon or are deserving of a resurrection, then their children would also have a resurrection though dying now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Since we can only reason on these questions from Scriptural principles and examples, it would be unwise to be dogmatic as to individual cases; we must leave such in the hands of the Creator, Jehovah God, who is just, wise and loving, even as his Word assures us: “The Rock, perfect is his activity, for all his ways are justice. A God of faithfulness, with whom there is no injustice; righteous and upright is he.” “O the depth of God’s riches and wisdom and knowledge! How unsearchable his judgments are and past tracing out his ways are!” “God is love.” Surely in the hands of such a God we can leave all questions as to human destiny.—Deut. 32:4; Rom. 11: 33; 1 John 4:8.</span></p>

He said churchgoers do not know what their religion is all about. “We can’t live as churchmen without adequate preparation and the right equipment. The average fourth grade child knows more about mathematics than the average Presbyterian knows about the Holy Bible. Adult church classes have largely disappeared and become social functions,” he said. The net result is “a poverty of faith which shows up in nominal ways in daily living. We lack vision and compassion. We have relinquished many of our responsibilities to a pagan world,” were the minister’s remarks.—The Dallas (Tex.) </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Morning News,</span><span class="font19"> June 22, 1963.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;">First Politics, Then Religion</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">Ny as aland’s minister of local government, Henry Chipember e, called on the European clergy in Africa to hand over their work to the Africans. He is quoted by the Indianapolis </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">News</span><span class="font19"> (U.S.), August 7, as saying: ‘T am not prejudiced against Europeans, but they must realize the time has come to leave everything in our hands. If we can administer the government, then we can also administer Christianity.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;">Formula </span><span class="font19">for </span><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;">Nonworship</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">'§&gt; Church members in </span><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font19">United States do not mind belonging to a religion, but they do not think much about worshiping. So concluded Robert Douglass, minister of the Preston Hollow Presbyterian Church in Dallas, Texas. He is quoted by the Dallas </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Times Herald</span><span class="font19"> as having said: “This tacit admission of unconcern for worship even has precise formulations. We learned, for instance, in planning our sanctuary, that only fools plan to seat an entire congregation at worship and that a church of a certain size ought to plan seating for no more than 50 percent of its total membership. And with a larger church the percentage is closer to one-third.&quot; Having the architects tell him this made Douglass uneasy. He said that he mentally began to defend his congregation’s attendance record. He told his flock, “Let me simply peg this down realistically in our own congregation. For the first 28 Sundays of this year we averaged almost exactly 400 worshipers in our Sunday morning services, against a membership of 1,400. That's 28.4 percent attendance. We must further embarrass this statistic, however, to point out that of these 400, an average of 86 were not a part of that 1,400 membership.” And he summed it up: “So I believe the point can be clearly maintained: the average Christian does not take his participation in worship too seriously.&quot; By the way, this is one of Dallas’ growing, thriving congregations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;">Bank Robberies</span></p>
<p><span class="font19"># The days of Al Capone and John Dillinger are looked back on as years of gangsterism and bank robberies in America. In 1932 there were 606 banks that were held up. But last year in America there were 1,250 banks that were robbed, an increase of more than 100 percent over those frightful years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;">“Th ou-Shalt-Not-Steal” Signs</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">The St. Paul (Minn.) Dispatch said that a large discount department store in the city found it necessary to post signs reading “Thou Shalt Not Steal” at their religious merchandise counter. The reason for this was given by the store’s manager, who said that in two months shoplifters have stolen an average of “six to eight rosaries a week, two missals a month, two or three religious medals a month and 5 </span><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">to</span><span class="font19"> 10 </span><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;">religious car </span><span class="font19">statues </span><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font19">month.” By what is stolen it is not hard to guess the thieves’ religious background. The manager said the signs are going to be big.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;">Strawberries In the Arctic</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">&lt;$&gt; The Ottawa </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Journal</span><span class="font19"> (Can.), August 12, reported that strawberries grown in the Arctic are as plump and sweet as those grown in southern Canada. Plants arc protected by plastic shelters and grown on top of 150 feet of permafrost at Inu-vik.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;">Never Too Old to Learn</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">&lt;$■ Ivan Prekajski, an 80-y</span><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;">ear-</span><span class="font19">old pensioner, had already </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">taken his</span><span class="font19"> first exams for a Doctor of Law degree before the first world war. Unable to complete his studies at that time, however, he enrolled at Budapest University in 1958, where now, at the age of 80, he has graduated with his doctor's degree. He hopes to continue studying for a Doctor of Philosophy degree.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;">Cancer Cures</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">&lt;$&gt; The book </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Cancer and Public Education,</span><span class="font19"> published on August 27, stated that there are now 25,000 cures </span><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font19">year in Britain. This figure could be increased by 10,000 or more if the victims would seek early treatment, the book said. John Wakefield, educational executive officer of the Manchester Committee on Cancer and chairman of the Committee on Public Education of the International Union Against Cancer, stated that many victims arc kept from seeking early advice by ignorance, fear, prejudice and shame. Wakefield said that seven to eight out of ten early womb cancers were curable. In late womb cancers the proportion of cures fell to one or two out of ten. Other cancers now curable included skin (90 percent, if treated early), breast, mouth, </span><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;">lip, </span><span class="font19">tongue, rectum and bladder.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;">World Illiteracy</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">&lt;$&gt; A report prepared by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization said that almost half the world's population can neither read nor write. In </span><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font19">number of countries illiteracy is growing rather than decreasing. The report said; &quot;An average of almost 5Q%—in some regions 70 to 80% or more--of the adult population Lof the world 1 is illiterate.” A representative of the News U.N. Bureau stated that only about 55 percent of the children in Africa, the Arab states, Asia and Latin America are enrolled in primary Schools. Under these circumstances, some 20 to 25 million new illiterates will be added to the adult population each year over the next six or seven years.</span></p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">“Protestantism,” <em>The Church Herald </em>says, “has lost its faith—not all Protestants, to be sure, but so many of them that the gasoline in the tank is half water. You can’t run a car that way. You can’t run a church that way.”—<em>The Reader’s Digest, </em>September, 1962, p. 50.</p>

FIELD MINISTRY
Jehovah’s witnesses, as followers of the “Lion of the Tribe of Judah,” display lionlike courage in carrying out their commission to preach the Kingdom good news in the face of intense opposition from wicked men. As they share in this preaching work during March they will offer a year’s subscription for The Watchtower, with three Bible-study booklets, for $1.
EIGHTY YEARS OF BIBLE COUNSEL
For over eighty years this magazine, The Watchtower, has brought real enjoyment and spiritual comfort to thousands of persons. For the past forty years it has shared its place in the hearts of those thousands with a companion, the Awake! magazine. Both of these journals have left an indelible mark in the field of Bible education, a mark that is reflected in the thousands of lives that have been dedicated to Jehovah as a result of the spiritual counsel and instruction carried in their pages. You too can share in the blessings regularly showered forth by these companion Bible journals by welcoming them into your home each issue. Both are yours for one year for only $2. Send at once and receive free six timely and instructive booklets.

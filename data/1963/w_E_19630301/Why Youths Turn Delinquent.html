<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">✔ Today delinquent youths do not come only from underprivileged families, but from the upper classes as well. But why? What is wrong? A young attorney throws light on the situation when he notes the religious attitudes of these families. “Most of these boys we call ‘middle-class delinquents’ are from families who no longer follow their religious beliefs, except procedurally,” he observed. “They have lost the firm foundation of the Commandments. They have lost their personal grip on all religious ethics and they have not yet developed any humanitarian or secular ethics. They’re in between. They’re in a no-man’s land and a no-God’s land and their children don’t know what to believe.”</p>

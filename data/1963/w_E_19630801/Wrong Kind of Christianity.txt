Wrong Kind of Christianity
In discussing the decision of the United States Supreme Court banning official prayers in the public schools, Edward O. Miller wrote in The Christian Century of August 1, 1962: “Business leaders who have consistently demanded that the government stay out of their domain now proclaim that unless the government undergirds religion, the God of Abraham and of Jesus could be overthrown. Since when do Christians run to the government to save God? Christianity came near to destruction when the Roman emperor Constantine gave it official sanction and made it respectable. As Kierkegaard wrote in his Attack Upon Christendom, a Christianity that looks to government for aid ‘betrays the fact that it is not the Christianity of the New Testament.’”

<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">One line from Jesus’ model prayer, the Lord’s prayer, would fill a book. So packed with meaning is each phrase that thousands of words are needed to appreciate their full significance. Do you know what Jesus meant when he taught us to pray: “Let your name be sanctified,” and, “Your will be done on earth”? Two books have been written on just these two lines from Jesus’ prayer, bearing as their titles these significant words. Send for both books and repeat this inspiring prayer with a new insight. Send now and receive free two timely booklets. Both books, only $1.</p>

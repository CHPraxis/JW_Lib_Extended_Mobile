<p><span class="font6">It takes real faith for a Christian to endure suffering, to be abused and tormented and made a public show because of what he believes and preaches concerning God’s kingdom. It takes real fortitude for other Christians to stand loyally by and watch the treatment that faithful men who love God receive because of their not breaking integrity. Jesus Christ, their Exemplar, endured to the death. He said: “He that has endured to the end is the one that will be saved.” (Matt. 24: 13) Jesus knew of men who displayed such magnificent faith before he himself became a man to save the world by a ransom. The record of their faith stands as a testimony to this day in the book of Hebrews, chapter eleven. Faith is not just a thing of the past that pre-Christian people showed, but something that Christians must display now. In the face of all the modern ideas, scientific knowledge and theories taught today, how strong is your faith in Jehovah God, in his Son Christ Jesus and in the written Word of God, the Holy Bible?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the Western world, or in Christendom, people will say, “I believe in God.” That is very easily said. But do they really believe what Jesus said? For instance, he said: “God loved the world so much that he gave his only-begotten Son, in order that everyone exercising faith in him might not be 5</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">destroyed but have everlasting life.” (John 3:16) The majority of “believers” in God will say “Yes” to the question but at the same time express belief in the theory of the evolution of man. If one believes in the evolution of man, how can he believe in the creation of man by God and the fall of man into sin and death? And if he does not believe the Bible account of creation, why exercise faith in Christ Jesus?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is not uncommon to hear clergymen say that the creation account of the Bible is a myth. If they believe that, then they do not believe God’s written Word, as the whole Bible rests its teaching on the creation of man by God. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Redbook</span><span class="font6"> magazine of August, 1961, under the heading “The Surprising Beliefs of Our Future Ministers,” had this to say: “The Reverend James A. Pike, Episcopal Bishop of California, recently startled many United States churchgoers when he declared that he does not believe in the Biblical account of the virgin birth of Christ. It is a primitive religious myth . . . Asked to name other religious myths, Dean Pike mentioned Adam and Eve and the Garden of Eden.” When this clergyman rejects the Adam and Eve account, then there is no need for the ransom sacrifice of Christ Jesus to take away the sin of the world, as he sees it. Mr. Pike assumes he has greater knowledge than the One who inspired the writing of the Bible. Whom do you believe, God or a mere man?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Australian journal </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Pix</span><span class="font6"> in its issue of October 21,1950, reported that Bishop Barnes of Birmingham, England, said: “The Old Testament was full of ‘folklore, defective history, half-savage morality.’ ” Another statement showing the clergy’s rejection of the Bible is found in the pamphlet </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">In the Beginning.</span><span class="font6"> It reads: “Stories of the Patriarchs were passed from mouth to mouth for many hundreds of years before they were written down. We must not be surprised to find that they are sometimes inconsistent; we are not bound to believe that everything happened just as it is told in Genesis.” It is not surprising, therefore, that, although Jesus himself referred to it, the Genesis account in the Bible about Sodom, and Lot’s fleeing from that city, is referred to as a “myth” by many of the clergy of Christendom. In </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Interpreter’s Bible,</span><span class="font6"> on page 626, under chapter nineteen of Genesis, the commentary says: “This story— belonging to a widely diffused class of tales having possibly a mythological background (See Skinner, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Genesis,</span><span class="font6"> pp. 311-12)—of the destruction of a city which had once stood in the vicinity of the Dead Sea, probably at its southern end, was presumably current in Hebron when the Israelites settled there.” The critics of the Bible, yes, many clergymen of today, say the Bible story of Lot has a mythological background, but did Jesus believe this Bible story to be a myth? No! He told his apostles: “Remember the wife of Lot.” (Luke 17:32) Whom do you believe, Jesus or the higher critics? As for us, we believe Jesus, who himself believed the things “written aforetime.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It was about the year 56 (A.D.) that Paul wrote: “All the things that were written aforetime were written for our instruction, that through our endurance and through the comfort from the Scriptures we might have hope.” (Rom. 15:4) What hope is offered us today in the Sodom and Gomorrah record in the Bible?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">EOT AND SODOM AND GOMORRAH</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Lot was the nephew of Abraham and resided in the city of Sodom. One evening about 1919 B.C.E. two angels who had previously visited Abraham at Mamre, near Hebron, west of the Salt Sea, came to the city of Sodom located in the “Low Plain of Siddim, that is, the Salt Sea,” probably in what is now the southeast corner of the Salt Sea. (Gen. 14:3) Lot was sitting in the gate of Sodom. He invited the angelic visitors to his home and urged them to stay overnight. “Before they could lie down, the men of the city, the men of Sodom, surrounded the house, from boy to old man, all the people in one mob. And they kept calling out to Lot and saying to him: ‘Where are the men who came in to you tonight? Bring them out to us that we may have intercourse with them.’ Finally Lot went out to them to the entrance, but he shut the door behind him. Then he said: ‘Please, my brothers, do not act badly.’ ” (Gen. 19:4-7) These men of Sodom wanted to use the two male strangers for their sexual pleasure. Lot refused, and the mob became angry. If it had not been for the angels’ pulling Lot back into the house and shutting the door, it would have been ruinous for Lot.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The angels were insistent that Lot, his wife and two daughters leave the wicked city early in the morning. The angels said to Lot: “We are bringing this place to ruin, because the outcry against them has grown loud before Jehovah, so that Jehovah sent us to bring the city to ruin.” So Lot prepared to leave. “When the dawn ascended, then the angels became urgent with Lot, saying: ‘Get up! Take your wife and your two daughters who are found here, for fear you may be swept away in the error of the city!’ When he kept lingering, then in the compassion of Jehovah upon him, the men seized hold of his hand and of the hand of his wife and of the hands of his two daughters and they proceeded to bring him out and to station him outside the city.” Lot and his family were then told: “Escape for your soul! Do not look behind you and do not stand still in all the District! Escape to the mountainous region for fear you may be swept away!”—Gen. 19:13-17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Lot did not want to die. He asked God to preserve his soul alive, but was unable to climb the mountain as directed. He pleaded for permission to flee to a nearby city and there, as he said, “my soul will live on.” They hurried on to the city of Zoar, and “the sun had gone forth over the land when Lot arrived at Zoar. Then Jehovah made it rain sulphur and fire from Jehovah, from the heavens, upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah. So he went ahead overthrowing these cities, even the entire District and all the inhabitants of the cities and the plants of the ground. And his wife began to look around from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt.”—Gen. 19:18-26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But what of Lot’s uncle? “Now Abraham made his way early in the morning to the place where he had stood before Jehovah. Then he looked down toward Sodom and Gomorrah and toward all the land of the District and saw a sight. Why, here thick smoke ascended from the land like the thick smoke of a kiln!”—Gen. 19:27, 28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As the smoke ascended Abraham must have wondered about the safety of Lot. The day previous, Abraham had made the request of Jehovah to save the city if only ten persons were doing what was right. But there must not have been even ten righteous persons in Sodom; so it came to ruin. However, “God kept Abraham in mind in that he took steps to send Lot out of the midst of the overthrow when overthrowing the cities among which Lot had been dwelling.”—Gen. 19:29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Read the full account of this in your Bible at Genesis, chapters eighteen and nineteen. Is your faith in God’s Word strong enough to believe Sodom was destroyed at God’s direction and Lot and his two daughters reached Zoar safely? Jesus believed it, because he referred to this as happening and said: “Likewise, just as it occurred in the days of Lot: they were eating, they were drinking, they were buying, they were selling, they were planting, they were building. But on the day that Lot came out of Sodom it rained fire and sulphur from heaven and destroyed them all. The same way it will be on that day when the Son of man is to be revealed.”—Luke 17:28-30.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">AN ILLUSTRATION FOR US</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jesus was talking to his disciples about the time when this whole wicked worldly system of things, the present Sodom and Gomorrah in which we are now living, would be destroyed. The ancient destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah was one of the historical illustrations Jesus used to help his faithful followers get the right understanding of what was going to happen during his second presence and to “give us more faith.” (Luke 17:5) But Jesus gave them additional true history from God’s Word as set forth in the book of Genesis to establish their faith. He said: “Just as it occurred in the days of Noah, so will it be also in the days of the Son of man.” (Luke 17:26) By these illustrations what was Jesus trying to impress upon their minds and ours? Deliverance! But in order to gain salvation they had to come out from and be no part of this old world. In our present day there is a class of people, a great crowd, pictured by Lot and his two daughters. We see them fleeing this old world that is doomed to sudden destruction. They appreciate God’s loving-kindness, just as Lot said, “to preserve my soul alive.” (Gen. 19:19) For this they have to seek safety according to God’s arrangements. That means flee modern Sodom. Flee quickly from this old world in its time of the end.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Do not be like Lot’s wife, who stopped, looked back and got encrusted so as to turn into a pillar of salt. She never got to Zoar, but Lot with his two daughters did. That was their place of safety. Lot had faith, and it carried him through. Today people of goodwill must have the same strong faith in order to be taken through this time of trouble and the battle of Armageddon into God’s new world of righteousness. They must keep on praying the Lord’s prayer: “Our Father in the heavens, let your name be sanctified. Let your kingdom come. Let your will take place, as in heaven, also upon earth.” That prayer will get an answer. Those who do the will of God will find complete safety and happiness under God’s kingdom. —Matt. 6:9, 10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">People of goodwill who are really seeking this kingdom today may escape with their souls. God’s prophet said: “Seek Jehovah, all you meek ones of the earth, who have practiced His own judicial decision. Seek righteousness, seek meekness. Probably you may be concealed in the day of Jehovah’s anger.” (Zeph. 2:3) They dare not look behind. Otherwise, they too will be swept away “in the day of Jehovah’s anger.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Just as Jesus believed in the history of Lot, so also Peter believed the story. So what if modern religionists do not? Listen to Peter’s strong language concerning evildoers and his confidence in Jehovah’s judgment upon them as recorded in the first book of the Bible, Genesis. Peter said: “Certainly if God did not hold back from punishing the angels that sinned [in Noah’s day], but . . . reserved [them] for judgment; and he did not hold back from punishing an ancient world, but kept Noah, a preacher of righteousness, safe with seven others . . . ; and by reducing the cities Sodom and Gomorrah to ashes he condemned them, setting a pattern for ungodly persons of things to come; and he delivered righteous Lot, who was greatly distressed by the indulgence of the law-defying people in loose conduct—for that righteous man by what he saw and heard while dwelling among them from day to day was tormenting his righteous soul by reason of their lawless deeds—Jehovah knows how to deliver people of godly devotion out of trial, but to reserve unrighteous people for the day of judgment to be cut off.” (2 Pet. 2:4-9) Peter had faith and believed that Jehovah God did all these things. He believed this when he wrote about it A.D. 64, over 1,980 years after Sodom’s destruction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">FAITHLESSNESS IN CHRISTENDOM</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Even though Jesus referred to it, still many of the modern-day clergy do not believe the story of Lot. What must they think of Jesus? The religionists cannot think much either of Peter, for he also referred to Sodom when describing the situation that would exist at this world’s end. Honest Christians who take time to study and search the Scriptures will discern the truth in them and build up their faith, wisely so, for one must “have faith to the preserving alive of the soul.”—Heb. 10:39.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">How strong is your faith about Christ Jesus? According to your faith, did he exist? Was he the Son of God? Do you believe he died that mankind might live? Do you believe that he provided the ransom sacrifice and that without him no human creature can gain everlasting life? Have you not read First Timothy 2:5, 6, wherein it says: “There is one God, and one mediator between God and men, a man Christ Jesus, who gave himself a corresponding ransom for all”? It may be that you believe, but do you know there are a number of prominent clergymen who do not have faith in this truth? For example, Dr. Lyle Weatherhead, president of the Methodist Conference in Britain, said: “I do not believe Christ’s crucifixion was the will of God. Christ came to the world to be followed, not to be murdered.” </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">(Awake!</span><span class="font6"> April 22, 1958, page 27) It is not at all surprising when we hear a religious leader like Harry Emerson Fosdick saying:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Of course I do not believe in the Virgin Birth, or in that old fashioned substitutionary doctrine of the Atonement; and I do not know any intelligent Christian minister who does. The trouble with these fundamentalists is that they suppose that unless one agrees with them in their doctrinal set-up, he cannot believe in the profound, substantial, everlasting truths of the Christian gospel that transform men’s lives, and are the only hope of Christ’s saviorhood in this world.”—</span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Christian Beacon,</span><span class="font5"> May 9, 1946, Vol. XI, No. 13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">If some clergy do not believe in Christ Jesus, his birth as the Son of God and his death as an atoning sacrifice, why should they stand before congregations claiming to be Christians? How can they build faith in others if they themselves have none? It is not difficult to understand how a “doctor of divinity,” like D. R. Keating, a minister of the United Church, could say:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“In the present condition of the churches I cannot figure out why a person, especially a man, wants to become a member of the church. He must either have relegated religion to one of the dispensable trivialities of his life, socially useful and personally harmless, or he has illusions about what he is getting into. Maybe he has been reading the New Testament and assumes that is what he will find in the churches. I, for one, admit that I can’t think of a church that I would bother crossing the street to enter if I were a layman.”—Winnipeg, Canada, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Tribune,</span><span class="font5"> March 4, 1961.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">How can anyone expect people to have faith in God and Christ Jesus when clergymen stand before the congregations and tell them that it was useless that they came to hear their sermons? Clergymen are supposed to be teaching faith in Christ as the way of salvation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The New York </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font6"> of March 11,1960, carried the following from a sermon by the “Right Reverend” Hanns Lilje, Lutheran Bishop of Hannover, Germany: “The scenery for Christianity has changed in our time more deeply and more fundamentally than most people realize. We do live for all practical purposes in a nonchristian world. The term should be used in its precise meaning. It is not an anti-Christian age. We live in a nonchristian period.” He ought to know! He is one of the leaders in the Lutheran religion and he in effect is saying that people in Christendom are non-Christians. His “church” and denomination make up part of Christendom, and Mr. Lilje says “we live in a nonchristian period.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">If no one today is following in the footsteps of Christ Jesus it is high time that a strong call go out to flee, get out of Christendom’s false religions. Jesus said he was not a part of this world, including its religious system, although he was born under one, the Jews’ religion. He condemned its leaders as hypocrites. Millions of persons are born into a religious system today, but the people who love truth must think for themselves and then flee from Christendom and serve the true God Jehovah. Many of the religious clergy do not believe the story of Adam and Eve and some even reject Christ; but Paul said: “Just as in Adam all are dying, so also in the Christ all will be made alive.” (1 Cor. 15:22) So Paul believed in both. But this being made alive is not going to be forced upon everyone. Each person must have faith. “Faith is the assured expectation of things hoped for, the evident demonstration of realities though not beheld.” (Heb. 11:1) Paul argued: How could anyone call on the name of Jehovah to be saved if he never had faith in that one? And, further, how could anyone have faith if he never heard about the true God? In order to get such faith there must be a preacher of the good news. But how can there be a preacher unless he is sent forth? Paul concludes by saying: “So faith follows the thing heard. In turn the thing heard is through the word about Christ.”—Rom. 10:13-17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">GOD’S WORD BUILDS FAITH</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The very first Christians had faith in Christ Jesus because they saw and heard him. They had an assured expectation of things hoped for. They knew Jesus healed the sick, opened blind eyes, raised the dead and he himself was raised from the dead by Jehovah God. What more assurance of their hope did they need? They had faith based on real things that happened. Now we have the written record in God’s Word the Bible. We know what happened during Christ Jesus’ life on earth. We also have a sure record of what the apostles did. We see a Christian’s faith is based on the truth of real things seen, heard and that occurred. We know, and the early Christians knew, that they were condemned to death through Adam’s sin, as Paul explains: “That is why, just as through one man sin entered into the world and death through sin, and thus death spread to all men because they had all sinned.” (Rom. 5:12) Christians know why man dies and they also know that life was a gift from God through Jesus Christ our Lord. “For the wages sin pays is death, but the gift God gives is everlasting life by Christ Jesus our Lord.” (Rom. 6:23) Paul knew this and he believed it! Do you today? If you do, you have faith in God’s written Word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Every clergyman in the world today representing Christendom ought to have that faith too; but their power to build such faith is gone. They have turned to the theories of men, evolution and to the education of the space age. To them the Bible is just a book out of date; but it is much better to listen to Jesus and the apostles who knew God’s purposes, and this is strengthening to our faith. Jesus said: “It is unavoidable that causes for stumbling should come. Nevertheless, woe to the one through whom they come! It would be of more advantage to him if a millstone were suspended from his neck and he were thrown into the sea than for him to stumble one of these little ones.” (Luke 17:1, 2) How many good people with some faith have been turned away from God and Christ by a faithless clergy! For this they must answer to God!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">True Christians will keep faith in God’s Word, the Bible, and in the sacrifice of Christ Jesus, but Paul warns all who renounce the faith and says: “If we practice sin willfully after having received the accurate knowledge of the truth, there is no longer any sacrifice for sins left, but there is a certain fearful expectation of judgment and there is a fiery jealousy that is going to consume those in opposition.” (Heb. 10:26, 27) Christ is not going to die again to save these who once had a knowledge and faith in Christ Jesus and who accepted him as their redeemer. If they throw their faith to the wind and reject God, his Word, and his Son, then God will not arrange to redeem them again. There is no longer any sacrifice for sins left! There is coming a judgment, a fearful one! Remember Sodom and Gomorrah. Faithless ones will not be able to flee like Lot and his two daughters. They will be caught in the fiery destruction. Some may try to escape but they will look around at antitypical Sodom, even as Lot’s wife looked back and became a pillar of salt, and in the battle of Armageddon others will die in the attempt to escape.—Gen. 19:26; 2 Pet. 3:10-13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">THE FAITH OF EARLY CHRISTIANS</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The clergy of Christendom today must take the responsibility, because through their organized religions since A.D. 325 Christendom has been pulling farther away from true Christianity and the Bible’s teaching. Modern historians recognize this fact, ^n the book </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Outline of History</span><span class="font6"> by H. G. Wells, it is stated: “This date 325 A.D. is a very convenient date in our history. It is the date of the first complete general (oecumenical) council of the entire Christian world. ... It marks the definite entry upon the stage of human affairs of the Christian church and of Christianity as it is generally understood in the world to-day. It marks the exact definition of Christian teaching by the Nicene Creed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“It is necessary that we should recall the reader’s attention to the profound differences between this fully developed Christianity of Nicaea and the teaching of Jesus of Nazareth. All Christians hold that the latter is completely contained in the former, but that is a question outside our province. What is clearly apparent is that the teaching of Jesus of Nazareth was a </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">prophetic teaching</span><span class="font6"> of the new type that began with the Hebrew prophets. It was not priestly, it had no consecrated temple and no altar. It had no rites and ceremonies. Its sacrifice was ‘a broken and a contrite heart.’ Its only organization was an organization of preachers, and its chief function was the sermon. But the fully fledged Christianity of the fourth century, though it preserved as its nucleus the teachings of Jesus in the gospels, was mainly a </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">priestly religion</span><span class="font6"> of a type already familiar to the world for thousands of years. The centre of its elaborate ritual was an altar, and the essential act of worship the sacrifice, by a consecrated priest, of the mass. And it had a rapidly developing organization of deacons, priests and bishops.”—Third Edition, pages 522,523.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This is a historian writing in 1920, and he saw “the profound differences between this fully developed Christianity of Nicaea and the teachings of Jesus of Nazareth.” Anyone today who is familiar with the Bible and the life of Christ can clearly see the profound difference between what Jesus and the early apostles did and what the clergy of Christendom are doing. Nineteen hundred years ago Christians were strong in faith. Where is that faith today in Christendom? God’s book, the Holy Bible, is considered by many as a fine piece of literary work but the Ten Commandments are just to be read, not something to live by.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">However, listen to what Paul says to us: “Any man that has disregarded the law of Moses dies without compassion, upon the testimony of two or three. Of how much more severe a punishment, do you think, will the man be counted worthy who has trampled upon the Son of God and who has esteemed as of ordinary value the blood of the covenant by which he was sanctified, and who has outraged the spirit of undeserved kindness with contempt?” (Heb. 10:28, 29) Do you say that was “too severe” upon one who disregarded the law of Moses? Do you agree with those who say that what Moses wrote about, namely, Adam, Lot, Sodom and the Messiah (Christ), was nothing more than myths? Do you think Moses was wrong when he wrote: “You must not murder. You must not commit adultery. You must not steal. . . . You must not desire your fellow man’s house . .. wife . . . slave . . . nor anything that belongs to your fellow man”? Moses was the one who also wrote that “you must not take up the name of Jehovah your God in a worthless way, for Jehovah will not leave the one unpunished who takes up his name in a worthless way.” He also commanded that you people “must not make for yourself a carved image . . . because I Jehovah your God am a God exacting exclusive devotion.” Moses wrote this, not on the stone tablets, but in Exodus 20:1-17, but Jehovah directed him to write it all for our benefit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Paul was convinced that Jehovah was behind the writing of the Scriptures. He told a young Christian full of faith: “All Scripture is inspired of God and beneficial for teaching, for reproving, for setting things straight, for disciplining in righteousness, that the man of God may be fully competent, completely equipped for every good work.” (2 Tim. 3:16, 17) Paul believed the Bible. He had faith in its teachings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In these last days it takes strong faith to be a Christian, and to believe what is written in the Bible; but some people have it, and equip themselves to proclaim a message of God’s kingdom in spite of clergy ridicule. Paul knew that Christians would be having a hard time keeping in the ministry not only in his day but through all ages, due to governments and faithless religious leaders. So he admonished Christians, saying: “However, keep on remembering the former days in which, after you were enlightened, you endured a great contest under sufferings, sometimes while you were being exposed as in a theater both to reproaches and tribulations, and sometimes while you became sharers with those who were having such an experience. For you both expressed sympathy for those in prison and joyfully took the plundering of your belongings, knowing you yourselves have a better and an abiding possession.” —Heb. 10:32-34.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">MODERN-DAY FAITHFUL CHRISTIANS</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the days of the apostles many thousands of persons were enlightened with the truth of God’s Word and they walked in the footsteps of Christ Jesus and experienced what Paul described. They learned a new way of life, and this brought them real satisfaction, but along with it some opposition. This is what Christians today must remember. Just as Christians in former days were enlightened and endured a great contest under suffering, so Christians must do today. There is no easy way to be a true Christian. Dr. Baillie of the Union Theological Seminary, commenting on the present state of Christianity, is reported to have said: “That which has been on trial all these years is not Christianity at all. The experiment of living in a Christian way has not been made and until it is we just do not know anything about it. . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Perhaps the world no longer persecutes Christians because there are no longer any Christians.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We ask, Has Dr. Baillie observed the activity of Jehovah’s witnesses in the past forty-five years? True, if he is only looking at the Protestant and Catholic religious systems, there is no persecution of them. But what about the small group of Christian witnesses of Jehovah in Hitler’s day in Germany, Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and, in fact, all the world, including the United States and Canada, during World War II? And how about today? What is happening in East Germany, Poland, Russia and Christendom’s Catholic Spain? In these places Jehovah’s witnesses are enduring “a great contest under suffering,” and Jehovah’s witnesses in other parts of the world “express sympathy” for those in prison.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jesus said concerning real Christians: “He that has endured to the end is the one that will be saved.” (Matt. 24:13) A true Christian will endure suffering, and certainly those who stand firm for the principles Jesus lived by will have the experiences of “reproaches and tribulation” for being Christian. Jehovah’s witnesses have experienced the concentration camps, the gas chambers, the starvation diets and imprisonments in most of the countries of Christendom. Furthermore, their work of preaching God’s kingdom was banned for years in many countries of Christendom. Why? Just because Jehovah’s witnesses wanted to and insisted on living a Christian life, and they were willing to endure a great contest under suffering to do it. While not every one of these Christian witnesses of Jehovah was thrown into concentration camps, others who expressed sympathy for those in prison joyfully took the plundering of their belongings. Read the history of the modernday witnesses of Jehovah as told in the book </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah’s Witnesses in the Divine Purpose,</span><span class="font6"> and there you will learn of the persecution they endured at the hands of the clergy and the political rulers in Germany, Greece, Poland, Russia, Dominican Republic, Quebec, yes, in all parts of the world. However, they are still proclaiming God’s kingdom in all these countries today.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A true Christian must be strong and, even though persecution gets more intense, he must still listen and do what God inspired Paul to write: “Do not, therefore, throw away your freeness of speech, which has a great reward to be paid it. For you have need of endurance, in order that, after you have done the will of God, you may receive the fulfillment of the promise.” (Heb. 10:35, 36) Jehovah’s witnesses will not give up their freeness of speech because of persecution. Jesus did not close his mouth because of the power of the political and religious crowd of his day. The religionists had to kill him to take away his freeness to speak the good news of God’s kingdom. Christians will not change today. On the other hand, Christendom’s religious organizations today do the bidding of the political rulers. In many places the pulpit has become the mouthpiece of the government’s ruler. The clergy have thrown away their freeness of speech to preach God’s kingdom in order to play favorite to the worldly political rulers. A Christian cannot compromise, because he knows that his ‘freeness of speech has a great reward to be paid to him.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Hundreds of thousands of people are pulling away from the false religious organizations of Christendom because these institutions hold forth no promise. What can they promise? They reject the Bible. They have no “assured expectation of things hoped for.” But as for those seeking truth, God’s Word has brought them knowledge and understanding, and they have faith that God’s kingdom is near at hand. They believe what Paul said, even though written nineteen hundred years ago. “For yet ‘a very little while,’ and ‘he who is coming will arrive and will not delay.’ ” (Heb. 10:37) There has been no delay in the arrival of Christ Jesus. His second presence has been made manifest since 1914.<a name="footnote1"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark184">1</a></sup> The time of the end is near! It is time to get out of this modern-day Sodom, just as Lot and his two daughters fled that wicked city centuries ago. Those who want to live in God’s new world will have to flee the Devil’s organization and find security in Jehovah’s organization. God will provide the safe place for all during the time of the battle of Armageddon. Do you have faith that God will do this for you? Lot and his two daughters had faith and they got to Zoar and lived on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">How true God’s Word: “ ‘But my righteous one will live by reason of faith,’ and, ‘if he shrinks back, my soul has no pleasure in him’ ”! (Heb. 10:38) Today Jehovah’s witnesses must live by faith, but it is an assured expectation with full confidence in the future, because the written Word of God tells them the future. They see things have happened and are happening that God’s Word said would occur. So this is no time for anyone knowing God’s Word to shrink back and return to the wicked organization of the old world, for God will have no pleasure with such a one. Paul was a determined man, strong in mind and of great faith, and could strengthen the faith of others. With conviction he said: “Now we are not the sort that shrink back to destruction, but the sort that have faith to the preserving alive of the soul.”—Heb. 10:39.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">ANALYZING OUR FAITH</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">What kind of faith do you have? Is it the kind that shrinks back at every trial or difficulty that arises, or is your faith strong, built on the solid foundation of God’s Word? Is your faith strong enough to carry you on to ‘the preserving alive of your soul’?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Paul, writing to the Philippians, said: “The things that you learned as well as accepted and heard and saw in connection with me, practice these; and the God of peace will be with you.” (Phil. 4:9) What did the early Christians learn from Paul? What did they hear? What did they see? What had they accepted? Surely they saw Paul as a staunch Christian, dedicated to Jehovah God, walking in the footsteps of Christ Jesus. They knew a man willing to go through all kinds of sufferings, persecution, trials and even face death without shrinking back. They read his letter containing the experiences of what he went through for the sake of the good news of Christ. They knew Paul believed that Christ Jesus laid down his life for the saving of mankind and that Paul showed his belief by preaching God’s kingdom with Christ as King. These are just a few things Christians learn from Paul. Through Paul’s many letters and personal association he built up in others the necessary faith. The things that Paul preached and lived by, the early Christian witnesses of Jehovah learned, heard and saw and accepted. Now what? Will you faithful followers of Christ Jesus today practice these things? If so, with what result? “The God of peace will be with you.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">How can a person gain the peace of God today? First of all, by withdrawing from this wicked system of things. Then devote yourself wholly to the doing of the will of Jehovah God. Moses wrote: “I Jehovah your God am a God exacting exclusive devotion.” (Ex. 20:5) Therefore you as </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font6"> Christian must serve God with your whole heart, with your whole mind, with your whole soul, with your whole strength. This will prove your real love for your Father in heaven. Add to that the second commandment you must follow, and that is, Love your neighbor as you do yourself. The best example that you have of this kind of love is the Son of God, Christ Jesus. If you want to become a Christian you must be as much like him as possible. You will want to copy him in everything he did. To do that you must read about him, find out all you can about his life and his work. This information is found in the written Word of God, the Holy Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">To follow in the footsteps of Christ Jesus does not require a training in a theological seminary or a religious college. If such higher education were necessary, then Peter and John could not have been apostles of Christ Jesus. Those two men were ordinary men with sound minds. They appreciated and loved truth. They were men who listened and learned from their teacher Jesus Christ. When their resurrected Teacher explained to them why he had died upon the torture stake, they were not the kind to shrink back but they were ready to move out, and at Pentecost they preached the things that they heard and believed. So the Bible record tells us that when the Jewish Sanhedrin “beheld the outspokenness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were men unlettered and ordinary, they got to wondering. And they began to recognize about them that they used to be with Jesus.” (Acts 4:13) It is the spirit in a person, his zeal, devotion and knowledge that count, not his degree or diploma that hangs on a wall. These men had gained true knowledge because they had been with Jesus and learned the truth. They were fearless in expressing that truth. It was not their college education, or the rabbinical schools of their day, that qualified them as ministers of God. They never enrolled in them. They were ordained as God’s ministers by God, not by men. To wear “the cloth” the clergy of Christendom may trace their lines of descent back to A.D. 325 and the Nicean creed, but not back to Christ Jesus or the Word of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This information should be of real encouragement to individuals in all parts of the world who love the Bible, and it should help them in taking their stand for the ministry. If Peter and John, fishermen, could be apostles of Jesus Christ and could qualify to represent God as his ordained ministers in the earth, then why cannot anyone who loves the truth in God’s Word and who is devoted to God and has dedicated his life to God’s service do likewise? All the early Christians were ministers and they studied God’s written Word. It becomes clear that every person who becomes a Christian must also be a preacher of the good news. The difficulty in Christendom today is that the clergy are the only ones recognized as ministers, and their congregations have been made a listening flock, not a preaching flock. There has been a development of the clergy class and a laity class in Christendom, and, as was pointed out in </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Outline of History,</span><span class="font6"> H. G. Wells saw “the profound difference between the fully developed Christianity of Nicaea and the teachings of Jesus of Nazareth.” Of early Christianity he said: “Its only organization was an organization of preachers, and its chief function was the sermon.” That is what real Christians today see the need for the organization to be. The whole organization of Jehovah’s witnesses is made up of ordained ministers, and their chief function and training is the use of the sermon. They use Bible sermons from door to door and in their home Bible study work. Christians now must be just like Jehovah’s witnesses in the days of the apostles, who went from house to house and delivered sermons to the people of the homes visited, to any family, and they studied the Bible with them. Paul said: “I did not hold back from telling you any of the things that were profitable nor from teaching you publicly and from house to house.” (Acts 20:20) H. G. Wells showed that from and after A.D. 325 the religious leaders of Christendom established elaborate rituals around an altar, consecrated deacons, bishops, priests, and established the mass, and went into the construction of temples. What a difference from the way true Christians worshiped the Almighty God Jehovah!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">EACH ONE MUST EXERCISE FAITH</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Christendom’s leaders have brought themselves into the position in which they find themselves today. They have made their millions of churchgoers, the laity, useless as far as the spreading of Christianity is concerned. The clergy have taught them to listen and to go through set formalisms in their temples each week. They put no responsibility upon their flock to preach in behalf of Christ and to tell others the good news of God’s kingdom. There are some clergymen today that realize their failure. For example, the “Reverend” John Heuse, director of New York city’s Trinity Parish, had this to say in his lecture “What Are Churches For?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“No parish can fulfill its true function unless there is at the very center of its leadership life a small community of quietly fanatic, changed and truly converted Christians. The trouble with most parishes is that nobody, including the clergyman, is really greatly changed; but even where there is a devoted self-sacrificing priest at the heart of the fellowship, not much will happen until there is a community of changed men and women.” </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">—Reader’s Digest,</span><span class="font5"> June, 1962.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Whose fault is this? The clergymen are to blame. They are not trying to turn their parishioners into Christians who would “endure a great contest under suffering.” Their parishioners do not want to be “exposed as in a theater to both reproaches and tribulation” for Christ’s sake. They refuse to be like early Christians, willing to go to prison if necessary just for the sake of preaching the good news of God’s kingdom. Why has Christendom failed? Their people do not “have faith to the preserving alive of the soul.” They do not know, nor have they been taught, what Christian work is. The people of Christendom have not been trained to stand up for that which is right. How could they? Jesus said: “If, then, a blind man guides a blind man, both will fall into a pit.” (Matt. 15:14) Their flocks have not learned what Christianity is, what truth is. How could anyone expect them to, when one of their own clergymen says: “I, for one, admit that I can’t think of a church that I would bother crossing the street to enter if I were a layman.” (See page 13.) And a good many men and women do not go to their churches either. Very likely these nonchurchgoers noticed the true condition of the churches even before this clergyman did.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Let all the heads of the different denominations of the world gather together with Pope John XXIII in another ecumenical council. Let them try to unite the various religious denominations, both Protestant and Catholic, into a solid organization. Yet they will never make Christians out of their members. It takes more than consolidation. It takes God’s blessing, his spirit, his Word and the individual’s faith to be a Christian. Christendom has strayed too far away from God’s Word, the truth, to return. Too many of Christendom’s clergy have chosen small bits of the Bible to believe and scrapped the rest as a myth. In exchange they give their flocks their own ideas and, as Paul puts it, they “pay attention to false stories and to genealogies, which end up in nothing, but which furnish questions for research rather than a dispensing of anything by God in connection with faith.” —1 Tim. 1:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The real Christian knows through study of the Bible that the whole Bible is a book of action, a book of service, a book of faith, a book of truth and truly the Word of the Almighty God Jehovah. Christ Jesus only nineteen hundred years ago believed its true stories as written in the Hebrew Scriptures and he quoted them from the books of the Bible. Are you, then, going to teach others the same things that Jesus taught back there? Have faith in God’s Word. Study it! “Preach the word,” as Christians must! Then “be at it urgently in favorable season, in troublesome season.” —2 Tim. 4:2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">You believe that “with the heart one exercises faith for righteousness, but with the mouth one makes public declaration for salvation.” (Rom. 10:9, 10) Well, then, is your faith strong enough to make you speak out as a Christian and to tell the truth of God’s promises regarding his kingdom, which is mankind’s only hope? Or, are you going to be like a certain group of so-called followers of Christ that James described as “hearers only, deceiving yourselves with false reasoning. For if anyone is a hearer of the word, and not a doer, this one is like a man looking at his natural face in a mirror. For he looks at himself, and off he goes and immediately forgets what sort of man he is.”—Jas. 1:22-24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The logic of James is conclusive. He says: “Indeed, as the body without breath is dead, so also faith without works is dead.” (Jas. 2:26) Faith expresses itself. It makes proclamation. Faith is not a dead thing, but it goes to work. Faith lets other people know what it believes. It speaks out from house to house. A minister of God with faith must be active. One who knows the Word of God preaches it. Faith has no fear to give testimony, Peter said. “But sanctify the Christ as Lord in your hearts, always ready to make a defense before everyone that demands of you a reason for the hope in you, but doing so together with a mild temper and deep respect.” (1 Pet. 3:15) One with faith in God and the Bible makes a defense before everybody.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jesus, when speaking to Jews who were looking for the Messiah, did not pick out the scribes and the Pharisees to be the light of the world. He just chose ordinary men, men of faith. You remember that he said: “You are the light of the world. A city cannot be hid when situated upon a mountain. People light a lamp and set it, not under the measuring basket, but upon the lampstand, and it shines upon all those in the house. Likewise let your light shine before men, that they may see your fine works and give glory to your Father who is in the heavens.” (Matt. 5:14-16) This instruction in his Sermon on the Mount he gave to men and women alike. What an excellent service sermon it is! Jesus encouraged all people listening to take up the ministry, to represent God’s kingdom and work for it. He said: “Keep on, then, seeking first the kingdom and his righteousness.” (Matt. 6:33) He taught lovers of righteousness how to pray. He showed them the need to sanctify the name of the Father, Jehovah, and pray for his kingdom so that his will would take place on earth just the same as in heaven. (Matt. 6:9-15) To keep at this ministry work personally requires real faith in Jehovah God, his son Jesus Christ and God’s Word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">If you have such faith it will mean the “preserving alive of the soul.” So flee from the old world, headed for destruction as was Sodom, and be like Lot and his two daughters. Get up and go, be a minister of the good news! Do not hesitate to endure a “great contest under sufferings, sometimes while you [are] being exposed as in a theater both to reproaches and tribulations.” (Heb. 10: 32, 33) Serve God as a real Christian and be strong in your faith. Believe his Word and gain everlasting life in the new world of righteousness.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">associated only the sound doctrine that he had received from God’s Word. He was not to be full of idle talk or his own ideas. Timothy knew the truth, and it was the truth that he must teach, nothing else. This teaching would take time and patience because God’s people are not the worldly-wise, the highly intelligent men, but rather humble people. That is what Paul wrote the Corinthians: “Not many wise in a fleshly way were called, not many powerful, not many of noble birth; but God chose the foolish things of the world, that he might put the wise men to shame; and God chose the weak things of the world, that he might put the strong things to shame; and God chose the ignoble things of the world and the things looked down upon, the things that are not, that he might bring to nothing the things that are, in order that no flesh might boast in the sight of God.” (1 Cor. 1:26-29) In the uneducated, noninfluential and poor people Timothy had to build up faith and then bring them to a point where they could offer a “fine public declaration in front of many witnesses.” Are you doing that kind of Christian work? You should!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">From God’s own Word we see that those who were highly educated in the world, and the most prominent men, were not the ones called. Look at those whom the Son of God chose: fishermen, tax collectors, men who were looked down upon by the scribes and Pharisees. When ordinary police officers were sent by the chief priests and the Pharisees to take Jesus and to bring him to them they came back without Jesus, and the officers said: “Never has another man spoken like this.” In turn the Pharisees answered: “You have not been misled also, have you? Not one of the rulers or of the Pharisees has put faith in him, has he?” (John 7:45-48) Even these men with great wisdom and high education who had the Hebrew Scriptures handy in scrolls, men who were supposed to be the representatives of God, had no faith in the Son of God. They argued that no rulers or Pharisees had put faith in him. Have things changed much in our day? Who turn out to be the true Christians?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Look around the world. Check the nations’ rulers since World War I began, A.D. 1914. Consider: Kaiser Wilhelm of Germany, a so-called Christian out for world domination; Adolf Hitler, a Catholic German dictator who signed a concordat with the pope in 1933; and Mussolini, who with the blessing of the Catholic Church invaded Ethiopia. Have these dictators acted the part of true Christians? They did attend church, did they not? But do you think God called these men to be heirs with Christ Jesus? Were these rulers in their positions “by divine right” and walking in the footsteps of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ? He did not choose the ‘rulers or the Pharisees’ as a whole to be his followers, did he? It does not appear that he is choosing them today. The faithful followers of Jesus, Peter and John, Matthew and others, were not of the ruling class. True, Paul was a converted Pharisee, but how true were his words: ‘Not many powerful were called’! Besides, here is what James had to say about the matter: “God chose the ones who are poor respecting the world to be rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom, which he promised to those who love him, did he not?” (Jas. 2:5) Persons who are trying to walk as Christians should keep these scriptures in mind and walk in humility and show love to their fellowman.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">What must one do really to put up a fine fight for the faith if he is a man in politics, business or religion? If someone rich and powerful comes to a knowledge of the truth and declares himself a real Christian, then let him listen to Paul’s stern words written to Timothy: “Give orders to those who are rich in the present system of things not to be high-minded, and to rest their hope, not on uncertain riches, but on God, who furnishes us all things richly for our enjoyment; to work at good, to be rich in fine works, to be liberal, ready to share, safely treasuring up for themselves a fine foundation for the future, in order that they may get a firm hold on the real life.” (1 Tim. 6:17-19) Rich men should be helped to realize that this life in the present evil world is transitory and not until anyone really dedicates his life to the service of Jehovah God and walks in the footsteps of Christ Jesus, preaching the good news of God’s kingdom, can he ever get “a firm hold on the real life.” Jesus said: “Whoever wants to save his soul [life] will lose it; but whoever loses his soul [life] for the sake of me and the good news will save it.” (Mark 8:35) Being a faithful Christian does not mean being a member of a “church” having a fine building. Being a Christian means living as one according to the Word of God, offering “the fine public declaration in front of many witnesses.” Are you doing this? If you are not, you can! It will take faith and courage to do so, but it can be done and is being done by those who truly love Jehovah God and his kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">ACCEPT RESPONSIBILITY</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah’s witnesses around the world have a responsibility to help every Christian and person of goodwill who seeks truth and righteousness to “fight the fine fight of the faith” and to “get a firm hold on the everlasting life.” (1 Tim. 6:12) How do Jehovah’s witnesses help people find this kind of faith to fight for? First, an individual must hear the good news. But in order to hear there must be a preacher. (Rom. 10:13-15) In Christ’s time the disciples listened to their teacher and then were taught to go from house to house. Jesus said: “Go on telling them, ‘The kingdom of God has come near to you.’” (Luke 10:9) His little band of seventy faithful followers must have spent many hours talking about the kingdom of God to individuals that they had never before met. But that was the will of God. On the day of Pentecost after the holy spirit descended upon the 120 persons in the upper room Peter spoke to thousands of interested people and there were 3,000 who “embraced his word heartily” and dedicated their lives to Jehovah’s service through his Son Jesus Christ and were baptized. They became true Christians, and “they continued devoting themselves to the teaching of the apostles.” (Acts 2:41, 42) They must have gone to all the homes in Jerusalem in a short time and from there returned home after Pentecost to scatter throughout the land, where thousands more heard the good news and came into the Christian congregation. The true ministry of Christ had begun!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In those days when Christ’s disciples preached the good news there was no record kept of the time spent in their preaching work. But today, that the Watch Tower Society may know where the preaching work has been accomplished, it keeps a record of the hours spent by Jehovah’s witnesses talking to people about God’s kingdom. During the twelve months from September 1, 1961, to August 31, 1962, Jehovah’s witnesses spent 142,046,679 hours preaching the good news of the Kingdom publicly. That is 9,351,139 more hours than they spent the year before in their field service. Where did they spend all this time preaching? Consult the chart on pages 30-37 and you will see the list of 189 countries, protectorates, islands of the sea and colonies where Jehovah’s witnesses preached the good news in cities, villages, hamlets, on rural roads, in offices, business houses, anywhere, everywhere, when they had the opportunity of talking to people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Who did all this preaching? True Christians, Jehovah’s witnesses, men and women, young and old, all dedicated to doing the will of Jehovah God. These ministers went from house to house and, where they could arrange to study with people in their homes, they did so. Those who spend 150 hours or more in the field work each month are called special pioneers. Some of these are missionaries who have graduated from the Watchtower Bible School of Gilead. All together during the year there were, on an average, 6,934 special pioneers engaged in the work every month. Then there were 26,626 pioneers who spent about 100 hours each month declaring the message of salvation. They worked in the territory of their own congregations or went out on their own into places where the need was great for telling out the good news, in isolated places, as special pioneers do. Then there are those Christians who have secular occupations and families to care for. They may be carpenters, farmers, office workers or factory workers. They cannot arrange their time to spend 100 or 150 hours a month in the ministry, but they do strive to spend a minimum of ten hours each month in the preaching activity being carried on in all parts of the earth. There were 887,360 of these witnesses of Jehovah working diligently in all parts of the world. They are called congregation publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">From this we see there were, on an average every month throughout the year, 920,920 different persons, all Jehovah’s witnesses, who preached and taught from God’s Word and who enjoyed spending time telling other people about God’s kingdom. They love peace and righteousness and want to tell others about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There were many other people who associated with Jehovah’s witnesses during the year that spent some time in different months talking to others about this wonderful hope and about the things they learned from God’s Word. Therefore some months there were peaks in the number of proclaimers of the good news, and so at one or more times there were 989,192 different individuals who were in the field service. We hope that they continue in this grand work of announcing the King and Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">While we are on this point of ministers, it should be pointed out that during the 1962 service year there were 36,333 more ministers in the field </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">on the average every month</span><span class="font6"> than there were during the previous year, or an increase of 4.1 percent. However, please observe in checking the chart that there are twelve countries where it is unwise to show how many publishers there are in each country, and in these lands there was a 9.6-percent decrease. This is due to the scarcity of reports from some countries. We earnestly feel, however, that it is only due to communication difficulties between Jehovah’s workers in lands where Jehovah’s witnesses must work underground that the available information makes this report lower. In a number of the countries behind the Iron Curtain there have been marked increases. If the local government under totalitarian rule knew just how many witnesses of Jehovah there were in each country they would push harder against them. It is of real interest, too, to point out in the chart, page 36, that in the 177 countries outside the very troublesome areas there was an increase of 46,798 more publishers. This is an increase of 6 percent in publishers, whereas for the whole world, taking into consideration the losses behind the Iron Curtain, the increase was only 4.1 percent. So there really has been a fine ingathering of those who love truth and righteousness during the 1962 service year, and it is marvelous in our eyes. Think of the difficulties in Russia, Poland, Spain, Portugal, Ethiopia and other parts of our earth! In many places, however, persecution against Jehovah’s witnesses has been overcome, and this is due to their trust in Jehovah God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">LITERATURE PLACEMENTS AND BIBLE STUDIES</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">These faithful Christians who go from house to house not only preach with their lips but also leave Bible literature with the people, that they may better understand the Word of God. During the twelve months of 1962 Jehovah’s people placed 4,680,233 Bibles and books and 11,664,763 booklets in 189 different lands in 158 languages. Christ Jesus commanded: “This good news of the kingdom will be preached in all the inhabited earth for a witness to all the nations; and then the end will come.” (Matt. 24:14) He foretold this work that Jehovah’s witnesses would do and are doing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Other publications that Jehovah’s witnesses use to spread the good news of God’s kingdom are magazines, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font6"> They obtained in their house-to-house witnessing work 1,386,404 new subscriptions. This was 63,709 more</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">subscriptions than were obtained the year before. You may often have seen Jehovah’s witnesses on the street corners presenting the magazines </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font6"> to passersby, or they may have stopped at your home or store and offered you these magazines. By doing this kind of work they distributed 112,788,689 copies of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! The Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> is printed in 65 languages, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font6"> in 25 languages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The work of God’s Christian ministers does not end with the placement of Bible literature. Jehovah’s witnesses return to the homes of the people and offer to answer their Bible questions. Many people are willing to have Jehovah’s witnesses call regularly so that Bible studies can be conducted in their own homes. Each week there were 654,210 different home Bible studies conducted throughout the world by Jehovah’s witnesses. What a fine way to help a family, the father, the mother and the children, as well as neighbors who might come to visit! What a changed outlook toward world conditions comes to those who study God’s Word of prophecy! With such studies whole families can “fight the fine fight of the faith.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Not only did Jehovah’s witnesses spend freely of their own money to travel to different parts of their territory to preach and conduct home Bible studies, but hundreds of thousands of dollars were spent by local congregations of Jehovah’s witnesses to sponsor public meetings, in all parts of the world. They arranged 793,136 public meetings. At the close of the year there were 22,166 congregations of Jehovah’s witnesses, arranged in 1,725 circuits. The circuits were grouped into 209 districts. Regular visits are made by circuit and district servants, appointed by the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania, to each one of these congregations so as to help them with their problems and their ministry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">WATCH TOWER BIBLE AND TRACT SOCIETY</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The name Jehovah’s witnesses is known around the world. It is also well known that these Christian witnesses of Jehovah distribute a magazine called “The Watchtower” in all the principal tongues of the earth. What is the connection between Jehovah’s witnesses and the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society? Jehovah’s witnesses are people that come from all nations, kindreds and tongues, and from all walks of life, men and women who are dedicated to the service of Jehovah God. They are unincorporated, but no matter where they are in the earth they work at unity, to the end that the good news of God’s kingdom will be preached in all the world for a witness to all the nations.—Mark 13:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">To carry on this tremendous task of the ministry they need a formal organization under which they can work, one that is recognized by the governments of the earth. So, many years ago, in 1884, the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania was organized. This corporation sees to it that </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> is printed in many tongues, sixty-five different languages at the present time, to aid Jehovah’s witnesses worldwide in their ministerial activity. In addition to this, the Watch Tower Society also publishes and purchases Bibles in many tongues and carries on a worldwide distribution of these. The Society publishes bound books, pamphlets and tracts in the millions of copies and distributes these in scores of languages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In addition to the Pennsylvania corporation there is also the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society of New York, Inc., and the headquarters of this corporation are located at 124 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn, New York. The Pennsylvania corporation also has an office at this same address in addition to its Pennsylvania address, and from the headquarters building in Brooklyn the work of Jehovah’s witnesses is supervised.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Pennsylvania corporation looks after the work in all the countries and islands of the earth. The New York corporation owns the property in New York city. It has two large twelve-story buildings, one across the street from the other, and a few blocks away it has a large printing plant, covering two New York city blocks. As Jehovah’s witnesses increase their demands for literature for distribution in order to carry on Bible studies, the printing organization continues to expand too. Some years the expansion of printing facilities is in the United States, at other times building of printing plants is done in other lands. The Pennsylvania corporation looks after this expansion in countries outside the United States. Both corporations work closely together to one end, that is, to keep Jehovah’s witnesses supplied with all the things they need in their ministry. These corporations also send out district servants, circuit servants, appoint congregation servants, and other representatives through their respective branch offices.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In addition to these two corporations there are a number of other corporations that Jehovah’s witnesses have organized, such as the International Bible Students Association of Canada, the International Bible Students Association of Great Britain and similar societies in different countries. All these Bible societies cooperate one with the other to get the good news of God’s kingdom preached everywhere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The headquarters of the Bible Society is situated in Brooklyn, New York, as mentioned above, and here there is a Bethel home where 676 people worked together throughout all of last year taking care of office work, translating magazines and books into various languages, operating linotype machines and large printing presses and bindery equipment so as to put this printed information in proper shape for mailing and shipping to the ends of the earth. These people, living together as a family, are known as the Bethel family.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">They all receive the same allowance no matter what assignment of work they may have. They have dedicated their lives to the service of Jehovah God and have left their homes in various parts of the world to come to Brooklyn to work and serve the interests of the Kingdom and their brothers worldwide.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is a happy family and it is a delight to be a member of it. Living together as one big family, they have their needs taken care of as a family. Each one has his room, which is properly cared for by sisters in the family. There is a large kitchen run by brothers that provides the meals for all these people. We have large dining rooms where all the family can sit down together at one time. In the morning the entire Bethel family considers the daily text and comments that appear in this </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook.</span><span class="font5"> The discussion lasts for about twenty minutes each morning. After this discussion a prayer is addressed to Jehovah God on behalf of all the members of the family and our fellow workers throughout the world. Then breakfast is served, and by eight o’clock all persons are at their respective assignments of work in the home, the office, the factory, the translation departments, shipping and trucking, whatever it may be, and their regular working time each day except Saturday is eight and three-quarters hours.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There is something about this family and the work they do that you will not find evident anywhere else. To begin with, they do their work because they love Jehovah God. They do not work for financial gain. While they each receive an allowance of $14 monthly, still the great volume of work they do is performed as to Jehovah God, and they do it with a zeal peculiar to those who have dedicated their lives to the service of the Grand Creator. However, their work is not finished after they have spent eight and three-quarters hours at their assigned work in the home or the factory or the office. During the evenings and on weekends this family are out in the witness work calling at the homes of the people throughout the city of New York, conducting Bible studies or attending Bible meetings themselves, advancing in their own knowledge of the Bible. They are interested in their spiritual welfare and in gaining spiritual maturity. They are constantly seeking to equip themselves better for every good work. Not only do they take in this spiritual food from the Bible, but they are intensely interested in calling at the homes of the people, as they have the opportunity, in order to tell out the good news of the kingdom of God, as did the followers of Christ in the first century. They arrange to return to visit those interested in learning more about the Bible and to study the Bible with such ones in their homes during their free time from their regular work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is truly a busy family, a devoted and dedicated family. It is a family that has one interest in mind and that is making known the name of God, Jehovah, and announcing his kingdom. It is their joy to cooperate with their brothers and sisters throughout the whole earth and they do this by printing literature in 158 languages and then shipping such literature to the lands where it can be read. What a joy they have in performing this labor of love in behalf of their fellow workers and all mankind!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There are other members of this Bethel family who do not live in Brooklyn Heights. These other members live at what is known as Kingdom Farm. There is one farm located in New Jersey about fifty miles from Brooklyn, and the other farm is situated in New York state about 250 miles away from Brooklyn. On these farms we have brothers from different parts of the United States who work throughout the year to supply the Bethel family with good, wholesome food. They raise many kinds of vegetables, run a dairy farm to produce milk, cheese and butter, and provide much meat, eggs, fowl and other necessities of life. By operating these farms the cost of food can be kept at a minimum. By keeping down the cost of food and by each member of the family volunteering his time and efforts in this wonderful work given to Christians, the cost of publications is kept down also, and thus many more people can be reached with this good news of the Kingdom. For example, the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> magazine subscription for one year can be obtained for one dollar. It is sent to a person’s home twice each month, or twenty-four times in one year, anywhere in the world. Bound books of 384 pages can be had for the nominal contribution of $.50 anywhere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s witnesses working in the Bethel home and on these farms feel that they are making a real contribution to mankind in bringing them a comforting message that sets forth to them the true hope for man from God’s Word. They can establish peoples’ faith in God and in his Son, Christ Jesus, through the written word of God, the Holy Bible. The Bethel family thus have three principal things in their minds, namely, working day by day at the Society’s headquarters on important literature that will help mankind find the way to life, building up their spiritual understanding of the Word of God by their personal study, and preaching the good news of God’s kingdom from house to house as they have opportunity. These three principal things in their lives keep them extremely busy but joyful in God’s service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There are similar Bethel homes in all parts of the world, as the Society has eighty-seven branches, and in these eighty-seven countries, islands and territories we have Bethel homes with the same arrangements as in Brooklyn, New York. These branches are not as large as the headquarters in New York. Sometimes there are only two or three in the family, but the same purpose in life is demonstrated by these individuals in these Bethel homes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">So the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania and the New York Society, and these other societies in all parts of the world are instruments that are being used by Jehovah’s witnesses worldwide to get the good news of God’s kingdom preached. Jesus said: “Go therefore and make disciples of people of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the holy spirit, teaching them to observe all the things I have commanded you.” (Matt. 28:19, 20) That is what Jehovah’s witnesses do. There are 1,423 members of the Bethel families living at the eighty-seven branch offices of the Watch Tower Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">COURAGEOUS MINISTERS DISTRICT ASSEMBLIES</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Reports have come in from all parts of the world saying that the brothers everywhere appreciated very much the arrangement the Society made this year to have assemblies well scattered over the territories of the different countries. It made it convenient for the brothers to get to these fine assemblies and to hear the excellent information that was presented in the discourses. Numerous comments were received concerning the instructive service meeting and in particular the outstanding discourses giving the correct understanding of the “superior authorities.” Many were the expressions of appreciation for the discussion on The Word and the information in the public talk. It was evident that this series of assemblies worldwide was upbuilding, and the spiritual food that the brothers received during the three days should <a name="bookmark185"></a><a name="bookmark186"></a>reflect itself in the good work that will be done during the new service year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A very interesting letter was received from a brother who is of the anointed remnant class and who has been faithfully carrying on the work of preaching the good news of the Kingdom for many, many years. He states: “This is just a word from one of your brothers to tell you how much good was set forth in this summer’s conventions. Biblical information on preaching, teaching and helping the brothers had the yeartext threading its way through all the convention talks. It impresses me much to see what loving concern and patience is being given to the brothers, the weak as well as the strong; the young and the old. All are putting up a hard fight to live in this vile world. But I think the brothers in the governing body of Jehovah’s organization showed much courage in setting forth the new truths of Romans, chapter thirteen, and First Peter, chapter two. With great interest I listened to the arguments given on the subject of the Superior Authorities. It was very conclusive. It has far-reaching implications as well. Caesar will see that God has a people who respect him for what he is but who will hold loyal to Jehovah as well. It is easy to see that our God Jehovah is directing this wonderful organization and its work when men can be humble and honest and set forth the unfolding truth as it is revealed to them. (Prov. 4:18) It is a joy to be associated with our brothers together in this wonderful day.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another expression came from Canada, wherein it was stated: “The clearer understanding on the superior authorities comes at just the time when our relations with human governments must be understood and conscientiously pursued. The answer to the identity of ‘the Word’ is a strong refutation to use with trinitarians. The material that was discussed on the Friday evening service meeting will be of benefit for a long time to come.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Word comes from Sweden: “At Fagersta a young man turned up who attends an Adventist missionary school. This was the first meeting of Jehovah’s witnesses that he had ever attended. He became so enthused already the first day that he called up his mother and sister who live in another town and told them to take the first train they could and come to the assembly, which they did. He himself went out in the house-to-house work with one of the brothers and by himself with the magazines in the street work.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The convention had an effect on those in the truth a long time, those in just for a few years or months, and even new ones associating for the first time. Truly it was a Courageous Ministers District Assembly, and the excellent public talk, which was entitled “Take Courage—God’s Kingdom Is at Hand,” carried a wonderful and comforting message to those who love righteousness. By no means has the full report come in yet on the number of those who attended all these assemblies, but by the end of the service year, that is, by August 31, the following countries reported their public meeting attendances along with the number baptized.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">TOTAL PUBLIC MEETING ATTENDANCE FOR ABOVE RE</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">PORTS: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;626,566</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">TOTAL BAPTIZED FOR ABOVE REPORTS: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12,191</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is wonderful to observe that 12,191 lovers of righteousness were baptized at the above-listed Courageous Ministers District Assemblies. This is an incomplete report because this series of conventions will go on throughout the winter months in the Southern Hemisphere. But it took courage for these people to come forward and make a stand for God’s kingdom publicly. We rejoice with them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It also took courage for a number of others who were not counted in with those above who were rebaptized, evidently due to the information appearing in the article in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> shortly before this series of conventions on the matter of baptism, wherein it was pointed out that, if people were not living a proper kind of life morally and were baptized while not appreciating their dedication to God, nor knowing fully what it meant, they should be rebaptized. Quite a few were rebaptized in some countries. In fact, in one country the percentage of those rebaptized went as high as 9 percent. Of course, these were not counted in the numbers baptized for the first time, as listed above. This brings home very forcefully the responsibility that comes upon those already dedicated to God and who are teaching newly interested ones, namely, that, when holding Bible studies with persons in their homes, we should not try to hurry them into baptism, but we should give them a full understanding of Jehovah’s purposes, what requirements and responsibilities go with dedication and baptism and be sure that they know their lives must be morally clean and in proper order for this important step in their lives. Dedication and baptism are steps that everyone must take if he is going to gain everlasting life. However, it is not a formalism. Therefore there is no reason to be baptized if one is unclean or does not understand fully what he is doing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Many fine and interesting points were brought to the attention of Jehovah's people at the Courageous Ministers Assemblies, and now courageously Jehovah God’s people will go on in the good work of preaching the good news of God’s kingdom throughout all the earth. —Matt. 24:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">OVERSEERS OF JEHOVAH’S WITNESSES</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the days of the early church there were a number of the elderly men appointed to direct the affairs of the congregations of God. As people came to know the truth of God’s Word they gathered together in small groups, and these people, having one faith and studying the Word of God together, formed a congregation. Of course, all these small groups together truly formed the worldwide congregation of God. The apostles first traveled to various locations to meet with these groups. By holy spirit directing the apostles appointments were made of overseers to shepherd the congregation of God, which he purchased with the blood of his own Son. (Acts 20:28) As the early Christian organization of Jehovah’s witnesses grew it was necessary to appoint more men to look after the best interests of these congregations, and it was a fine thing for a dedicated man to seek this office. That is what Paul told Timothy: “If any man is reaching out for an office of overseer, he is desirous of a fine work.”—1 Tim. 3:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As it was in the days of the early Christian congregations, so it must be now, because we have the same instruction from God in his written Word. The Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania, working in conjunction with all the other societies that direct the work of Jehovah’s witnesses, makes appointments of overseers for the congregations in the different territories. These servants must meet the qualifications set forth in First Timothy, the third chapter, and in the book of Titus, the first chapter. Men meeting these qualifications are delighted to show zeal in the preaching of the good news of the Kingdom and to direct the affairs of the congregation so that there may be peace and righteousness manifested by all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The affairs of the congregation must be guided so that all those meeting together will incite one another to love and right works. Furthermore, with an overseer shepherding the congregation, he will see to it that the people do meet together in the interests of the Kingdom and to the praise of Jehovah’s name. While the congregation is a unit and is assigned a definite territory by the Society in which to preach the good news, still all these congregations are tied together one with the other through the circuits and districts and the national assemblies that are held from time to time. This instills unity throughout the whole organization. The Society appoints men of maturity and zeal to visit the various congregations. These are called circuit servants. Then there are other individuals who look after greater areas and these are termed district servants. These men are appointed to a special service that gives assistance to the overseers of the various congregations. It is appropriate that these men be listed in the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses</span><span class="font5"> along with zone servants and branch servants and members of the Bethel family, all who have been in the full-time service for many years. It would be impossible to list all qualified special representatives of the Society who are ordained ministers, but we do set out here a list of some receiving special appointments.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">WATCHTOWER BIBLE SCHOOL OF GILEAD</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Monday, November 27, 1961, was a big day in the Bethel home in Brooklyn. The whole Bethel family was excited because this was graduation day for the 36th class of Gilead. To the students it was a day looked forward to because now they had finished their very enjoyable series of studies and Bible research. They had learned how to carry on more effectively their ministry to which they had dedicated their lives. They had lived with the Bethel family for over ten months and had worked with them in the factory, office and home. They had enjoyed working in the field with a number of the congregations in the city of New York. They had had the opportunity of going on many educational tours in the city, which were part of the course. So a wonderful year of training had come to a close. Now they were ready for their new assignments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Over 600 members of the Bethel family were excited because now for the first time all the members of the Bethel family in Brooklyn could attend the graduation of Gilead School. It was a time of delight and pleasure for the students, the instructors and the Bethel family. This is what happened.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Earlier in the day Brother Knorr had announced that for this special occasion the factory, office and home would be closed at three o’clock in the afternoon, for the program would begin at 3:30. Due to limited space for seating, the program would be confined to the students and members of the Bethel family. As the crowd entered the beautiful Kingdom Hall they viewed a breath-taking arrangement of flowers on and around the platform. Before 3:30 the auditorium and the school lecture hall upstairs in the second-floor school area were full, with 720 attending. After brief talks of encouragement and counsel by the four instructors, telegrams of congratulation from many parts of the earth were read, followed by comments from the factory and home servants. Brother Franz, the Society’s vice-president, then gave fine Scriptural admonition before the main address by Brother Knorr, president of the Society, on courage and hearts united in the fear of Jehovah. Then the president handed diplomas to eighty-six of the hundred graduates, giving more details on the work each would be doing in one of the fifty-three lands to which this student body would be assigned. To conclude the session one of the students read a heartfelt resolution of appreciation and determination by the graduates to apply their training in their new assignments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">After intermission for the evening meal the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> study was held, with selected students giving brief comments to the questions. Then Brother Knorr called on students from forty-four countries for farewell comments. These proved to be very enjoyable as the students expressed their appreciation of the school and the association with the Bethel family, and their view of the work ahead of them in their assignments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In a short time all were on their way to their assignments. Letters were received from the New York congregations to which they had been assigned, expressing appreciation of the fine ministerial work done by these brothers during their stay and the encouragement, help and unifying force they had been to the congregations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Now within a few days of all this excitement some of the students of the 37th class began arriving, in December. These were foreign-speaking students who needed special training in English. For ten hours a day these students were reciting, reading and preparing written assignments, using varied reading material so as to get vocabulary and a grasp of English language structure. Gilead instructors taught during the day and volunteer members of the Bethel family gave more individualized instruction with small groups during the evening hours.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As opening day approached, the total enrollment of 104 students arrived, were registered, taken on a tour of the Bethel home and factory, and on February 5 school was opened with a talk by the Society’s president. On that Monday evening, after the Bethel family’s weekly study of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font5"> the new students introduced themselves to the family and gave experiences from their homelands. It was found that this 37th class embraced fifty-two countries, from five continents and many isles of the sea.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It will not be long now before the 37th class of Gilead graduates, but a report on this will come next year. We set forth here the names of those who graduated in the 36th class.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">KINGDOM MINISTRY SCHOOL.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Watch Tower Society is very conscious of proper education, and the highest education anyone can receive is the knowledge contained in God’s Word. It was Jesus who said: “This means everlasting life, their taking in knowledge of you, the only true God, and of the one whom you sent forth, Jesus Christ.” (John 17:3) Since this is true of everyone in Jehovah’s organization, it must of necessity be true of overseers who are looking after the flock of God. Considering the educational program of the Society, what is occurring week by week in each congregation in connection with the theocratic ministry school is marvelous. Here all persons, from youths to older ones, are invited to go to school, and they are all taking good advantage of this. In order to aid the overseers to be better qualified to care for their local congregation and their theocratic ministry schools, the congregation servants have been invited to the Kingdom Ministry School arranged for in different countries throughout the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The same course is taught to all overseers in their own language, and it has been arranged for the congregation servants to come to a certain location, usually a Kingdom Hall in some city, where twenty-five or more overseers are taught what an overseer should do. In larger countries, like Britain and Germany, this school continues for years, while in some of the small countries all the overseers have now received the training through the Kingdom Ministry School. However, everywhere the brothers acting as congregation overseers are given an opportunity to take this special training in the Kingdom Ministry School course.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the United States, where we have the largest number of congregations of any country in the world, one hundred overseers and special pioneers are trained at one time. The school in the United States is located at the Kingdom Farm in South Lansing, New York. The registrar of this school reports the following on the activity during the past year:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">By Jehovah’s undeserved kindness we have completed our third fiscal year for the Kingdom Ministry School here in the United States. It has been a happy year of Kingdom service. It has been a particular joy to be serving with so many mature brothers being brought from all over the country. The year certainly was fittingly climaxed by the spiritual refreshment brought us at Courageous Ministers District Assemblies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We are glad to report that 1,010 completed the course during the year, of which 76 were sisters of the special pioneer status. Since the Kingdom Ministry School has been established at South Lansing, 2,077 brothers and 205 sisters, or a total of 2,282, have gone through the school since March, 1959.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Gilead School in Brooklyn, New York, which covers a ten-month course, calls in circuit servants, district servants, branch servants and people from branch offices in all parts of the world and trains them in organization to a much higher degree than the Kingdom Ministry School. However, what is taught in the Kingdom Ministry School is also included in the ten-month course at Gilead School, so that everyone is fully acquainted with the main things that every overseer should know.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Kingdom Ministry School has certainly had Jehovah’s rich blessing upon it, and the knowledge that the overseers are gaining is reflecting itself in the spiritual blessings received by the brothers in the various congregations throughout the world. Maturity on the part of the greater number of brothers is now being manifest, and this maturity can only be gained by studying the Word of God, which all people who are dedicated to Jehovah must do. So the Society has three fine schools in operation, the Theocratic Ministry School in every congregation throughout the world, the Kingdom Ministry School under the direction of each branch, and Gilead School in the United States for training servants of God from all parts of the world. Jehovah’s witnesses are certainly education-minded, and what they all want to have is knowledge of Jehovah and his beloved Son, Christ Jesus, for this means everlasting life to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">UNITED STATES OF AMERICA</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 286,908 Population: 182,062,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 635</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The congregations of Jehovah’s witnesses in the United States of America enjoyed a healthful increase during the 1962 service year. On the average, there were 18,755 more publishers of the good news of the Kingdom going from house to house than during the previous service year. A new alltime peak of 286,908 publishers was reached. Now the responsibility falls upon all the overseers and congregation publishers to aid these new ones to keep on proving their integrity. It was a real joy to learn that 22,023 persons were baptized in the United States during the past twelve months. This is the largest number of persons baptized in any one year to date. So there has been a steady ingathering in this country. Individuals have been learning the truth and have come to an appreciation that this good news of God’s kingdom must be preached and that they must be baptized in the name of the Father, the Son and the holy spirit and follow the commandments as set forth in God’s Word. This they are doing, to the joy of all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">One of the delightful things in the report for the United States concerns the pioneer activity. Special attention was given this feature of the ministry by the Society during the year. The circuit and district servants stressed this work, and the response was excellent. In fact, 2,553 individuals were appointed to serve as regular pioneers and an additional 26,098 joined in the pioneer service sometime during the year as vacation pioneers. Due to this the American territory had the best witness ever given by special pioneers and pioneers. During the year the United States averaged 683 special pioneers in the field, the highest number to date, and 9,323 pioneers, which includes the vacation pioneers. What a joy it is for all the brothers in America to say that during the year we averaged 10,006 engaged in pioneer service! It is our prayer and hope that during the 1963 service year this average will be maintained and even increased.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Another happy observation is that now we have 4,564 congregations in the country as compared with 4,333 a year ago. This necessitates a reorganization of the circuits in the United States so that every congregation will be getting the service of a circuit servant at least once every four months. This will require more mature overseers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Another very important feature of the service increased during the year, namely, the average hours of the congregation publishers. They were able to average 9.7 hours during the 1962 service year. Maybe this year the publishers will be able to average ten hours. Everything in the report shows a healthful trend, which gives us reason to believe that many, many thousands more will associate themselves with Jehovah’s witnesses in the United States by the time of the 1963 Worldwide Assembly of Jehovah’s Witnesses. The branch servant gives us some very interesting experiences that took place during the past year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Two months this year were spent in Bible distribution, with over a half million Bibles being placed. One brother placed a Bible and when he called back the lady asked for four more, as she had talked so enthusiastically to her friends they wanted copies also. Another brother who manages a small hotel found he could place many copies of the Bible by leaving it out on the desk and discussing its merits when people inquired about it as they checked in and out. One circuit servant wrote: “Offering the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures</span><span class="font5"> to the people and seeing real joy come over their faces has brought unspeakable joy and happiness to me and much comfort to the sheeplike ones. It has been the greatest month yet. I set a personal goal of two a day, and by the end of December I had placed sixtyseven Bibles.” Many younger publishers found they could place two or more Bibles each time they went out by using the simplified sermons suggested by the Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An extensive effort was made to cover all unassigned territory in the United States this year, with the result that 758 out of a possible 849 unassigned counties were worked. Over 70 counties that had not been worked for nine or more years were covered by 77 special pioneers who individually averaged 185 hours, 84 books, 20 subscriptions and 400 magazines each month. A number of persons who had published while with a congregation and had become inactive when moving into unassigned territory were found and aided to share in the service and encouraged to continue working as isolated publishers. Much trading for literature was done. One special pioneer couple who placed 429 books and 2,733 magazines wrote: “Because of the extreme poverty, it was necessary to do a lot of bartering. We got enough almost to start a grocery store. We traded for fresh vegetables and fruits, canned vegetables and fruits, jams, jellies, honey, live and frozen chickens, eggs, frozen meat, towels and washcloths. We also traded for a total of 1,616 soft-drink bottles. The stores allowed three cents for each bottle. So 25 bottles would cover the cost of a </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font5"> book. One day we went home with 334 bottles. When bartering for foodstuffs we let the householder set his own value on things. They would usually want to give us more than what we figured the literature was worth.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One sister on her way to do magazine work was stopped at a railroad crossing for the switching of a long freight train. Several cars were parked in front of her and behind her waiting for the train to move on. Not wishing to pass up an opportunity to place magazines, she got out of her car and went from car to car placing magazines. In just a few minutes she placed twenty-one magazines and obtained one subscription.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Sermon Outlines</span><span class="font5"> booklet has been a great help to all who have used it. Two brothers were called upon to be the guests on a radio program where the radio audience is allowed to telephone in their questions for immediate answer by the guests. One of the brothers wrote: “During the course of the two hours we answered fifty-seven inquiries, ranging from the blood issue and flag salute to the Kingdom and Kingdom Halls. The brother and I were able to give Scriptural proof of all our statements with the aid of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Sermon Outlines </span><span class="font5">booklet. It really drew our attention to the importance of knowing and becoming familiar with this quickreference help.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Calling back even when people do not take literature but manifest interest is important. One brother found this to be true when he called back on a schoolteacher who had many questions. After a three-and-a-half-hour discussion with this sincere Catholic man and his wife, they accepted a book and arrangements were made for a study. Soon the man discontinued his practice of going to church every morning and the local priest called to warn him that if he did not discontinue studying he would no longer be allowed to teach school and the priest would see to it that no one would patronize his part-time dancing school. Upon telling later of these threats and intimidation, he said, “How could I have ever believed that organization practiced true Christianity?” Later, his brother, a priest, came to “save” him. After having his arguments all turned aside by the Scriptures, the priest worked himself into such a rage that he threw a chair across the room and left without saying goodby. Two weeks later the man and his wife were baptized and now have a service center in their home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">MANY LEGAL PROBLEMS</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Green River ordinance has been a larger plague in the form of threats and interference than at any time in the past. While the number of instances of interference has been greater, it is significant to note that the “bark was greater than the bite.” Actually only three cases were instituted. This is evidence of Jehovah’s blessing. We hope and pray that city ordinances interfering with house-to-house witnessing will not be applied against Jehovah’s witnesses and that those who do try to apply them can be quieted down by explaining the rulings of the higher courts. The Society’s legal office has been very successful in doing this. It saves a lot of time and trouble.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There have been a number of cases in the courts with regard to zoning laws involving the construction of Kingdom Halls. There have been much prejudice and continued hatred against Jehovah’s witnesses in some communities, and these communities have desperately fought the issuance of building permits for the construction of Kingdom Halls. A landmark decision was added to a pile of thirty-two favorable decisions heretofore rendered by various state courts. The Supreme Court of Illinois handed down a favorable decision in the case of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Columbus Park Congregation of Jehovah’s Witnesses v. Board of Appeals of the City of Chicago. </span><span class="font5">In this decision it was stated, among other things: “The arguments advanced by defendants, if followed, would be sufficient to bar all religious worship from the commercial areas of Chicago. Such arbitrary prohibition is not consonant with the constitutional guarantees of freedom of religion, nor do we believe it is consistent with the intent of the ordinance. . . . We believe that the denial of a special use permit to plaintiffs is arbitrary and capricious and bears no substantial relation to the public health, safety and welfare. Plaintiffs have therefore been denied their constitutional rights in this case.” Kingdom Hall building by Jehovah's witnesses in the United States moves ahead at a good pace, although at different places in the country with keen opposition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Blood transfusion cases continue, but only involving children. The trouble in getting justice done on this subject is not in regard to adult witnesses of Jehovah. The doctors in the hospitals know that they cannot force a blood transfusion by law upon any adult witness of Jehovah. The device has proved successful only in the case of Jehovah’s witnesses under the age of twenty-one because of the legal theory that Caesar is the prime parent of all children in his realm and when the natural parents go contrary to Caesar’s opinions about what is best for a child Caesar’s will must prevail. This ancient doctrine of the law has been misapplied so as to defy the law of the Great God, Jehovah: “Any soul who eats any blood, that soul must be cut off from his people.” (Lev. 7:27) The judges, bowing down to the vague medical mystery pitched to them by Caesar, cast aside the fundamental rights of the parents under the Constitution to worship Jehovah and bring up their children in the authoritative advice of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There have been a number of cases brought to court by the Department of Justice in connection with the draft law in the United States. This has involved a number of Jehovah’s witnesses. At the present time there are seventy of Jehovah’s witnesses serving terms in prison, averaging one to three years, because of their taking a firm stand regarding their religious beliefs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another issue involving patriotism has cropped up in the schools in connection with the singing of the national anthem, and right now the matter is being tried in court in the state of Arizona. The Society through its legal office is defending some children.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There is one thing that all of Jehovah’s witnesses must be, whether young or old, and that is courageous. So, in harmony with the text that Jehovah’s witnesses have had in mind during the past year in particular, they will press on doing Jehovah’s will, declaring the good news of the Kingdom at every opportunity. They appreciate the words of the psalmist: “Be courageous and let your heart be strong. Yes, hope in Jehovah.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">PRINTING ACTIVITIES IN BROOKLYN</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Something we at Bethel have long hoped for was the time when the Bible would have the greatest production of any book in our factory. What a thrill it has been to see this hope realized this past year as 1,717,835 copies of the new Bible, the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures,</span><span class="font5"> were completed in our Brooklyn factory! This surpassed </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“Let Your Name Be Sanctified,”</span><span class="font5"> which was second in production this year, totaling 1,046,279.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Because Jehovah’s witnesses use the Bible constantly in their ministry, the Society saw the need to develop a deluxe binding section in our factory where we could produce a more durable Bible. This involved some new machinery in order to make the special flexible covers and gold-edged Bibles. After many months of working out problems, a production line was set in motion, and by the end of the service year the first 50,000 deluxe Bibles had been produced.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In 1954 the Society released a booklet entitled “This Good News of the Kingdom,” which has been very effective in carrying words of good news world-wide. It has also been very helpful as a textbook for starting home Bible studies with people interested in the good news about Jehovah’s kingdom. Since the release of this booklet 36,582,630 copies in 72 languages have been produced in the Brooklyn factory. The great demand for this timely booklet continues. In the past year there was a total distribution of 2,720,548 copies, far exceeding the distribution of any other booklet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Magazine production also continues to increase. Over the past year a total of 120,148,965 copies of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> magazines were produced in the Brooklyn plant, an increase of five million in one year! The production of these magazines involves a great deal of organization and scheduling, because in the Brooklyn factory alone </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> is printed in twenty-four different languages and the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> in twelve languages, most of which are semimonthly. This totals fifty-four different magazine issues per month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">To keep up with our heavy printing schedule a new large magazine press, capable of producing 25,000 magazines per hour, was installed. With the installation of this press we now have sixteen high-speed, web, rotary printing presses. Adding to these all our other presses of various sizes and varieties brings the total number of presses in the Brooklyn plant to thirty-one. You probably wonder how much paper is required to keep all these presses running. This past year our paper consumption was 8,907 tons. This was an increase of 258 tons over the previous year.</span></p><img src="yb1963_E_files/yb1963_E-4.png" alt="" style="width:239pt;height:191pt;">
<p><span class="font5">We kept our ink room busy, too, manufacturing 257,282 pounds of ink during the year. Another commodity necessary for completing this printed material as finished publications is adhesive. To meet this demand we manufactured 172,028 pounds of adhesives. Our final step was to ship or mail out all this completed literature to different parts of the world. The cost for freight, postage, and other shipping costs came to $875,249.69.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">REPORT ON OTHER TERRITORIES UNDER THE UNITED STATES BRANCH</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Brooklyn branch office is very much interested in territory not under the jurisdiction of any other branch office. Sometimes these territories are widely scattered, but due to the fact that good communications can be maintained with these isolated territories and the United States, every attention possible is given to them. During this past year the Watch Tower Society looked after the islands of Bermuda, the island of Guam in the Pacific and Sudan in Africa. Here are some of the experiences the brothers have had in these places.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">BERMUDA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;53,640</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 60 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 894</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This has been the most progressive year in the history of the Bermuda congregation. Ten persons moved here to help us in the service, including a couple over seventy years of age who traveled over three thousand miles to get here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There was a good experience recently showing the value of inviting people at home Bible studies at an early date to attend meetings. A publisher made a call on a subscription expiration and found that the lady of the house was blind. Two or three return visits were made, but it was very difficult to determine the extent of the interest, as the lady was reluctant to comment or ask questions. However, the publisher gave her an invitation to attend the congregation meetings, even leaving his phone number and saying that he would be willing to pick the lady up if she desired to go. After two or three weeks the brother was surprised to receive a call requesting him to stop by and take the lady to the public meeting. Since that time she has attended meetings regularly, and a study has been started with her at which her son joins in, and there is a good prospect of other members of the family participating. Her son also attends meetings with her.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">GUAM &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;43,798</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 44 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 995</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We here on Guam benefit greatly from Jehovah’s arrangements through his visible organization, although we are somewhat isolated. Two new missionaries, who arrived here in June to assist with the work, were in the process of leaving to put placards in store windows when a man with whom they had studied only three times came along and asked them what they were going to do. When they told him, he said, “You need me to go along with you. Can I help too?” He could and did, staying out in the service all day with them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Society was able to send a representative to make a short visit to the Caroline and Marshall Islands this past service year. This territory covers about three million square miles, slightly larger than the United States. There are about 687 square miles of land and a combined population of about 75,000 persons. Four island groups were visited: Koror, Palau; Moen, Truk; Colonia, Ponape and Majuro, Marshall Islands. The people are friendly and want to learn more about God’s kingdom. Many names were obtained, and over 100 </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font5"> books, 150 </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“Good News”</span><span class="font5"> booklets as well as Bibles, magazines and tracts were placed. Thus, the work goes on apace, for which we are thankful to Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">SUDAN &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 10,262,674</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 37 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 277,370</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Many blessings have been experienced by the Witnesses in Sudan during the past service year. Among them were two visits by traveling representatives, and on each occasion a fine gathering was enjoyed. After the program we had the privilege of seeing six new ones symbolize their dedication.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One person has made application for the full-time ministry. She has put in almost special pioneer hours for the last year as a publisher. She is the mother of five children; four are now dedicated and her husband is a good brother as well. She is training her children to make the ministry their career.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Later on, in August, another special representative of the Society visited Sudan, and the Witnesses enjoyed their first truly three-day educational gathering. How grateful they were to receive the good, practical instructions on how to improve their personal ministry! Many in attendance took notes and gladly received the sound counsel. It was gratifying to see the peak attendance of fifty-five for the Sunday talk. Indeed, it was a fitting climax to this eventful weekend.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 428 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 556</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark187"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark188"></a>It is a pleasure to report that there is now a branch office established in Anchorage, Alaska. Jehovah has richly blessed the publishers of the Kingdom in the far north, and the work increased very rapidly during the year. The average increase was 27 percent. In addition to this fine increase there is much evidence of greater maturity on the part of many of the publishers. The local congregation arranged to build a branch office and living quarters on the second story of their Kingdom Hall and they have made a very fine branch home for those working there. Varied are the experiences that are had by our brothers in this part of the earth, and listed herein are a few of them as reported by the branch servant.</span></h3>
<p><span class="font5">There are many young people in the territory, and it is good to see children of school age looking to Jehovah’s new world as their hope for the future. The following experience was told at a recent circuit assembly: “I left a </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font5"> book with a woman and her young daughter and started a study with them. After about three studies the daughter told me that she had given an oral report in her science class and used the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font5"> book as reference material. The teacher was much impressed and asked where she got her material. The student showed her the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font5"> book and as a result she left three books and a new Bible with her classmates. The girl began attending meetings and is now a regular publisher.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In southeastern Alaska there are many islands and remote logging camps and fishing villages that can be reached only by boat or plane. To follow up interest in these remote places is very difficult. Usually the mail is the most effective means of keeping the interest alive. One of the publishers situated in an isolated logging camp remains a regular publisher, with above-average hours in the service, by corresponding with different ones. The following excerpt from a letter is typical: “I find I get much good from reading the books I got from you. I would like to start a study by mail because the more I read Jehovah’s Word and talk with Jehovah’s witnesses the more I believe you have something worth while.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There is much unassigned territory in the Yukon and in the interior and northern part of Alaska. Most of these are native communities of Eskimos and Indians. These can be reached only by plane, and due to the vast distances involved the cost of witnessing in these communities is high. However, this summer two of the brothers from Anchorage decided to spend their vacation witnessing in Nome. They took with them a carton of books and Bibles, some magazines and the Society’s film “Happiness of the New World Society.” They were able to show the film twice—in the local high school and the city jail—to a total of sixty-six people. The local people showed much interest in the Kingdom message, and in the one week that the two brothers worked the town they placed 63 Bibles and bound books, 76 booklets, 225 magazines and obtained six subscriptions. Arrangements have been made to make the back-calls by correspondence. There are yet many such communities throughout the territory that need to be witnessed to.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">ARGENTINA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;20,956,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 8,880 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 2,360</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The living conditions among the people of Argentina have been very unstable during the past year. Changes are continually taking place, and this leaves the people without a sure guide. In contrast with the old system of things the New World society moves steadily ahead preaching a sure thing, God’s kingdom, the only hope of the world. There have been a number of different mail strikes in Argentina during the past year and this has interfered with the work of the branch office in keeping in touch with all the congregations. It has also slowed down the movement of literature at times. Nevertheless, the water of truth continues to flow out like gentle rain upon newly sprouting grass. Jehovah’s witnesses in Argentina enjoyed fine increases in the pioneer service. They now have 235 congregations. They have just finished building a new Bethel home and branch office, a fine addition to what they already had, and the first class of the Kingdom Ministry School began at the close of the year. So with all their hardships in the country they have had unusual blessings. The branch servant gives us some interesting experiences from this country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A man and wife and little son started to study. Although the man had known something about the truth before, there were many things that he needed to set straight in his mind. After two months of studying and attending meetings, which was emphasized from the very beginning, both he and his wife started out in the service. What shows the importance of meeting attendance for new ones and helping them in the service is the fact that the very first month the man had in mind reaching the quotas of ten hours and twelve magazines. He was sick during the first month and at one of the studies mentioned his worry as to how he could reach the quota. It was suggested that he do what he could and next month work for the quota; but he was so determined that, when he was well, he dedicated Saturday and Sunday to the service. The next time the publisher had the study, the man, with a smile on his face, said: “I placed fifteen magazines and have been able to make ten hours; but I have not been able to make the six back-calls.” He was encouraged to continue with his good work. He has a study with his wife and little boy. This is the result when people of goodwill are encouraged to attend the meetings and hear the service announcements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The teaching qualities of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font5"> book are shown in this experience: The book was placed with a grandfather, but no interest was shown. His grandson of fifteen years of age read the book very carefully, and, though not knowing where there were any of Jehovah’s witnesses, he read the book for one year, clearly seeing the responsibility of preaching. He started this preaching work with some of the magazines that his grandfather had obtained from the publisher. One day the mother of this boy heard one of the Witnesses talking at a door; the address of the meeting place was taken, and this young boy started to attend with his mother. Three months after having contacted the Witnesses this young boy is a regular publisher with a twenty-hour average, making back-calls and conducting one study. This too shows the wisdom of the Society’s counsel to bring new ones to the meetings just as soon as possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The pioneer service was the theme of the year and special stress was given it by the Society as well as by the circuit and district servants at the district and circuit assemblies. The result of this special activity is appreciated from the number of pioneers on the list now. The peak pioneers for the 1961 service year was 415, and for this service year, 579, or 164 more pioneers enjoying this feature of the service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Think of the joy of taking the “word of life” to the people and the joy it brings to the ones who are working as pioneers! Two special pioneers were assigned to a place. After two years and nine months they have twenty-nine publishers, a 30-percent increase in the month of December. They dedicated a new Kingdom Hall and there were sixty-five present,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">AUSTRALIA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 10,508,191</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 15,927 Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 660</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah’s witnesses in Australia had another very good year and the congregation publishers lifted their average from 9.3 hours per month to 9.7. Excellent results were achieved and many were the expressions that the theocratic ministry school was an advantage to everyone in presenting the truth. On one occasion when two sisters met a Baptist minister and engaged in a long conversation with him, he wanted to know where they learned to speak so well. He told them that their approach to the subject under discussion and their clear presentation left little to be desired and he wished the women in his church could explain the Christian teachings like Jehovah’s witnesses. When a Christian attends the theocratic ministry school regularly he gets the full benefit of it. In a similar manner the congregation overseers are getting excellent training in the Kingdom Ministry School. Thus all of God’s people are maturing together. This is very essential in these last days so that we can meet the problems and difficulties that face the servants of Jehovah. The experiences sent in by the branch servant in Australia help us with some of these problems.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Sometimes husbands are ignored by publishers having the best of intentions. One congregation servant explains how this problem was overcome: &quot;The last time our circuit servant was here he found that our great problem was husband opposition preventing the wife to advance. We had been working on the theory that we should avoid the husband until the wife was built up sufficiently to see the issue clearly. This time we were told to visit the husbands. Last night we called on a ‘violently opposed’ husband. We were invited in, and his anger soon evaporated when he saw he was not being ignored. While he does not believe the Bible, he wants us to come and try to convince him that it is true and answer some of the questions that are troubling him. Arrangements were made to go back; he shook hands and thanked us for coming.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A twenty-eight-year-old nurse suffered a mental breakdown while studying for higher examinations. Her parents, who are prosperous, spared nothing to give her the best psychiatric treatment possible, which failed. When she threatened suicide she was taken to a local doctor who declared her a hopeless case, put her under heavy sedation, and applied on her behalf for a full invalid pension. The girl’s mother, who is one of Jehovah’s witnesses, vainly tried to bring her daughter into association with the brothers but only met with violent and vicious opposition from her husband. Finally, in desperation the husband consented to allow his daughter to associate with the brothers, as he was forced to admit they had tried everything medical science had to offer to no avail. Her health picked up immediately and her father, friends and relatives were amazed at her restored condition, while her dumbfounded doctor is positively perplexed at her rapid and complete recovery. This is because, as she told her doctor, “I now have something to live for—the new world.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Sickness should not prevent us from sharing in the ministry and being a regular publisher, as the following experience shows: “A sister in our congregation had already obtained twelve subscriptions during the campaign when she was admitted to hospital for a big operation. The operation was performed successfully on Tuesday, and on Thursday we were able to visit her. Imagine our surprise to find that, despite her operation and subsequent ill-feeling, she had obtained another four subscriptions from ladies in adjoining beds! These subscriptions were obtained after the operation, not before.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Publishers who have magazine routes seldom fail to reach their quotas regularly. A pioneer explains: “Considering my magazine activity for the month, I was surprised to find that I had only half my quota. I immediately sat down and looked through my magazine route list. After studying it carefully, I packed my bag for a full day of service. I spoke to almost everyone on my list. After concluding my joyful day of service I immediately began to count up my placements, and with Jehovah’s help I found that I had been able to place a hundred magazines on my route in just eight and a half hours.” Magazine routes also help us to attain the subscription quota: “As suggested by the Society, I started a magazine route, having about fourteen calls, and called back regularly with the latest copies. When the subscription campaign began I then called on all, explaining that sometimes it may not be possible to get around to them and, knowing how much they enjoy the magazines, I thought they should have them coming through the post. I was able to obtain seven subscriptions.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Distributing the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures</span><span class="font5"> for the first time brought great joy to the brothers in this country. Just prior to the campaign in June the Society supplied all congregations with a news release about April’s peak of 15,927 publishers that also contained the announcement that in June Jehovah’s witnesses would distribute their new translation of the Bible throughout Australia. As a result many papers published the entire release, and in some areas people were found anxiously waiting for the brothers to call with the new Bible. One sister placed five in one morning on her magazine route. Another placed four at one home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">AUSTRIA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 7,060,133</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 7,004 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 1,008</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah’s witnesses in Austria had their best year yet in preaching the good news of God’s kingdom. They spent 78,000 more hours proclaiming the glad tidings of good news than during the previous year. The congregation publishers had their finest average hours in the past five years, going up to 9.1 for each publisher each month of the year. This reflects itself, too, in the distribution of literature, the making of back-calls and the conducting of Bible studies. The branch servant reports some very interesting experiences on the blood issue. Mature Christians know that they must ‘keep themselves free from things sacrificed to idols and from blood and from things strangled and from fornication.’—Acts 15:29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A special pioneer sister contracted tuberculosis and was compelled to spend several months in a hospital. Only a portion of her thrilling letters can be related here. She had fervently prayed for an opportunity to glorify Jehovah there also, and when she said in the reception office her occupation was missionary work for Jehovah’s witnesses, she had the opportunity to witness to the secretary for one hour. This hospital for tubercular diseases is strictly isolated, and neither doctors nor nurses had ever heard the truth before. To start her “campaign,” every morning when the doctors came she made a little display of books and magazines on the chair beside her bed. One doctor showed more and more interest, and finally it was possible to arrange a fine regular Bible study with him with the book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True.”</span><span class="font5"> It was wonderful to observe the deep reverence of this intellectual man for God’s Word, which he had never seen before. He soon studied the book at home with his wife, and she too liked it very much. Also, with five nurses Bible studies were arranged and they were really appreciated by them. One day our sister was urgently called to the doctor, who said he had just been told by a nurse that Jehovah’s witnesses refuse blood transfusions. “Why is this?” he asked. When she showed him the scriptures he said: “You have poorly fulfilled your missionary duties. Why have you not told me this before?” When, later, a nurse criticized Jehovah’s witnesses because of their stand against blood transfusion, he replied: “It all depends what one esteems higher, God’s law or his own life.” When the sister left the hospital, arrangements were made by which all the good interest is taken care of.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A brother has a book study in isolated territory with a young couple and their little son. One day they had slaughtered a pig just before he came and had made blood sausage, as is the custom. When the brother explained what the Bible says about eating blood, the woman said at once, “We will throw it away”; and the man also went to slaughter the pig of her parents so that they would not get the blood of it. They had a large cross in front of the house, but when they learned the scriptures about idol worship the young woman dug it out and destroyed it. Her mother was furious, and it took considerable time till she calmed down. The next surprise for the brother was when they confessed they were not married, and because of an article in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> were going to get married the next day. When the priest heard they would marry only at the registrar’s office and not also in church, he told the man he should forsake his wife and his little son. But the hardest test came when the woman had to have an operation, and the doctors said her life depended on a blood transfusion. The day before she wrote: “This is the hardest day in my life. I love my little son very much, but I also love God very much, and therefore I cannot accept a blood transfusion.” But the doctors were wrong; she got well again, was baptized, and joyfully serves her Creator. Her husband, too, continues the study with the brother, and he accompanied her to the recent district assembly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">BAHAMAS &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;109,662</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 248 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 442</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Kingdom Ministry School was the highlight of the activity in the Bahamas this past year. Brothers who were servants on other islands came to Nassau to attend the school. During the four months that the school was in session there were thirty-four brothers who attended a month-long course of training. The branch home was used to house some of them, others stayed with brothers in Nassau, and some of the brothers being trained who lived in Nassau came from their own homes early each day to the branch to join in the discussion of the daily text at breakfast and to be with all the other students. One of the Kingdom Halls was used as a classroom. Two missionary sisters took turns as cooks and housekeepers for their brothers. The school was something new for congregation servants to enjoy and it proved to be most profitable and brought together closely the different overseers of the congregations in the islands of the Bahamas. Jehovah’s witnesses certainly take interest in their overseers and want them to have the instructions necessary to aid all the “sheep.” Some very interesting experiences are reported from the islands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One experience in our “out islands” has taught us that we can never work our territory too often, for we never know when someone will become spiritually-minded enough for the truth to appeal to him. A settlement on one island has been worked regularly for the past seven years and everyone there has been contacted many times. In February two special pioneers were assigned to the island and located their home in this settlement. When they were working the territory they came to the home of a man who was quite prominent in the town. He was the assistant minister in his church, active in the local political party and associated with many lodges and fraternal groups. But his heart was receptive and he told the brother that he was willing to accept God’s Word as the final authority and that if the brother could show him where he should keep separate from politics or should not belong to these secret organizations, he would obey the Bible. One subject was discussed at each back-call, and after a few weeks the man had left his church, stopped his political and lodge activities and taken up the Kingdom ministry and attending congregation meetings. In turn he was visited by, first, his former minister, then the politicians, then his friends and finally by another minister of a different church, who had no interest in him, but who just could not stand to see him become one of Jehovah’s witnesses. The new brother was able to answer each one with the truth. Within weeks he was in the field service, symbolized his dedication in June and has now begun Bible studies of his own. His wife was used at first by relatives and friends to bring pressure on him to stop, but, with patience, she too began to see the truth and started to study and is now actively preaching the good news.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An experience from Nassau illustrates how much good the literature can do by itself. Some time ago a brother obtained a subscription for </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font5">in the French language from a Haitian woman, but as he could not speak French he did not call back. But this lady read her magazine and from it learned Jehovah’s requirements about morality. She saw that some changes were needed in her own life, as she was unmarried but was the mother of three children. One day she came to the brothers and told them that she wanted to be married and start to be one of Jehovah’s witnesses. They brought her to the meetings and she started attending them regularly, although she could speak no English. The father of her children, when he saw her determination to straighten up her life, was willing to marry her, and they were married by a brother in November, with their three children attending the wedding. The very next day she had her fourth child and was very pleased that she was married before it came. One of the pioneers started a study with her, although neither spoke the other’s language. Each would take his own language copy of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“This Good News of the Kingdom”</span><span class="font5"> and at times they would cover only one or two paragraphs in the booklet in an hour, but she was really grasping the truth. Now she can study </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> in her own language at the French study just started in Nassau at one of the congregations, and just last week she also started in the field service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">BELGIUM &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 9,228,729</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 7,223 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 1,278</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The past service year has been richly blessed by Jehovah. Belgium has had a good increase in publishers over last year. The distribution of magazines and other literature has moved ahead very rapidly and a fine witness was given throughout the country. It was good to see the congregation publishers averaging 9.4 hours each month in the field. This was better than anything done in the last ten years. Jesus told us that we should love our neighbors as we do ourselves, and the branch servant gives us a very fine experience along this line, as well as some others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Sometimes new and less experienced publishers fear their neighbors and do not like to work their own village. However, when they do try to work near their home they soon find out that their fears are unjustified. A pioneer sister found a widow living with her two daughters. A study was started with them and they made rapid progress to the point of dedication and baptism. The lady, however, feared her neighbors. Why? She did not know herself, but she thought that it would be good to sell her house and live in an apartment, so that no one would know she had become one of the Witnesses. Her two daughters and the congregation servant advised her not to do that, as the people sooner or later will have to know it and, moreover, perfect love for Jehovah throws fear outside. The pioneer sister invited her then to accompany her in the service in her own street. Many people were amazed to see her going from house to house, but after her telling them what she was doing, many started to get interested. Much literature was placed that day and four new Bible studies were started, one of which was held with her friends. Now she knows how foolish it was to fear to work in her own neighborhood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Good habits of collective worship and Bible study in the family circle are a source of blessing to each member of the family, but they can also be a blessing to people on the outside. While camping during their vacation, a Christian family was holding their regular weekly family Bible study when a neighbor stepped in. The visitor was invited to join in the study, and a very encouraging meeting was held with him. The next day he and his wife came back with Bible questions, and a Bible study was arranged right there. They left their address, and arrangements were made through the local congregation to continue the study started.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Society has stressed pioneer service, and this has not been in vain in Belgium. The number of pioneers is getting steadily greater. A new all-time peak in pioneers, vacation pioneers included, was reached, with 249 last July. Sometimes the publisher who is considering pioneer service cannot find a part-time job that suits him. Why not do like the pioneer in the following experience? It can help you to take that most blessed step forward and become a pioneer. The pioneer writes: “I was desiring to become a pioneer, but among other problems there was the obstacle that I could not find a part-time job to sustain myself. I was employed in a factory as draftsman. With this trade one does not easily find part-time work. One day, after having tried several media without success, I decided to put Jehovah to the test. I went to the boss and told him I was going to leave, not because I was unhappy, but I explained to him that I was going to pioneer. He told me that some time ago a young engineer had asked him for a part-time job for the same reason, but he was not able to do anything for him at that time. However, as I had been faithfully working for quite a while, he asked me to stay on a part-time basis. I was very happy. The next day he told me that he had thought the matter over and had decided to raise my wages, as he believed that I would not have enough to live on.” Truly, Jehovah helps his servants who show faith and want to follow Jesus’ footsteps as pioneers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">BOLIVIA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 3,600,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 493 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 7,302</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The service year in Bolivia has been a fruitful one. Three more congregations were organized. There was more regularity on the part of the publishers and the congregation publishers improved their average hours in the field, which has considerably helped the fine witness given throughout the land. Jehovah’s witnesses enjoyed an 8-percent increase and have had some very fine experiences. One, as reported by the branch servant, shows that some people have studied the truth for many years even when there has been no one to teach them. They must be directed to Jehovah’s organization so they can serve unitedly with his people, as this experience shows.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“While the circuit servant was in La Paz he learned of a man with a family of seven who lived in a little village just outside the city and who had known of the truth for about ten years by means of a subscription for </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font5"> He directed me to his home, where I studied with him in the book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">‘Let God Be True’</span><span class="font5"> His whole family also would join in, sitting on blankets on the floor, while he provided one of their few chairs for me, the conductor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Though they are an Indian family with little education, the oldest daughter has learned to read fluently, which is unusual progress because she did not know how to before. This makes the study more interesting and upbuilding, since the majority can partake and share in the reading of scriptures and paragraphs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“This man had preached incidentally for many years but because of living in an out-of-the-way place he had never been assisted to any extent so as to associate with a congregation in La Paz. After about three studies it seemed that he could be invited in the service. However, there was one other thing to consider. Since a vast number of the Bolivians live in consensual marriage, the question was, Was he legally married and therefore qualified to participate in field service? Upon asking him tactfully, he declared an emphatic ‘Yes!’ and brought out all the legal certificates for his marriage as well as those of his married sons and daughter. He then asked if he should be married again in the Kingdom Hall, because he wanted to comply with every rule of the New World society. I assured him that his legal, civil marriage was sufficient.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Being qualified, he eagerly accepted an invitation to go out in the service and had the joy of being able to teach another person. He is now using the sermon, though he has difficulty reading the texts in the Bible, Over the years he has planted many seeds of truth in his little village and has helped at least four others to have a strong desire to learn the truth of God’s Word. A study has been started with one of these who is equally eager to progress. He attends the meetings regularly and enjoys the association of the brothers in the congregation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">&quot;Now after ten years of patiently waiting to enter the flock of Jehovah’s ‘sheep’ he is going to be baptized at an assembly that will soon be held in La Paz. It seems quite certain that the rest of his family will follow as they progress in the understanding of Jehovah’s requirements for life.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">BRAZIL &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 70,799,352</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">The national assembly in Sao Paulo was the outstanding event of the 1962 service year. There were 48,094 who attended the public meeting. At this same assembly 1,269 symbolized their dedication by water immersion. However, during the entire year in Brazil there were 3,782 baptized. The work is moving ahead rapidly. In five years’ time the number of publishers engaging in the field service has doubled, and throughout the entire 1962 service year in Brazil there was an average of 24,664 publishers, to compare with 1957 when the average was 10,522. It is no wonder, then, that the Society found it necessary to build a new Bethel home on its property in Rio de Janeiro. In this new building will be a fine Kingdom Hall, which will be used for the brothers in the community. The additional living accommodations being added to the present printing plant and excellent office will certainly make it possible for the work to expand as far as the headquarters organization is concerned, so that it can keep up with the grand progress being made in the field. The branch servant gives us many very interesting experiences, and a few of these are related here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Writing letters to relatives and friends in distant parts often pays off. A witness in the State of Bahia wrote her fleshly sister in Rio de Janeiro and told her about the Witnesses and their work. A separate letter to the Witnesses asked that they visit her sister. The publisher who made the call writes: “On the first call I found the lady ready and anxious to study. The letters she had received from her sister in Bahia had stimulated her interest in the Bible and created expectancy for my visit. Immediately a study was started. As the study continued severe persecution was brought upon her by her husband, who even resorted to beating her to make her stop studying the Bible, but she continued. Four months later she was going into the field service. Her Christian perseverance yielded more fruits, as her husband became more tolerant and now is friendly to the Witnesses. One year after her first study she symbolized her dedication by immersion, and now she conducts her own Bible studies, fulfills assignments in the theocratic ministry school and enjoys New World associations to the full. What a wonderful reward for her fleshly sister due to having written a few letters!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A new publisher writes: “My wife and I progressed steadily in accurate knowledge from the weekly Bible study in our home. We offered our apartment for a service center. Only four days after our baptism we received a letter from our apartment official stating that our Bible study was not permitted and should be discontinued immediately or legal action would follow. Although new in the truth, we recalled the yeartext and took courage in Jehovah since the matter involved his Name and his pure worship. We replied to the official’s letter, and received another one requesting my presence at a meeting with all other apartment owners. In this meeting my letter was read and denounced. However, instead of supporting the official, many of those present were shocked and surprised that a complaint like that had been made. Others did not know that a private gathering was being held in our apartment. During the discussion it was apparent that religious prejudice was at the root of it. I was finally invited to speak, and tactfully but courageously defended our right to gather together to study the Bible. At the conclusion one owner expressed it as being most praiseworthy that someone in the building was interested in studying the Bible. Another commented that this was much better than spending time gambling, drinking or playing cards. No disrespect was involved and no regulations were violated. To our surprise, the official then offered us the building’s ‘social room’ for our weekly congregation book study. How grateful we are to share in this victory for true worship!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One couple from the Amazon region of Amapa went to Belem for treatments and they were found by a pioneer sister. They were overjoyed with the many new things they heard about the world’s end and the new world, and subscribed for the magazines and attended a few meetings. Before returning to their jungle home they asked that someone visit them. Later the circuit servant and two missionaries traveled 158 kilometers by truck, then continued by motorboat for eight hours up a tributary of the Amazon River to reach these goodwill persons. The next day was spent visiting neighbors by canoe, and fifteen attended the Bible study that evening. A schoolteacher told all her pupils to inform their parents about the special visitors and invite them to come the next day. Next morning many canoes were seen arriving from both sides of the river. Classes were suspended for the day. Fifty-one persons listened attentively to explanations of the Bible and had their questions answered in a three-hour meeting. They had never heard so many good things explained from the Bible. They requested a return visit soon. From there another four-hour motorboat ride took them to another family who had heard of the truth. What a pleasant surprise to these humble jungle folks! From 2 to 11 p.m. the shower of questions continued, and they were resumed early the following morning. Fifteen persons joined in having their spiritual thirst quenched. By 10 a.m. thirtyseven persons had gathered, and a public discourse was delivered. Most of them stayed on until the night, when twenty-seven attended another discourse and a Bible study, ending about 11 p.m. There was no such thing as getting tired listening, uninterested, annoyed or discouraged. They wanted the Witnesses to stay and study with them. It was thrilling to see their thirst for truth being satisfied, and to have visited them was well worth the inconveniences involved and the effort put forth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">BRITISH GUIANA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;590,140</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 740 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 797</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During the past year things have been rather unsettled in British Guiana, and the people of the land lived under a state of emergency for about six months. However, Jehovah’s witnesses went ahead steadily preaching the good news of the Kingdom, gathering together in the United Worshipers Assembly and in the Courageous Ministers Assembly. Thus the brothers were built up spiritually. At the same time they carried to the people of the land the comforting message of God’s kingdom. How true it is that “those seeking him will praise Jehovah”! (Ps. 22:26) It is hoped that the Kingdom Ministry School that many of the congregation servants and special pioneers attended will have a telling effect upon their future reports. Here are a few experiences sent in by the branch servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Quite often a householder remarks, “Selling books? Well, I am not interested!” One sister replied to such a remark by saying, “But what I have to say is free!” The couple at the door were surprised at the word &quot;free,” as they had just purchased a religious book for $22.95. They listened to the sermon and accepted the offer. They explained how their minister had been warning them for many Sundays about Jehovah’s witnesses and had charged us with being Communists. That first call took two hours. Back-calls </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">were</span><span class="font5"> made and a study was started. After two studies the wife attended the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> study and then began attending the other meetings at the Kingdom Hall. Now she is a regular publisher and is planning to be baptized at the coming circuit assembly. The husband, although showing an interest in sports, has cooperated in the care of their child and has announced his intention of following the course of his wife.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In one yard in Georgetown six families are living. A publisher talked to a woman there in the door-to-door work and started a study with her in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True.” </span><span class="font5">Enjoying the study, this woman told one of her neighbors about it. She desired a study too, so it was held in the booklet </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“This Good News of the Kingdom.”</span><span class="font5"> A third woman then desired instruction in the Bible; so a </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font5"> book study was started in her home. Then a fourth family in this same yard heard about the truth and requested a study also. Now these four Catholic families are studying, with all six families represented at the various studies. Four persons from this group have become publishers, one being immersed at our last assembly. The truth spreads like fire among sheeplike persons!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In one of the country congregations a woman who had enjoyed studying with the Witnesses said, “I prefer to remain a person of goodwill rather than getting baptized.” Then the publisher looked up scriptures from the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Sermon Outlines</span><span class="font5"> on “Baptism,” and on the succeeding call reviewed an article in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> on “Why Be Baptized?” Her attitude has changed and she expresses her desire to be baptized at the next opportunity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">BRITISH HONDURAS &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;90,343</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 294 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 307</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah’s witnesses in British Honduras have had a wonderful year of giving praise to Jehovah’s great name and they have good reason to be thankful. During the past year there was great suffering among the people, including the Kingdom publishers, due to hurricane “Hattie,” which lashed out against the land. More than half the country was devastated. A remarkable recovery has been made in rehabilitating the people, and the Kingdom work has also moved ahead well. One thing that needed attention in the country was arrangements for more frequent visits of the circuit servants to the congregations. This has proved to be a real blessing. The president of the Society had the opportunity of serving the brothers in March of 1962 and helped in the reorganization of the work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The branch servant relates some interesting experiences, particularly in regard to the young folks, showing that out of the mouth of babes praise is given to Jehovah’s name. The people notice this, and one individual recently remarked to the branch servant: “You people are going to grow enormously in British Honduras and nothing is going to stop it.” He had been observing the joy of the children at the Courageous Ministers District Assembly. On reading these experiences one can see why such a statement was made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is really admirable how children of the New World society take a keen interest in the teaching work even while attending school. Here is a report from </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font5"> schoolgirl of nine: “Well, I am still going to school, but after hearing at our congregation meetings how urgent it is to teach others God’s purposes, which can be done by studying the Bible, I decided to ask some of my schoolmates if they would like to learn the good things that I am learning from the Bible about the paradise God will restore. To this they agreed, so I then arranged that they should have their mothers’ consent. All this proved successful, and now I am conducting five Bible studies with my schoolmates.” As a result of this effort of our young school-age publisher, parents of some of the schoolmates with whom she studies are showing keen interest in the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A recently dedicated teen-ager writes concerning the effects of a Bible study being conducted with her: “It took me a little while to realize that this is the truth. I even opposed my family. One day a Bible question was put before me by my worldly friends, but I was unable to answer. I was very ashamed of myself. I then decided to start studying the Bible. So I requested one of Jehovah’s witnesses to help me get the knowledge and understanding of the Bible I needed. It was not long before I was attending the meetings. Next, I found myself going out into the service with the brothers. My friends mocked and scoffed at me, but it did not bother me, because I was convinced that I have found the truth. Because of my fearless approach, the truth has caught their interest and I now conduct five Bible studies with previous opposers of God’s Word.” This teenager got baptized at our Courageous Ministers District Assembly in August, and immediately afterward requested an application for the vacation pioneer service. Her mother has also requested a vacation pioneer application form. When parents take their theocratic responsibilities seriously, children tend to copy them and in turn show appreciation to Jehovah by sharing in the teaching work themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">BRITISH ISLES &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Populations 52,777,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 49,924 Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 1,057</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There is no unemployment in Britain, so it is reported, and the people of that country are faced with increasing materialism. At the same time there is much “higher criticism” of the Bible. The brothers in the British Isles are finding it necessary to be very skilled in the use of the Bible to direct the interests of the people to God’s Word. Even though the Church of England has failed to arouse the people to want to study the Bible, the responsibility still rests upon Jehovah’s witnesses to stir up their interest. This takes time. The congregation publishers in the British Isles have increased their hours in the ministry slightly during the past year, but they are still considerably below the average of ten hours per publisher per month, a quota that all Kingdom publishers work for around the world. It is a real joy to see a number of persons taking up the vacation pioneer work in the British Isles as well as regular pioneer service. The brothers rejoice that 3,444 new ones have been baptized and have taken their stand with the organization. The branch servant sets out a number of very encouraging experiences, not only for the British Isles, but also for some territories under the jurisdiction of the London office, namely, Aden, Gibraltar and Malta.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The mother of an eight-year-old son wrote that her young boy insisted that he also carry out Jehovah’s instructions as they were discussed in the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry.</span><span class="font5"> Thus, when the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation</span><span class="font5"> was being offered from house to house this young publisher knocked at his first door, stated his purpose in calling, made the point that many people do not read the Bible because of difficulty in understanding it, and offered the new Bible. The man at the door not only accepted the Bible with gratitude but has since explained throughout the neighbourhood how a small boy brought this new translation to his door to help him understand God’s Word. The mother concludes her letter by saying, “All this proves that our heavenly Father knows the capabilities of the little ones too and blesses those who really enjoy serving the interests of his kingdom.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Following the encouraging article in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> on “Freedom of Worship in the Schoolroom” parents and children in Britain saw the need to become more firm in their stand for pure worship. One mother who had two girls in school took up the matter of religious assembly and religious instruction with the headmistress and made sure that her two daughters did something else when these were scheduled. At the end of the term the mistress approached her as to what she would do over the written examination now required to gain the marks needed for the course. The mother gave consent for the examination to be taken even though the class had not been attended. The result was that both children did very well on the examination, and one came out highest of the school for religious instruction! Children who have received proper training at home and at the meetings receive an education far superior to that given in any other school. Naturally the outcome of the examination was much to the annoyance of the mistress of that school.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Illustrating the increased joy that comes both to the individuals who have been able to vacation pioneer as well as to the congregation is this experience: “Many mature publishers are reaching out for privileges in vacation pioneering. I was with one unit recently where seven sisters were vacation pioneering together and bubbling over with enthusiasm. It was great!” Another circuit servant writes: “It is good to see some of the younger ones getting into the pioneer service. The idea of getting groups of sisters to vacation pioneer together is being well received. This week at the congregation I am serving there are five sisters who have vacation pioneered this month and all have reached their quotas with some time to spare.” From a congregation nearby he reports: “In this circuit there are quite a few sisters who have been learning to drive. They have a vehicle available to them during the day and they thought that this would enable them to get to territory quicker and also enable others to get out into the ministry. As a consequence there are now five to six sisters who have learned to drive in the last few months and they are all busily engaged in the ministry and are making up groups of workers by calling for those with children to get them into the ministry.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">ADEN &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population; 220,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 73,333</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Two publishers returned to England during the year, leaving one lone Witness to carry on the work. Although many have written to the London office about serving in Aden, few have been able to arrange for some secular work, which is essential in order to stay. However, just recently we received word from a brother that he has contracted for work for at least two years and will be sailing soon with his wife and daughter to join the brother now there. It is hoped that a few more may be able to do the same so that the people in this tiny land who are fighting for their political independence might also learn of the real freedom that brings everlasting life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Whatever seeds have been planted have been quickly attacked by the priests of the Roman Catholic Church. When one woman started to study the Bible with a Witness, the priest told her that he would see to it that the education being given to her daughter would be stopped immediately. Another woman who started to study noted that the grades her daughter was getting at school suddenly dropped. Suspecting the cause, she sent her daughter back to church and the girl’s grades at school immediately improved. Yet we are confident that Jehovah will give courage and strength to those “sheep” that belong to him and that they will hear his voice and come forth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">GIBRALTAR &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;26,385</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 25 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 1,055</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Early in the year the four special pioneers were forced to leave Gibraltar after working for just a few months, and there was much concern for this young congregation that was less than one year old. But “we are obligated to give God thanks . . . because [their] faith is growing exceedingly.” (2 Thess. 1:3) Truly thrilling have been the willingness and determination of these brothers to accept full responsibility for their preaching assignment and their congregation organization. The very first month that they preached without assistance from the pioneers they reached a new peak of publishers and averaged fifteen hours in the service! An example of their courage and confidence in Jehovah is seen from the following experience.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A young brother was visiting from house to house when he was suddenly confronted by a secret police officer. This officer appeared very unfriendly and threatened arrest. But the young brother stood his ground and gently explained that he was serving his God in this manner and whatever contributions were accepted for literature were no different from contributions given to the church. The officer took two magazines and shut the door in the minister’s face. The next day this same young Witness went back out in the service and again met this same officer. Now the reaction was more friendly and the brother continued his preaching without interruption. This genuine zeal and love for Jehovah’s service is bound to make a good impression on the minds and hearts of all those disposed toward righteousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">MALTA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;330,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 11 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 30,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“We certainly have the potential,” writes the sister who is the congregation servant. “It is rare for us to go out in the service without starting at least one new Bible study.” However, this same report mentions that over thirty families with whom studies were being conducted have moved away during the year. Such is the problem that faces this energetic little congregation whose publishers are generally wives of servicemen whose tour of duty on this island is for but two years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Several years ago a young man in the Royal Navy heard a discussion between one of Jehovah’s witnesses and a Roman Catholic who were on board his ship. He was so impressed by the convincing Scriptural answers given by this Witness that he made up his mind that every time he visited a country he would look up the Kingdom Hall of Jehovah’s witnesses and attend the meetings. Finally he came to Malta for a period of two years and when he was contacted arrangements were immediately made for a weekly home Bible study. Now both he and his wife are learning about the coming peaceful conditions that will cover the entire face of the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One lady called on at her home immediately expressed her appreciation for the Society’s publications. She explained that one year ago while in Aden she had obtained a </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font5"> book and found it a wonderful aid in answering all the questions of her seven-year-old child. The Witness promptly offered to study the Bible with her a little each week so that she could extend her knowledge. She immediately consented and now enjoys learning more about God’s kingdom of righteousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">BURMA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 20,054,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 216 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 92,843</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the country of Burma there has been quite a political upheaval, and conditions have been distressing to many. However, Jehovah’s witnesses have continued with the preaching of the good news of God’s kingdom and have brought comfort to as many people as possible. All in Burma are now living under the strict rule of a military government, but this government has not interfered in any way with the preaching work. While there are not many publishers in this country, which has a great population, still the truth is represented and there are wonderful opportunities here for expansion. It is good to see that during the past years there has been a gradual ingathering, for there are many sheeplike people in the country. But it takes patience on the part of one of Jehovah’s witnesses to show these people the difference between the true God, Jehovah, and the gods that are worshiped by the majority. The report of the branch servant shows some of the <a name="bookmark189"></a><a name="bookmark190"></a>problems that have to be met and how by continual searching people of goodwill are found.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A Tamil special pioneer writes: “When I made a back-call on a young Hindu man, he was glad to see me and invited me to come in. Seeing he was Telugu, I started a study with him in the Telugu tract </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Life in the New World</span><span class="font5"> while I used the same tract in Tamil. After completing the study of the tract, we studied the Telugu Bible. He was happy when the notice appeared in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font5"> that </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">‘Good News’</span><span class="font5"> in Telugu could now be obtained. While studying this booklet, he began telling others about the message. When his father learned about it, he opposed the truth. He insisted that the boy stop studying and asked: ‘Why do you want to change your religion? We are Hindus. Do you want to become a Christian?’ The boy answered: ‘Father, I am worshiping the God who created me, but you are worshiping the gods made by men. Which is right?* This seemed reasonable to the father. The next day his father said: ‘I want to know more about your God.’ A study was started with the whole family of seven. After a few studies they tore down their altar and destroyed all their images. Friends and relatives opposed, but the family held firmly to the truth. Four of them are now S' ”.shing. As for the young man on whom the first</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">-call was made, he is already baptized and conducts two studies of his own.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A publisher took the opportunity of presenting his boss, who was returning to England, with the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise </span><span class="font5">book and a copy of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures.</span><span class="font5"> In a letter to him his boss said: “Before proceeding further I must thank you for the very nice present you gave me before leaving you. The two books in question are now ‘honoured treasures’ in our household, and my wife and I are most grateful to you for your kindness.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">From what follows we can see how important the house-to-house work is in locating lost “sheep”: “Working in a rural section across the river from Rangoon, I met a young woman who told me that seven years previously she had been in touch with our organization, but had lost contact after she left to get married. I noticed she manifested good interest and inquired if her husband was interested also. She promised to inform him of my visit and let me know. On the return call I asked her to bring out the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">‘Good News’</span><span class="font5"> booklet I had placed with her. She said: ‘I do not have it; my husband has taken it to work with him.’ I provided another booklet for her, and the study was commenced. On the next call the husband was home, having taken off from work specially to meet me. After the study, which he enjoyed very much, he said: ‘Please come regularly and train us how to do your work.’ They both come across the river as often as they can to attend meetings and have joined us in the preaching work too.” Jehovah knows his “sheep,” and they know the voice of his Fine Shepherd.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">CAMEROUN &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;4,087,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 6,394 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 639</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This has been an outstanding year for the brothers in the Cameroun Republic. They have had one happy experience after another, and because of this we feel sure that the work will open up even wider than it has to the present moment. Jehovah has opened the floodgates of the heavens and has poured out a blessing until there is no more want. (Mal. 3:10) But let us hear the branch servant tell us what happened, along with some experiences enjoyed during the past year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Events in favor of pure worship in Cameroun occurred swiftly during the year. By far the most outstanding events were the establishment of the branch and the legal recognition of the work here. In October what was formerly known as “Southern Cameroons” became a part of the Republic of Cameroun. This meant that over 1,000 publishers were added to our territory. In January the branch began operating with over 6,000 publishers. After three months of branch operation came a notice from the Ministry of the Interior informing us that the work of Jehovah’s witnesses was legally recognized by the Cameroun government. Thus, finally, after years of hard work, prayers on the part of the brothers and many representations to the authorities, the way was now open for greater freedom and activity for Jehovah’s people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Due to internal strife in the country, assemblies of Jehovah’s people had not been held for three years. Can you imagine the joy and delight of the brothers when letters were sent to all congregations advising them of the time and place of their next circuit assembly? The first was held in Douala, where the daily attendance exceeded 2,000 persons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We have had our problems with marriage difficulties and a high incidence of immorality, but progress is being made. Several couples living together but not legally married have obtained civil marriage certificates as proof of their desire to conform to the Scriptural and civil obligations regarding marriage. Through the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom ministry</span><span class="font5"> and the circuit servants, the office is giving all the help possible to couples finding themselves in unscriptural marriage. One congregation servant writes about a well-known polygamist who knew of the truth since 1959 but did not become an active publisher because of having four wives. Now he has just his first wife with him and is taking part in the field service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A special pioneer writes of his experience with a young man steeped in demon worship: “While we were talking about the true God and his purposes the young man entered his room and returned with a number of books, all of which had an inscription of a pagan god on their covers. He also had a so-called ‘magic wand’ and a phallic cross. After we showed him the futility of such worship, he gave me these images to burn. He was so convinced of the truth of what he had heard that he immediately began attending the congregation meetings. Six months later he was baptized, and I have the joy of telling you that since May 1 this brother has been enrolled as a regular pioneer.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The sluggishness of Christendom is very evident when compared with the zeal and regularity of Jehovah’s worshipers. When faced with inclement weather, many churchgoers are content to remain at home rather than walk or drive to church in the rain. In one town the pastor of the local Presbyterian church noted this in his sermon from the pulpit. He said that when there is just a little rain, attendance at the church meeting is always very low, that churchgoers are very lazy. He added that if they felt it too big a task to attend church meetings when the weather is bad, how much more if they were commanded to preach from house to house? He then referred to the alertness of Jehovah’s witnesses and said, “Look at how Jehovah’s witnesses have regard for their work! Whether it is raining or sunny, they are always busy preaching.” He exposed churchgoers as “bench warmers” and commended Jehovah’s witnesses for being alert and serious about their work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">From time to time pioneers write in and express their appreciation for this blessed service. Typical of such letters was the following: “At an assembly in Yaounde in 1958 I heard a talk on the privilege of pioneer service. It was pointed out that the vacation pioneer service was a good way to start. I resolved to take up this service from March, 1959, to August of that same year. As a result of those few months’ service, Jehovah richly blessed me with six good Bible studies. Today four of these are baptized publishers and one is a pioneer. I continued to find more persons of goodwill, and my joy moved me to continue as a regular pioneer.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">CANADA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 17,765,766</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 40,121 Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 443</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When one compares the peak number of publishers in the field service in Canada this year with the peak of a year ago he will find that there were 109 fewer publishers reporting field service activity. However, those who have engaged in the field service have been more consistent and there were, on the average, 768 more regular publishers in the field service each month. Still the question arises in everyone’s mind as to why there were fewer publishers in the field during the 1962 service year. Those who are dedicated to Jehovah God and who are preaching regularly every month will have to have patience and endure in the ministry; they cannot forget their first love, their joy and zeal in preaching the good news of the Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There are still 17,725,000 people in Canada not associated with Jehovah’s witnesses, and these have to be preached to and given an opportunity to gain everlasting life. The work is there to be done and no one may say that, of this great population, there are no more who will come into the truth. Even though the increase in the average number of publishers has only been 768, there were 2,198 baptized, more than twice as many as during the previous year. Maybe the increase will show up in the 1963 service year. If it does it will require the consistent preaching of the good news on the part of every servant of God in Canada.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It has been good to see that as far as the congregation publishers are concerned there has been a slight increase in the average number of hours devoted to the field service. Their average is the best in many, many years. This is certainly a move in the right direction, and with the overseers, circuit servants, district servants and congregation servants taking the lead during the 1963 service year, and with full cooperation on the part of the brothers everywhere in Canada, good progress should be made. There has been no difficulty in the Canadian field as far as opposition or court cases are concerned. There has been no trouble in the Quebec area. But even though there are no disturbances, every one of Jehovah’s witnesses should realize that we are still in a big fight against the Devil and his whole organization, and it is necessary to keep on the whole armor of God and declare this good news right on down to the end. We have every confidence that there are many more people of goodwill to be found and that Jehovah’s witnesses in Canada will find them and feed them and lead them to the path of everlasting life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Here are a few interesting experiences sent in by the branch servant on the work in Canada.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Perseverance, tact and kindness show up in the experience of a new brother in isolated territory. When he married, both he and his wife had been Catholic, so there was much opposition from her when he accepted the truth. His kindness and patience eventually won her; but let her tell the story: “I am very thankful that my husband took a firm stand for the truth, although I was opposed for a year and a half. Since I was in a convent for nine years, six of them as a nun, I was sure I had the true faith. This led to many quarrels with my husband, and at times I resorted to outright violence. However, my husband, always a true Witness, would prove to me that hate had not entered his heart and he would return good for evil. He did not stand in my way when I wanted to go to church or any social events. When he went out by himself and I would ask where he was, he always told the truth, although he knew how angry I would be when he announced that he had been in the service or at a meeting. In my heart I admired him for that. Had he told me a lie I would have accused all Witnesses as untrue. As I look back now and see how new he himself was in the truth and yet he took such a firm stand, I thank him for being strict with himself and with me for the sake of God’s work. Many times I tried to get help from the priests, but the answer was always the same: ‘If your husband is one of Jehovah’s witnesses there is nothing we can do; the problem is yours.’ Then one day a brother and sister stopped at our house to see my husband, and I swallowed my pride long enough to ask some questions. The answers they gave me made me realize that the religion I was fighting for was wrong. So I asked them to come back again, and they have been studying with me regularly since. As a result the truth of the Bible has won me over and now I have a big job: to show my twin sister, who is still a nun in the same convent I was, the truth of the Bible, God’s Word.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The aged ones among us are a constant encouragement to us by their endurance. One sister who wanted so much to vacation pioneer did so, but was having difficulty due to trouble with her feet that made it very hard for her to walk. When others saw her determination, they assisted by providing transportation. In time she found that the exercise she did get strengthened her legs and feet so that she was able to get around quite well. Even her eyes seemed to gain strength, although at first she had wondered how she would conduct studies because her eyesight was so weak. Now she is able to read well from the publications.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The studies parents have with their children are producing fine youthful ministers. The congregation meetings that these young ones attend with their parents and other adults also qualify them to be His ministers. A ten-year-old tells of a Protestant minister who visited her school to give a sermon each Friday. After the sermon he would answer questions for the students, but if he could not answer he would say, “That is a mystery that has never been solved.” When the young sister offered answers, she was permitted to give them and prove them with scriptures. She adds, “This led to magazine placements with the minister, as well as many fine discussions on the truth. Thereafter, at the conclusion of his sermons he would ask me what I thought about it. I could see that the source material for his sermons was now the magazines that I had placed with him. His sermons had improved a great deal! He now has the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font5"> book and I am looking forward to making back-calls on him.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">CEYLON &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 10,412,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 246 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 42,825</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The preaching of the good news of the Kingdom has been done under most favorable conditions in Ceylon during the past service year. Jehovah’s witnesses have enjoyed unrestricted freedom and have been able to carry on every feature of their field ministry. While there are many problems that the governments of the earth have to handle internally and externally, yet Jehovah’s witnesses have but one work to do and that is to announce the glorious kingdom of Jehovah God. The brothers in Ceylon appreciate that it is essential to work in peace and unity. When there is peace there is growth. We rejoice, too, in the fine United Worshipers District Assembly that was held in Ceylon during the past service year. This assembly gave the brothers an opportunity to take in increased knowledge. The branch servant sets out some very interesting experiences for the country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Brother Henschel’s visit will be remembered for the fine admonition he gave on how to trade literature and magazines for whatever the people have. Since then it has been interesting to see the publishers returning from the field with rice, coconuts, eggs, soap, fruit, vegetables, clothes, and what have you. This means that many people have the Word of life in printed form who would not have received it otherwise. Having given something for the literature, they treasure it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">More are availing themselves of the opportunity to share in vacation pioneering and the joys that accompany it. A sister writes: “I enjoyed being </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font5"> vacation pioneer during the month of April, and the blessings received are abundant. There is much happiness in spending more time telling the good news of Jehovah’s kingdom. I would like to continue vacation pioneering during the month of May too.” This sister and her husband are now special pioneers. With grandmother to assist in looking after seven-month-old Milton, who was born close to the time of the district assembly, and the other three children, they are a very happy family.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In this land where publishers mostly walk or go by bus they face the problem of carrying enough literature. Often sisters say, “How can we carry it? It is so heavy.” Still the circuit servant insists that they must be optimistic about presenting the offer and always be well equipped. After hearing this counsel on Tuesday night a publisher reports this experience enjoyed the next day. “The first house we visited was the home of a schoolmaster. He greeted us with a friendly smile and invited us in. When we stepped in, there was a visitor, his brother, a doctor. We started off with the sermon and, as both of them were supposed to be Christians, they joined in the discussion; they seemed to be familiar with the Bible. Halfway through the sermon we were interrupted by two more visitors, both Hindus. After having finished the sermon the offer was presented to the Hindu gentleman, and the others were told that we had sufficient copies of the Bible for all of them. I was so thrilled when three of them, the Hindu, the schoolmaster and the doctor each obtained a copy. This meant three Bibles in the first house, and certainly only one with a positive attitude and well equipped could enjoy such an experience.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One congregation has leased land and bought the necessary material to build the first Kingdom Hall to be owned by Jehovah’s witnesses in Ceylon. With the termination of the monsoons and the beginning of fine weather this forward step will soon prove to be a blessed reality.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">All were glad to have a Ceylonese brother return from the new Gilead School, after completing the longer course of intensive study, to be able to share and apply the many good things learned as he lovingly trains and assists them. Presently there is further reason for<sup>-</sup>gratitude as another brother prepares to go to Gilead for the next term. All know the need in Ceylon is very great, especially for qualified overseers to train the publishers to greater maturity and to care for the new ones coming into the New World society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">CHILE &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 7,889,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 2,885 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 2,734</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Probably the most outstanding event in Chile during the past service year was the Kingdom Ministry School. It was arranged for in different parts of the countries, and 143 overseers, special pioneers and missionaries had the privilege of taking this special training course. This school in Chile, which has also been conducted in all parts of the world, certainly helps brothers to “walk worthily of Jehovah to the end of fully pleasing him as [they] go on bearing fruit in every good work and increasing in the accurate knowledge of God.” (Col. 1:10) It was a joy to observe the 14-percent increase in publishers in Chile during the past service year. A new peak of 2,885 was reached in the ministry. Four hundred and twentyeight were baptized during the year. The branch office feels that the organization in Chile is showing good maturity, even with the fast influx of new publishers, and they give us some very interesting experiences about what is occurring in that land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In order to bear fruit in one’s ministry, seed must first be sown, and what better seed do we have than the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> magazines? It was a joy to see the increase in number of these magazines placed during the year, the congregation publishers maintaining an average of 13.8 magazines each per month. By taking advantage of every opportunity to place magazines, some publishers have been able to place as many as 100 a month. One brother, a congregation publisher, had an average of 112 a month by placing them during his work hours as a bus driver between two cities. Many persons commute regularly from one city to the other and take the magazines every week from him. When a new issue arrives he fills his briefcase and sets it beside the driver’s seat, and when these persons get on the bus he has their magazine ready for them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A sister was accompanying the circuit servant in the field service and mentioned to him that this was her first time to go from door to door. He expressed surprise, since her report showed that she was conducting a number of studies and was averaging about forty magazines a month; so she explained how she did it. Because of having six small children her husband did not want her to attend the gatherings for the door-to-door ministry, but he did allow her to attend the regular meetings. So at the meetings she obtained her supply of magazines, and every morning for a short time she would stand in her doorway and speak to her neighbors and the passersby, offering them the magazines. In this way she placed many magazines, and as time went on she started to study with some of the interested persons. At the same time she was able to care for her home and her children, thus ‘walking worthily of Jehovah.’ Her joy was complete when her husband too became interested and later on became a Kingdom publisher. Now they take turns in watching the children and attending the meetings for the door-to-door ministry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Thanks to the Society’s letters on pioneering at the beginning of the year, this feature of the ministry improved during the past months. All together, 232 different brothers became vacation pioneers, and adding these to the number of special and regular pioneers, we find that over 400 brothers have shared in the full-time ministry during the year, or 15 percent of the average number of publishers. What better way is there to ‘go on pleasing Jehovah as you bear fruit’? One sister wrote the branch office during her enrollment as a vacation pioneer and said: “Although I have eight children, I made a schedule that allows me from 1 to 6 p.m. in the service. The older children cooperate in caring for the smaller ones, and my husband also helps when he can. The results have been marvelous! After four months of vacation pioneering I have thirteen Bible studies, and several of these persons are now attending the Kingdom Hall. In order to care for them properly I am considering being a regular pioneer.” She certainly proved to herself and to others the truth of Psalm 34:8: “Taste and see that Jehovah is good.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">CHINA</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Little has been heard from the Chinese mainland during the 1962 service year. One report did come through that a student studying in China regularly received copies of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> during the year. The British Foreign Office reported that a representative of the British government was able to visit the two missionaries imprisoned in China and he found both of them in satisfactory health and receiving some food parcels that were being provided for them. It is comforting to know that these two brothers are well, and it is our united prayer that Jehovah will continue to be with them to grant them strength to maintain integrity in their devotion to him. Aside from these brief communiques, there is nothing further to report on the activity of Jehovah’s servants in China at this time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">COLOMBIA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 13,500,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 2,546 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Katio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 5,302</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The courageous and faithful witnesses of Jehovah in Colombia pushed ahead during the past year with excellent results. They increased their active ministers by 22 percent. They did not confine their witnessing work to the larger cities, but as occasion afforded they went out into the rural territories and the mountains. Many isolated groups were formed and some of these developed into strong congregations. In 1961 there were fifty-four congregations in all of Colombia, but now they have seventy-two, an increase of eighteen new congregations, and in addition to that there are eighteen new isolated groups that are being visited by the circuit servants. Everything in their field service report for the year is excellent. They placed more books, booklets and magazines, and obtained more subscriptions. They devoted more hours to the service, made more back-calls and conducted more Bible studies. There was an increase in the number of public meetings held in the country, and there were more enrolled as vacation pioneers, pioneers and special pioneers. This is the sixth year in a row that Colombia has had an increase of 20 percent or better. All will be delighted to know that the congregation publishers averaged 11.9 hours throughout the whole year. Here are some of their interesting experiences, as sent in by the branch servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Colombian Witnesses appreciate that one of the provisions of Jehovah to give greater knowledge and strength to his servants is assemblies. Certainly the 2,600 who attended the national assembly during Brother Knorr’s visit fortified their faith and hope. Appreciation of the benefits of such assembly was reflected by the attendance of 4,466 at the series of eight circuit assemblies recently arranged here. The district servant reports that real efforts were made to attend these assemblies, some walking three days to get to the assembly site.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Long-hoped-for increases in Colombia’s capital city, Bogota, have been manifested during the year. This cold city is now warming up to the truth, and many longtime publishers there are happy to see the “other sheep” now coming in. Surely this is Jehovah’s blessing upon their continuous preaching. A missionary sister there, who rejoices to see from seven to nineteen of the persons she studies with in attendance at the meetings of the congregation each week, writes this interesting experience showing results of calling on a subscriber:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“In the magazine work one day I called on a manager of a drugstore who had subscribed for our magazines about a year ago but was not receiving his magazines regularly. I gave him the missing copies of his subscriptions and arranged to call at his home and there found his wife of goodwill too. On the second call a study was started, which they insisted on having twice each week. Soon both began attending meetings regularly and the wife now gives enthusiastic support to the door-to-door ministry. The husband witnesses at every opportunity during his working hours and both plan to be baptized at the next assembly. All this in just four months!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A full-time minister in Cali writes us that recent earthquakes there and severe damage to many churches, along with the crushing to death of several persons while praying in church, have tended to shake the faith of many churchgoers. Some begin to wonder and ask why God should do such things if the churches and people attending them are his. This affords courageous Witnesses the opportunity to show that the true God, Jehovah, the One that created the heavens and the earth, does not dwell in man-made temples and that he is not causing such destruction. It is explained that the earthquakes are part of the great sign now being fulfilled, which indicates the nearness of the end of this system of things along with its god, Satan, the enemy of Jehovah. Much literature has been placed with those truly interested in finding out more about such things and the hope for the future.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">CONGO REPUBLIC (Brazzaville)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 763 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;784,023</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 1,028</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The brothers in the Congo at the branch office in Brazzaville received very good news in December of 1961. At that time the government lifted the ban against the work, a ban that has been in effect</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">against the distribution of the literature of the Society for the past eleven years. It was not many months after that that Jehovah’s witnesses in the Congo Republic under the Brazzaville branch began using books, booklets and magazines in their preaching activity. What a joy to be able to go from house to house after so many years and to present something the people can read and understand in their own languages! The branch office in Brazzaville looks after the Congo Republic, Central African Republic, Republic of Gabon and also the Republic of Tchad. With literature now available it is believed that the work will make good progress during the 1963 service year. Here are some experiences as related by the branch servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is sometimes amazing to see how certain persons come to accept the truth and take their stand for God’s kingdom. A congregation servant relates the following experience: “Up until recently none of Jehovah’s witnesses in the town of Jacob had individual post-office boxes, and so to receive their subscriptions they were obliged to have the magazines sent to the address of the enterprise where they worked. The letter depots at these places of secular work are not well looked after, and anyone is free to come and search for his own correspondence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“One day a young worker, obsessed by the practicing of magic, came along to look for a letter from his magic professor. Amid the mail destined for the company and the workers he noticed some </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> magazines. Seeing that no one was looking, he seized them and hurriedly ran off into some high grass to hide long enough to unwrap the magazines, all the while thinking that here he had found the address of a new magic teacher.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“For two months the brothers missed their magazines but said nothing, believing there had been a delay in the mailing. Some time later while finishing a morning of activity in the house-to-house service, one of Jehovah’s witnesses happened to meet this young man who had stolen the magazines. Noticing that he was reading </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font5"> the brother stopped, engaged him in conversation, and asked where and how he had been able to obtain these magazines. The brother asked him: ‘Are you one of Jehovah’s witnesses? Do you know who Jehovah is? Are you a subscriber to the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font5">magazine?’ The young man could only answer no to all these queries. Trembling, fearful that his thievery had been discovered, he admitted to the brother that he had stolen the magazines from the letter depot where he worked. When the brother wanted to report the theft to the local gendarmerie, the young man begged him to settle the affair in a quiet, friendly way, and so invited the minister to come to his home—an invitation that the minister accepted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“After a very serious discussion between the two, the young man stated that Jesus Christ had asked to have his enemies pardoned in that they did not know what they were doing. Noting that the young man seemed genuinely sorry for what he had done, the brother sternly disciplined him verbally and invited him to all the congregation meetings and offered to study the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> magazine personally with him to help him understand what he was reading in the magazines he had taken. Fearful at first of being turned over to the local gendarmes if he did not attend meetings and study, the young man accepted the brother’s offer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“After several studies this young thief turned over to the visiting minister all his literature on magicpracticing to be burned. He made rapid progress in understanding, to the point of dedicating himself to Jehovah at a recent circuit assembly. Now he has joined the ranks of the regular pioneers and rejoices to be able to help others learn the truth.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 486 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 1,171,252</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 2,410</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Those who sigh and cry because of the injustice practiced by false religion are to be found in all corners of the earth, as illustrated by the following experience from a circuit servant working in small villages of the “bush”:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“While working from house to house with publishers from a small isolated group, I knocked on the door of a hut that proved to belong to a Protestant man. He did not wish to talk to me and curtly said: ‘I am Protestant and I do not want to worship a lot of gods. I come from Gabon, and for me you people have far too many gods.’ I replied by asking him if the people in the vicinity had treated him as a stranger. ‘Yes!’ he cried. ‘Many times they have mocked me and insulted me.’ ‘And are all these people non-Christian?’ I asked. ‘Certainly not! They are Protestant like me.' I explained to him that the religious systems of Christendom were not practicing true worship, and that Jesus, rather than upholding the influential religious institutions of his day, turned his listeners to God’s Word. Today, to imitate him we have to follow the instructions that are written in the Bible. ‘Do you have a Bible handy in your home?’ I inquired. ‘I would like to show you something interesting.’ He did possess a Bible and was happy to bring it out. Together we read Isaiah 2:4, and I assured him in a brief explanation that in the new world that God would soon create there would be no strangers and that never would one’s neighbors be mocking and insulting. This good news brightened up his face. He explained: Tn our local church we have two pastors and they cannot get along with each other. They constantly quarrel, even during the services. My wife and I are sick and tired of all that and very discouraged.’ I was able to assure him from the Bible that true Christians did not have such unloving conduct and went on to illustrate the harmony that will exist among true lovers of Jehovah under his kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Wishing to provide him with further Scriptural proof of the fine things he had heard, I presented four booklets. ‘Oh, how I would like to have them,’ he said, ‘but I have really no money at all.’ Despite the fact that he was very poor and had not too much to eat himself, he insisted that we accept three large bananas and some peanuts to cover the cost of the booklets. That same afternoon he came along to the public meeting, and while there made sure that the brothers had his address to visit him weekly. He has since attended regularly all the meetings of the small group and continues to make fine progress. His appreciation for the truth is evident to all.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">REPUBLIC OF GABON Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;416,142</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 40 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 10,404</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We have known for some time that there were isolated publishers in different regions of this republic, and this year for the first time we were able to send a circuit servant to meet and organize them to help train them for the ministry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During his first trip through this area he wrote indicating that an immense work was waiting to be accomplished, for the inhabitants listened attentively to the good news of God’s kingdom. “While witnessing,'” he states, “I often find myself facing an audience of from thirty to forty persons, and a simple sermon is not enough. I have to give an impromptu discourse, so much do these humble people want to know the good things of the Bible. Although most of them are very poor, it is not rare that I place about fifteen booklets at the end of my talk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“A short while ago,” he continues, “I met some natives that have known the truth since 1951, and during these past eleven years they have regularly witnessed with the Bible alone. They had never had any of the publications of the Society, nor any contact with the organization. The persons they had interested came from more than ten kilometers to ask me questions. Imagine my joy, and theirs too, when I was able to organize them into an isolated group and instruct them about Jehovah’s marvelous organization!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">REPUBLIC OF TCHAD Population: 2,574,600 Peals Publishers: 21 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 122,600</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The brothers in the Republic of Tchad have accomplished a very fine work during the past service year by persevering in the house-to-house witnessing. By means of their zealous efforts they have an increase in Kingdom proclaimers, despite the fact that they find few ears attentive to the message of good news. The population of this vast desert country is composed nearly entirely of persons practicing the Islam form of worship and little receptive to the teachings of Christianity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">CONGO (Leopoldville) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 13,559,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 2,124 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 6,383</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During the past year Jehovah’s witnesses in Africa in the Congo under the branch office at Leopoldville have been saying: “How Jehovah is good! How Jehovah is great!” Their joy was well founded and there was good reason for expressing such appreciation because great blessings were theirs from the hand of Jehovah during the year. They had an average increase of 20 percent in the number of publishers proclaiming the good news, and they reached a peak increase of 53 percent. During the past year the Society established a branch office in Leopoldville. This has enabled the work to move ahead rapidly, and special attention can now be given to the brothers in this country. Additionally, the provision was made for the Kingdom Ministry School to be in operation, and much enthusiasm has been shown by all the overseers who have been called to the school. This has had a marked influence on the lives of the African brothers dedicated to Jehovah God and the congregations with which they are associated. We rejoice with the prosperity these brothers have enjoyed, and the branch servant gives us some very interesting experiences of what has happened in the land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The brothers express appreciation for the fact that the Government respects their freedom of worship. The use of a great number of Bible publications provided by the Society and the use of the film “Happiness of the New World Society” have helped large numbers of people as well as many of the authorities to appreciate the organization of Jehovah’s witnesses and to see that it is not just a local group but is world-wide. All are happy to see that no racial discrimination is practiced in the New World society. Some of the authorities were so impressed that they arranged for film showings for some of their friends.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One congregation overseer wanted to come to school very much, but his employer would not give him the time off work. This brother put much faith in Jehovah and resigned from his regular job so that he could attend the school. This was done despite the fact that he has a wife and many children. To provide for his family while he was attending school, he took advantage of the fact that there are many United Nations personnel here in Leopoldville in need of food. Since he still owned some citrus groves, he was able to sell large amounts of citrus fruits to the United Nations headquarters. So his faith in Jehovah plus his industriousness after having to give up his regular employment all worked to help him realize that truly “Jehovah is good.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Others mention that, not only have they learned how to work more efficiently in the organization and with their brothers in the congregation, but they have even learned how to appreciate their family responsibilities to a much greater degree. The African family in general is a very loose arrangement. However, after the school the brothers express appreciation and say that now they will show more love and consideration toward their wife and children. They have found that by eating together they can use the opportunity for spiritually upbuilding their family and training their children properly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Many more people here in the Congo are realizing the conscientiousness and honesty of Jehovah’s witnesses. One European employer has a business in which he employs many people, some of whom are brothers. However, the employer stated that he wanted workers who were of his own religion to work in his home. Later he found that his wardrobe of suits was missing. After this, new workers were chosen for the work in his home; yes, they were to be Jehovah’s witnesses, for they were honest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">COSTA RICA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;1,260,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 2,700 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 467</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Paul advised Timothy: “Be training yourself with godly devotion as your aim.” (1 Tim. 4:7) While Jehovah’s witnesses have been doing this for years, still this past service year was outstanding in Costa Rica due to the fact that the Kingdom Ministry School was in operation and the good training received by the overseers was carried back to the congregations, which increased in number from sixty-nine to seventy-five. It brought great joy to all of Jehovah’s witnesses in this land when in the first month of the service year they reached a new peak in publishers. Interesting things happened during the year and the branch servant reports on some of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Much training was given in circuit and district assemblies. In addition to two district assemblies at the end of the service year there was a special national assembly in March at the time of the visit of Brother Knorr. A three-day assembly was arranged, and Brother Knorr arrived in time to give three talks on the final day. A record of 1,844 persons was in attendance at the public talk. The brothers were greatly encouraged by the counsel and showed it the following month, reaching a peak of 2,700 publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There has been no legal relief for the children expelled from school for refusing to violate their Christian consciences by saluting the flag. Nevertheless, most of the children are back in school, because many teachers have recognized their right to freedom of worship and let them return. But there are still those who would like to deprive them of this right; so they will have to continue to prove their integrity to God under test.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In October the first class of the Kingdom Ministry School began its studies and was followed by three more. A total of one hundred overseers and special pioneers received training in godly devotion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Because of religious prejudice it is difficult to place magazines in Costa Rica, but the magazines still do a fine work. A copy of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> was placed with a young man and, after reading it, he looked up the publisher and requested a Bible study in his home. He and his consensual mate studied for a few months and saw the necessity of legalizing their marriage. In April they started in the service and symbolized their dedication to Jehovah God by water immersion at the district assembly in August.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A rural congregation was in need of a Kingdom Hall, but, because of the economic situation, just did not have enough money to buy property and build. They did arrange to get a lot and then planted it in rice. Six months later when the rice was harvested they planted a crop of beans. Now after three crops they have almost enough money to build. They think one more crop will cover the cost of the Kingdom Hall.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In 1960 a rural congregation had grown to fifty publishers and a new congregation was formed so many of the brothers would not have to travel such long distances to get to the Kingdom Hall. A year later a third congregation was formed from the original group, and at the close of the service year there were still over fifty publishers, with more than fifty working in the two new congregations. The overseer attributes much of the growth to teaching many new ones to read and write. Now they share in teaching the Bible to others and in training them in godly devotion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">CUBA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6,466,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 15,364 Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 421</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah’s witnesses in Cuba are going through some most unusual experiences, much different from former years. However, despite many obstacles new peaks in publishers have been reached, as well as in hours, back-calls and home Bible studies. It is certainly true that the people in Cuba are taking notice of Jehovah’s name people because they are outstanding in their neutrality. In previous years there was little or no opposition to the work of preaching the good news of the kingdom of God, but things have begun to change. Serious interference and even destruction of the magazines in the mail took place in various locations. Some prejudiced postmasters have told the brothers not to expect any more mail. In May of 1962 the Department of Communications stopped the magazines from entering Cuba. Gradually information began to appear in the newspapers against the work of Jehovah’s witnesses, and there was some violent opposition expressed against God’s people. Considerable has been said over radio and television. These have been attacks by government spokesmen against the work. Now Jehovah’s witnesses are being classified as ‘counter revolutionaries’ and ‘foreign agents of Yankee imperialism.’ This is the same propaganda that has been broadcast in East Germany and in other locations behind the Iron Curtain. This kind of propaganda has aroused some mob action by the lawless and rabble elements. Some of Jehovah’s witnesses in Cuba have been arrested and put in jail. Nevertheless, this outbreak of opposition has only served to tighten the ranks of Jehovah’s witnesses in Cuba, for they trust God and will seek his guidance, protection and blessing. They are grateful for all his spiritual provisions. Jehovah’s hand is never shortened and Jehovah’s witnesses will press on, to the honor and glory of Jehovah’s name and to the blessing of those people who love righteousness and God’s words. Here are some interesting experiences about what is going on in Cuba.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A special pioneer writes us that he placed the book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise,</span><span class="font5"> but he noticed very little interest on the part of the householder. One afternoon after making all his back-calls he decided to pass by the man’s home anyway since there was nothing else to do. A study was started. In one month the man was publishing, and on July 1 this year he was baptized. It certainly pays never to judge before making the back-call. Just do the watering; Jehovah will determine the increase.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As to effectiveness in teaching doctrinal truth and cutting away the lies of false religion nothing can really take the place of home Bible studies. For example, a graduate of a correspondence Bible school needed only a few studies in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font5"> to see that his religious diploma meant nothing. Now he, his wife and son are publishers. Then again, only three months of studying the book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font5"> was sufficient for a sincere Pentecostal woman to see clearly the difference and the truth. She is now baptized and her husband is studying. The same is true regarding a Presbyterian Sundayschool teacher, who for forty years had belonged to this sect but, after studying the book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise,</span><span class="font5"> this sincere “sheep” expressed herself this way at a recent circuit assembly: “I am very happy to be able to participate in all this. I thank Jehovah for his mercy in using his own Shepherd Jesus Christ in gathering me to his true fold.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Several new peaks in number of pioneers were reached this year. It seems that everyone became pioneer-minded. District and circuit servants have cooperated diligently. One district servant writes that he made it his aim to talk to everyone possible about pioneering, and in five circuits he personally had aided fifty-seven publishers to become pioneers, twenty-one regular and thirty-six vacation pioneers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Other responsible servants report similar blessings. A Las Villas circuit servant says that he and his wife determined to do something in a certain congregation since no one was pioneering. Both encouraged pioneering during the visit. Result? Five filled out applications at the end of the visit, and the congregation servant made arrangements with the publishers so that there would be at least two vacation pioneers each month in that congregation. Such encouragement resulted in more than 1,300 pioneers during the month of August for this island.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Rapid reaction to the message has been gaining momentum during the service year. A circuit servant in Havana tells us about a study that was started with a Catholic instructor of Catholic youths. After studying the book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font5"> three months this zealous instructor began to publish as well as study the book with twenty-one Catholic boys. During the circuit servant’s visit five of the boys accompanied other publishers in the service, and fifteen of the twenty-one students were present for the public talk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">CYPRUS &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;594,600</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 532 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 1,118</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Things happen in this old world that are hard to understand unless one has an appreciation of the Word of God. For example, in Communist lands Jehovah’s witnesses are persecuted because they preach God’s kingdom, and in countries of Christendom such as Cyprus Jehovah’s witnesses are persecuted because they preach the Bible, which contains the message of God’s kingdom. The Greek Orthodox clergy have always been opposed to Jehovah’s witnesses. They have gone to some terrible extremes to show their opposition. When a brother and two sisters were preaching from house to house in a village, all three were severely beaten, and the opposer who beat the two sisters was a priest! Strange it is that this priest could not stand before the two sisters and use the sword of the spirit, the Word of God, but would rather use violence and beat two ministers of the Kingdom good news. Despite this, the work continues to make progress in Cyprus, even though extraordinary measures are taken to break up the missionary work. There are other experiences that the branch servant writes about, one of which is of violence and opposition. Additionally, there are items of interest from Israel too, which is under the jurisdiction of the branch office in Limassol.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">About a week ago a serious incident happened. On the evening of September 11, after 11 p.m., six masked men entered the missionary home at Famagusta through the window and, after beating Brother Psaltis with their fists on his face and chest, they tied Sisters Psaltis and McRae and cut their hair almost to the roots. Then they went on destroying books and magazines belonging to the missionaries and causing damage to home equipment estimated approximately at $140. They got all the missionary home and congregation records and other private things, put them into suitcases belonging to the brothers and left about 1 a.m. During all that time the brothers were giving a good witness to these “brave” men, and from their answers it was plainly understood that the reason was religious intolerance, as they were calling the brothers traitors of the religion of their fathers, and so forth. After the masked men left, the brothers were able to free themselves and reported the matter to the police. Strong protests have already been made to the acting president of the island ■—the president being absent in London—to certain embassies, the mayor of Famagusta, the commissioner and the heads of the police. A few newspapers have written articles condemning this barbarism, which has in fact become common in Cyprus. Most of the people are disgusted with the present state of affairs, and an advocate was heard to say: “I would like ideas fought against by ideas and not by means of violence.” There is no doubt that what has been permitted will be good for the work, as many persons will want to know why we are persecuted, since we cause no harm to anybody. The morale of all the brothers in general is very good and they do not show any signs of discouragement at all, in spite of the fact that the masked men said that we should expect much worse things in the future.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A special pioneer was having a Bible study with a family of seven persons living in a picturesque little village of the Papho district. Everything was going on well, but one evening the wife did not want to participate in the study because she was told by the “biack birds” that Jehovah’s witnesses believe that Mary had other children besides Jesus. The brother tried to prove this fact, but she said that she would not believe such a thing until reading it in a Bible of the Greek Orthodox Church. As they could not find one in the village, the husband promised to bring her one the next time he went to town. One day during the same week he went down to the river to load his lorry with stones. Among the stones he found a soaked book, which was nothing else but the Christian Greek Scriptures published by a Greek Orthodox. He took it joyfully to his wife and that served the purpose well. She changed her attitude immediately after having read in it exactly the same words read to her by the special pioneer. Her house is now used as a Kingdom Hall, where as many as twenty persons attend and almost all of them are publishers. Her young daughter served as a vacation pioneer during August. Even the stones can cry out the life-giving truth, which false religion has hidden under poisonous tradition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">ISRAEL &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 2,250,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 83 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 27,108</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As a rule perseverance finally wins. Here is an example: A newly dedicated sister met with strong opposition on the part of her husband when he heard that she was going from house to house. He began threatening her, but with no success. Finally he decided to isolate her, together with her two young daughters, in a faraway private camp. This caused the sister to miss the meetings, although she was doing her best to attend some of them occasionally. The congregation kept corresponding and encouraging her. Finally, after a few months, the husband realized that his home needed a woman’s touch; so he called back his wife and daughters, with the result that this faithful sister managed by means of perseverance to attend all the meetings again regularly and also go out in the service regularly. This isolation gave her much opportunity to teach the truth to her daughters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Literature placed often helps other people who did not take it themselves. A subscription for </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> and a book were placed with the sheikh of a Druse village. A Jewish man, who reads Arabic, visited the sheikh on business and his attention was attracted by the literature. The Druse, having noticed his special attention, let him have it. This man had in fact about twenty years ago read a set of ten books by Judge Rutherford in Hong Kong at the time the Japanese were attacking and he became convinced that this was the truth. Taken prisoner by the Japanese, he came in contact with men who broke down his faith on such points as the dates of 607 B.C. and 455 B.C. Before losing faith, he had written his story as to how he came to believe. He visited our congregation to see if we could help him to publish his book. Long discussions started on various nights on his main difficulties about chronology. He used many books to prove his points, but the brothers were able with the help of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watch Tower Publications Index</span><span class="font5"> and the Society’s publications to prove that the above dates used by the Society were correct. Now this man attends all meetings regularly together with his young daughter, and they both go in the service regularly. They are now looking forward to being baptized at the next assembly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">DENMARK &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;4,585,258</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 10,513 Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 436</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the country of Denmark very few people show any interest whatsoever in religious matters. This makes it difficult for the house-to-house publisher, because it takes only a few moments for the people to know that one of Jehovah’s witnesses is calling. It takes real stick-to-itiveness on the part of the witness of Jehovah to press on in territory where there is little interest, but, then, the Word of God tells us that this witness will be given right on until Jehovah says the work is done. So with the persistence with which Jehovah’s witnesses around the world do the gathering work in these last days our fellow witnesses in Denmark continue their preaching activity, and people are found who want to know about God’s Word. During the 1962 service year Denmark enjoyed a 5-percent increase in publishers and they rejoice now that they have reached a peak of 10,513 publishers in that country. The branch servant gives us some very interesting experiences from Denmark, the Faroe Islands and Greenland, and these are set out herewith. Great hardships must be endured by our brothers in the Faroe Islands and in Greenland, and you will enjoy knowing of their faith and integrity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Results often require long-lasting patience and endurance, as shown by the following experience where interest shown by a twelve-year-old boy sparked results. The man of the house had subscribed for </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> for seven or eight years, but, though he was visited often, he never showed any particular interest. He felt that his children would have difficulties in school if he associated with the Witnesses, so he decided to wait until the children were grown and could take their own stand. About a year ago a publisher visited this family and showed the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font5"> book, which the man said was very nice, but he would not take it then. At a later visit the man’s twelve-year-old son was present and he wanted very much to have the book, which was allowed him. During several back-calls thereafter the boy asked many questions and kept talking to his father about the matter daily. Last December a study was established with the entire family, father, mother and six children, and they soon began making the eleven-mile trip regularly to the Kingdom Hall meetings. Two of the young people are publishers in another congregation, and three of this family are publishing with the little congregation where they live, having contributed to this little congregation’s 30-percent increase, its first increase in several years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Sometimes a person cannot learn quickly enough. A sister called on a man who declared that he was a convinced evolutionist and had become such after many years of thorough study. Still he conversed a little with her and accepted the booklet </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Evolution versus The New World.</span><span class="font5"> He viewed the cover with an amused tolerance and indulgently asked, “Is it possible such a little booklet will overturn the results of many years of scientific research?” The publisher was invited to come again the following week and to bring along her husband. As he received them into his home the following week he exclaimed, “I am completely ruined! Everything that I have so painstakingly built up has collapsed around me. This little booklet’s logical argumentation has convinced me I am wrong. Now you must help me build up something new and, I hope, more enduring.” This man had already been out to see where the Kingdom Hall was located, and during that week he had rushed home from work and stayed there every evening for fear that the Witnesses would come when he was not home. The following week he attended a circuit assembly in his hometown and then began a regular Bible study. During the following two weeks he read two bound books and a number of booklets, and he is now regularly attending congregation meetings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Children can also play their part in spreading the good news. The six-year-old son of dedicated parents talked so much about the truth to his playmates that during a later working of this territory several parents who had not previously taken magazines said they had to obtain them now so they could answer the many questions asked by their children. One of these families has requested a Bible study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">By using all opportunities to witness we reach people whom we normally do not meet from house to house. A new sister traveling on a train in Denmark began witnessing to the others sharing her compartment. There were three foreigners who, in their broken Danish, asked many questions about Jehovah’s witnesses and their beliefs and readily accepted tracts. The sister learned later that one of her traveling companions was secretary to the chief of state of a large country in the Far East and one of the others was the ambassador for this country in Denmark.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">FAROE ISLANDS &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;34,596</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 26 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 1,331</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One pioneer tells of a young man who, while visiting relatives in Denmark, received some knowledge of the truth from them and was urged to get in touch with the Witnesses on the Faroe Islands when he returned home. He began having a Bible study and in addition started to attend meetings regularly. After five months he joined the ministry school, and besides witnessing to family and friends, he recently began to distribute handbills.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Religion plays an important part in the life of the Faroe Islanders. But there are those, especially among the young, who have their doubts about the message from the state church as well as that from other sects, and many of these are in serious danger of losing all faith in God. One young man in this situation met one of the special pioneers and began to put forward the questions that gave him doubts, naming several instances where he thought the Bible contradicted itself. Upon getting clear, definite and logical explanations as answers he became interested. He said that always before when he asked these same questions of different clergymen or missionaries he never got any definite answers, and while they on the one hand gave the appearance of looking to the Bible for support, they criticized it and claimed that it was contradictory. After having heard the explanations from the special pioneer he made an appointment for a back-call and invited several other young people along. A Bible study is conducted regularly with him and he says, “Before you came I was practically an atheist. I have been to many religious meetings but was always disappointed.” Without doubt these words express the feelings of many young Faroe Islanders—disappointment in false religion and hunger for the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">GREENLAND &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">33,113</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 13 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 3,759</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">For several years from two to four special pioneers have traveled along Greenland’s west coast visiting isolated villages and outposts and acquainting the people with the truth. Back-call and Bible-study work was carried on with interested persons as long as the pioneers were in the area, but soon there was no more territory and they would move on. More recently they have concentrated on the two larger towns, Godthab and Julianehftb, to build up the interested persons. With the help of a couple of families who have moved up from Denmark and who have living quarters in these two towns, it has been possible to organize a little congregation in each town, with the brothers using their homes as permanent meeting places.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An opportunity to give an extensive witness throughout a large part of Greenland has resulted from the newspaper campaign started by the church against Jehovah’s witnesses. In a series of articles appearing in the newspaper </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Gronlandsposten</span><span class="font5"> in both the Greenlandic and Danish languages, the Witnesses were accused of Biblical heathenism because they call God Jehovah and say that the “time of the end” began in 1914. Since this newspaper is distributed all over Greenland and reaches out to many isolated areas where our publishers have been unable to go, it was decided to use the opportunity to give a witness. One of the special pioneers immediately began to write several short articles that tactfully, clearly and correctly explained our message. The first article has already appeared word for word as written, both in Danish and Greenlandic, and the well-worded and constructive way the message was put has resulted in a much more friendly reaction from people in the witness work and has spread the message to many isolated areas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is our hope that other publishers from Denmark will respond to the call to serve where the need is great.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">DOMINICAN REPUBLIC Population: 4,070,100 Peak Publishers: 912 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 4,463</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“We became like those who were dreaming.” (Ps. 126:1) This expression of the freed Israelites on their return from captivity well expresses the feelings of the brothers in the Dominican Republic during the past year. What a contrast to the days and years before! At the year’s end there were 912 praisers of God. Truly, our brothers in the Dominican Republic can sing with all of God’s people the world around: “Jehovah has done a great thing in what he has done with us. We have become joyful.” (Ps. 126:3) Everything is on the increase, the distribution of literature, books, booklets, magazines and subscriptions. There was more time spent in the field service. Back-calls and Bible studies increased. And the reason for all this? Let the branch servant tell the story in these few experiences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The service year- began in turbulent times as the remnant of the thirty-year-long Trujillo regime fled the country under pressure of popular resistance. Soldiers lined the streets, days were filled with strikes and violence, nights with gunshots and noise-bomb explosions. Against this background a Kingdom Ministry School was set up to receive three different groups of students. Curfews altered class schedules, lectures were often interrupted by the rumble of tanks, students sometimes had to walk up to three miles due to transportation strikes, but the school kept on like a small island in a troubled sea. Not one class was missed. Of the fiftyseven brothers and sisters taking the course, seventeen had spent a total of thirty-six years in prison for the truth. The privilege of attending this month-long course was, after years of bans, restrictions, and persecution, indeed like a dream come true.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The people make much use of their new-found freedom of speech. A circuit servant became involved in a conversation with a group of persons on a bus who were loudly condemning the abuses of the past regime. When he reminded them that just a few months back they were still praising the man they now reviled, they replied, “But everyone had to do it; even </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">you.”</span><span class="font5"> His denial brought further inquiry and he identified himself as one of Jehovah’s witnesses. At this, one man spoke up saying, “True, these people did not worship Trujillo. But do you know why they could be so bold? Because they have a great lawyer who protected them. I was in prison with them and know. One day an order came through to kill them all off, but their lawyer intervened and a change was made.” Now the circuit servant was curious to know just who this “lawyer” was. Back came the man’s answer, “Jehovah.” The circuit servant counseled him and the other passengers to seek the services of this Lawyer also, placing magazines with them to help them do so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Magazine placements have long been a weak point in the activity here. As publishers learned that brief, pointed presentations were best, and service centers organized regular Magazine Day activity Saturday mornings and afternoons, placements grew and nearly 100,000 more magazines went out this year than last. One special pioneer heard the circuit servant explain the value of presenting magazines at every opportunity, going to and from territory, while on the way to meetings, and so forth, and thought the idea sounded good. On stepping outside the Kingdom Hall she tried it. Her six magazines went out in five minutes. By the month’s end she had placed 406 magazines, her husband had placed an additional 355, and the congregation’s average rose to 19 magazines per publisher in August.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Crowning the year’s events was a visit by the Society’s president. The first in ten years, it brought great joy to all the publishers. It was indeed a year of blessings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">ECUADOR &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 4,520,430</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 909 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 4,973</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During the past year the country of Ecuador has had its share of these “times hard to deal with.” Political upheavals, abrupt changes of government, a Communist scare with its accompanying strikes and general agitation have led to a state of affairs in which the foretold “increasing of lawlessness” has been evident everywhere. But, like Jehovah’s witnesses in other lands, God’s people kept on preaching amid these conditions, be they troublesome times or good times. They know the Kingdom must be preached; and, as is usually the case, many goodwill people were found during the troublesome times. People who love righteousness and are desirous of peaceful conditions enjoy the truth, and so during the year many more in Ecuador have come to a knowledge of the good news. The branch servant gives us a few very fine experiences of how new territory has been opened up.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the month of February two special pioneers began work in an unassigned town that is the center of the country’s railroad activities. By the end of the service year they had three new publishers with them, a weekly attendance of sixteen at meetings and twenty-seven Bible studies. One of these Bible studies is held with the wife of the superintendent of the government-operated railroad. On the basis of what this man has read in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Faith on the March,</span><span class="font5"> he has shown much goodwill toward the brothers, even though he himself does not study. When a Kingdom Hall was rented, he made a provision of benches for the audience to sit on; he also arranged for the painting of a sign for the Kingdom Hall.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the last month of the service year a brother who belongs to the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Jibaro</span><span class="font5"> Indians but who was separated from his family at an early age decided to do vacation pioneer work and go to search for his family. He traveled six days by canoe beyond the limits of “civilization” and finally came to his birthplace. His canoe capsized on the way and he lost everything except his briefcase, to which he clung tightly. On locating his family the brother found his uncle in charge of the community. The place had been visited on previous occasions by “evangelists” and Catholic priests, but the people had no knowledge of Jehovah’s purposes. Studies were held every night using the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font5"> book as a basis, with our brother translating into the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Jibaro </span><span class="font5">tongue. His fellow tribesmen were thrilled with the message. They tried to compel him to stay, but he explained that he had to return to bring his wife and six children. So his uncle allowed him to depart, but with these words: </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“1</span><span class="font5"> order you to come back as soon as possible. In the meantime I will gather all the tribe and we will build you a house, clean some land and plant it for you. Everything will be ready on your return—but by no means leave us in darkness; we need your help.” Now the brother is in the process of selling his house and all that he has so that he can return to the wilds of this only semi-explored territory to preach to a people whose life is still most primitive and who have not yet been fully incorporated into national life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">EIRE &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 2,814,703</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 211 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 13,340</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In Eire Jehovah’s witnesses are glad that they have kept up the preaching of the good news over the years. Their faithful and persistent preaching in the face of opposition has not been in vain. “Jehovah knows those who belong to him.” (2 Tim. 2:19) So when people get hungry for the truth they know where to come. For years Jehovah’s witnesses have been looking for “sheep” in this country and they have found some. Now, some of the “sheep” are looking for Jehovah’s witnesses, as indicated in the experiences that follow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A Catholic man, wanting to learn about the beliefs of Jehovah’s witnesses, called at the branch office one evening. He was invited inside and one of the missionaries talked to him, explaining the hope of the Kingdom and the benefits that it would extend to this earth within this generation. At the end of the discussion an offer of subscribing for </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> was readily accepted and an arrangement made for a further discussion on Friday, two days later. On Friday evening this interested person obtained </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God, Be True”</span><span class="font5"> and the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures.</span><span class="font5"> A study was started then and there, and he immediately began regular meeting attendance. After several weeks of study with him and the young lady who purported to be his wife, he explained that they were not married and because of reading the publications realized they would not be acceptable to Jehovah. When it was pointed out that they would be acceptable if they got married, it made them happy. Arrangements were made for the ceremony to be conducted in the local Kingdom Hall, and they are now living in harmony with Christian principles. After their first circuit assembly they were so impressed they wrote a letter of appreciation, which, among other things, said: “I should like you to extend on behalf of my wife and myself our sincere thanks and appreciation to all the brothers and sisters who were so kind and thoughtful to us during the unforgettable and very enlightening first circuit assembly that we attended. My wife and I had the feeling, which we have never had before, of ‘being wanted.’ My wife and I can both say we would never be ashamed of our association with any of ‘Jehovah’s witnesses.’ We ourselves, humble though we may be, are grateful for the gift from Jehovah God to be able at last to belong to and to call ourselves with pride ‘Jehovah’s witnesses.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The special issue of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> on “The Catholic Church in the 20th Century,” which had a special distribution in Eire over a period of twelve months, indirectly found its way into the hands of a young man of Catholic upbringing who had given much thought to the subject of religion. This was the thing that first impressed him. When he made contact with one of the local special pioneers he quickly began to appreciate the truth and talk about it to others. Violent opposition came, but he was undeterred. He became a dedicated servant of Jehovah early in the service year and soon began to think about the pioneer service. Making preparations for this, he began to look around for part-time work and told his employer of his intentions. His employer said: “You cannot leave me. I will let you work part time for me, and I will give you the same money.” So he is now pioneering, places many magazines, and one of the persons he has interested cycles sixteen miles in order to attend meetings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">EL SALVADOR &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 2,612,139</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 720 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 3,628</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark191"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark192"></a>Jehovah’s witnesses in El Salvador have taken to heart, the counsel given in the Bible at 2 Peter 3:18: “Go on growing in the undeserved kindness and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.” This desire for spiritual growth on the part of God’s servants has resulted in a fine service year. There was a 14-percent increase in publishers. Also among the highlights of the year was the United Worshipers District Assembly, at which 1,200 were in attendance. Then the president of the Society visited El Salvador and had the opportunity of using the new National Gymnasium for a public talk. At the same time the Kingdom Ministry School commenced for the benefit of the overseers, special pioneers and missionaries in the country. This school continued for four months, and some of those who have gone through the Kingdom Ministry School have had fine experiences. Below are some reports from the branch servant in El Salvador.</span></h3>
<p><span class="font5">The training received in the Kingdom Ministry School has produced many interesting experiences. One young special pioneer had the following to write: “One day while working from house to house I met a family belonging to a sect called Pentecostal. The conversation soon turned to the trinity doctrine. With the instruction I received in school fresh in my mind, I soon was able to prove to their satisfaction that this was </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font5"> false doctrine, and they took the publication </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">‘Let God Be True’</span><span class="font5"> from me. The man then turned to me and said, ‘Frankly, your organization has qualified ministers to teach the Bible. I have been a member of the Pentecostals for twelve years; how long have you been one of Jehovah’s witnesses?’ I told him, ‘Two years,’ and he replied, ‘Won’t you please come back and visit us and explain the Bible to us?’ ” This man now regularly has the opportunity to drink in the pure truths of the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Finding the Kingdom Ministry School a spiritual stimulant, a missionary sister wrote the following experience: “Working in magazine activity before the book study Tuesday evening I placed two magazines with a man who showed unusual interest in my message. He worked out of town, and time after time I called at his home only to find him not in. Months passed by. My husband and I had the privilege of attending the Kingdom Ministry School, and thoughts of this man of goodwill had faded from my mind, but the special training we received in the school stressed the need of showing love by calling back on all interested persons. My mind immediately recalled this man who had shown so much interest, so I made a special effort to contact him again. This time, to my joy, I found him at home. He readily subscribed for </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font5"> and arrangements were made for a study in their home using the booklet </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">‘This Good News of the Kingdom.’</span><span class="font5"> Since it was the Sunday before the celebration of the Memorial, I invited him to attend. He came with his woman, to whom he was not legally married, and his daughter. The next Sunday he came to the public talk, and afterward the subject of marriage came up. We explained the Bible requirements for marriage, and he expressed an eager desire to obey Bible instruction and said he would arrange his papers for marriage the following week. The next Sunday </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font5">went to the study and he looked especially happy and, showing me some clothes hanging on the wall, said: ‘Look, here are my new suit and my wife’s new dress for the wedding.’ Due to some difficulties in arranging his papers he was not able to get married the following week, but now, after four months’ time from hearing of Jehovah’s requirements for life, he is married, and both he and his wife are publishing Jehovah’s requirements for life to others.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Many people young in the truth are eagerly seeking more knowledge and ways to expand their service to Jehovah. One young sister, working in San Salvador as </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font5"> maid, had this desire to increase her service and knowledge, but it seemed impossible since she was required to work every day of the week with just time off to attend the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> study on Sunday. Then came time for the circuit assembly. She did not want to miss it, so she asked permission to attend. It was denied. She decided to take a positive step ahead, so she quit her job and attended the assembly. Afterward she remained in the assembly town serving as a pioneer with other special pioneers there. How much happier her life is now! She has been assigned as a special pioneer and is eager to begin her new assignment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">FIJI &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;413,872</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 242 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 1,710</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Society has a branch office in the Fiji Islands, and from there the interests of the Kingdom are cared for in many islands of the South Pacific. We have reports from seven different groups of islands, and the brothers in all these places are having marvelous experiences. A good many years ago brothers from Australia and New Zealand went to work where the need was great. Many of these had to return to their respective countries when the period of time they were allowed to stay in the islands had expired. However, during their stay they were able to aid many to get established in the truth. These new brothers, natives of the various islands, have gone ahead preaching the good news with excellent success. The experiences that follow show what is being done in the various islands of the South Pacific, where the work is growing at a rapid pace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Local people are quickly taking the lead, as is shown by this experience: A few months after arriving in Fiji to serve where the need is great, a brother started a study with a Hindu youth who showed great interest and made rapid progress. He immediately commenced attending meetings, invited himself out into the service and to studies with the brother. Then the test came. His father told him to stop preaching this Christian religion or get out of the house, as the whole family is Hindu. Choosing to carry on true worship, he was put out of the house, with the warning never to return. He was baptized at the next assembly and soon commenced vacation pioneer service. Next came regular pioneer service. Due to his excellent zeal and devotion he was appointed a special pioneer in a predominantly Indian territory. There he has set a high standard among the Indians, so much so that his father became impressed and surprised at the way his son is working. The son always writes his family, using these occasions to witness to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">AMERICAN SAMOA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;29,134</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Local people who are seeing Jehovah’s witnesses for what they really are are willing to see their own responsibilities too, as the following experience underscores: A thoughtful young man spoken to in the house-to-house ministry explained that he had met Jehovah’s witnesses before and was troubled by the things they showed him from the Bible. Why? He was a seminarian at a Roman Catholic school for priests and, after having finished four years of training, was due to be sent to a seminary in the United States. As president of the student body, he had in the past led students in ridiculing Jehovah’s witnesses. In his four seminary years he had never seen the Bible nor had his questions on scriptures satisfactorily answered by priests. His Catholic faith was weakening. “Once,” he said, “I played football with another village team, the captain of which was just beginning to preach with Jehovah’s witnesses. After the game, the new Witness took the opportunity to preach to me, and later I reflected: Here I am learning to be a priest, but I never have this zeal to preach my faith on every occasion.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Additional calls were made and after a study on the falling away from Christianity he became more sure of the course he wanted to take. His vacation ended and he went back to Western Samoa to the seminary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Two weeks later he was back. He had left the seminary, been ordered out of his home by his father, and was back in American Samoa to study daily with the Witnesses so as to learn to serve Jehovah in truth. Despite this great change in his life, he is holding steadfast and is anxious to get much knowledge of the truth as quickly as possible so that he can be accepted for baptism and then for service as a pioneer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">NEW CALEDONIA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;72,500</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 37 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 1,959</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The increase at the beginning of the year required the building of a small Kingdom Hall, the first to be built within the Fijian branch. Even then it was evident it would be swiftly outgrown, as many persons of goodwill, some only sympathizers, helped with its construction. Once the hall was completed, these people began to attend meetings and were soon engaged in the preaching work. The hall was the site of a splendid circuit assembly held during the year. By the end of the service year the new hall was already too small.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The brothers are having good success among Tahitians living in a community there. A Bible study was started with a Tahitian woman whose husband manifested particular opposition to the truth. Each time his wife told him about the new truths she learned, he replied: “It is not you who should teach me something. You are not able to teach me anything.” What happened next shows the importance of having brothers in the congregation contact opposing husbands of sisters and people of goodwill. The woman asked one of the brothers to speak with her husband, in the hope that he would listen. It turned out to be a real success. The man was surprised to receive Scriptural answers to his questions. Arrangements were made then and there to start a study with him. Some time later an Adventist pastor, hearing the man was studying with the Witnesses, tried to dissuade him from studying with them and to study with him instead. The person of goodwill said to the Adventist pastor: “Before the Witnesses came to me and started to teach me God’s Word, you never bothered about me. It is only now you come to see me.” This person is now a regular publisher.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">NEW HEBRIDES &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;53,700</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">A number of good studies were started during the year. Some were stopped by opposition, but others continue and are making progress. There is great need here for brothers speaking French and English. People are scattered over the two-hundred-mile-long island chain that forms the group, often accessible only by sea. Many </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font5"> books have been placed with natives who have returned to some of these islands. Wonderful opportunities exist in this land for those who desire to serve where the need is great.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">When one of the brothers whose father is a retired pastor opened his home for meetings, the rest of the villagers began stoning the roof. This made the brothers more determined to be regular at meetings and to intensify the house-to-house work. Their endurance under opposition has paid off. It is reported that others in the village now come to the meeting place, not to throw stones, but to attend the meetings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Being awake to opportunities to place magazines has fine results. Each lunch hour a brother used his time to read through the latest copies of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font5">and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> A fellow workman asked what he was reading and whether he had any comics. When told the nature of the magazines, the fellow workman asked why he preferred the Society’s magazines to comics. The brother answered, “Because comics are filled with stories about killing, stealing and broken marriages; I cannot follow what they say in my own way of life. However, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> are filled with things I can practice in my daily life, so are more valuable and practical than comics.” He took two copies of the magazines and later became a subscriber for both.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">TAHITI &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;73,201</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The work is surging ahead due to the outstanding zeal of brothers for whom the service has become a way of life. At every opportunity brothers are out in the service, and their enthusiasm is </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font5"> pleasure to witness. Meeting attendances are exceptionally high. Some groups of the congregation with only fifteen publishers have as many as forty at group studies. Meetings are lively and would go on into the small hours of the morning if no one called a halt. Often it is that people of goodwill must be told to go home, and the lights are turned out to enforce it!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Due to the unstable economic situation in Tahiti, most people take an active interest in politics. During house-to-house work the leader of one of the most popular parties was encountered. Having often quoted from the Bible during his campaigns, he already had some background knowledge of it. He quickly saw he had found the truth. Recently he was approached by his party to put his name on the list again. He explained he was already on a list. Opportunity was so given to preach to each one of the party. The result was that this news raced to the outmost islands. Today his house, formerly used for political meetings, has been converted into a Bible study center. He was baptized recently at the circuit assembly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">WESTERN SAMOA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;105,000</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The new self-governing state of Western Samoa had opportunity to show its attitude toward Jehovah’s witnesses when a district assembly was arranged for in its capital, Apia. As was the case last year, missionaries, special pioneers, branch and circuit servants were refused entry to the country. However, once more the local brothers rallied together and cared for a full three-day program and the organization of it. How grand it is to see these local brothers shouldering their responsibilities in the New World society and doing it so well!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Several delegations of brothers approached the prime minister about the refusal of permits for Jehovah’s witnesses to attend the convention. He called a cabinet meeting to have the decision changed, but nothing could be done at that time. He received clear answers to his questions and showed genuine appreciation for the clearly neutral stand of the brothers and also for their lawfulness. So there is much hope that the new state of Western Samoa will yet dignify itself by allowing the real practice of freedom of religion within its boundaries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One brother writes: “Do you know that about 3,000 attended the Independence Day celebration? and that nearly every fourth or fifth person must have had an </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Olomatamata</span><span class="font5"> (Samoan </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower) in</span><span class="font5"> his hand? The brothers placed more than 650 magazines among the crowd that morning.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As is happening elsewhere in these Pacific Islands, people are really beginning to see the difference between Jehovah’s witnesses and the false shepherds of Christendom. A special pioneer began a study with a Roman Catholic catechist and his wife. After two months of study, including the subject of life on earth in the new world, the catechist said: “All I have been teaching my people these many years has been false. Purgatory, hellfire, burning up of the earth—all wrong.” From that day he and his wife decided not. to go back to church. However, the priest, noting their absence, called to visit them. He came with the purpose of holding communion. Surprise turned to anger as he heard the catechist’s explanation, but he still went ahead with preparations to give them communion. The wife interrupted the proceedings by stating: “I have washed my hands clean of the wrong use of those emblems. The body and blood of Jesus were truly holy things. All these years I have partaken of them regularly in church, though I used bad language and did many other wrong things, setting a bad example. But no one ever corrected me; I was still allowed to take of the emblems, despite my unworthiness. It is only now with Jehovah’s witnesses that I am learning what it means to be a real Christian. I do not want to be partaking of those emblems so commonly.” The priest has not returned. The couple have remained steadfast, thankful for their new-found knowledge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">FINLAND &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4,514,920</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">The hearts of Jehovah’s witnesses in Finland are full of gratitude toward the Giver of “every good gift and every perfect present.” One of the grand gifts received during the year was the new Bethel home and factory, which was built in very beautiful natural surroundings just out of Helsinki. In January of 1962 the Bethel home was sufficiently ready for use and the Bethel family moved in. The Kingdom Ministry School course was put in operation, and by the end of the service year 157 congregation servants and special pioneers had received some very splendid training. Many of the neighbors around the Bethel home have become very interested in the work done in this place, and when everything was in readiness, the branch servant arranged for a dedication of the home and factory on June 9 and 10, and he invited all the neighbors to attend, as well as the brothers from the congregations roundabout. There were more than fifty of the neighbors who came to look over the home and factory, and they were very impressed with what they saw. The work continues to move ahead well in Finland, and here are a few experiences as reported by the branch servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Kingdom service is always joyful, and the many experiences that the brothers have sent in express the joy the publishers are having in the service. One brother writes: “I had just gotten a new workmate at my place of employment, and I immediately decided to take advantage of the opportunity to do some incidental witnessing. All morning I waited for the lunch hour so that I would have a chance to speak to him about the truth. I was a little nervous at the beginning of the lunch hour, as I did not know how he would react to it. It happened that he was a leftist in political viewpoint, but nonetheless meek and looking for something better. Right from the start he asked many questions and accepted the answers given. The following day I took him the book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">‘Let God Be True,’</span><span class="font5"> and we arranged to meet at his home. A study was started on the first call, and his wife and eight children also took part. After the third study the man announced that he had stopped smoking, although I had only casually mentioned why I did not smoke. At the fourth study he had another announcement to make: ‘I have handed in my political membership card.’ He continued to make rapid progress. After studying for two months he started out in the service and now he is a regular publisher. The district assembly, which was held in this city, gave him added courage, and he zealously took part in the volunteer convention activities. Since the assembly his wife has also taken part in the service, and all the children are making excellent progress in the Bible study, which is continuing in their home. I would probably never have had any association with this person if I had not taken advantage of the opportunity to do incidental witnessing, and I am glad that I did so the very first day, as he was working with me for only three days.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Even the antagonism of neighbors can be a blessing to one who has a right mental outlook. A </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">brother sent </span><span class="font5">a letter that shows that good can come even out of an evil turn. “Our congregation received a telephone call asking for Jehovah’s witnesses to make a call at a certain address. The caller gave the address and said she was interested in our work. Naturally, Immediate arrangements were made for a call. When we presented ourselves as Jehovah’s witnesses, saying that we had been invited to call, we were shown inside, but then we were informed that no one there had invited Jehovah’s witnesses to call. The lady of the house explained that she was not even the least bit interested in Jehovah’s witnesses, but that she had asked us in because she wanted to know what was behind this call. It seemed that one of the neighbors had wanted to annoy this lady and so had given her address to Jehovah’s witnesses. Well, since we had gained entrance to the home in such an unusual way, even though the person was not interested in our message, we gave the current sermon anyway, and this raised some questions and sufficient interest for us to be able to arrange for a back-call. After a few more calls we started a study, and now this lady whom the neighbor wanted to annoy is very happy for the knowledge she has gained and is taking part in the service herself. She has also brought one of her acquaintances to join in the study.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Some pioneers write that at a public talk they noticed a stranger following the talk very closely. When the congregation servant made inquiry later as to who this man was, no one seemed to know. Before the next talk the publishers advertised the talk over a wide area, and eagerly waited to see whether he would show up again. No one met him in the territory, but when the talk began there he was again. This time the congregation servant decided that he would not be allowed to slip out a second time, so as soon as the talk was over he went over to talk to this interested stranger. The man lived quite some distance away and had not been personally invited to either talk, but he had come because of seeing placards advertising the talk while on his way to do some work in the village where the talk was delivered. His address was obtained and arrangements were made to call on him. A study was started on the first call. His wife also proved to be of goodwill and they both made rapid progress. After four months the April special talk came around and they were both present. When the invitation was extended at the end of the talk to take some of the special magazines to give to friends and neighbors, this couple took away thirty-five copies. The brothers were a little worried as to how they would get on trying to put out all those magazines, but in a couple of days the congregation servant received a phone call: “Have you still got those special magazines? Our supply has run out!” They got more, and in their first month of service the man placed seventy copies and his wife thirty-five. From that time forward they have been regular in field service and both were immersed at the district assembly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">FRANCE &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 46,500,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 18,452 Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 2,520</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Steadily over the years the work in France has grown. In seven years’ time the average number of publishers in that land has more than doubled. In 1955 they averaged 8,512 publishers, and at the close of the 1962 service year they averaged 17,299, with a peak in publishers of 18,452. A marvelous ingathering of the “other sheep” has taken place. They had a very fine increase in the number of pioneers during the past year, and now France can say that all towns of over 20,000 population have publishers in them so that the people might hear the Kingdom message. The brothers in France appreciate the Kingdom Ministry School, too, because already 324 overseers and special pioneers have been taught. The branch office in Paris also looks after the work in Algeria, Malagasy Republic, Mali, Reunion, Senegal Republic and Tunisia. The branch servant gives us interesting experiences from all these places.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This experience concerns a very sincere person living in Brittany, a bastion of Catholicism in France. A study of the Bible with the help of the book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True” </span><span class="font5">was being conducted in this lady’s home. To set her mind at rest, she went to see her priest to ask him what he thought of the Bible. “It is a very fine book, but difficult to understand,” was his reply. She told him that she was studying the Bible and that she found nothing in it that corresponded with anything the priest had taught her. “What is that? You are studying the Bible! Don’t you know that it is necessary to spend many years of advanced study in theology in order to understand the Bible?” On hearing this, the lady, who has only had an ordinary education, asked the priest, who has spent many years in theological study, to explain the Bible to her. His reply was: “Madame, that is not all I have to do. All you need is what is said at mass. Do you attend mass?” When she replied, “No,” and insisted on the study of the Bible, he reasoned that she had been contacted by Jehovah’s witnesses. He then began to speak abusively of them, saying that they gave their own interpretation of the Bible, and as for the lady, he said that she was well and truly on the wrong road. She then said that she still had a chance if he would help her understand and see the difference. The priest replied: “But, Madame, I do not have the time. Can you imagine, if I had to help everybody to understand the Bible, I would have no time to conduct the mass. Listen, there is only one thing to do: start attending mass again. I will pray for you and you will very soon find the right road. You must realize what your parents will think, your friends, your neighbors. You will make yourself look ridiculous like that woman in our parish [he gave the name of another lady who was studying the Bible] who is the laughingstock of the whole district. Come now, come back quickly and you will see clearly.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Very shocked, the lady replied: “But you have said nothing that proved to me that Jehovah’s witnesses are in the wrong. You calumniate them; you try to persuade me by fear, but you have proved nothing. If that woman is the laughingstock of the district, that only makes her resemble Jesus and his apostles, who were also the laughingstock of others. No, I will not come back to mass, because I know now where the truth is. Jehovah’s witnesses have helped me to understand the Bible, but you, you refused to do so. I know what I must do.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There are some congregations where there is a need for brothers. Is there nothing that can be done to change this? Why, of course there is! Such was the case in one of the Paris units. This is what the overseer writes: “Our congregation, like many others, did not have sufficient brothers. Instead of thinking that this was the normal thing, we made it our aim to interest the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">whole family.</span><span class="font5"> When during return visits we happen to meet a different member of the family of the interested person, we try to interest this member. What we say to this person helps to instruct the one who is already interested, and shows how we can help others. In order to give attention to a whole family, my wife and I went together. In order to interest the husband, who did not believe in the Bible, I spent the first hour of the study discussing directly with him the theme ‘Why we accept the Bible.’ We discussed the fulfillment of prophecies in the past and those of the present day. It was clearly shown that these prophecies were undeniably true, and that therefore we could have full confidence in the rest of the Bible. After he saw </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">why</span><span class="font5"> we accept the Bible, we began the actual study. But we had a third person in the family to interest, a young boy of twelve years. After the first study had barely begun, he left, having no interest. How could we interest this boy? The following week I mentioned to the boy that previously he was occupied elsewhere but that this week I had something that would interest him, and that he could look over my book with me.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The first paragraph showed that Jehovah is greater than the scientists. I said to the boy that the scientists have no doubt accomplished some wonderful things, and we spoke for a few seconds about projectiles and sputniks, which were the talk of the day. The interest I showed in him, giving him a turn to read the paragraphs and to find texts in the Bible, also helped to arouse his interest. Soon the whole family, each with his own book well studied, met for study. Now the whole family engages in the preaching work, and that regularly for seven months.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The idea to interest the whole family </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">at the outset </span><span class="font5">has produced good results in our congregation. Since working on this idea we have more men in our congregation, and more families are united for life in the new world.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">ALGERIA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 10,000,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 171 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 58,480</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This service year has been one of great difficulty. The yeartext, “Be courageous and let your heart be strong. Yes, hope in Jehovah,” has very often been in the thoughts of the brothers during the armed raids, plasticbomb explosions and fires. (Ps. 27:14) The lives of some of the brothers and persons of goodwill have been endangered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The preaching work during the past year has not been less productive than in previous years. The fruit has ripened even quicker. Here is an example: A married</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">couple had been studying the Word of God for several months when the father of the husband was killed by </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">a </span><span class="font5">terrorist. Several days later the members of the opposing terrorist organization came to the interested man with a weapon so that he could avenge his father. The person of goodwill refused, saying that vengeance belonged to Jehovah. This attitude was considered treacherous, and could even mean death for him. In spite of this danger this man and his wife, parents of eight children, remained firm, confident in Jehovah, and they were right. Soon afterward they became zealous publishers and they are such to this day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In short, this year has been a year of trial for each one of us, but there have been many occasions for rejoicing. What a joy, for example, to be seated in the apartment serving as a Kingdom Hall, and to observe the brothers sitting together, brothers of different origin, Europeans, Jews, Arabs, and so forth, and yet outside in the city men were hunting one another, thirsting for their lives because of the difference of race and religion! Such a spectacle of peace in the Kingdom Hall causes one to be deeply moved, and one is really stirred to praise Jehovah, the Great Unifier of nations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">MALAGASY REPUBLIC Population: 5,655,888 Peak Publishers: 85 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 66,540</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Yes, Madagascar is a country where the harvest is great, and it is for that reason that a family of four persons came from the United States to work where the need is great. Their son has already learned to present the magazines in Malagasy with good results. In order to extend the work the Society sent six missionaries to Madagascar, and at the beginning of the year all the special pioneers in Madagascar had the joy of considering the course in the Kingdom Ministry School.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One day while engaging in magazine work two missionaries placed magazines with a lady and promised to come back and answer any questions she might have. They returned twice but did not find the lady at home. However, one day when making return visits in another section of the same territory, they found the lady waiting outside the house where they had been making a call. When they came out, she said: “You promised to come back and answer my questions. Will you come to my house now?” So she led them back to her house, where a study was started.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A publisher writes: “I worked from house to house and placed two </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> magazines. On the return visit the gentleman accepted two more magazines and asked me to bring him all the magazines from the beginning of the year. On the third visit I began a study with the booklet </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">‘Look! I Am Making All Things New.’</span><span class="font5"> His wife also attended the study, but as she did not know the French language, he was obliged to translate into Malagasy. After two months they began to witness to their neighbors, and after three months they wanted to share with the missionaries in going from house to house. The gentleman said: ‘We have been in our church all our lives, but our pastors have not taught us the things you have taught us during these studies. Jehovah’s witnesses have explained everything to us and now I can see that a Christian has to fight to know the truth.’&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">REPUBLIC OF MALI &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 4,200,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 840,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Mohammedanism is very strong in this country. While it is easy to approach the Moslems, they are afraid to quit their religion for fear of being expelled from their families and losing respect in the town.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A young man of goodwill, a Moslem, went to see a brother immediately after work one day, and said: “It is indeed bad for a man to have two wives! Now, look, when I was coming from work I saw a Moslem man preaching to a group of people, explaining to them that it is good for a man to have only one wife. He drew the attention of his audience to a too-heavily-loaded truck standing in the street, and asked them if the truck was overloaded. They replied, ‘Indeed, it is.’ The preacher replied: ‘It is like you, for you should have only one wife.’ I have heard about your doctrines. In fact, we prefer your church to the Catholic church, and I know that in a few years' time your people will have more members. So I will still study with you in that </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font5"> book, and I also need two for my friends.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">REPUBLIC OF SENEGAL Population: 2,220,000 Peak Publishers: 39 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 56,923</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A young man became so interested that after a little while he expressed the wish to accompany a publisher in the field. This resulted in his expulsion from his brother’s home. But he was not discouraged and he continued to witness. During the study of the book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font5"> he understood that Jehovah is a God who demands exclusive devotion, who does not tolerate the use of amulets or any other kind of fetish. The brother explained to him that those persons who held on to their amulets were not accepted as Jehovah’s witnesses and hence could not be baptized. After hearing this explanation the young man said: “I was completely enslaved before, and I can see now that the truth has really set me free. As a matter of fact I had several fetishes. Some were in a bottle that I kept very carefully in a suitcase. I had others in powder form. I used to anoint my entire body with this powder at a certain time of the day or when I was in difficulty. I used to take the most meticulous care of my ‘protector bottle’ lest it should get broken. And yet in spite of all this I was a Catholic, and I went to mass every Sunday to hear the priest sing </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Dominus vobiscum.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“One night after the study—it was the day we had read Deuteronomy 18:10-12—I could not sleep at all. Every time I thought of these verses I shuddered. When the dawn broke I got up and opened my suitcase where I kept my fetishes. I decided to destroy all of them. Although in my heart I hesitated a little, finally I overcame this hesitation by reading again the verses in Deuteronomy. Confident in Jehovah, I broke all my fetishes. Now I had to break the bottle. This bottle that I used to place so carefully in the suitcase so that it would not break became almost unbreakable that morning. I struck it on the ground several times and finally managed to break it. After having checked the contents I then put it into the trash can together with all my fetishes. When the sanitary service came to collect the rubbish, I said to myself, ‘Goodby, fetishes!’</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“From that morning forward I was free. And the suitcase that I used as a fetish case I now use for my Kingdom books.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">REPUBLIC OF TUNISIA Population: 3,800,000 Peak Publishers: 38 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 100,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Following is an experience received from Tunis: A young couple who had quite recently been baptized were walking in the park when they met a person of goodwill to whom they began to speak of the wonderful works of Jehovah. They came to a seat and there they continued their conversation with enthusiasm. On another park seat beside them sat a couple who seemed to be listening. After a while they got up and, passing in front of the brother, said: “Excuse me, but are you not Jehovah’s witnesses? I have heard a lot about them during the years, and I have had some long conversations with them. I am happy to meet you today.” Imagine the brother’s joy as he invited them to come and sit with them so that the conversation could continue among the five of them! An arrangement was made to conduct a home Bible study with this gentleman and his wife with the use of the book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">From Paradise Lost to Paradise Regained.</span><span class="font5"> This study is going along fine and this couple, who are Jewish, rejoice to know Christ as the Redeemer. As for the person of goodwill, this experience gave her much encouragement and she is now a dedicated sister in the congregation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">RWNION &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;356,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 32 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 11,125</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Two special pioneers accompanied by two publishers, one of whom is a child, began their service on this island in February, 1961. They quickly found ears attentive to their message. The joy of being liberated from religious enslavement, particularly noted in this island, makes persons anxious to share the good news quickly with others. Zeal in the preaching work has resulted in the formation of an accelerated training program, where brothers who have studied for ten months and published for six months train new publishers not only in the door-to-door work but also in making return visits and in conducting studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Are they happy to gather together twice a week in the vast wooden “case” arranged as a Kingdom Hall? Here is the average attendance: During the week seventy, and on Sundays a hundred persons of different colors are seated side by side to receive spiritual food. These meetings are very much appreciated by the natives, as is shown by the following experience.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Society asked a pioneer to visit a young couple whose parents live in France. The visit proved interesting. A study was started immediately. The pioneer, who conducts thirty home Bible studies a week, found it difficult to find an hour in his weekly program when he could come back to visit this couple. The husband suggested the Sunday afternoon. “I would like to come then, but we have a meeting that day,&quot; replied the pioneer. “A personal meeting?” asked the husband. The pioneer then explained how the meetings were conducted. “Then we can come!” declared the husband with enthusiasm. Somewhat taken aback by the enthusiasm of the couple, the pioneer took leave of them, saying: “See you Sunday, if it doesn’t rain!” (It was the season of tropical rains and the couple had a child of six months.) To this they replied: “It isn’t the rain that is going to stop us from drawing near to God now that we have found him.” They have not missed a meeting since that first visit and soon they will be baptized, thus symbolizing their dedication to Jehovah God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">GERMANY &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 54,698,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 74,165 Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 738</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The witness given in West Germany during the past service year has been the best in years, as the publishers there spent 9,480,126 hours in the field service. We see from this that the people of the land were given the opportunity to hear the truth, but not too many took their stand for the Kingdom. There was, however, a 4-percent increase in publishers. The overseers have been assisted greatly during the year in the Kingdom Ministry School. Seventeen groups of overseers and special pioneers have been trained at the branch office in this school. These overseers are helping the congregation publishers to see their responsibility and are giving them aid in every way they can to see the importance of preaching the good news. Those in the truth, of course, enjoy the ministry, but it is hard to find people at home in West Germany. One circuit servant reported that one can work for hours without finding anyone at home except the children, because both the parents are employed at some secular occupations. The booming prosperity in Western Germany has turned the minds of the majority to materialism. But whether people hear or not, Jehovah’s witnesses continue to preach the good news. The branch servant in Wiesbaden gives us a few experiences about what is going on in Western Germany. There is also a report on what is happening in the territory of West Berlin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Since all Western Germany has been assigned either to congregations or to special pioneers, there was no possibility of working in unassigned territories during the summer months. A special arrangement was therefore worked out. We encouraged the congregations that regularly cover their territory to assist other congregations having large territories that they are unable to work often. There were 205 congregations that in this way assisted 267 other congregations in covering their territory. Thus an attempt was made to reach every family at least once during the year with the Kingdom message. The overseers report: “It was an encouragement, not only for us, but also for the publishers, because they were happy to be working for a change in a territory where the people were not contacted so often,” whereas the brothers in smaller congregations and the pioneers were very much encouraged by the association they had with their brothers in field service. We read in one of the letters received, “The brothers were a great help to us in covering our territory. The joyful willingness to be of assistance to us was in itself an encouragement and greatly strengthened us.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The German labor shortage caused the government to bring in 700,000 workers from Italy, Spain and Greece. Among them are many persons of goodwill anxious to hear the good news of the Kingdom, for which reason we have had to place ever larger orders for literature in these languages. In Munich a Greek congregation has even been formed. Their first circuit servant visit was a real experience for them. There are twenty-nine persons in this congregation reporting field service, and all twenty-nine are enrolled in the theocratic ministry school. At the public lecture delivered by the circuit servant seventy persons were in attendance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the course of three years one congregation was able to reduce the number of irregular publishers from forty-five to only a single publisher. The congregation servant reports: “In harmony with </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry </span><span class="font5">suggestions, at the first of each month the assistant congregation servant made out a list of publishers needing particular help and then gave it to the study conductors. A second list was given them at the middle of the month, so that those could be helped who had not yet been active in the service. The study conductors were also advised to report their success each month. The congregation servant could then determine what the weak points were and make systematic arrangements for the servants and mature publishers to help the especially weak publishers.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">BERLIN &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2,182,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 5,023 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 434</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The conditions under which our brothers in Berlin have to carry on their service activities are well known throughout the world. Those living in Berlin do not tend to take such matters too seriously, however. The cold war of nerves has been going on for so long that this, together with the population’s general attitude, has made them rather apathetic. Then, too, Western German authorities have created certain financial advantages for those living in Berlin, making it like a luxuriant hothouse plant of prosperity blooming atop a powder keg.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The following report from a circuit servant shows us how determined the brothers are to serve Jehovah with their entire devotion: “At the conclusion of my last visit a sister who serves as study conductor decided to speak to all the sisters in her service center about the possibility of taking up vacation pioneer service. The study group consists of nine sisters and the study conductor, who Is a pioneer. Most of the sisters actually decided to vacation pioneer, six of them the very next month. The other three were prevented from doing so by understandable reasons. Their joy was so great and they had so many wonderful experiences that they decided to do the same thing again in the fall. So it was that all of them, with the exception of only one sister, who had Scriptural reasons preventing her, were vacation pioneers. They arranged their activity in such a way that they could use their vacation as well as take full advantage of the worldly holidays that came during this period.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The district assembly, held in the “Deutschlandhalle,” greatly encouraged the brothers. Those generally coming over from the East Zone were missed this year, but it is to be expected that the change in conditions will stir the brothers up to renewed activity in promoting Kingdom interests wholeheartedly. All reports indicate that our brothers living on this “island” all have the sincere desire of proving themselves courageous ministers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">GHANA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6,690,730</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">The past service year has been one of happy experiences for Jehovah’s witnesses in Ghana, although there have been some internal problems and unrest in the country from time to time. This has not unduly disturbed the witnessing work, nor the spiritual growth on the part of Jehovah’s witnesses. All of them have kept in mind the good advice set forth in God’s Word: “Return evil for evil to no one. Provide fine things in the sight of all men. If possible, as far as it depends upon you, be peaceable with all men.” (Rom. 12:17, 18) As Jehovah’s witnesses have pursued this course they were able to enjoy many experiences during the year, and these are set forth in the branch ser<a name="bookmark193"></a><a name="bookmark194"></a>vant’s report on the country. He also reports on the Ivory Coast and Togoland.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In a town in northern Ghana the congregation was having difficulty placing Bible magazines on Magazine Day. One enterprising publisher used a novel method and thus found a way to overcome the problem in part. He said: “The people often refused magazines and seemed to dislike seeing us come with our witnessing bags. I took a number of magazines and covered them inside a copy of the local newspaper, the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Graphic, </span><span class="font5">and left my bag behind. As a result placements came easy for me. They thought I was coming to discuss the news with them. However, I would tactfully compare their living with current articles in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> or </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> and then introduce the magazines to them. Within an hour I ran home again and took the rest of my magazine supply and they too were all placed in this manner.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Living clean moral lives and building a happy marriage arrangement are things Jehovah’s witnesses strive for and they are often studied in the congregations. A circuit servant reports: “When I was serving the Bontodiasi congregation the parents of the wife of the assistant congregation servant arrived with this stated purpose: ‘We have come with a special mission. You married our daughter five years ago and she has not given birth to a baby for us. We wanted you to have children so that you would increase our family, but all in vain. So, if you agree or not, we are taking our daughter back to Ashanti to give to somebody who can bring forth many children for us.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The brother, knowing that he had a legal marriage, replied, ‘But our marriage is legalized at the District Commissioner’s office. Let us all go and see if barrenness is ground for dissolving the marriage.’ The case was explained to the District Commissioner, who replied, ‘This is very childish really. Let me tell you, barrenness is no ground for divorce. If you attempt to dissolve this marriage you can be imprisoned for that.’ The worldly parents and relatives left defeated and never mentioned the matter again.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“As a result of this case the marriage of the brother and his wife is even happier, and many in the congregation have followed suit in obtaining civil marriages even though already married by native custom.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In house-to-house work a publisher met a dumb man. The man took in the truth readily and desired to have a share in the witnessing work but could not speak. He accompanied the sister on calls and while listening wanted so much to say something in addition that he would exert force in an effort to talk. Finally, he began uttering some sounds and eventually words. Now he can give a witness and generally be understood, much to the amazement of his former associates.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An army officer was invited to attend an assembly. During a tour of the grounds he came upon the lost and found department, but it was hard for him to believe that anything lost would actually be returned. While he was standing there a goodwill person came to inquire if a ten-shilling note had been found. Yes, it had, and it was promptly returned to her. This impressed him so much that he remarked that Jehovah’s witnesses certainly need no other reference for honesty than this assembly department.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We cannot close this report without a word about the construction of our new branch office and Bethel home. The first sod was turned on July 25. After a number of time-consuming problems in clearing the title of the land and obtaining permits to build we are happy that the building is at last under way, and at the time of writing this report the ground floor and walls are almost completed. All of Jehovah’s witnesses in Ghana are grateful for this provision to expand the Kingdom preaching activities throughout our territory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">IVORY COAST &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 3,200,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 114 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 28,070</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A group of brothers, including the circuit servant, were arrested pending inquiry into the death of a dis-fellowshiped person. During the course of investigations the police commissioner called the group for questioning and he appeared considerably opposed. However, the attitude of the brothers led him to inquire further and to be convinced. He held an interview with two clergymen and one of the arrested brothers, to testify to either the falsehood or the truthfulness of the Witnesses. He was convinced by what the brother had to say, changed his attitude completely, and worked for the release of some of them by the next day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The brothers who had to remain in prison for a time due to the case continued to give a fearless testimony. The local Seventh-day Adventists stopped visiting the prison when confronted with the situation of answering questions from the brothers in front of all the prisoners. Consequently, the brothers applied for and were granted the use of this time period to give public lectures to those who would like to attend. Before their release was effected two lectures were held, with over thirty persons at each. Regular meetings were held and two of the criminals began to take their stand for the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Toward the end of the service year negotiations were made to have a Gilead graduate and his wife apply for entry into Ivory Coast as missionaries. To the delight of all the brothers in the country this application was approved by the government officials, and the brother and his wife joined them in the ministry at the beginning of September, 1962. This will be a great help in strengthening the work in the country and will increase the amount of witnessing that can be accomplished.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">TOGOLAND &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 1,440,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 463 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 3,110</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The following experience well illustrates the value of assemblies in stirring up goodwill people to action. A congregation servant writes: “A goodwill person began to associate with the congregation, but his wife had less interest than he did. The time came for us to go to the national assembly in Ghana. This goodwill person could not arrange his affairs to be free to attend. Nevertheless, he decided that the wife should go and take note of everything so that she could impart the information to him when she returned. The wife agreed and went to the assembly with the congregation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The unity among those of differing tribes, the upbuilding teachings and the cooperation and happiness of the brothers made an impression on her so that she began to appreciate the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“When the wife returned from the assembly she told the husband what she had seen and what she heard and ended by saying, ‘The only thing I can say is this: From now on all the children and I will be going to the meetings and preaching with you.’ From that time till now the whole family has been regular at meetings and in the ministry.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At one congregation in Togoland a Methodist pastor took interest in the message and began to study with Jehovah’s witnesses. Little by little he began to recognize the truth and accept it. He was recently baptized and when he formally left the church twenty others left with him and began studying the Bible with the local congregation of Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">GREECE &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8,200,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 9,688 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 846</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the past year Jehovah’s witnesses in </span><span class="font6">Greece felt vigorous opposition against them from intolerant circles. The greatest activity against them was brought </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">by</span><span class="font6"> ministers of the Orthodox Church, using their religious press to rouse hostility in the minds of the people against God’s people. Despite the terrific hatred shown on the part of the clergy against Jehovah’s witnesses, the truth continues to spread in Greece and Jehovah sees to it that those who belong to him are found, for he will gather his “sheep” under one Shepherd. The brothers have had many good experiences during the year, and the branch servant reports on some of these.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In a small town near Athens a married couple went on a back-call with the circuit servant. A prejudiced neighbor, upon learning of this call, came in with her daughter to cause trouble to the brothers. When the circuit servant began to speak about God’s kingdom, this neighbor was constantly intervening in an attempt to sharpen the discussion and cause disturbance, with a view, as she said afterward, to sending her daughter to warn the police to come and catch the brothers in the act of proselytism. But the manner in which the circuit servant handled the discussion, steadily quoting Scripture texts, suggesting the lady find them herself and read them, brought a full change to the neighbor woman. Finally she told her daughter, “Go and call your father to come.” Her father came, and now all three persons were listening with care and appreciation. They asked for a call to be made at their own home, and there a Bible study was arranged. Five months later, when the circuit servant visited that small congregation again, he found that family of four members to be all regular publishers. Thus, instead of fetching the police, as she intended to, she fetched her husband, and now the whole family belongs to the New World society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In a town of northern Greece one brother who is a plumber was called to repair the plumbing system in the home of a superior jurist in the town. The brother performed his task most carefully and accurately and claimed a reasonable remuneration. All this impressed the householder, who asked why this plumber was so different from the other technicians whom he had previously called to do work at his home. The brother did not let the opportunity escape but spoke immediately to the jurist about Jehovah’s witnesses and their work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This higher jurist listened with astonishment and deep appreciation to what the plumber brother told him, and added: “I had an entirely different opinion about Jehovah’s witnesses, and even some days ago, when one of you people was on trial in the court of appeals, I voted against him. I now see how wrong I was. Please, pray to God to forgive this action of mine.” Experience shows that our </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">good</span><span class="font5"> conduct everywhere, even in our secular job, and our alertness in giving a witness, do help considerably to create a favorable attitude toward Jehovah’s witnesses and eliminate prejudice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A pioneer sister was assigned to help a sister who had made repeated calls on an interested woman, but, finally, noticing a loss of interest, she practically abandoned her. The pioneer sister suggested that they visit that lady, who was a teacher, together. The good handling of matters by the pioneer sister resulted in reviving the lady’s interest, and a Bible study was arranged immediately. Soon this teacher began to speak to her neighbors and at the homes where she was giving lessons about the truth. One day when the pioneer sister went with the publisher to the teacher’s home for the Bible study, she told them: “Please bring me ten copies of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> and a </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font5"> book, because I want to give them to persons whom I told about the truth.” Now this teacher is associated with the local congregation and is regularly having a share in the ministry. Perseverance and patience in helping goodwill people bring rich fruit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">GUADELOUPE &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;229,120</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 348 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 658</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Under the jurisdiction of the branch office in Guadeloupe come French Guiana and the island of Martinique in the Caribbean Sea. All these three places have enjoyed a remarkable increase during the year. As the branch servant says, the brothers in these three places kept in mind the admonition of Paul: “Really, woe is me if I did not declare the good news!” (1 Cor. 9:16) By following this course they brought many blessings to themselves and to those of the islands and French Guiana in South America. Many individuals have joined with them during this past year in their preaching of the good news and in dedicating their lives to Jehovah. <a name="bookmark195"></a><a name="bookmark196"></a>So their joy was full. Here are some of their reports on the various places from the branch servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Two ladies, one being the niece of the other, began to receive the Witnesses into their house. The niece, a schoolmistress, accepted a home Bible study and was invited several times to hear a public talk at the Kingdom Hall before attending. What she saw and heard made an excellent impression on her and she explained that to her aunt. But the lady expressed her disapproval that her niece went “there.” She said: “What will people say? Your colleagues will ridicule you. Of course, the Witnesses explain nicely the Bible, and I must confess that I listen to them with pleasure, but that is all. I don’t want to have anything else to do with them.” The niece, being convinced that she now knew the truth, remarked that it would be hypocritical not to live by it. But the aunt concluded: “I can practice the truth as well in my church, without caring for the priest. I have been brought up at the Catholic church. I will never give it up. Salvation can be gained anywhere.” Despite her deep Catholic feelings and a life full of the religious exercises of her church, the aunt did not refuse to have a home Bible study—because she loved so much the Bible Psalms.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The niece continued her good progress and made a new attempt to have her aunt come to the Kingdom Hall for a public talk. She at last succeeded. The lady was amazed to see no racial discrimination. She commented: “Everybody has been very nice. I did not think that it would be so interesting to go ‘there.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Soon she decided to go in the service. She became a zealous publisher and was baptized at the Courageous Ministers District Assembly of last July.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">FRENCH GUIANA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;50,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 21 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 2,381</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Working an unassigned territory, the isolated group in Cayenne some time ago went to a small village about eight miles away from their town. After several visits some persons of goodwill took subscriptions, and among them particular interest was found and a home Bible study was started.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">But in this country sometimes it happens that it rains one or two weeks without stopping. However, this does not hold back our courageous mininsters there, and, in spite of the bad weather, filled with joy at the prospect of feeding a “sheep” with truth, they kept on going.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This made a very good impression on that person, and one evening after the study she exclaimed, “Truly, I see your love in teaching us! For months, in spite of that bad weather, regularly you have come up here to give me the knowledge of the Word of God. Well, in turn, I will go each Sunday to your meetings!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This was really true. But after having attended the meeting, she was so filled with enthusiasm that she started to talk with her colleagues at work and her friends, saying to them, “Come! Come! There is nothing more wonderful than that meeting!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">MARTINIQUE &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;239,130</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 118 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 2,027</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Our brothers there did a fine work during the past service year. They appreciated very much having their first district assembly in Fort-de-France, where, on Sunday, three-quarters of the four hundred and sixteen attenders were persons of goodwill! Imagine the joy of the fourth quarter, the Witnesses, present, and also the good prospect for the future!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Four months ago a sister, a schoolmistress, received from one of her schoolgirls a handbill inviting her to hear a public talk by the Seventh-day Adventists. She went with another sister and, scrutinizing the audience, she saw one of her colleagues who had been her schoolmate. She said: “She here? I must absolutely talk with her.” Right after the talk she accosted her friend and, after a few words, she said to her: “You are slightly interested in the Bible I see.” Her friend answered: “Slightly, no! Fully!” “That’s fine,” was the answer of the sister, who, continuing, said: “If it is so, we will converse together on the Word of God. Would you?” Her friend replied: “Yes, but you know I am on the side of the Seventh-day Adventists and have been for four years, not on the side of Jehovah’s witnesses, because you are not in the truth, and you say things that are contrary to the Bible.” The sister answered: “If possible, could you give us an example?” She said, “Yes.” For instance, you say that Jesus Christ will be seen no more. However, the Bible says that ‘every eye will see him.’ ” “That’s true,” said the sister, but if you want we will come to your house to discuss that point. Would you?” She agreed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">So the day came for it, and after the discussion of that point all was cleared up in her mind. With her daughter, who also shared in the conversation, she said: “That is so clear for us now. We understood that subject so well!” The sister then invited them to our meetings, and they started to attend them regularly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">But the pastor came to their house, and it was an occasion for a good comparison. This, of course, was useful to show the truth, and, seeing the lack of sincerity of the pastor, the daughter exclaimed: “Monsieur Pastor, please understand! The explanations of Jehovah’s witnesses cannot be clearer! Yours are not right, and I see you do not want to understand, and this grieves us.” But after our sisters left the house the pastor said to the mother and her girl: “I will come back with some other verses.” But the girl answered him: “Useless, Pastor; we are already Jehovah’s witnesses in our heart.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A few weeks later they went out in the service to preach the good news, and both were baptized at the Courageous Ministers District Assembly of last August, and this only four months after the first contact! Truly the Lord knows those who belong to him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">GUATEMALA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;3,952,944</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 1,110 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 3,561</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah’s blessing was upon his servants in Guatemala all during the 1962 service year. They enjoyed great freedom to preach; and with strong hearts, hoping in Jehovah, the spirit of the brothers is good. They are looking forward to a new year now and to greater expansion because all the congregation servants have been trained in the Kingdom Ministry School. We feel sure that this will have a telling effect upon the organization in all the thirty-two congregations in Guatemala. The branch servant gives us a few highlights.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">By the end of January all congregation servants and special pioneers, in three groups of twenty-five each, had attended the Kingdom Ministry School. Many were the expressions of appreciation for this training. One wrote: “I am very grateful to Jehovah for his gift of permitting me to attend the Kingdom Ministry School . . . The twenty-eight days that I spent beside my brothers in joyful fellowship will always remain in my memory and heart.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We have a few who have come to serve where the need is great. They came by highway from Canada. Along the way they lost some material possessions due to accidents and sickness, but none of their love was lost. After their spending several years in the capital, during a circuit assembly it was pointed out through Jehovah’s organization that the need vzas great in many places outside the capital. Our brothers wanted to serve; so they moved to a town of 6,000 population only about twenty miles from the city. Special pioneers had worked there before, but after they left, the five publishers had stopped reporting. A Kingdom Hall was set up in their* home in the center of town and a theocratic program of meetings and service was begun. The preaching went forward rapidly, including two villages, one of which was fifteen miles away, and back in the mountains, where a dedicated sister lived. In a few months, in spite of continued opposition of the clergy and their followers, thirty-six persons of goodwill had taken their stand. A new congregation was formed and later a circuit assembly was arranged in the town. What a happy day! Five hundred and thirty brothers and persons of goodwill attended the public meeting. After less than a year there are forty-six publishers conducting thirty-three home Bible studies. Jehovah’s words proved true, as recorded in Isaiah 60:22: “The little one himself will become a thousand, and the small one a mighty nation. I myself, Jehovah, shall speed it up in its own time.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">HAITI &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 3,384,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 895 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 3,781</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During the last year the loyalty of Jehovah’s witnesses in Haiti has been tested due to the sudden expulsion of all foreign missionaries from the country. It was thought by the opposers that the preaching activity on the part of Jehovah’s witnesses would stop when the government expelled the missionaries, but Jehovah’s witnesses in Haiti were not trusting in men. They were trusting in Jehovah. They kept in mind during these troublesome days: “Be courageous and let your heart be strong. Yes, hope in Jehovah.” (Ps. 27:14) They worked diligently to gain maturity. They took on responsibilities locally and they have had excellent success, considering all the disturbance. Jehovah’s witnesses in Haiti are confident that Jehovah is directing his earthly organization, and this is being observed by a number of individuals not in the <a name="bookmark197"></a><a name="bookmark198"></a>organization. Here are some reports from the brothers looking after the work in Haiti.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A goodwill person made the remark to a brother: “After the departure of the foreign missionaries of your sect, I thought the preaching work of Jehovah’s witnesses was going to die out. But now I must confess the truth, that you show more zeal in your house-to-house witnessing.” Another goodwill person who has a home Bible study, conducted by one of our special pioneers in the north of Haiti, made this acknowledgment to the district servant at the end of one of our circuit assemblies: “I came to attend this assembly not as a goodwill person, but for the sake of curiosity, because I believed that this assembly would be a failure without the foreign missionaries. But I must confess that the servants are only instruments; to the extent that they submit themselves to the Holy Scriptures, the spirit of Jehovah will direct their steps, regardless of color or race.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Sunday I went to deliver a Bible talk in a church to an audience of 140 persons. Before I spoke the “pastor” informed the audience: “These brothers are not here to convert you. They are not here to receive money. They came to give us a better understanding of God’s Word. I am one of their students and I have learned a lot since I began studying with them. I no longer believe in the trinity. It is not Biblical. I will no longer pass the plate in the church for collections. I will leave the plate in the church, here on the table in front. You are welcome to make voluntary contributions, which will be used for church expenses.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Concerning the value of work in isolated territory to extend the preaching comes this experience: “A congregation of Witnesses in the north of the country has had the custom of organizing group witnessing in isolated territory every month. One of the publishers met a family with some of the Society’s publications, but they showed very little interest in the message of the Kingdom. The head of the family, who openly opposed the message, told the publisher that he would have his head chopped off if he persisted in visiting his household. But the congregation publisher did not get frightened; he continued visiting this family, and with what result? A home Bible study was started with the whole family. At present there is a nucleus of twelve publishers in this isolated territory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In June Jehovah blessed us with a 12-percent increase in publishers, making 880, and we had the privilege of holding four circuit assemblies throughout the country. A total of 1,707 persons heard the main talk, and 75 got baptized. Truly, Haiti is very happy to be one of the countries reporting theocratic expansion for this past service year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">HAWAII &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;620,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 1,799 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Katio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 345</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The situation in this disunited world, threatened by a desolate radioactive future, has caused many thinking persons in Hawaii to grope for God, and they have an opportunity to find him. Once persons who have sighed and cried because of the abominations that exist gain a knowledge of Jehovah’s purposes they rejoice in association with Jehovah’s witnesses. Many today are studying the Bible and are gaining a deep-rooted conviction, and in being associated with Jehovah’s people they are eager to do as Psalm 110:3 says: ‘offer themselves willingly on the day of his military force.’ The branch in Hawaii gives us some interesting experiences showing the zeal of those taking a stand for the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A youthful minister relates the following experience, showing that she is quick to obey and witnesses at every opportunity, even in the classroom: “One day the class was given an assignment to present three-minute demonstration talks. Everyone was planning on such subjects as sports, art or baking, which didn’t interest me at all. Instead I used the article from the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> magazine on ‘Shortcuts in Mathematics.’ After giving my demonstration, I had eleven requests for that particular magazine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Sometime later, the class was given another assignment, on Greek mythology. As I glanced over the topics that were to be given to us I noticed the topic, ‘The Balm of Gilead.’ The teacher questioned me over and over to make sure that I would take that subject, because none of the other classes were able to find any material on it except one Scriptural reference. I was certain though that the Society’s publications would help me find the needed information. After doing research, I had so many scriptures I decided to use my Bible in class. Everyone was amazed at my handling the Bible in such an easy way and also at all the information I had obtained.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“After class the teacher called me to her desk to find out more about Jehovah’s witnesses. I pointed out to her the benefits of the Theocratic Ministry School and other meetings because of the speaking ability that is gained from the school.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“I left a copy of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation</span><span class="font5"> in the school library for all to use. The teacher, although being a faithful churchgoer all her life, readily admitted that her knowledge of the Bible was limited. However, her desire was to learn more, and this enabled me to place the book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">‘Equipped for Every Good Work’</span><span class="font5"> with her, along with several booklets and magazines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“When school started, very few of the students in the class knew I was one of Jehovah’s witnesses, but by the time school ended I was like a portable Bible. When the students or the English teacher had any doubts or disputes on Bible subjects they would always ask me if I knew anything about it. Thus I was able to glorify Jehovah’s name further and make known his Word, the Bible.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A special pioneer had this gratifying experience: “A study was started with a young couple who were members of the Mormon church. The wife told me that many times after the study she would cry because the study of the Bible was destroying her belief in Mormonism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“After several weeks of lively discussion and study the wife decided that the only way she could relieve the confusion in her mind was to have a discussion with Jehovah’s witnesses and the Mormon elders together. The discussion was arranged and eighteen relatives and friends were also invited to attend. After one and a half hours of refutation there were no longer any doubts left in her mind or in her husband’s that the Mormon church was not teaching the truth. Another couple who attended the discussion were likewise convinced and have been attending our study weekly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Since the discussion with the Mormon elders the wife’s mother and father, who lived with them, moved from their home, the father being a member of the high priesthood of the Mormon church.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">HONDURAS &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 1,949,858</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">A national assembly in December was very stimulating to the brothers, and with the regular visits of the three circuit servants in Honduras Jehovah’s witnesses have been helped on to maturity to a greater degree. Another grand assistance to the brothers in this land, particularly to the overseers, was the Kingdom Ministry School, held during the months of June and July. This school presented to the congregation servants the outline of responsibility that they have toward all the “sheep” in their flocks. The proclaimers of good news in Honduras enjoyed a 9-percent increase, and here are a few experiences from the branch servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A circuit servant visited a brother who had moved into isolated territory two or tiiree years ago and had practically disappeared. The circuit servant found him and spent a week with him. He showed the brother how to conduct a regular study with his family and encouraged him to be regular in service. While there he took the brother with him in the service as much as possible. The brother published regularly during the following months and also conducted the study with his family, and now, since a second visit, he is sending in his own reports to the branch office. Such loving personal attention has Jehovah’s blessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Calling back on those who manifest interest even though they do not take literature brings fruitage. A visiting brother in one town called on a Catholic lady who is illiterate. Since she did not show interest in the sermon he was using, he switched over and began to discuss the Lord’s prayer. After hearing it read from the Moderna Version Bible, the woman asked to have it read to her again. “That is different from the way the priest says it,” she said. “I’m glad to hear it the right way.” She asked the brother if he would not copy it down for her on a piece of paper so her school-age daughter could read it to her. She produced an old piece of paper, and the brother copied it down word for word from the Moderna Bible. The girl was called in to see if she could read it back. She could, and the woman was delighted. Later the local special pioneers made a back-call, and now even though the woman does not know how to read, a study is being conducted in the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font5"> book every week with the family, and she no longer attends the Catholic church.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Incidental witnessing, even by persons of goodwill, can produce remarkable results. A man of goodwill in a large city always talked about the Kingdom at his secular work. One of his co-workers was a fervent Catholic, and they had many spirited discussions. After several years of persistence in talking about the truth, this co-worker was finally driven to a desperate decision. He asked to have an appointment with a mature brother to have this thing out once and for all. The assistant congregation servant agreed to an evening appointment and they discussed the Bible until 1 a.m. A second appointment was made, with similar results. After this second appointment a home Bible study was arranged for and agreed to by this man, who was now of goodwill. After studying for about nine months he was baptized and is a regular publisher of the good news. Now he preaches to the person of goodwill and cannot understand why he, too, does not dedicate his life to Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">HONG KONG &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;3,409,700</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 227 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 15,021</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah’s witnesses in Hong Kong fully realize that they have an enormous work to do among the millions of Chinese people who have made their homes in Hong Kong and who are refugees, using Hong Kong as an escape route from China. More work has been done than ever before in this colony. The publishers of the Kingdom good news spent 81,486 hours in the ministry during the year. All of them have worked hard, even though there has been no great increase in the number of Kingdom proclaimers working there. However, they have carried the good news to the tiny shanties on the rugged hillside, and they have regularly visited those who are relatively more fortunate, having-been resettled in vast housing blocks, where one is often followed by crowds of children who sing out the presentation long before the Witness has had a chance to speak to the persons at the doors. One of the difficulties the brothers have encountered is the community mind, and this presents a barrier to individual reception of the saving message of the Kingdom. The Witnesses do not stop there, however, but continue to higher levels, and those who live on the social plane of the rich are also given the opportunity to hear the good news. Here </span><span class="font5">are a few experiences that the branch servant sends in.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A missionary sister writes about a young lady who was a factory worker and showed such interest from the start as to arrange for a study speedily. In spite of factory shifts, which make meeting attendance difficult, she became regular at the group study. She heard of service arrangements and wanted to take part. Her actions quickly brought up a flare of opposition from her ancestor-worshiping parents. She faced the ultimatum, “Give this up or leave home.” Reasoning was hopeless. Tearful but determined to cling to her faith, she quit home, only to find that within a week she was begged to return, which she did on the promise of no interference. Another sticky problem had to be settled: A marriage had been previously arranged by her parents and a dowry had been paid to them, but the young man had no interest in the truth so she used her savings to refund the dowry. Having taken a clear stand, she made her dedication and was baptized at the following circuit assembly, and by the close of the service year she was doing fine work as a vacation pioneer. This is not an isolated case, for several others have shown true determination and courage in breaking through the barrier of family opposition to serve Jehovah in freedom. With them spiritual riches came first.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Some years ago a special pioneer in magazine work placed a single copy of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> with a shoemaker and his wife as they sat at lunch. On following up, it was found that the couple attended the Salvation Army meetings. After a Bible study was commenced with the wife, attendance at the Salvation Army meetings was dropped. The lady progressed, weathering opposition from her former “church,” and made a real effort to get to the meetings, although this called for much tactfulness, as she worked alongside her husband as an integral part of the business, and shoemakers work long hours. The special pioneer had to go, as she was assigned to a new area out of town; but in the meantime the newly interested one was assigned as a partner with another publisher and continued to advance to maturity. About a year ago the special pioneer took sick and had to be hospitalized for rest and treatment and, when again well enough, she went back on the pioneer list. She was very happy to find that she had a new assignment—and her partner? The shoemaker’s wife who had at one time taken a single magazine!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Hong Kong has a shifting population. Missionaries and special pioneers often experience that, after much labor has been spent and much careful attention has been given to newly interested ones in building them up, they move away overseas and have to be replaced by new study interest. No wonder, then, that the older brothers here are glad and grateful for the local Chinese brothers and sisters who have courageously stuck to the work and are now carrying a good share of the responsibilities at the office, at assemblies and in the congregations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">INDIA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 439,235,082</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 1,911 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 229,846</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The witnesses of Jehovah in India are able to report another year of progress, having a 9-per-cent increase. For them it has been another year without any restrictions on their activity by governmental authorities of the land. The brothers have been free to engage in every form of witnessing without molestation, and this is greatly appreciated. One very fine thing about the work in India is this: Many have seen their privilege of entering the pioneer service, as the branch servant says: “Parents are gradually learning the importance of training their children in preparation for the ministry.” What a fine thing! Here are some of the experiences enjoyed by the Witnesses in India.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Kingdom Ministry School was, perhaps, the outstanding gift of the year. We started with three classes running consecutively in our fine new Kingdom Hall at the Bethel in Bombay. Some students were accommodated right inside the Bethel home, while others were lodged nearby; all had their meals at Bethel. In this way the students got a double blessing, for by living and working at Bethel they saw something of branch organization and were trained in the finer ways of life and regular habits of living. It was an experience that they appreciated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The graduation of the first class was particularly impressive, as some of the more promising students were handed new assignments to places far away from their hometowns. For them it was as momentous as for students at Gilead receiving a foreign assignment. New territories now began to be opened up, and some fine experiences have been related by these brothers. During the year we have sent special pioneers into four entirely new territories, with splendid results in some already, notably in Shillong in the faraway province of Assam, and at Ranchi in the state of Bihar.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Three brothers went to Shillong at the beginning of the year and in two months sent in well over 200 subscriptions for </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> or </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> It was not long, of course, before the religious leaders began to feel alarmed. It truly was as if a locust plague were in their midst. On one occasion a Roman Catholic priest from a local seminary, along with some of his students, sought an interview with the pioneers. The interview was arranged and the priest and his students turned up half an hour late, but the pioneers were ready for them. The first problem that troubled the priest was the “trinity” doctrine, and from all accounts the brothers certainly won the day, for two days later one of the students met one of the pioneers on the road and wanted to beat him up, because, as he said: “You puzzled our ‘father’ and he is our professor.” Numerous warnings against Jehovah’s witnesses have been issued from local pulpits, and some studies were lost as a result, but now the real fruitage is beginning to be seen as the people are settling down to consider for themselves whether to stick to their old church traditions or accept the plain truths of the Bible. Many good studies are now being held.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Patience is truly a fine Christian quality, and the following experience well illustrates it. A pioneer sister started a home Bible study with a lady who showed good interest, but was opposed by her mother, her husband, and relatives. It looked as though the study would have to stop. But the pioneer persevered. This was five years ago. Eventually the mother was induced to join in the study. Two more years passed before the mother took her stand for the truth and symbolized her dedication. She then began to write to her other sons and daughters and sent them literature. Another year passed, and then three daughters and the husbands of two of them started having studies in their homes, but all the while the sister with whom the studies had first been started was still being bitterly opposed by her husband, even to the extent of preventing her from attending any meetings. She had made a dedication to Jehovah within her heart, but had never been allowed to be baptized. Articles in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> on the proper conduct of wives in divided households gave her the necessary instruction on how to act, and she faithfully followed those instructions. Her changed course of life made a deep impression on her own brothers and they began to study. Eventually her husband was moved to have studies with another publisher, and at our last district assembly in Bombay he presented himself for baptism and related his experience. It took over five years of patient adherence to theocratic principles to make a divided household into a united one, but it resulted also in twelve zealous publishers within one family relationship being united in the hope of life in the new world. That original home is now a service center.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is not often that people of other religious faiths make sufficient progress to make a stand for Jehovah’s worship. But one of the missionaries relates how she started a study with a Muslim girl. She was a good student and always had her lesson prepared. Her father was abroad on a lecture tour and while away was given a small statue of Jesus on a cross, which he brought home and gave to his daughter. She was quick to explain that it was only Roman Catholics who use images and statues; true Christians never do. However, the family moved to another town, where there were none of Jehovah’s witnesses, but this did not break off the studies. The missionary writes to say that every week, regularly, she receives a big envelope with all the answers to the questions in the study written out, and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> also, usually with additional questions that she does not understand. The Muslim girl was trying to arrange to attend an assembly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We enjoy freedom to preach and teach the willing ones the hope of life in the new world under a righteous government. The field is vast, and the cry for willing volunteers who are capable of taking oversight and supervising the work is great. We are certainly grateful to Jehovah for sending us missionaries from other lands and making it possible to give training to our Indian brothers who will accept the responsibility of taking the lead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">ICELAND &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;177,292</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 69 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 2,569</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The highlight of the year was that a branch office was established in Iceland on January 1, 1962. The brothers had the visit of a zone servant, and at their assembly in the capital, Reykjavik, a </span><span class="font6">bound book was released in the Icelandic language, the first new book in nine years. The special pioneers in the country as well as the congregation servant of the one congregation in the country also had the opportunity of attending the Kingdom Ministry School. All these events during the year made the brothers rejoice, and at the close of the year when they found that there were sixty-nine publishers, instead of the fifty-three that had reported during the previous year, they had good cause to rejoice. Seven persons were baptized during the twelve months. This small band of faithful witnesses of Jehovah in Iceland made an impression too, and here are a few experiences that have been sent in by the branch servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We had our first major encounter with clergy opposition in this country. Curiously enough, what touched off the attack was an interview with a young newly married pioneer couple. Both were foreign, and she had come all the way from California to marry this European brother, and this one of the newspapers thought was a very good story; so they ran it with pictures from the wedding, and in the interview our work was discussed. Also it was stated that this couple would be going to a small place out in the country to work as missionaries. The otherwise very docile clergy now came to life, and one morning big headlines on one of the major papers told everybody that the bishop of the State Church had issued a booklet warning of the activity of Jehovah’s witnesses, telling people to shut the doors and not listen to us. However, the newspapers were not content to bring a one-sided story; so the leading afternoon paper, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Visir,</span><span class="font5"> had an interview with the branch servant the same day, explaining our views, and other papers followed suit. In this way a tremendous witness was given, and many more people got to know of our work than ever before. Yes, some readers of the papers began writing them letters, taking the stand of Jehovah’s witnesses; so the poor bishop tried to fight his cause the same way, publishing a sort of “answer” to us. However, he did not get the last word. In a full-page article in the biggest of the dailies, the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">MorgunblaOv),</span><span class="font5"> Jehovah’s witnesses explained their work and beliefs thoroughly. So finally the storm subsided, and the outcome was a great publicity for the truth, and we still feel the effects in our work in the territory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Endurance and patience are qualities of great importance for us to succeed in our preaching and teaching work, as was illustrated in this story told by one of the special pioneers: “About two years ago I went with another pioneer on a back-call with a lady, whom he had contacted half a year ago, before he left the territory; so now, when in for a visit, he wanted to see her. To my great surprise she turned out to be well-known to me, because she had attended the meetings regularly some years ago, but then she had stopped and we had seen her only a few times in between, because she worked at the swimming pool where we used to perform baptisms at assemblies. Now as contact was made again, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font5"> study was arranged for immediately, and soon she told me why she had stopped attending meetings. One evening at a meeting the brothers had been told not to waste their time on those who did not make any progress. Now she knew herself to be the only one present not engaging in the preaching work, so she thought she might as well not continue taking the time of the busy Witnesses, so she stopped coming to the meetings altogether and also discontinued her private study. However, when she now revived her old knowledge through the study and began attending the meetings, she was soon very happy to make progress and join the ranks of the house-to-house publishers. And so it happened that she was again present the next time we had our assembly and a baptismal ceremony was performed. However, this time she was not attending as a mere onlooker because of being a swimming pool employee, but she was herself baptized as a sign of her wholehearted dedication to Jehovah God, and now she appreciates Jehovah’s long-suffering and patience with us all the more.”—2 Pet. 3:9, 15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">INDONESIA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 96,000,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 650 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 147,692</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah’s blessing upon the work of his servants in Indonesia has been very evident during the past service year. While we do not have very many publishers, to compare with the population, still those who come to a knowledge of the truth certainly appreciate the privilege of service that is extended to them, and many of them after learning and coming to maturity have entered the pioneer and special pioneer service. An excellent witness is being given on all the principal islands, Java, Kalimantan, Moluccas, Sulawesi, Sumatra, Sumba and Timor. Pioneers and special pioneers have gone out into isolated places and have certainly been blessed. They have been foremost in bringing in the increase, and many of them have also had the opportunity of going to the Kingdom Ministry School. This training has greatly improved their ministry. Here are some reports from the branch servant on the work in Indonesia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Pioneering is eagerly sought as a career by youths of the New World society in Indonesia, as well as by older persons. During the service year just closed 19 percent of the total publishers were in the full-time service. Some congregations are excellent examples in encouraging pioneer service. One small congregation that has never had more than thirty publishers has produced sixteen special pioneers who have gone out to other territories in the four years of its existence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Showing patience and kindness to opposed family members can bring good results in time. A young fisherman studied with a special pioneer and in a short while became convinced of the truth and began publishing. His father, an ardent Protestant and the senior elder of the church, angrily ordered him to quit associating with Jehovah’s witnesses or leave his home and never again be considered a son. The father ordered the circuit servant who came to see him to leave and never set foot in his house again. The older brother of the young man wrote the father from another city urging the father to go ahead and dismiss our brother before he corrupted the younger brothers and sisters. Our new brother maintained a quiet composure during the weeks of tension and made no reply. He did his work well in his father’s fishing business and showed diligence and proper respect around the house but continued studying and preaching from house to house. Although the situation was very tense in the home, the father did not get as far as carrying out his threat. Our brother made no mention of the truth during this period of trial but treated his father with kindness and respect. His good example surprised the other family members. Then trouble developed in his father’s church. One elder committed immorality. Another embezzled church funds. Other divisions arose. The father, sad about the conditions in his church, became more reasonable. Every day our brother had a chance to say more and more about the truth. The father could no longer defend his church and he remained silent, but he listened. Eventually the father stopped going to church, agreed to have a study and to allow his other children to study with our brother. The eventual result: The father, mother and five children are now publishers and their home is now the congregation Kingdom Hall. The son who first accepted the truth and his younger brother have now joined the special pioneer service and, like the early disciples, have left the fishing business to their father.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Some coming into the truth find it difficult to give up smoking. A new, zealous person shared in the field service the first day of the circuit servant’s visit. While working with the circuit servant he took out a cigarette and lit it up. The circuit servant began to talk to him about the wonderful witness given at the 1958 international assembly where more than 150,000 gathered each day and not one was smoking. After field service the circuit servant gave him some more information and reasons why Jehovah’s witnesses do not smoke. No more was seen of this person for the next three days of the visit. On Saturday night he came along with a big smile and expressed his regret to the circuit servant that he had not been able to join the activities during the last three days. He had stopped smoking, after being an inveterate smoker for forty years, and he had been so sick from not smoking that he could not do anything. Today, he said, he was feeling much better and he was sure he had now beaten the habit and would never smoke again. This so impressed his wife, who had previously shown no interest in the truth, that she agreed to begin studying.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">ITALY &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 50,463,762</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 6,929 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 7,283</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The good news of the Kingdom was again preached in Italy with real enthusiasm, and it produced an 11-percent increase in publishers during the past twelve months. A real expression of joy went up too when it was found that by the end of the year there was a 25-percent increase in the number of pioneers serving the interests of the Kingdom in comparison with the previous year’s average. There is so much territory in Italy for Kingdom publishers who can spend their full time preaching the good news. Many young people in the New World society, particularly in Italy, are realizing more and more that a full-time career is the only thing of real value at this end of the world. Many have chosen the pioneer service rather than selecting some worldly vocation. They know the need is great, and it is good to see their maturity. They are using their knowledge to bring comfort to others. The branch office in Rome looks after the activities of the work in Libya and Somalia as well as in Italy. Here are some experiences from the three places.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Taking advantage of every opportunity to preach is one way to reach the quota of ten hours and find some of the “sheep,” as was shown by the following experience sent in by a pioneer in N----: “Due to illness I</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">was sent to the hospital for fifteen days, but I was determined to do as much preaching as possible to other patients. My ministerial activity was not appreciated by some of the nuns in the hospital, who practically ran the place, so I had to carry on ‘underground.’ I found a great number of patients who were more sick spiritually than physically, and within a short time I had a Bible study started with six persons. I had to hold the study after nine o’clock at night so as not to be disturbed. After a few days the nuns discovered our study and they made every effort to get me expelled from the hospital. In the meantime a </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font5"> book that I had placed began to circulate among the patients until it fell into the hands of the ‘Mother Superior.’ To the surprise of all, she advised the patients that this was truly a beautiful book for all to read. Then, a day or two later, several nuns called me into a private room and assailed me with questions regarding baptism and other Bible doctrines. I explained how Jesus had been baptized, and, although they agreed, they stated that they had to obey the pope. They said that they admired Jehovah’s witnesses, however. During my stay at the hospital I placed thirty magazines and three books, and now there are four new families that study God’s Word with Jehovah’s witnesses. They may still be sick physically, but they are getting cured spiritually, and this is more vital!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Many publishers throughout the world are thinking about serving where the need is great, and Italy is one of such places. A number of native Italians living in the United States have written to the branch about coming back to Italy to serve where the need is great. The following experience sent in by an elderly sister who did this very thing may encourage others. The sister writes: “At the age of sixteen I decided to enter a convent and become a nun. Here I learned many things about the Catholic priests that made me realize how wrong it was for them to live without a companion. A vicar made advances toward me, and I became infatuated with him. To avoid sinning I decided to abandon the life of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font5"> nun, and so I emigrated to the United States, where I married and raised a family. Many years passed, and I became old. In 1958 I accepted the truth, and I was now anxious to share the life-giving message with my loved ones in Italy. I knew that all my brothers and sisters in Italy were strong Catholics, and when I sent them Bible literature, they would send me religious cards and images. So I decided that it would be well worth the cost to make them a personal visit. My mother was well over eighty years old, and, although she and the other members of the large family listened courteously, they made it clear that they had no intentions of changing their religion. To put a stop to my preaching they called in their ‘father’ confessor. But he did nothing but confirm the fact that the Bible does not support Catholic doctrines. Finally, he flew into such a fit of anger that he cried out: ‘You can have your Bible, and I’ll keep the “Holy Father.” ’ This action aroused the desire of my mother and sister to examine the Bible. A few days later they made up their mind to tell the priest not to come back anymore, since he had not proved anything from the Bible. My mother took down all her images and stated that she had decided to quit the Catholic church. This was a shock to the family and relatives, right down to the youngest niece and nephew. All wanted to know what made this eighty-six-year-old grandmother abandon the Catholic religion. It wasn’t long before the greater number of them were attending meetings at the Kingdom Hall. I had so many Bible studies among my own people that I just had to become a pioneer. Now I have been in Italy for about one year and, although I am returning to the United States for a few months to arrange some of my affairs, I am determined to come back as soon as possible because I realize that there is much need for publishers in this land. I intend to take up the pioneer service again, and even the special pioneer service, if the Society will permit me. I feel that I can meet the quotas even though I am sixty-four years of age.” Yes, we shall certainly be glad to see this sister over here again, and many more like her. How about you?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">LIBYA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 1,109,830</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">In a large family of nine, the husband permitted his wife to study the Bible with Jehovah’s witnesses. Recently the man died leaving the family in difficult economic conditions. The relatives tried to take advantage of the widow’s sad plight and poverty and made her an offering of financial assistance if she would stop studying the Bible. The widow answered that, when her husband was alive, he was glad to have her study the Bible, and now that he was dead, her faith in God’s Word was even more necessary. So she would not give up studying the Bible just to receive material assistance. Her spiritual needs were more important! She is anxious to become a preacher of the good news.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A mother of another family was taking driving lessons so as to be able to drive her husband’s car. One day her instructor told her that he was going to question her. She thought that the matter concerned her driving, but to her surprise he asked her if she would not like to give him something to read, since he knew that she was one of Jehovah’s witnesses. The sister was quick to supply the man with Bible literature, which he accepted with real joy. A few days later the instructor asked her some questions on the Bible and expressed regret that his religious leaders had kept God’s name in the dark. The sister arranged to have him talk with her husband, and what a surprise for both of them when it turned out that they were old acquaintances! In fact, some years ago the instructor had told him that he wanted nothing to do with Jehovah’s witnesses and that if they ever came to his door he would know how to handle them. Now he realizes that they alone have the truth. So, while the instructor teaches a Witness to stay on the road with a car, the Witness is teaching him how to stay on the highway that leads to eternal life.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The service year was highlighted by the showing of the films of the Society in two different cities and to mixed groups of Europeans, Americans, Arabs, Eritreans and Somalis. Many favorable comments were heard regarding the efficient organization of Jehovah’s wit-</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">nesses and the peace and unity of the New World society. A good witness was given to those who attended. In the city of M—— at first we had planned to use a private home for the showing of the film, but since so many had promised to come we rented a large hotel room. A literature display was arranged on two billiard tables, and many who saw the film were so impressed by it that they obtained literature after the showing. Some even decided to take some literature before the film was shown. One Somali was so anxious to get the only </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font5"> book that we had on display that he paid for it in advance so as to be sure to have it after the film showing. In this region the people usually pass on any reading matter for others to read. So the publications that we distributed will be read by many more people than those we talked to.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">While we were eating in the restaurant of the hotel where we had shown the film, a gentleman at a nearby table greeted us warmly and told us that he had read the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font5"> book that had been given to him by a friend. In a loud voice for all to hear in the restaurant, he exclaimed: “It will certainly be wonderful to live on the paradise earth after the battle of Armageddon, won’t it?’’ We continued conversing for a while, and then I arranged to meet him in our room for further discussion. The results were two new subscriptions obtained and two bound books placed. This man is certainly searching for the truth.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Freedom and independence were granted to Jamaica in August of 1962. The people of the land are seeking to orient themselves to their long-sought-for independence, and Jehovah’s witnesses are still determined to declare the good news of God’s kingdom. Jehovah’s witnesses in Jamaica keep in mind the words of the heavenly chorus recorded at Revelation 11:15: “The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ, and he will rule as king forever and ever.” There is still much work to be done in Jamaica and the comforting message of God’s kingdom must reach out into every nook and corner. Here are some of the experiences as <a name="bookmark199"></a><a name="bookmark200"></a>sent in by the branch servant concerning the work in Jamaica as well as in the Cayman Islands and Turks and Caicos Islands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Many have demonstrated this by the interest they have manifested in wanting to learn to read and develop this ability to be used in the Kingdom ministry. Interest in this was stimulated by your visit to this island in April, Brother Knorr, and since that time classes for reading have been organized at various Kingdom Halls. While the regular course in theocratic ministry is conducted, brothers who want to learn to read have their own classes. The publishers are pleased to know that the organization is interested in them so much that it will lend a hand to help them to learn to read.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A woman who lived in an out-of-the-way place showed a keen desire to learn, so a study was started with her. Immediately her attention turned to inviting some of her neighbors to the studies, which resulted in two more joining in the study. Lack of transportation made it impossible for the study to be conducted regularly by the publishers; so these “sheep” were shown how they could carry on the study without the publishers being present. When the publishers were there they would outline the workings of Jehovah’s organization and also teach these people the simplified sermons as outlined in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry,</span><span class="font5"> encouraging them to use these on their friends and other persons that called at their homes. For one zealous woman, witnessing to people who called on her was not enough. She saw the importance of going to people, and showed it by making her own arrangements one Sunday morning to witness from door to door in her community. She was pleased to report the placing of several magazines and has made it a practice to continue witnessing publicly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One young brother writes about a new religious knowledge book that was distributed to his class at the beginning of a term in school. He noticed that one part stated that the Bible was not true and referred to the stories of Adam and Eve, Jonah, and Noah as all myths. When the teacher entered the room she was asked to explain why such a statement should appear in this religious book. She showed that she was in agreement with the statement. She did not believe that Adam was the first man on earth. There were others here at the same time. The young brother quoted 2 Peter 1:20, 21 in proof that God inspired the Bible, so what it says is true. So she asked, “What about the story of Adam and Eve?” He suggested that the entire class open to Genesis 1:27; 2:18-25, which tells of the creation and marriage of Adam and Eve. The teacher was then asked if she believed the sayings of Jesus Christ to be true. She answered, Yes. Then this youthful minister turned to Matthew 19:4, 5, which contains Jesus’ reference to Adam and Eve being the first on earth. Her later questions about where Cain got his wife and the Flood being worldwide and not a local deluge, and the beginning of the various languages, were easily handled by this brother by use of the Bible and reference to what archaeologists have said. Youthful ministers are making an excellent contribution to the work of the New World society in Jamaica.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Two Courageous Ministers District Assemblies were held in the island of Jamaica with fine results. There were 6,222 in attendance and 125 immersed. Many of the brothers expressed appreciation for the information regarding the “superior authorities” and “The Word.” These expressions indicated that the brothers are determined to stand fast for the truth and to spend their energy and ability preaching it to others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">CAYMAN ISLANDS &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7,616</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 30 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 254</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The spirit of nationalism raised its head in an endeavor to interfere with the work of Jehovah’s witnesses in the Cayman Islands during the past year. The government officials were opposed to one special pioneer being on the island due to his being a Jamaican. Letters were written to the government explaining the work of the pioneers in the island and a guarantee given stating that they would not be a financial burden to the government. Thanks to Jehovah God, permission was granted for the special pioneer to continue in his assignment in the field ministry and give valuable assistance to the brothers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The people on these islands are very friendly and hospitable. As a result of this they will not turn the Witnesses away but prepare for them as they see them coming. Because of this the brothers are able to deliver their sermons and impress the people with the truth. This has led to fine progress and growth in the congregation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">TURKS AND CAICOS ISLANDS</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5,716</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 2,858</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Two faithful special pioneers are directing all their ministerial efforts to the main island of the Turks and Caicos group. At first the residents there did not pay much attention because of religious prejudice and indifference. Their views are changing in some respects. This is noted in this comment by an islander when one of the special pioneers was about to leave for medical treatment: “We hope you are not leaving for good. We are just getting acquainted with you.” Prejudice and fear play a big part in keeping the people from associating with Jehovah’s organization, but the brothers are willing to be patient and lovingly assist people to see the truth of God’s Word. A familiar comment from people who have to acknowledge that Jehovah’s witnesses know the Bible is: “If I continue studying with you Jehovah’s witnesses I will become a preacher.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">JAPAN &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 94,870,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 2,491 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 38,085</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Each year the proclamation of the good news of the Kingdom in Japan seems to be better accomplished than during the previous year. Again this year the report shows that Jehovah is gathering multitudes of those who say: “Come, you people, and let us go up to the mountain of Jehovah, to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will instruct us about his ways, and we will walk in his paths.” (Isa. 2:3) There has been </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font6"> steady flow of people of goodwill into Jehovah’s organization for six years, yes, more than a 20-percent increase each year in the ranks of those proclaiming the good news of God’s kingdom in Japan. Outstanding, too, is the distribution of magazines. The congregation publishers more than met their quota of twelve magazines each, averaging 12.7 for each publisher each month during the year. The pioneers averaged 117.5 and the special pioneers 156.3. For the third time in the history of the work in Japan the congregation publishers averaged at least ten hours. We see that here the brothers are coming to maturity and a deep appreciation of the truth and the need to spread it far and wide. It is a joy to see, too, that 12 percent of the average number of publishers in Japan during the 1962 service year were in the pioneer service, reaching a new high of 283 pioneers. The branch office in Tokyo has sent in some very interesting experiences about the work in Japan and Okinawa.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In Buddhist Japan the office of temple caretaker is often hereditary. It carries with it the centuries-old privilege of sounding out the hours on the temple bell and sweeping the dust from the temple courts. In the island of Shikoku there is a temple bell that has now stopped its booming, and the temple itself lies thick with dust. If you ask the townspeople why, they will tell you that the caretaker has abandoned her ancestral duty in order to study the Christian Bible. She now has more important duties as a regular publisher of Jehovah’s kingdom, and in assembling with his witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In making the change from the traditional religion to the true religion, some have to overcome great obstacles in the home. A new sister was bitterly opposed by her husband, because she wanted to study the Bible with their five children. He withheld her housekeeping money, so that for one week they had little more than salt and bean paste to live on. He said he would leave his wife, and called on the children to choose between their two parents. They were told it was a choice between salt and bean paste with mother, or plenty of food with father. With one accord, they chose to stay with their mother. At this the father gave up, decided not to leave, and he now no longer prevents their attending meetings. Several of the children have been baptized, and the oldest has been a vacation pioneer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">How about the old people? A seventy-three-year-old doctor who is studying with Jehovah’s witnesses came to a circuit assembly. He was so enthusiastic about it that he made this comment: “This truly is like paradise. Everyone seems so happy and kind. All these young people are different from the other youths of today. They are friendly and warm, even toward an old man like me. I’ve been connected with the Buddhist temple for ages, but it is so gloomy, and nothing like this assembly.” He shared in the door-to-door work on Saturday, and as he started out, met an old friend, a retired judge, aged eighty-three. He invited him to the assembly and, sure enough, he attended for the entire Sunday afternoon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Sharing in summer vacation pioneer work this year was an eighty-two-year-old sister in Kyoto. She supported the circuit servant’s visit every day, placing 62 magazines for the week, and 170 for the month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the city of Nagasaki an eighty-five-year-old new publisher expresses herself this way: “Truly, my viewpoint had been narrow. The worship of the ancestral gods of Japan is foolish. To learn the worship of the universal God of all mankind at my age is an inexpressible joy.” In support of true worship, this elderly sister has thrown out both her Shinto god-shelf and her Buddhist shrine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A high school principal in central Japan was </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font5"> sincere man, and one day he prayed to God to send someone to teach him the truth. Two or three days later a special pioneer called at his door, and he immediately began to find great encouragement in the regular Bible study that was started in his home. He was greatly impressed by the first Memorial celebration that he attended. The next week he gave up smoking, saying, “There will be no smoking in paradise, will there?” He was baptized at the next circuit assembly, and served as a vacation pioneer in unassigned territory during the past summer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The year was brought to a close by a stimulating series of four district assemblies, conveniently situated for the four main islands of Japan. A publisher who had planned to attend this, her first large assembly, was disappointed when her husband lost his job the week before. How could she now afford to attend? Another publisher, who had saved up for a new hat, decided to give the money to this sister instead, and others also helped generously. The sister cried with joy at being able to go to the assembly after all, and thanked Jehovah for his goodness. At the assembly she talked with many of the pioneers, and now she wants to pioneer herself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The 2,154 conventioners, including 109 baptized, were greatly refreshed for another year of service, and they parted company with a joyful, “See you next year in Kyoto!” The 1963 international assembly, in the ultramodern Kyoto City Hall, will undoubtedly be the 1963 highlight for Japan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">OKINAWA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;868,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 162 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 5,358</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A junior high school teacher watched for every opportunity to witness to her students. In answer to the question, “Who is God?” she received various answers, such as “Nichiren” (a Buddhist saint), “Our ancestors” and “Jesus Christ.” Then she told them about Jehovah. However, her problem was to study with the children, as regulations did not permit this at school. She invited those who were interested to come to her home and, with the help of two other publishers, she had good discussions with eight of them. One of her students is now a regular publisher; ten are now studying—some of them in the face of family opposition—and five of them traveled with her to the district assembly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A housewife who dedicated herself to serve Jehovah told her husband that she could no longer place offerings on the Buddhist altar. As he was the eldest son, the husband had the family altar in his home. At the season of “bon,” when the spirits of the ancestors are supposed to return, all the family came to the home, and they were outraged when the wife merely set out refreshments for them, with none for Buddha or the ancestors. They held family council and called on the eldest son to divorce his wife. However, he had previously overheard a visiting Witness giving his wife good, Scriptural counsel on how to maintain a happy family while faithfully serving Jehovah. He told his relatives that he wanted to keep his family together and that he would stand by his wife. Now he is studying too, and he attended the district assembly with his wife and children.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The district assembly was the largest, the best organized and the happiest ever held in Okinawa. The public talk attendance was 291, and nine were baptized in the open sea. Among those baptized was an elderly lady, who had been contacted and helped in her Bible study by a seventy-seven-year-old publisher. In fact, this elderly publisher was accompanied to the assembly by six other elderly publishers, all of whom had received the truth through the original publisher, and all of them supplying a good answer to those who may say, “I’m too old to study.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">KOREA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 24,930,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 4,416 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 5,645</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">What a joy it is to associate with courageous ministers the world over in this great preaching work of spreading the good news! In Korea Jehovah’s witnesses have shared in this great work during the past year. It took courage on their part to press on under adverse conditions, but with the constant flow of spiritual food the Korean publishers did well. The Kingdom Ministry School was an aid to them also, as 170 brothers and sisters received instruction there. Ninety-five of them were congregation overseers. By applying the things learned the brothers became better equipped for the feeding, leading, protecting and shepherding of Jehovah’s “sheep” in Korea. Things are constantly changing in Korea, due to last year’s revolution; but the brothers pay attention to the preaching work and have many interesting experiences, as reported by the branch servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We had three Courageous Ministers District Assemblies this year, and the combined attendance of 5,056 at the public meeting was the largest we have ever had at any district or national assemblies. The 3,478 brothers in attendance on Saturday listened with rapt attention to the information on the superior authorities. All realized what wonderful and especially timely information it is. The brothers here have much required of them by the superior authorities, so how good it is to know where a true Christian stands on that subject!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Placing magazines in the country villages here is difficult as people have very little money. A circuit servant who finds it easy to make the magazine quota visited a special pioneer who had trouble placing many magazines. The special pioneer writes: “I found that the circuit servant placed magazines easily by trading; so I tried that too. To my surprise I began placing more magazines and at the same time obtained many things I needed in daily life and would have to buy anyway. At present I carry a good-sized bag with me when I preach, as one day I traded for so much rice I couldn’t carry it all home.” That same circuit servant has traded for over fifty different items, ranging from toothpaste to rice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Applying Biblical principles in daily life, even before baptism, has its rewards. One sister placed one copy of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font5"> magazine with a woman and three days later on the back-call started a study. Regularly for three months they studied, and the woman began attending meetings. After six months of study she began preaching and spent twenty to thirty hours a month, placing over her quota of magazines by memorizing a brief sermon. This person of goodwill, not yet baptized, began studying with her children regularly. The publisher continued to discuss Christian conduct, the preaching work and other organizational things after the study, stressing how she should treat her unbelieving and sometimes opposing husband. This goodwill person followed the good Biblical advice. She kept her house in better order, neater and cleaner, and was tactful with her husband. The result? The husband also became interested, started studying, and now the whole family is in the truth. Peter’s advice to women about subjection to husbands and Christian conduct was well applied.—1 Pet. 3:1, 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Covering every corner of our territory is important too. This experience from a sister proves that. “While I was a vacation pioneer, I got a territory and covered it piece by piece. Nobody showed any interest, and one day I was so discouraged that I just left the last few houses and thought, ‘There can’t be any “sheep” in those places either.’ But my conscience didn’t allow me to return the territory card to the magazine territory servant until I had done those last few houses, so I went. My conscience was the right guide because there I found one of the ‘lost sheep,’ an inactive publisher who had moved into our congregation territory. First thing she wanted to do was review the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">‘Let God Be True’</span><span class="font5"> book, and we arranged to do so. Immediately she started associating with the congregation and coming to life. How happy I was to have finally done those last few places!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">LEBANON &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 1,250,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 764 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 1,636</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jesus said, You will be called &quot;before kings and governors for the sake of my name. It will turn out to you for a witness.” (Luke 21:12, 13) How true this statement is in the last days in many parts of the earth, and particularly in the territory of Lebanon, Syria and the Moslem countries of the Middle East! As for Lebanon, the reason for being before the rulers is that for the past six years the issues of the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font6"> magazines have been banned from the country on the false basis that these magazines are “Zionistic.” So continually our brothers speak to rulers about our problems. Despite this, the work goes grandly on and a good witness is being given in Lebanon, Bahrain Islands, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Qatar and Syria, and here are some experiences from the branch servant who looks after all these countries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Witnesses’ being well qualified for the ministry is a source of great annoyance to the clergy. Their resentment toward the truth continues to show itself in many ways. During the first day of 1962 an antireligious political party in Lebanon attempted a coup d’etat. The revolution failed. However, the clergy saw in this an opportunity to discredit our work by attempting to associate us with the defeated party. In a newspaper account written by an archbishop it was claimed: “Its [the PPS] doctrines must be those of Jehovah’s witnesses, for this is the way of Jehovah’s witnesses.” The rulers know quite well our way of worship and took no notice of the archbishop and his remarks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During a classroom session at a large school a small Witness stopped a teacher in his tracks. The teacher, a priest, was discussing John 1:1 and attempting to prove the trinity doctrine. The little brother asked for permission to change just one word in the verse, to try to find agreement with what he was being expected to believe. The priest agreed. The little brother read aloud in Arabic: “In the beginning was the [God] and the [God] was with the God and the [God] was the God.” When he finished he looked at the priest, shook his small head and said: “What did we understand from that?” The priest looked at him hard, paused, rose and walked out of the room without a word. The class registered their approval by applauding the little Witness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We are happy to report that finding new territory to work is becoming a problem in at least one city. A brother who took up pioneering finished the territory assigned to him and asked for a new one. He was told, “There is no territory available.” While passing the city park he saw many people sitting and enjoying the greenery so he decided to approach them with the message. The results were very encouraging. He would start out his introduction by commenting on the beautiful flowers and how this compared with the beauty of the paradise of Eden that was lost but that would someday be regained. He placed much literature and got many appointments to meet the same people in their homes. After his discussing the interest found in the park with the congregation servant, the park was made a regular territory, and the brothers can now select it if they want to do “park witnessing.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Preaching the word in troublesome season in a highly fanatical Maronite town, sometimes called “The Vatican of the East,” has led to more than a good witness. Two special pioneers were assigned to the town and the longer they were present the more disturbed the clergy became. Their animosity caused them to try to pressure the landlord into evicting the couple from their home. But the landlord said he could not, because, as he said, ‘Where could I find better people to rent to?’ Students from the most advanced religious school in the area came in the absence of the pioneers and molested the home, leaving a threatening message. The pioneers remained firm. The clergy then signed a petition against them and sent it to the governor, with the result that an investigator came to them charging them with “revolutionary activity.” When he learned the truth he left recommending no action be taken and said: “You are true Christians indeed. What the clergy are doing is nothing but envy and jealousy. Go on with your message, and may God be with you.” This type of thing, with the same results, occurred, all together, three times. In desperation the clergy even started printing pictures of the “Virgin Mary,” on the back of which were written ten [new] commandments, such as (1) Don’t argue with Jehovah’s witnesses, (2) Don’t accept literature, and so forth. The results of all of this? A congregation has been formed, local brothers compose the service committee, prejudice has been broken in the community to an extent and one person of goodwill, hearing about the 1963 assemblies, invited “three or four” of the Witnesses to come to him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">BAHRAIN ISLANDS &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;143,213</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Bahrain is one of a group of small islands in the Persian Gulf. Although this island is only ten miles wide and thirty miles long, there are still many, many persons who have not heard about Jehovah’s kingdom or his witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Brother Henschel’s visit during the year was appreciated by the one lone publisher there, and following his visit she felt encouraged to keep on with her service. She wrote the Society to tell how the nurses in a hospital were informed about Jehovah’s name people in this place as follows: ‘It was made clear to the doctors that under no circumstances did I want a blood transfusion. This information was put into the records and attached to the progress chart clipped to the foot of the bed. Many of the nurses had never heard of Jehovah’s witnesses before, but when they noticed that the records said “no blood transfusions” they wanted to know why and also to know more about this “queer religion.” It was a good chance to witness.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During a visit of one of the circuit servants the brother was introduced to a young Indian man of the Roman Catholic faith. He also had never heard of Jehovah’s witnesses before. However, he listened to a discussion about the subject of Jehovah’s established kingdom and several times read scriptures from the Bible when invited to do so. Later he confessed to the householder that he was thrilled with the information and that it was different from anything he had ever heard before. He also confessed: &quot;It came as a real shock when your friend asked me to read from the Bible, as it was the first time I had ever touched one, but I didn’t want to refuse the man so I read from it and I enjoyed reading it very much.” This man had been a Roman Catholic all his life.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The Society’s comments in the February 1, 1962, issue of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> on Jesus’ words: “You will by no means complete the circuit of the cities of Israel until the Son of man arrives,” were certainly appreciated by the friends in Iran. (Matt. 10:23) There are an estimated 57,748 villages in this country of almost nineteen million people. At the present time the brothers find that they have more than they can do in just the capital city of Tehran. Certainly until Armageddon strikes, the brothers here know that they will never run out of new territory to work. The need for more to serve here is great. The population is increasing at the rate of almost one million per year, while the congregation is increasing by only one or two. Can anyone come and assist here?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Children are doing their share to see that the Kingdom is preached, and one mother gave the following experience: ‘Most foreign children in this city have to learn several languages to be able to get any schooling, and mine are no exception. Consequently they attend a French school, and therefore speak not only English but some French and Persian as well. This gives the children a wonderful opportunity to witness to both European, American and Persian children who would otherwise perhaps not hear the good news. They take their Bibles to school with them and are prepared to answer questions. Through this witnessing my nine-year-old daughter was able to start a study in the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise </span><span class="font5">book with another little English girl of similar age. She has been brought up </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font5"> Catholic, but permission was gained from the parents for the study, and the children studied together in the school playground at lunch times, three times a week. This child was absolutely thrilled with what she learned and told her parents, who seemed quite interested.’</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Fear and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">suspicion</span><span class="font5"> of almost everything Western in certain fields grips Iraq. The country has experienced many difficulties since its revolution of July 14, 1958. Recently in Iran a brother tried to take a subscription for the Arabic edition of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> from some Iraqi visitors passing through on their way home. However, when they heard that the magazine was printed in America, they refused to subscribe, saying they were afraid of what their government might do to them if they discovered it coming to them through the post.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One sister wrote: ‘Recently I was rewriting the notes that I took on a visiting brother’s talks, and it was as if he were here in the midst of us again. In fact, I understood his talks more as I studied them. We had some very good advice and we pray that we will keep it in mind, always realizing the big responsibility we have to the name that we bear. We are having regular meetings now and really enjoying ourselves. When one reads a few experiences in the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font5"> it makes him realize how small his own problems really are. It doesn’t matter what the size of the problem is as long as we do our best and trust in Jehovah. Jehovah is blessing us very much, and we behold the pleasantness of Jehovah more and more each day.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">JORDAN &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 1,636,000</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Though Jehovah’s witnesses have been legally recognized in Jordan, there are still some legal problems and it was necessary to spend a lot of time during the year calling on government officials. This has had a good effect as they thus get to know better who Jehovah’s witnesses are. As one high official who had just had his former bad opinion of Jehovah’s people cleared away put it, “You were the victims of propaganda.” But propaganda cannot stand against the truth, so many officials and people in general are coming to understand that we are not Zionists or Communists, as some try to say we are, but honest Christians.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is good to witness tactfully to people even though we know them to be opposed, as the following experience shows. A pioneer and his wife went to call on some of their relatives that they knew hated the truth. Since they knew that the minds of these persons were closed on the subject of the truth, they thought it best just to make a friendly visit the first time and try to break down some of the prejudice. This took the opposers off guard, as they had expected to be “preached to.” Soon out of curiosity they began to ask the brothers questions, and it was not long before a Bible study was started with the whole family. After two months of study they started attending all congregation meetings and have missed very few since. A short time later three of the family became publishers. At this point strong opposition and persecution came upon them from the new sister’s father who is a priest. In spite of this a few months later at the assembly held during Brother Henschel’s visit two of them symbolized their dedication by baptism. Now they continue as happy members of the New World society, grateful to be free of the bonds of darkness in Satan’s world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As this service year ends, Jehovah’s witnesses in Jordan have much for which to be thankful. During the year two new missionaries were sent into the country. At the last assembly held during August the happy announcement was made that beginning with the new service year, on September 1, 1962, the Society would open a new branch office in Jordan to look after the work. This should certainly result in greater progress, and the brothers are thankful for this kind provision of Jehovah and his organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Already we are looking forward to and preparing for the big event of next year when our brothers will be coming to Jerusalem from all over the world during the summer of 1963. It will be a joy to receive them and show them the many interesting things in the historical city of Jerusalem and in other parts of the Holy Land.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">During the hottest part of the summer a brother was going from house to house in spite of the fact that the temperature was above 125 degrees. At one door the householder turned the brother away, but left his door open and listened to the conversation that took place with his neighbor. When the sermon was finished and he was about to leave, the first householder called the publisher back and asked him what his religion was. The brother was then invited in and an apology was offered for turning him away. “I wish that I had known that you were one of Jehovah’s witnesses. The information I overheard I am grateful for, and I would like to have you come and visit me again,” it was explained. He accepted literature, and calls are being made upon him now.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The discovery and exploitation of oil in this sheikhdom by European oilmen and the skilled labor imported from India have brought many changes to Qatar’s ancient way of life. However, hatred of Christianity still remains to such an extent that, if a nominal Christian laborer dies here, his body is not allowed to be buried in the parched and inhospitable sands of the country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A person of Hindu background has shown unusual interest in the message of the Kingdom. This man has seen the hypocrisy of Christendom, yet he has a strong appreciation for the power and wisdom of the Bible. When expressing himself to visiting representatives of the Society and hearing from them the frank and candid words of God against Christendom (Isa. 58:1), along with the Bible’s grand message about a new world, he was deeply moved and is now studying more seriously. It is hoped that soon he will take his stand, as many others are doing all around the world.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Five brothers arrested when coming to a district assembly were jailed and confined with a Communist prisoner. Given only one loaf of bread each twenty-four hours, they were all hungry. When bread was issued, the Communist would snatch his loaf and, like an animal, devour it, cursing and swearing all the time. The brothers would calmly put their loaves together, ask a blessing and then partake. The Communist soon noticed this and was impressed. One day when the brothers looked up from their prayer, they found the Communist had come over and put his bread with theirs and bowed his head during the blessing. He became friendlier and the brothers were able to explain to him why they were imprisoned and why they were always happy in spite of it. Before they were released this man compared his own miserable position with theirs and said: “And what has communism done for me?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In one of the largest cities of Syria, where the Society has tried for years to open the work, a fruitful field has finally been located. Jehovah has again provided the means to gather those who belong to him. A pioneer sister from America working in Beirut had some relatives in this city and, together with her parents, decided to contact them and pay a visit. The relatives were Protestant; the daughter of the family was a Sundayschool teacher. After a number of letters were exchanged it was arranged for the pioneer sister to come and stay with them. Soon after arrival a Bible study was started. Three months later our pioneer sister was reporting fourteen Bible studies with her relatives and their friends. Now there are five publishers of the Kingdom sharing with her in praising Jehovah. The former Sunday-school teacher is conducting several studies of her own. The father of the family is thrilled with the truth and says: “I’ve learned more in these few months than during forty years of going to church.” He is a regular publisher too. An isolated group has been formed, and these persons are now sharing in all the meetings, with as many as thirty attending.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">In the Leeward Islands the Christian work of rendering praise to Jehovah God continues. Even though the population on these islands is small, individuals are found who want to know the truth. Jehovah’s witnesses know the importance of being ambassadors substituting for Christ, and they have taken the good news of the Kingdom among the islands, and many persons have listened and have taken the message very seriously. Thirty-three different individuals have been baptized during the past year, and this shows there is a steady drawing away from Christendom and into the New World society. Life in the new world is what Jehovah’s witnesses are interested in, and they are desirous of aiding others to get life too. For this reason they keep on speaking to the people all the sayings about this life. (Acts 5:20) The branch servant, situated in St. Johns, Antigua, sends in some interesting experiences from all the islands under his jurisdiction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Loyalty to Jehovah was shown by a lone publisher in an isolated area who had spent much time witnessing to his neighbors. When many showed they were willing to come to the district assembly thirteen miles away, transportation presented a problem as there was no regular bus service. This publisher was so interested in helping them learn how to get life that he chartered a bus on his own to bring fourteen of them to the assembly. As a result of this a good witness was given and many in his village have shown unusual interest in the message of life. At their request a special pioneer is going to work in this village, and it is hoped that a congregation will be formed soon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The brothers in Antigua appreciated the help of a married couple from the States who came here to pioneer. Although their stay was only for seven months, one man with whom they studied was baptized at our Courageous Ministers District Assembly in August.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">ANGUILLA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5,605</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Although the territory in this island is very scattered, the lone congregation has put forth great effort to search for the “sheep.” The brothers have taken seriously the suggestion of the Society for each publisher to put in three hours every Sunday. The result has been an average of thirteen hours per publisher each month for this year. The publishers from here traveled to the neighboring island of St. Martin to attend the circuit assembly, where one new publisher, despite opposition from his family, symbolized his dedication by water baptism. There is a good spirit among the brothers on this island and they really love the preaching work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">DOMINICA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;65,305</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Searching for the “sheep” calls for much patience and endurance, and many times much courage is required to take a stand for the truth. One sister conducted a Bible study with three of her husband’s nieces who were staying with their Catholic grandparents. When the three girls, ages eighteen, thirteen and eleven, started to go to meetings, the local priest started to put pressure on the grandparents to cause the girls to stop their study of the Bible and association with Jehovah’s witnesses. Because of lack of knowledge of God’s Word and respect for it, the grandfather packed the few belongings of the three girls and put them out on the road. When the girls came home that afternoon they were told they could not live there any longer unless they stopped studying the Bible with Jehovah’s witnesses. What were they going to do? Many tears still flowed when they reached the home of the sister that had been studying with them. Although the sister did not have much room because of her own family, she realized that these young girls needed the benefits of a Christian home, and adjustments were made in the home so they could stay. You can imagine the joy that this sister and her husband had recently when they saw the oldest girl symbolize her dedication by water baptism at the circuit assembly held in Salisbury in May. The two younger girls are regular publishers and hope to be baptized at the Courageous Ministers District Assembly in October.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The youth in the New World society sometimes have difficult decisions to make that test their faith and determination. A young brother finishing secondary school was offered a scholarship to attend the West Indian University, but he turned this down in favor of the pioneer service. On the weekend that he filled out his pioneer application he received a letter from the education officer inviting him to go for an interview on Monday morning for a job. The brother said: “I made sure I had my pioneer application in the mail before I went to see the education officer.” A job was available, but this brother had already chosen his vocation—that of serving Jehovah full time in the pioneer service, which has far greater rewards than even a government job. He has since been made a special pioneer working with a small congregation. Thinking back on his experience, he recently said: “I thank Jehovah for strengthening me at that time to make the best choice, and I also appreciate the encouragement given to me by the older brothers.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">NEVIS &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;16,133</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The special pioneers have been able to aid the local brothers on this island very much as well as conduct many Bible studies with goodwill people. In spite of the fact that four publishers have moved to other islands to find employment, there has still been an increase in the average number of publishers. Two sisters from the States visited Nevis at the time of the circuit assembly and felt they had to comment on the love and unity shown among the brothers. With 143 in attendance at the circuit assembly public meeting, there are good prospects for increase in Jehovah’s praises in this island.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">A special pioneer was on this island for three months, but the authorities did not allow him to stay. That there is quite a lot of interest and the need for workers is great can be seen from the report of the circuit servant and his wife on a five-day visit in August: forty books and Bibles, seventy magazines, ten subscriptions and three new Bible studies started.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">ST. KITTS &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;37,058</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">While attending the Kingdom Ministry School in Basseterre in January, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font5"> zealous congregation servant started a Bible study with nine youths, who immediately associated with the local congregation. When the Kingdom Ministry School ended, the study was handed over to a zealous pioneer. Three months later three of them started publishing at the circuit assembly and two were baptized. The others are still showing interest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Publishers who make adjustments so they can have a full share in the service the week of the circuit servant’s visit will benefit considerably, as did one sister on this island. This sister lived in an isolated village, and when the circuit servant visited a nearby congregation she took her three children and moved to the congregation village and stayed for the whole week so she could attend all the meetings and join in the field service arrangements every day. Her appreciation of the truth has greatly increased and she is planning to vacation pioneer in her own village.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">By accurate knowledge and well-prepared Bible sermons much opposition can be overcome. A local clergyman has used much time on the radio to try to turn people away from hearing the truth from Jehovah’s witnesses, but this does not affect those who love the truth. One man contacted in the door-to-door work said he had to go and buy a pair of reading glasses so he could read the Bible for himself to find out if Jehovah’s witnesses are the antichrist as the clergyman said.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">After a brief discussion during which a number of scriptures were pointed out to him in his Bible he was so convinced that Jehovah’s witnesses are not the antichrist that he asked to have the scriptures written down so he could carry them with him. This done, he said: “Now I can prove to anyone that Jehovah’s witnesses have the right religion and that Jesus Christ and God are different persons.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the public school a clergyman comes on occasions to give religious instruction. One day he wrote on the blackboard, “God the Father, God the Son and God the Holy Ghost,” and told the class that these three are one. When an opportunity for discussion was given, the children were all quiet except one little girl, who was one of Jehovah’s witnesses. When her raised hand was acknowledged she said: “But John the Baptist baptized Jesus; he did not baptize God.” The clergyman replied that they would discuss this another time. That was four months ago, but the discussion has not been brought up since. Accurate knowledge out of the mouths of children can effectively praise Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">LIBERIA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 1,500,000</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Real problems arise in many countries in Africa, and the missionaries find much illiteracy when they get out into the small villages. While all these people speak the language, they cannot read it. So it becomes necessary for the missionaries to teach the people their own tongue, and with good reason, for if they learn to read they can learn firsthand the message of the Kingdom from God’s own Word, the Bible, or from publications that contain information from the Word of God. This teaching takes great patience on the part of the publishers, but our brothers in Liberia show such patience and are willing to help all the people they can to learn to read and write so that they may grow to maturity in their study of the Word of God. Jehovah’s witnesses in Liberia had a good increase again during the past year, and this is due in part to their training program. Here is what the branch servant writes as to some of the experiences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We were happy to make progress during the year in overcoming a major weakness, illiteracy. For two of the local languages reading primers were not in print, so we set out to make some. A fine illustrated primer in Kisi was made at the branch and printed by a government department. Another primer in Bandi was mimeographed. The primers were received enthusiastically, for most of the brothers had never before seen a book in their own language. The brothers set out to read with zeal, and forty-seven became literate by the close of the service year. Also the first publications in local languages were received, tracts in Kpelle and Bassa, so many tract studies were conducted. During this coming year we hope to have the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">‘‘Good News” </span><span class="font5">booklet in print in three of the Liberian languages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Incidental witnessing was responsible for the following letter received at the branch office from a clergyman who wrote: “I have come across one of your books entitled ‘The Truth Shall Make You Free.’ After reading it, I want to study it. I was ordained five years ago in the Protestant Episcopal Church here in Liberia. I can confess I have never seen such a book shining with such a light in all my life.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">While doing some construction work, a brother met and witnessed to a teacher of theology. The cleric admitted putting Jehovah’s witnesses off his place once, but promised to read a book offered by the brother. Now for the first time he understood what the sin was that Adam and Eve committed, what was meant by the seed in Genesis 3:15, and what the Gentile Times were. Thinking about these things, however, actually made him ill. He could not get over the fact that most ministers did not have this knowledge, or that they should be so blind to such plain truths.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">From that time on he preached only what was in the Bible, but was reproached with, “You sound just like one of Jehovah’s witnesses.” At a circuit assembly he told the district servant, “I want to be the right kind of minister. I need to know more. If you have a school, I would like to go to it, even paying my own way.” After visiting the branch office and studying with one of the missionaries, he returned home to become, by Jehovah’s undeserved kindness, a right kind of minister.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“How will a young man cleanse his path?” That question interested sixteen young men who were entertainers, drummers and dancers, but who found delight in the news of a paradise earth. Tactfully a special pioneer got them to admit that the motive in their way of living was to become popular with many women.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Besides much immoral conduct and drinking, they trusted in “medicines” rubbed into their faces to bring them good luck. God’s laws and his will were then forcefully explained. In conclusion the minister asked, “How many are ready to preach for Jehovah?” Up shot all sixteen hands. By the next visit the drums were gone and the group got down to serious study. At this writing, five months later, four of the group are planning to be baptized soon, and all of them continue to walk in clean paths “by keeping on guard according to [God’s] word.”—Ps. 119:9,</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Solomon said: “Send out your bread upon the surface of the waters, for in the course of many days you will find it again.” (Eccl. 11:1) This has been true in Luxembourg with Jehovah’s witnesses as they distributed the special </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font6"> magazine “The Catholic Church in the Twentieth Century.” This one magazine aroused an individual so much that he subscribed for </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!, got</span><span class="font6"> a book and six booklets and within a few days a publisher was calling on him and a Bible study was started. It was not long before he was a publisher. So who knows what will happen to a person taking the literature? In a short time he may be helping you in this grand work. The same thing works in another way. All the congregation servants in Luxembourg went to the Kingdom Ministry School in Germany and for one month they feasted on the Word of God. Now they have returned to their congregations to spread the truth in greater measure to those that they shepherd. Jehovah’s witnesses in Luxembourg are having a delightful time. They had a good increase this past year, and here are some of the experiences that the branch servant sent in.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Neither infirmity, nor youth, nor family obligations are too big a hindrance for positive publishers who want to enjoy vacation pioneer service. A sister, unable to walk, used 921 hours during the service year to write letters. She sent out 1,388 magazines and 122 booklets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A woman received two magazines and told the publishers to return next Sunday when her husband would be at home. But the man told his wife she should have turned the people away. Nevertheless, he started to read in the magazines and found an explanation about Matthew 24. He had never heard such things. He did not know that the Bible was so interesting and up-to-date. He never had one. Next Sunday he himself asked the publishers to come into the house, and it was he who wished to have the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font5"> book. A study was started with the two. He began to talk with neighbors, giving magazines to a young man living in the same house. This young man showed interest too. But the priest told him to burn up the literature and stop talking with Jehovah’s witnesses, which he did. The priest even visited the couple and tried to discourage them from further study. But the two were not afraid of him. They asked him if he would agree to defend his religion in the presence of one of Jehovah’s witnesses so they could see who really does teach the truth. The priest accepted. Shortly before this he had accused Jehovah’s witnesses in his church paper as false prophets because they deny the eternal virginity of Mary. The interested man now wished a discussion about the theme of Mary. During three hours the couple followed the discussion, and the lamentable failure of the priest to prove his side with the Bible helped them to make their decision. They continued to study and to attend the meetings and even started publishing from house to house. Those who have the truth must never be afraid of false religion, for the “sheep” listen to the Fine Shepherd’s voice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A publisher was checking his tent in his garden while a neighbor was watching him. “Are you preparing for vacation?” he asked. “No; my family and I are going to Hamburg, to attend the international convention of Jehovah’s witnesses,” was the answer, and a short witness was given. Later the young man told his wife: “Did you know that our neighbors are crazy? They belong to the new religion.” And they both scoffed. This woman and the sister often met when shopping. Several times the sister gave her magazines but then stopped, since she had the impression they did not read them. One day the woman asked her if she could get more magazines. Upon hearing this the sister started a study with her. One day the woman came to the study with $10 and wished to have a Bible. How she was surprised when she got one for only $1.90! After a time the scoffing man joined the study. Soon both started to attend meetings, and now for four months they have been Kingdom publishers. They do not think any longer that Jehovah’s witnesses are crazy. To the contrary, before they knew them, they always had quarrels and fights together, insulting each other and even using their fists. They even had in mind a divorce. Now they admit that only the study of the Bible with Jehovah’s witnesses has helped them so much that they no longer think about divorce, no longer fight and quarrel, but work hard to make their family life a success. Now the relatives see the change and wonder why. This gives good possibilities to help them to see the true religion, which changes personalities. All this because a publisher was alert to give a witness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">MAURITIUS &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Populations 671,500</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 70 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 9,593</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The labor of Jehovah’s witnesses in Mauritius has not been in vain in connection with the Lord during the last service year. They enjoyed a 31-percent increase in the number of publishers. However, they fully appreciate that the harvest work is still great, but when they look back over the past year they see that Jehovah has sent workers into the field in Mauritius. Not only does the increase in publishers bring joy to all those in the congregation, but the fact that more have entered the pioneer service on this little island has made the whole group of seventy devoted servants rejoice. Here are a few experiences sent in by the branch servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One brother writes: “Our congregation had been for a long time dormant. In fact, I remember well that when we started the meetings with the two missionaries, myself and perhaps one or two others, although the congregation had been established for four or five years, it looked as if it would never progress. However, Jehovah revealed to us what was wrong, and the difficulty was cleared up, the offender being disfellow-shiped. Since then Jehovah has blessed us, and this year we are happy to report a 38-percent increase in publishers. Now we do not start our meetings with five or six persons but with twenty-two publishers and many of goodwill. We are happy to report that five local brothers are regular pioneers, two of them specials, and three others have vacation pioneered during the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We have had as many as seventy people attending our public meetings and more than a hundred were with us for the Memorial. One goodwill lady remarked, ‘Your hall is too small, Mr. S----. You must get us a larger</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">one.’ It brings joy to the heart to see the ‘sheep’ coming into the organization, getting baptized and becoming pioneers.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The following experience was written in by a pioneer sister, mother of four young children. The family have twice lost everything they possess in the cyclones of last year. However, their joy of service for Jehovah can never be blown away by the wind. She writes: “On returning home from service the day of the Memorial I placed my two remaining invitations on the table. My eldest child, eight years old, asked me if she could have them to invite two of the neighbors. “Oh, it’s not worth the trouble,” I said. “This territory has been worked many times and no one is interested. I’ve invited them all to the public meetings, but they never come.” However, the child insisted; so I let her take them. She gave them to two neighbors to whom she had already witnessed. One of them said to call for her and she would come. When the time to go was near, she just had to run round to see if the lady really meant it, and great was her joy when she saw that she was almost ready to come with her. The goodwill person enjoyed the Memorial and has shown much interest since.” How blessed are parents who set a good example to their children in serving Jehovah! Even at an early age they will follow their example.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">MEXICO &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 36,091,006</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 27,034 Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 1,334</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There has been much activity and opposition on the part of the clergy to stop the preaching activity of Jehovah’s witnesses. Of course, most of the clergy are Catholic in Mexico. The brothers have endured many hardships so as to carry the good news into many isolated territories. Eight new congregations were organized and thirteen isolated groups are now being visited by the circuit servants. One of the outstanding happenings in Mexico during the past service year was the dedication of the new five-story branch office and Bethel home, completed in Mexico City. The pi’esident of the Society had the pleasure of sharing in the dedication. The Kingdom Ministry School, which moves about in the country of Mexico, gave instruction to 496 overseers and special pioneers. The brothers in Mexico kept in mind the year’s text: “Be courageous and let your heart be strong. Yes, hope in Jehovah.” (Ps. 27:14) It took courage to face some of the mob action and persecution that has been brought against them. Many interesting experiences are related by the branch servant in his report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Society’s films are still playing an important part in demonstrating to the world that Jehovah has an organization doing his will. A district servant relates how he and the circuit servant went to exhibit the film in an isolated place in Chiapas and while returning they passed a village where three families of goodwill persons lived, so they decided to exhibit the film there. Guarantees were obtained from the commander of the rural cavalry, who brought his soldiers to keep order, he himself taking the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font5"> book and some magazines. Over 500 attended with joy and 150 magazines and four books were distributed afterward to interested persons. The district servant arranged with the nearest congregation to visit there and attend to this interest. Afterward the city counsel went to the commander and wanted to know why he had given permission to show the film, and he answered, Because it was good. They said that the commander should have thrown us out of town, to which he said that he would throw the city counsel out of town if they did such a thing. His firm stand for liberty brought results. After eight months there were twelve publishers reporting in this town and they were organized into an isolated group. Again the film was shown, with 600 attending this time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Catholic church has not changed in its attitude on persecution of true Christians since the unholy Inquisition of the Dark Ages. A special pioneer relates that a priest formed a mob and broke into his house at night and took him by force, inquisition-style, forced him into a pickup and took him eight kilometers out of the town, beat him with a pistol and with their hands and told him that if he did not become Catholic they would cut off his hair and kill him. He remained firm in his faith in Jehovah. So after beating him up severely, they left him there at midnight. He returned to the town on foot and the next day put his case before the city mayor, who, being a justiceloving man, severely reprimanded the mob and the priest to such an extent that the priest offered to bribe the mayor with 3,000 pesos ($240), to no avail, and it was necessary for him and his mob to flee the city. Now many people of this town are attentive to the good news preached by this faithful brother, and meeting attendance has increased from ten to thirty!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Sometimes Jehovah’s witnesses are condemned by those of the world because they say the Witnesses are too persistent. Appreciating the importance of their message, Jehovah’s witnesses know they must be persistent in obeying God’s command to preach. A publisher tells how he went to a house and found a rather old woman that worshiped a big wooden cross, which she always decorated with flowers and candles. The publisher, trying to give his presentation, was almost struck by this opposed person. On the second working of this territory he encountered the same reaction, but the third time the woman disgustedly said, “Well, here you are again. To satisfy you and so you will not come back to my house I am going to listen to you.” With what reaction? She was so impressed with the information about the new world that she then and there accepted a study, the publisher placing a Bible and books with her. The second study found the large wooden cross in the rubbish, and today this elderly woman, a former worshiper of the cross, is a true worshiper of Jehovah God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the home of a very Catholic man a publisher was challenged to prove that Mary had other children. The Catholic man had so much faith that the publisher could not prove it that he said that he would leave the Catholic religion and burn his images and saints if the publisher could prove that Mary had other children, and some other similar doctrines. “In turn if you cannot prove that Mary had other children,” said the Catholic man, “then I am going to give you a whipping with the flat side of my machete.” The brother accepted the challenge, but, not having a Catholic Bible with him, went for it, but the man of the house made the publisher leave his portfolio, hat and jacket so that he would be sure to come back. The publisher came back and, after his proving that Mary had other children, the Catholic man literally hugged the publisher and wanted him to come back and study the Bible with him, which the publisher did. The man progressed very rapidly and became a publisher, then a regular pioneer, and he is now the congregation servant!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">MOROCCO &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 11,598,070</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 176 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 65,898</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It takes courage on the part of the brothers that remain in a country to press on preaching the good news when they see a goodly number of their fellow workers having to leave. During the past two years many of the ministers of the good news found it necessary to leave Morocco to return to their own countries. So it requires courage and consistency on the part of the ones who remain, and Jehovah’s witnesses have displayed these qualities during the past service year. The smaller group of 176 ministers of the good news have improved in their ministry and have come on to greater maturity. They have shown warm and loving interest in one another, and these things improve the efficiency of the organization. True love does not tolerate fear, but it does bring forth courage, and this has been instilled in some of the young people, as this experience sent in by the branch servant shows.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A good example of this courage is a young brother, fourteen years old, who attended school in the northern Spanish-speaking section of Morocco. He had the following experience: One day while he was in class a priest came in with his teacher and it was announced that the entire class would immediately visit the Catholic church. All the students remained seated as they knew that he was a Witness and they wanted to see what he would do. The teacher then opened the door and said, “Come on, everyone, quickly!” Our young brother stood up and explained to the teacher that he could not go to the church. The priest interrupted and said, “What is it with this young one?” The brother explained that he had different beliefs. Then the priest said, “The Moslem children, the Jewish children and the rest go. Why not you?” He replied, “Because I am one of Jehovah’s witnesses.” At this moment all the students were gathered around them listening intently to what was being said. So our young brother continued to explain just why he did not desire to enter the Catholic church or to share in the worship carried on there, after which the priest said, “What, what’s this?” acting as though he had not heard what was being said. Then someone said, “He’s a disobedient child.” All remained silent; then our brother replied, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“I prefer</span><span class="font5"> to be disobedient to men, but not to God.” At this the priest said, “Enough! Enough! Let us go. Leave him here, but we will talk about this another day.” That other day has not arrived, but the opportunity to witness to all his classmates and to one of his teachers has.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Our territory is worked too often!” Yes, a familiar expression, but some of our best results come from the territory most often worked. Recently a publisher was heard to remark on the way to the territory, “Oh, we never place anything in this territory; it is worked so often.” After the territory was assigned, two brothers began working in an apartment house. At the first door a man listened attentively and accepted the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise </span><span class="font5">book with appreciation, expressing his desire for a return visit. The second sermon was given to a woman who was preparing to take her family to the beach. She too wanted a copy of the book. Finally, with one book left, the brothers started their next building. After several doors they were invited into an apartment by a mother with a number of children. A sermon was given and many of her questions were answered, and then the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font5"> book was used to show how the new world would usher in righteous conditions for all of sorrowing mankind. When the book was offered she asked if they had several copies. At that a sister working her way up through the apartment house in the other direction knocked at the door. Happily she had two more books in her case and so three were placed, with a study being started immediately. After two hours of door-to-door work, the placement of five books and finding much good interest they could only say, “Our territory is not worked often enough.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">NETHERLANDS &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 11,593,000</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">When one is courageous he can stand up against opposition in a divided home, he can meet religious opposition in the field and he is not afraid of opposition from friends because of the truth. Also, he is not afraid to take his stand for the truth in his business relations or among relatives. When hostility is shown at the doors of the people or opposition is demonstrated by ruling authorities, then the quality of courage comes to the fore. It takes courage to stand up against remarks made by people we meet in our house-to-house ministry. Sometimes people try to cause Jehovah’s people to have a feeling of guilt, of being too persistent, or calling too often, or of being intolerant of the religion of others. But Jehovah God says to his favored people: “Be courageous and strong. Do not suffer shock or be terrified, for Jehovah your God is with you wherever you go.” (Josh. 1:9) Jehovah means what he says. He meant it when he spoke those words to Joshua and he means it just as much when those words are applied to his people on earth today. Here are some interesting experiences sent in by the branch servant of the Netherlands showing the need for being courageous and speaking forth the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The brothers in many parts of Amsterdam may feel they come too often to the doors, because they make the rounds every three or four weeks. During Saturday morning magazine work a brother met a man who showed interest and gladly took two magazines. An appointment was made for a week later. A week later on a Sunday morning he came back, gave a witness and placed the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font5"> book. When the brother came back for the second time the interested man remarked that he had expected them earlier; he seemed to think it was a habit of the Witnesses to return each week, which it should be. During this second back-call he took more literature and a study was started. This man worked for the fire department and was away much, which accounted for the fact that it was so hard to meet him although the territory was very often worked. He is now a very good student, witnesses to his fellow firemen, is looking forward to an occasion when he can symbolize his dedication. He is proof of the fact that no territory is worked too often!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An enthusiastic pioneer sister’s experience is a very forceful recommendation for the pioneer service. One Monday morning while working a flat in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font5"> Catholic city in the mining district, she spoke to a man who was waiting at the door of his flat for his wife to come home, as she had the key. He liked what the sister told him but refused the literature because he wanted to obey the Catholic clergy who had forbidden him to read any such literature. Just as she was taking leave his wife came up the stairs and caught a glimpse of the magazines she was putting away. This woman said: “Oh! those are the same magazines for which my mother subscribed.” The pioneer sister gave her a short witness, and the husband gave his wife permission to obtain a couple of the magazines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Next Friday evening the sister called back, being quite certain that this woman would have read the magazines, but was disappointed when it appeared that she had not even looked into them. The sister relates: “At that moment the husband came to the door and asked me if I would come in for a short while. That ‘short while’ came to be almost two hours, as it was the man who at first would not take the magazines who had read the magazines from cover to cover. I was very happy that I had been so richly blessed. I was invited back, and it turned out to be a fine Bible study. His wife too took part in the study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“A few weeks later I was to drop in on another evening just to hand over a book. The man told me that the things he had learned in a few weeks he had told his grocer. Now he had told him all he knew and asked me to come over when his grocer would be at his place. Just as we were talking the grocer came along to bring something he had forgotten to bring that afternoon. We were both invited in and I was introduced to the grocer. ‘Well,’ said the grocer, ‘this man has told me that story of eternal life on earth. I find it fantastic, but I cannot say I believe it yet.’ ‘You do believe in God, don’t you?’ I asked. ‘Why, of course; I am a good Catholic.’ Tn that case, you also believe in the Bible, don’t you?’ I went on. I produced my Bible and gave him a witness on paradise conditions in the new world. After about an hour he looked at my Bible and began to laugh. He said that he now noticed that I was trying to put one over on him in referring to the ‘Jehovah Bible,’ as he called it. He claimed that that which I had read to him cannot be found in the Catholic Bible. I then produced the Catholic translation. This man was very much shocked to learn that the teachings in which he had been brought up were not true. He proved he was seeking the truth by at once joining the study, and after five months both he and the young couple were immersed and this grocer is now the assistant to the book study conductor.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">It is a joy to see the work progressing in the islands of the Caribbean. Again in the Netherlands Antilles Jehovah’s witnesses have been very active, and the branch servant there sends in good reports from all three islands, Curasao, Aruba and Bonaire. While these islands appear to be small, they, too, can have isolated territory, and that needs to be worked just like the more populated centers. It takes planning and organization to get to these isolated places, but pioneers and congregation publishers can do it if they work it into a regular schedule. These islands are getting a thorough witness, but the work is not yet done and Jehovah’s witnesses appreciate this. Therefore, they have spent more time witnessing for the Kingdom than in any previous year by well over 5,000 hours. That means something in these small places. Here are some interesting experiences sent in by the branch servant for the three islands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The highlight of the year was the visit of Brother Knorr to Curacao for four days, from March 27 to 31. While here, Brother Knorr did, among other things, the following: Dedicated a new Kingdom Hall at Buena Vista, gave a service talk and a public talk, appeared on TV for fifteen minutes and approved the building of a Bethel home, branch office and Kingdom Hall all in one. This visit was really enjoyed by the friends and people of goodwill. The telecast was seen and commented on favorably by many people in Curacao and Bonaire too.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">While on a dirt road near West Point looking for a former subscriber, two pioneers in a car met a lady rushing along with a child in her arms. The pioneers decided something was wrong, made inquiry and found the child had had a spasm and was thought to be dying. The lady was in search of someone to take the child to a doctor. The pioneers rushed the child some miles to the nearest doctor. After getting there the child revived. The doctor said it was very ill. The family of the child were sure the pioneers had saved its life and could not thank them enough. Now the story has traveled far that</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s witnesses are good people; they saved a child’s life. The pioneer work is really a lifesaving work in more ways than one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A publisher living in isolated territory had an aversion to witnessing to his neighbors and always left them for the special pioneers to work. When the pioneers left the territory the publisher decided he had to call on his neighbors. When he did he was amazed at the good reception he received. They said, “We were waiting for you to call and wondered how long before you would.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Right at the end of the service year a most wonderful thing has happened. For sixteen years now we have had only the Christian Greek Scriptures in the Papiamento language, and the name Jehovah does not appear in this translation. Now Psalms and Proverbs have been translated and published in Papiamento using the name Jehovah throughout. When the subject of images comes up, which is so often the case, what better back-call sermon could one have than Psalm 115? We are looking forward to using this in our work of finding and feeding the “other sheep.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">ARUBA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;57,829</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The work is going ahead well among the natives in Aruba. The one Papiamento congregation had a 15-percent increase during the last service year. At the end of January the congregation servant of this congregation left Aruba to attend the school of Gilead in Brooklyn. When he left, the congregation resolved to work hard so the congregation would not go behind because of having lost their congregation servant. Rather than go backward, the congregation went ahead as never before. That is the proper spirit for all in the New World society: Have determination to overcome whatever obstacle gets in the way. Jehovah will bless the efforts of such determined servants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In February, five publishers in a congregation of forty decided to do vacation pioneer service for the month, and they all did very well. They averaged 109 hours and 117 magazines and nine new subscriptions. These five vacation pioneers put in more than twice as many hours and placed more than twice as many magazines as the thirty-five publishers that remained in the congregation. One of these vacation pioneers continued as a regular pioneer and is doing fine in the full-time service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">BONAIRE &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5,893</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">At the beginning of the service year the branch office received a notice that a subscriber from New York had moved to Bonaire. This information was passed on to the congregation, and on investigation they found that a native of Bonaire that had been living in New York for twenty years had now returned to Bonaire with his five children. After coming to Bonaire this man of goodwill symbolized his dedication at a circuit assembly, and now he and four of his children are regular publishers. This family moved into a neighborhood that is fanatically Catholic, and the priest did all he could to make it hard for them. The brother studies every day with his children from one-half to one hour. The brother has a program for his family and they have made wonderful progress in the truth. The good conduct of this brother and his children has impressed the neighborhood and had a profound effect on their attitude toward the Witnesses. A missionary said that if the priest himself had become a Witness it would not have changed the people more. For the past service year this new brother has averaged thirty-nine hours a month in field service in addition to being both mother and father to his children, who are from fourteen to six years of age.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In Bonaire the most successful magazine placer is an elderly brother who has a limited education. As this brother was working the right side of a street one Saturday morning, a man that has a store on the left side and knows the brother well yelled out and asked the brother what he was doing trying to teach others when he himself was not educated. Quick as a flash the brother answered, “Don’t you know that God can use foolish things to put the wise to shame?” (1 Cor. 1:27) The next Saturday when the brother worked the other side of the street the man took a magazine and continued to take them in the future also.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">The desirable things of all the nations are being gathered into Jehovah’s New World society, and good progress in this regard was made in the service year of 1962 in Newfoundland. Jehovah’s witnesses have accepted the responsibility of preaching the good news and continually look for the meek people who want to loyally worship Jehovah. The responsibility is to give them the proper instruction and to bring them on to maturity. Doing this work in the last days is an inestimable privilege and honor, because these words of truth mean life not only to the teacher but to the one being taught. So our brothers in Newfoundland appreciate the words of the apostle Paul wherein he wrote: “Pay constant attention to yourself and to your teaching. Stay by these things, for by doing this you will save both yourself and those who listen to you.” (1 Tim. 4:16) The branch servant gives us some interesting experiences showing what is occurring in this north country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Fulfilling the responsibility of a shepherd of God’s flock is not a simple task. It requires much patience, strength, skill and understanding. The “sheep” look to the overseers for direction. The shepherd must be alert and concerned for the welfare of the “sheep.” The need for this concern is well illustrated in the following experience: “Trying to reach the goal of at least ten hours a month was a real problem for me. I felt I had so many obstacles to overcome. My secular work, caring for the family physically and spiritually, preparing for and attending all congregational meetings seemed to take up all my time and I just could not reach the goal of at least ten hours. This troubled me deeply, as I wanted to be among those who were accepting and discharging their responsibilities before Jehovah. I firmly believed this problem of mine had a solution and decided to talk it over with the congregation overseer. He referred me to the Society’s suggestion of having </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font5"> schedule and assisted me in preparing one for my family. Since this time I have not only reached the goal of at least ten hours but for the last eight months my smallest report has been sixteen hours. How thankful I am to Jehovah for the increased blessings and joys that I have experienced as a result of increased service!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A publisher relates his personal interest in his family when he writes: “As a family head I have kept the responsibility of preaching the good news of the Kingdom before my children continually. We never miss a weekend in the service, rain or shine. As a result the children are having good success and becoming effective publishers of the truth. My eight-year-old daughter makes the regular offer with the sermon every Sunday and does not give up easily. After she had presented the sermon and then the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font5"> book, one lady remarked, “I’m sorry, but I haven’t any money today.” My little daughter suggested making a trade with something of value in the house. A trade was made—the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font5"> book for a half pound of tea. A Bible study is now being conducted in this home with the assistance of the mother. All three of my children, ages seven, eight and ten, meet the quota of twelve magazines each month. Sticking closely to the family schedule is the secret of our success.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Bible study activity is another responsibility that we should joyfully accept. A young minister explains the joy and success she had in starting and conducting a home Bible study with one of her schoolmates. “In my relationship with other pupils in school I continually sought opportunities to start a home Bible study. It wasn’t long before I arranged to conduct a study every Saturday afternoon at three o’clock with one of my schoolmates, using the booklet </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">‘This Good News of the Kingdom.’</span><span class="font5"> As soon as we completed the booklet we continued with the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font5"> book. Soon two more school children joined us in study and this made the meeting more lively and interesting. Shortly thereafter along came another four, and this brought the total to eight. Now the figure has grown to nine; the oldest is fourteen years of age and the youngest four. They all share in answering questions on the study material as well as taking their turn in reading Bible texts. These children show good understanding and have progressed well in the truth.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Our happy service year came to a close with the Courageous Ministers District Assembly at Corner Brook. What a fine spiritual feast Jehovah prepared for us! Yes, what blessings we received! While our attendance was not as high as last year, we feel more people heard the public talk. For the first time in Newfoundland the local radio station broadcast the public lecture direct from Humber Gardens. In addition we were allowed a ten-minute television interview.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark201"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark202"></a>Jehovah’s witnesses in New Zealand are grateful for the evidence of Jehovah’s undeserved kindness during the 1962 service year. They had a fine increase in many different divisions of the work, like the distribution of individual magazines, the number of Bible studies conducted, the distribution of bound books and a fine new peak in publishers of 4,249. All this made them rejoice, but they still feel that they must persevere in preaching and following up all interest and placements of literature so as to accomplish their work fully. With such determination they look forward to a busy 1963. The branch servant gives us some interesting experiences about what has been going on in the island of New Zealand.</span></h3>
<p><span class="font5">While working with the circuit servant a sister obtained a half-year subscription for </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> from a woman who showed more friendliness than interest. Her kindly spirit prompted the sister to make an early back-call to arouse more interest. She was invited in and shortly a Bible study was in progress. Definite arrangements were made to continue, but that second study was to be a long way off. On six successive back-calls in as many weeks, she was either not home or busy with visitors and not seen even once by the publisher. The sister was determined to meet this friendly subscriber again, so she set out for the seventh and last attempt. Both were surprised to see each other after so long a time. The study was resumed after a short discussion and it continued regularly. Soon she requested a study for her four boys, who were asking many questions she could not answer. Due to the publisher’s patience and perseverance this friendly householder was immersed after a year of study, and now two of her boys have been baptized and have shared in vacation pioneering.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Calling at the last house on a country road, two ministers were apprehensive about the results because Witnesses had been treated badly there before. Apparently the opposers had gone. A young woman came to the door and contributed for two magazines. She asked if we had any of those “pink” books. The </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise </span><span class="font5">book was placed with her. When a back-call was made they learned her husband had read the book and had questions to ask. That opened the way for another visit, which in turn led to a Bible study. Now an excellent study is in progress, showing that teachable ones can be found by always calling at each place, even in the face of opposition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One woman who was having a Bible study in her home was undergoing persecution from her husband to such an extent that she expressed doubts about being able to endure it. The Witness instructor told her the need for and merit of prayer and encouraged her to keep trying. This wise counsel was applied. One day her husband asked what she would do if he died. Without hesitation she answered: “I would become one of Jehovah’s witnesses.” “That being so,” he said, “you might as well become one right now so I can see what you are doing while I am alive.” Then this truth-seeker proceeded to tell him that she had prayed for Jehovah’s help and this was the answer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">NICARAGUA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 1,588,484</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 507 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 3,133</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">How infinite are the blessings of Jehovah and unfathomable his deep love and mercy! Jehovah’s people in Nicaragua feel doubly blessed because of the favors they received during the year and the joy of gathering together those of the “other sheep.” While this was the outstanding feature of the work, there were some other things that brought real pleasure to the brothers in Managua, Nicaragua. For the first time the Society gained legal recognition by the government. Then came the good news that work would start on a new branch building—an office, missionary home and Kingdom Hall. This work actually began in February and in the same month one of the congregations finished erecting the first Kingdom Hall in the country, built and owned by the congregation publishers. This was dedicated during the year. Jehovah’s witnesses, indeed, say with the psalmist: “Jehovah is my Shepherd. I shall lack nothing.” (Ps. 23:1) Here are some reports on the activity of the brothers in Nicaragua.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Joy radiated when all learned that Brother Knorr would give the dedication talk in March during his trip through Central America and would be visiting us for parts of three activity-filled days. Then came the announcement from the zone servant. He would be serving the brothers for two and a half months. For two and a half months? What was wrong? Nothing! He was the instructor for the Kingdom Ministry School that started April 2. What welcome training it was! Is it not with reason, then, that the year has been a happy one?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">More than one person has been attracted to the cause of our joy and solidarity. A fanatic Pentecostal man took a second look at a recent circuit assembly. He saw something unattainable by his church. He was astonished at the love and unity between foreign missionaries and our Nicaraguan brothers. In his Pentecostal organization the missionaries strive for prominence instead of setting an example in lowliness. Therefore, all, feeling that they are examples, strive for prominence in the same manner. This has produced two groups with much division, both vying to direct. His disillusionment softened his formerly hardened heart so much that he meekly asked question after question, whereas before his only desire was to pray for the “misled” brother who called on him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Honest-hearted ones can easily recognize the true shepherds from the false ones. Said one woman, isolated in a rural town, to a circuit servant, “I admire you Jehovah’s witnesses. You show love when you come in this mud and rain to visit us every few months. Why, do you know, I have children here [and she indicated some up to seven years of age] that do not know what a priest looks like?” The woman started reading </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When Paul preached in Ephesus many who practiced magical arts became believers, confessing it publicly, even burning their books on magical arts valued at some fifty thousand pieces of silver. (Acts 19:17-20) Recently, a spiritist visited the missionary home to sell some fake medicine that “would cure everything.” An alert sister placed literature with him and turned the call over to an infirm missionary brother. The man returned for more of the “true medicine,” and regular Bible studies ensued. He now advises his former spiritistic clients to read the Bible instead of his publications on “magical arts,” which he has shoved aside. The value of these abandoned books total §8,671. Now he is arranging his marital affairs to be legally married and to be eligible for baptism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">NIGERIA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 35,000,000</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Nigeria is moving along at a steady pace, and it is marvelous in our eyes to see how the people </span><span class="font6">from many tribes can associate together in peace and enjoy the company of one another. Truly, this is the doing of Jehovah by having his holy spirit operate upon his servants. It takes real patience and kindness on the part of an overseer, congregation publisher, and pioneer to preach the good news to others. It takes time to plant seeds of truth in the minds of nonbelievers and those who have been held in darkness by Christendom and to see them change their thoughts and conceptions of God and his Son, Christ Jesus. But with patience and the art of teaching much can be accomplished. When we check back over the years we see that excellent progress has been made in Nigeria. The branch office in Lagos sends in some very interesting experiences on Nigeria as well as Dahomey and Fernando Po.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One of the big works during the year has been that of trying to revive many who had fallen back into inactivity. A congregation servant writes: &quot;One brother had been inactive for four years, but due to the Society’s admonition the brothers started to visit him again. They could not stir up any interest at first, but through persistence on their part he subscribed for </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font5"> The article ‘Do You Avoid Enemies of Happiness?’ gave him a real shock, as he realized that he was very unhappy. After this he responded well and began attending meetings and publishing.” He found that staying away from meetings and becoming inactive in service do not solve any problems but just multiply them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Throughout the year the pioneer service has been kept to the fore in special letters and in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry,</span><span class="font5"> and it is grand to see the pioneer ranks growing. Wonderful results have also come from the meetings held by the district servants with those interested in pioneer service. Many, too, are taking up vacation pioneer service during the time of the circuit servant’s visit. One sister who had been publishing for many years without placing a single book was persuaded to be a vacation pioneer during the month when the circuit servant visited the congregation, and in the first two weeks she placed nine books and started a Bible study. The congregation servant says he never saw her looking so happy as during her vacation pioneer work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Pioneering certainly helps one to become more mature and strong in the service. One of our pioneers volunteered to go out to an isolated town where interest had been found. His letter reads: “It was not an easy thing to persuade them, due to their devilish customs. Witchcraft and immorality are not </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">only common but</span><span class="font5"> praised. Common was the saying, ‘Since your religion does not allow fornication and adultery, you cannot expect to convert anyone here.’ One would think that they were ‘heathens,’ but not so. Even the witches and wizards of this village are faithful members of the Methodist Church, which claims 80 percent of the town, and the rest belong to the Apostolic Church and the Spiritual Holiness Church. But ‘the word of God is alive and exerts power and is sharper than any two-edged sword.’ So in time the people received the truth and a congregation came to be organized. Just before I left for another service appointment the congregation was reporting thirty-three publishers.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Congregations sharing in unassigned territory work have continued to enjoy fine experiences, finding people who are really thirsty for the truth of Jehovah’s Word. In one town the Anglican catechist offered his house for a meeting, which was very well attended by the villagers. The congregation servant reports: “The villagers proved to be an anxious and inquisitive set of people. The catechist was no less inquisitive, but bluntly so. He would urge the brothers to refute a doctrinal point. When they tried tactfully to evade some controversial issues, he pressed them more vehemently, not knowing he was digging a pit for himself. The brothers then had to let the truth out, and the truth had its way, exposing the false teachings.” The villagers had their eyes opened and some became angry with the catechist, shouting, “Is this the way you have been taking our money, only to teach us lies?” The brothers restored order, and the discussion went on until three o’clock in the morning. Other meetings during the week extended until after midnight with questions, but each morning when the brothers awoke about six o’clock they would find some had already turned up with more questions. As the brothers were about to leave at the end of the week, the villagers came in a body and asked how much it would cost to bring the truth into their village. They were assured that help would be sent free, and one of the pioneers in the congregation volunteered to go and take up his assignment there.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">There has been a decrease in publishers in Dahomey, and this is cause for concern. There has also been a severe food shortage during the past year, and conditions of life have grown harder. It seems that some of the weak ones have been overcome by “the anxiety of this system of things,” to the extent that they have fallen into inactivity. It was very timely, therefore, that the Kingdom Ministry School was held in Dahomey this year, and all the congregation servants and special pioneers attended the course.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Illiteracy is the principal reason why many fail to advance to maturity, and this calls for a great effort on the part of the overseers and other literate publishers to show much love and patience in teaching those who cannot read. There is every incentive to learn, as the brothers now have </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font5"> in the Gun language as well as booklets and tracts. There is no reason for any to think they cannot learn. Even a sister of seventy told the audience at a recent circuit assembly how she had overcome this handicap and had learned to read her own language.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In February the brothers enjoyed having their own district assembly at Cotonou with a very fine attendance. A great shout of joy acclaimed the release of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font5"> book in French, and this is having a good distribution. The assembly was climaxed by the showing of the film “Divine Will International Assembly of Jehovah’s Witnesses.” This was the first time one of the Society’s films had been shown in Dahomey, and over 3,000 crowded in to see it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">FERNANDO PO &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;212,000</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The brothers in Fernando Po have again enjoyed a good increase in publishers, and now there are seven groups meeting in different parts of the island. There has been no organized opposition reported, as formerly was the case, but conditions are still difficult for the brothers. They are not able to carry on house-to-house work, but do their service in the form of back-calls and studies. Most of them work on farms under Spanish masters. They cannot leave the farm, even for a brief visit, without a paper signed by the master, and this prevents close contact between the groups. But their letters are joyful and express appreciation for their privileges of service there. During the harvesting season they have to work during all the hours of daylight, and their preaching is done during the night. One wonders when they sleep, but they are determined to keep on giving out the good news. The brother in charge of the largest group recently expressed himself as follows: “We have no difficulty except that we feel cut off from Jehovah’s people elsewhere. We still carry on the preaching work, and I beg you to remember us before Jehovah and make supplication for us. When I remember the apostle Paul’s words, ‘Who will separate us from the love of the Christ?’ I am moved very strongly toward Jehovah and his organization.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Earlier, the same brother reported a fine meeting they were able to have, taking advantage of their day off on Christmas Day. “We are happy to report,” he wrote, “that we conducted a successful, big meeting attended by all brothers resident in this island on December 25. All contributed personally to the success of the meeting, and we thank Jehovah God that at the first session we had forty-four persons in attendance and forty-seven at the second and last session. It is also interesting to report that this meeting was conducted in the woods in secret, which necessitated our using banana stems for seats. We were very happy that all the meetings were orderly and successful.” It is fine to hear of brothers who live under such difficult conditions staying so faithful and strong spiritually.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">NORTHERN RHODESIA Population: 2,483,500 Peak Publishers: 80,129 Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 82</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The publishers in Northern Rhodesia have continued steadfast in the preaching of the good news in the midst of unsettled conditions. Jehovah’s witnesses have been insistent on pursuing a course of neutrality toward the politics of this old world, and because of this they have often been misrepresented by the politicians. Efforts have been made to intimidate them and, in certain localities, attempts have been made to ban the preaching activity by local officials working under religious and political pressures. The brothers, however, are not intimidated, and they continue on faithfully serving the Kingdom interests, advertising public talks, going from house to house and telling others of God’s wonderful promises. No matter what happens, the rulers are forced to see that Jehovah’s witnesses are a peaceful, law-abiding people doing good to everyone they meet and they realize that Jehovah’s witnesses love their neighbors. So opposition may come from many quarters, but for their faithfulness Jehovah rewards his people with good results. The branch servant in Northern Rhodesia, situated in the new branch home in Kitwe, gives reports and experiences from Kenya, Tanganyika, Uganda and Zanzibar.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Patience and long-suffering in the ministry certainly bring rewards. Back in 1959, in territory where a special pioneer was often ridiculed as he went from house to house, he met a man who was an official of the local political party, a prosperous farmer and a polygamist. Many objections had to be overcome before a study could be started. “After studying for a year and a half,” writes the pioneer, “I felt I was getting nowhere and wondered what I could do to help this man to take his stand. I prayed to Jehovah and then suggested a study of the book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">‘This Means Everlasting Life.’</span><span class="font5"> I began the study with chapter 14, on ‘Marriage Among the Heirs of Life.’ He saw the issue and the need to put away his second wife, but since she was pregnant at the time he felt he could not do that. Also, about that time I left the assignment to take up circuit work. In October, 1961, I met him again at our district assembly, and there he decided to put his life really in order. He divorced his second wife, paying a considerable amount of money to arrange this, and then went to the congregation committee explaining that he now wanted to share in the preaching work. He had also given up his political associations. How happy I was when I served the congregation with which he is associated and saw him giving a student talk in the ministry school, and sharing in the ministry as a baptized publisher of the good news!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Some seeds of truth are planted by “shut-in” publishers’ writing letters. One day a circuit servant and his wife were working some isolated rural territory as they traveled from one congregation to another. To get to one farm they had to go twenty-three miles along </span><span class="font6">a </span><span class="font5">small track. When they arrived at the home, a man greeted them saying that he had just received a letter from them. They thought he was mistaken. However, he fetched a letter from his room together with a </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“Good News”</span><span class="font5"> booklet. The letter was signed by an </span><span class="font6">el</span><span class="font5">derly sister living 400 miles away, who had written to his address listed in the telephone directory. So impressed was he by what this sister had written to him and what he had read in the booklet that he subscribed for </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> and promised that he would keep in touch with the sister.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A sister, taking to heart the suggestion in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font5"> to try to use in the field material prepared for students talks, was wondering how she might use the material for her next talk, taken from the chapter on evolution in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True.&quot;</span><span class="font5"> One day she made a return call on a young couple who had shown outstanding interest, only to find visiting them a young man who had turned up at some of her other calls and had ridiculed everything she said. The sister greeted him politely, praying to Jehovah for help to say the right things to help the people of goodwill in the home. After a few minutes of discussion the young man said he did not believe in the Bible. “What do you believe in, then?” the publisher asked. “Evolution,” was his reply. “Oh, that’s very interesting,” the sister said. “And which particular’theory?” To that the young man said, “Darwin’s, of course.” Here was a perfect opening for the refutation she had prepared for her student talk. With confidence she briefly dealt with the point. The young man was completely nonplussed and the couple of the house were amazed. In conclusion this sister writes: “I might say that this young man has not appeared at any more of my back-calls, and the young couple are doing fine with their studies and are considering becoming students themselves in the theocratic ministry school.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This report would not be complete without mention of the new Bethel home and branch office in Kitwe. We made the move in February, 1962, and it is proving to be a most convenient place in which to work, as well as being an ideal home for the Bethel family. We all want to express our appreciation for this blessed provision that Jehovah has made for us through the Society and the generosity of our brothers, and we are determined to use these facilities to the best of our ability in serving the Kingdom interests.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">KENYA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 7,131,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 130 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 54,854</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Courageous ministers in Kenya have been richly blessed by Jehovah during this service year. After six years of restrictions, which denied the freedom to meet together openly, legal recognition of Jehovah’s witnesses has now been granted, and there is now complete freedom to engage in all features of the service and to meet together without difficulty. Because of this the various small groups of publishers in Nairobi were able to merge into one congregation of eighty publishers, and they now enjoy the same kind of association and fellowship as their brothers in other parts of the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This good news arrived just in time for the brothers to celebrate the Memorial together, with 130 attending in the city of Nairobi. Another outstanding event during the year was the circuit assembly held in Nairobi with sessions in English and Swahili. This was quite an international gathering, with more than ten nationalities represented, so the people of goodwill had a fine opportunity to see the brotherly love and international unity of the New World society on a small scale.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Kenya is another place where the need is very great, and the opportunities for expansion are unlimited. The publishers there are working hard, and during the year seven had the privilege of sharing in vacation pioneer service. The prospects for the future are excellent, and we look forward to the coming year with keen anticipation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">TANGANYIKA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 9,560,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 739 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 12,936</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The zealous activity of the publishers in Tanganyika is having a telling effect both among people of goodwill and among religious leaders. One religious magazine in the Swahili language stated in substance: Tn these days we hear that a new religion has started in our land. They call themselves “Jehovah’s Witnesses,” and each one is a witness of God. The followers dedicate themselves to their ministry, averaging fifteen to twenty hours each month, some even doing </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font5"> hundred hours a month, and they do not get any pay. When we hear this what are we to say? These people, Jehovah’s witnesses, must be a looking glass for us so that we examine ourselves to see whether we are lazy or whether we are doing what is right.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The good reputation of Jehovah’s witnesses as reliable workers resulted in excellent cooperation from local businessmen in providing arrangements for a circuit assembly. The manager of one sisal estate spoke very highly of those working for him and said, “They set a very good example and are a good influence on the other workers.” This man was instrumental in obtaining the use of the local welfare hall, and, in addition, he kindly cleaned out an old store, painted it, repaired the lights and provided a large gas cooker with free gas to be used for the cafeteria.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is often the case that opposition produces just the opposite result to that intended. One day a special pioneer met a group of schoolboys and placed ten </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“Good News”</span><span class="font5"> booklets with them in Swahili. Later a local religious man met the boys and took one booklet and threw it in a nearby stream and tore up another. This so angered the boys that they started fighting the man until he ran away, and then the boys went with the two damaged booklets to the chief to explain the matter. The man was called to the court, and the pioneer was also called to give evidence as to the cost of the booklets. The man was sentenced to pay damages of five chickens and warned not to repeat his action. Then the chief turned to the pioneer and asked him to bring some of his fellow Witnesses the following Sunday to give a public talk in the chief’s village. This was done, and after the talk the chief provided some food for the brothers and sisters and invited them to come regularly to preach in his village.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Of the possibilities for the future in Tanganyika the district servant writes: “The prospects for expansion are unlimited.” The territory is ripe for harvest and certainly enjoyable to witness in. This same district servant mentioned that during the week’s work with one congregation “not one person refused to talk with us.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The small band of Kingdom publishers in Uganda have had a happy year in Jehovah’s service and have seen some good increases. People of many different religions are met in the territory, and it requires tact and patience to help overcome prejudice. A special pioneer placed some magazines with a Goan Catholic man and on the return visit placed the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font5"> book. His Goan friends, Catholics like himself, warned him that their religion did not permit him to read such books. He passed on this objection to the pioneer. The pioneer then said to this goodwill man, “I could understand this if there were bad things in our books, but I am sure you have found nothing that is bad in the books you have received from me.” Then, turning to page 77 in the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font5"> book, he discussed the point relating to the worship of images and how the Bible condemns such practices. At this the man said, “Now I know why it is they want to stop us from reading such religious books and the Bible as well.” He asked for a Bible so that he could find the chapters and verses himself, and a </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation</span><span class="font5"> was placed with him. Despite further efforts of his friends to frighten him away from the truth, he stood firm, telling them that he had found nothing bad in the books of his “new religion” nor in the Bible. Now he has subscribed for </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font5">and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake.',</span><span class="font5"> has a regular Bible study in his home and attends the congregation </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> study.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">During the year the two publishers who started the preaching work in 1961 had to return to Kenya because of a change of employment. However, before they left, an American family moved onto the island and were able to take over the care of the newly interested ones, so the preaching work continued uninterruptedly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Though the predominantly Muslim territory presents problems in the advance of the truth, some good Bible studies are being conducted and quite an amount of literature is being placed. Sometimes even one piece of literature can go a long way. An </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> magazine was placed with an Arab gentleman who planned to make use of the contents as material for discussion at a regular group gathering that he had with some friends every Sunday, In this way it is hoped that more from among the Arab community will get to know something of the truth.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">The ministers preaching this good news of the Kingdom in Norway have had very interesting experiences during the past year. They rejoice in the fact that they spent 55,358 more hours in the field than during the previous year. As one brother put it, “My experience with increased time in the service seems to underline the truth the Society has set forth, namely, increased service gives better results. There is greater joy when one gives more and works harder.” While the average hours of the congregation publishers in Norway did not reach ten, still they did considerably better than during the previous year, as did all the publishers <a name="bookmark203"></a><a name="bookmark204"></a>in the country. A good variety of experiences have been sent in by the branch servant, and here are a few of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A young sister on entering high school found interest for the truth in her class. One Thursday in September the sister was asked by a classmate what our religion was about. After two hours of questions and answers the classmate was convinced this was the truth. Saturday she was invited to the public talk and the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> study. Monday she obtained a Bible, and Wednesday the classmate asked to go along in the field service, and a study was started. Since then she has been a regular publisher each week; she started to report in November. She has a regular share in the meetings and has enrolled in the ministry school. She has witnessed to her family and others. Her family are of goodwill and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font5"> young boy in the family is very much interested. Another girl in her class has attended a service meeting and several others are showing interest. The sister concludes: “Such great joy as I have had I did not expect when I took sides with Jehovah. I hope that others, not only the young folks, but all that have dedicated themselves to serve Jehovah, will experience like joy and blessings as I have had in the past few months. In the past months my faith that Jehovah does strengthen and help those who serve him has been increased greatly.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A circuit servant wrote in the following experience of a young man working away from his home. One day the workers started talking about Jehovah’s witnesses. One elderly man had much to say against us and told of many things the young man had never heard nor seen in his meetings with Jehovah’s witnesses. All this aroused the interest of the young man, and his desire to find out for himself was so great that he wrote the Society’s office for some literature. After studying these publications he was so sure it was the truth he began witnessing from house to house without having any association with the Witnesses. As time went on he visited the nearest congregation and obtained more literature, which he placed. He is now associated with this congregation and regularly attends meetings and shares in the service. He plans to be baptized at the first opportunity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A sister was invited in by a lady who stated: “Whenever Jehovah’s witnesses called before I always turned them away. But I invite you in because some time ago I borrowed one of your books from a friend of mine and there I found the answer to all the questions I had asked my father, who is a minister, and many other religious friends; but they never were able to answer them. But your book, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise,</span><span class="font5"> answered them all and now I invite you in.” Many more questions were asked and answered from the Bible and a study was started, which is progressing very well. This lady found answers to her questions and the truth where she was sure she never would.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A congregation tells of a family that had been called on several times by Jehovah’s witnesses but that had always been hesitant about a study though showing interest. Finally a study was started with them. As time went by, many truths were learned, and among them the need of living a clean life. This elderly couple told their life story, stating they had lived together for forty years without being married. He had been a member of the Salvation Army and a leader for fourteen years and she for twelve years, but never had they been told anything about living a clean life. They were told now that it would be necessary for them to legalize their marriage to be Jehovah’s witnesses. Help was given them and they were married legally. The change in this couple and their legalizing their marriage caused much talk and wonderment among their neighbors and much respect for the Witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">NYASALAND &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 2,860,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 15,494 Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 185</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">With the world in so much turmoil the courageous ministers of Jehovah in Nyasaland have not been trembling at the men who keep it in turmoil, but they have been trusting in Jehovah. (Prov. 29:25) The Kingdom Ministry School has been a great aid to the overseers in the various congregations throughout Nyasaland. It has helped them to take a very firm stand and to show the brothers what course of action to take when political leaders of the land have tried to sidetrack some to become interested in the affairs of the old world. Their zeal for true worship and their stand as courageous ministers can easily be seen by the experiences that are reported by the branch servant in Nyasaland. He also gives us a report on the country of Mozambique, where a number of our </span><span class="font5">brothers have been imprisoned because of witnessing for God’s kingdom. However, a number of these in Mozambique have been released now without even having a trial. Here are experiences from both places.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Some people have tried by violent means to cause brothers to compromise. During the year a number of brothers had their crops destroyed by hooligans, because of refusing to join the local political party. In a number of instances this happened at nighttime, and in the morning the brothers found their crops cut down. Most of the brothers are farmers, and many suffered a total food loss. All cases of destruction of property were reported to the police, and in one of the resulting court cases twenty persons were sentenced. The integrity and stand of the brothers resulted in a good witness being given. The conduct of three of the brothers in giving evidence in court resulted in the magistrate’s stating: “All three of these men have impressed me most favorably as being witnesses of truth and reliability beyond the ordinary.” Many brothers wanted to assist those who had had their crops destroyed and willingly contributed maize and groundnuts. All together, 128 bags of maize were distributed. Outside persons have now seen that Jehovah’s witnesses in a practical way prove their love for one another and are united as a happy family.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At the beginning of the service year a national assembly was held. Brothers did not let lack of transport stop them from attending. Some walked two or three hundred miles to reach the assembly. Others traveled by cycle; one cycled 375 miles. After the assembly those returning by foot along the shore of Lake Nyasa passed through one of the congregations. One of the brothers of that congregation wrote that for about two weeks brothers, sisters and children had passed through. Many slept the night there and had a meal with the brothers. “When the outside people saw the hospitality shown by us local brothers to those of our brothers walking through, many concluded that there is no other organization throughout the world that can be compared with Jehovah’s witnesses.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Brothers with families appreciate the simplified sermons that appear in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry.</span><span class="font5"> These are very good for children to use. As the children mature, the parents are able to show them how to expand their sermons to include more scriptures. At one circuit assembly one little girl about six years old showed how she gives a witness. Besides an introduction and appropriately tying in the sermon with the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> subscription offer, she effectively used two scriptures from the current sermon, Isaiah 43:10 and Matthew 24:14. This helped as an encouragement to all the other children present to continue progressing in the ministry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">MOZAMBIQUE &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 6,170,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 805 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 7,665</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The work is spreading among Europeans as well as Africans. Already twelve European publishers have symbolized their dedication and are busy spreading the good news. One European sister living in isolated territory, at least a hundred miles from the nearest congregation, did not keep the truth to herself. She witnessed at every opportunity. Her husband, who is not interested in the truth, said, after reading the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> article on the persecution of Jehovah’s witnesses in Spain, “This will happen to you if you do not stop this preaching.” Later, when they were visiting with his manager, he told his wife that she was not to mention the truth. During the visit he left the room for a few minutes and on returning saw his manager reading the book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True.”</span><span class="font5"> Yes, the sister had just placed it with him. Jehovah has blessed her efforts in the ministry, for she was able to start a study with a local woman, and during the visit of the circuit servant she was overjoyed when this person, her “letter of recommendation,” was immersed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is good to see that brothers are training their children in Bible principles. This aids them to stand firm for the truth. Often opposition arises at school, as two young African children found out. When the teacher led the class in prayer, these two young ministers did not kneel down with the other children. They explained to the teacher that Jehovah says that we should not bow down to other gods but only to him. The teacher answered, “We are praying to God.” In reply the children showed that the teacher was directing his prayers to Mary, whereas they prayed to Jehovah through Jesus. The parents were able to give the teacher further Scriptural proof for this, and so, instead of being angry, he allows these two children to be absent when he leads the class in prayer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">PAKISTAN &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 93,000,000</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The service year for Jehovah’s witnesses in Pakistan brought good spiritual health to the New </span><span class="font6">World society. The country received its finest witness thus far in the preaching of the good news of the Kingdom. The publishers have been very devoted to their work, achieving an excellent distribution of literature, especially individual copies of the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font6"> magazines. They have good cause to rejoice, for they had a 12-per-cent increase. Some fine experiences have been theirs during the year and this has helped the growth of the theocratic organization in the land. The branch servant tells us what has gone on in Pakistan and Afghanistan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Continuing a Bible study by correspondence can be rewarding, as shown by the following experience related by a missionary: “About two years ago while conducting a Bible study with a Pentecostal family I was introduced to another person of the same religion. A Bible study was started with this person and he showed himself to be very humble and receptive to the truth. Six months after the study began, he was transferred, so the study was continued by correspondence. He received a great deal of opposition from his wife and associates but continued faithfully in his study and progressed well. His wife and a Pentecostal minister destroyed every copy of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> magazine they could find. However, this served as an incentive to him, and at the assembly held during Brother Henschel’s visit he symbolized his dedication by baptism. Since then he has published regularly, placing literature and conducting Bible studies with persons who are also progressing well in knowledge. Despite his being isolated and rarely meeting with the congregation, he continues to take advantage of every opportunity to preach to others and increase his joy in the ministry.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Serving with Jehovah’s organization can often result in accelerated spiritual growth, as seen in the case of a businessman who was first met in Saturday-morning magazine work. A study was started, and off and on for some five years it was continued with this person, who, understanding what he was learning, took the information and gave it as sermons to his former religious associates in their homes and even in their church. But rarely did he attend meetings or associate with Jehovah’s organization. Eventually the study was discontinued and only occasional visits were made until another publisher resumed the study and undertook an intensive “directing-to-the-organization” program. This proved successful, so that within a few months this goodwill person was attending the congregation book study, next the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> study, then the service meeting, finally engaging in field service and joining the ministry school. His conclusion concerning his previous activity: “I’ve been wasting my time. I’ve been doing everything the wrong way.” Now, although working six days a week to support his family, for the past five months he has averaged over fifty hours, thirty-two back-calls and four Bible studies per month in the ministry, and is assisting others in field service, directing all interest to the organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">AFGHANISTAN &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 12,000,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: 1 to 1,200,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Of the ten publishers serving where the need is great, two have found it necessary to return to their own country, leaving just eight brothers serving in this vast and isolated territory. Nevertheless, the ministry has not lagged and the activity of the brothers has outstandingly increased over previous years. The overseer of this small group of faithful brothers writes: “The highlight of our service year occurred during the visit of Brother Henschel, when we held our own small United Worshipers assembly, the first ever held in this country. It was a rich, rewarding and encouraging experience that seemed impossible years ago, due to local restrictions. We thank Jehovah for his undeserved kindness shown on this occasion.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">That interested persons who often move about have ample opportunity to hear this good news of the Kingdom, due to the witness being given all over the earth, is shown by this experience. A person visiting Kabul for a short time was witnessed to and readily subscribed for </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> He had previously become acquainted with the truth in Liberia when he had a few studies and had shown some interest. We had no further chance to speak to this person but often wondered about him. How happy we were to hear that a brother in faraway Kuwait had met a person familiar with </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!,</span><span class="font5"> having seen it at the home of his friend, who had obtained the subscription in Kabul! The last news was that both of these subscribers were being looked after by our brothers in Kuwait.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">PANAMA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 1,110,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 1,423 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">1 to 780</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">An effort was made by Jehovah’s witnesses in Panama to get out into some new territories during the year and to find more of the Lord’s “other sheep.” A circuit servant and his wife were sent to a new section of the country where there were no publishers. This section lies along the Atlantic coastline and is inhabited by Indians. The language they speak is their own, not Spanish; however, some do read and speak Spanish. It is truly marvelous how Jehovah’s witnesses keep publishing the Word of life and continue pushing out into every nook and corner of each country wherever people live to try to bring them the good news of God’s kingdom. Some literature was placed in this isolated section, and studies in the Bible were begun and held a number of times during the short visit of the circuit servant and his wife in that vicinity. It is hoped that the Society can find a pioneer to go there to take care of cultivating the seed and watering what has been planted. Jehovah will surely give the increase. There have been other interesting experiences enjoyed in Panama and the branch servant reports on these.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One of our biggest problems here in this Catholic country is caused by the local custom among many of living together and raising a family without getting legally married. Many learn the truth and would like to be in the New World society but find that they must straighten out their lives first. One man who studied with the Witnesses quit his heavy drinking and gambling, stopped smoking and quit beating his woman companion who was the mother of his four daughters. Still he could not dedicate his life to Jehovah because the woman would not agree to a legal marriage. She just could not believe that he was sincere and thought that after a little while he would be back at his old way of life. After living for a year like this and seeing that she still refused to marry him, he said that he would not let the next assembly go by without getting baptized and so started packing up to move out of the house. This apparently convinced the woman of his sincerity and she finally agreed to say “Yes.” They were married the very week of the assembly, the man was baptized and has been very regular in the field ministry ever since. This has been a fine testimony in the neighborhood, and many persons who knew him previously have expressed amazement at his change of conduct and ‘what this religion can do to a person.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It pays to follow up all leads where interest may be found. A publisher from another congregation sent the name and address of the mother of a man of goodwill with whom he was studying. The person of goodwill wanted someone to call and help her to learn the truth, but said that she was very Catholic and very devoted to her images. A local publisher was given the name and went to make the call. Sure enough, she was ushered into a living room past a well-adorned image of the “virgin” and invited to sit down under a big picture of the “sacred heart.” The publisher continues: “You can imagine my surprise when she took the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font5"> book and asked me when I could return and give her Bible lessons. Well, within a month she had stopped playing the lottery, stopped going to the Catholic church, and was witnessing to her family, but still had the images in the house. Knowing that she could not accurately instruct others in the true worship until she herself had knowledge, we took up that lesson in the book and it was pointed out that image worship was one of the things that caused God’s people in ancient times to stumble. The next time I called the images and religious pictures were gone, and very shortly five of the family began to take part in publishing the Kingdom message. Now less than a year later three of the family have been baptized and others have expressed their desire to be immersed at the next circuit assembly. And to think, all this from calling on what I thought would be a ‘goat.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">PAPUA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;487,050</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 407 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 1,197</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The good news of God’s kingdom goes forward in all parts of the world and that includes Papua and other islands of the South Pacific, such as New Britain, New Guinea and the Solomon Islands. The Society has seen to it that regular visits are made by circuit servants to the congregations every four months throughout these islands and this has been a wonderful blessing to the congregations in these places. During the past service year there was a new congregation formed in an area where special pioneers have been working for two years. It takes time to teach these people the truth, but those who have dedicated their lives to the service of Jehovah are giving of their time with very good results. The branch servant in Papua sends in some interesting experiences from the four islands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Early this year a brother kindly donated to the Society a portable electric generator to use with our projector. This has really been a great aid in the isolated areas. The Society’s films have caused great excitement among the village people and have created much interest. In areas where the films were being shown for the first time, gasps of surprise and astonishment came from the native people as they beheld the magnitude of Jehovah’s organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Special pioneers, working about 140 miles down the coast from Port Moresby, wrote: “A European minister came to Kerema to have a meeting with leading churchmen in the area. Because of the growth of our work among their people they were very concerned about us. The minister invited some of the Witnesses to attend this special meeting and several native brothers did so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“When the meeting began, one man stated that Jehovah’s witnesses were telling the people not to give money to the mission. Our native pioneer who was present pointed out that this was not correct, that if the people want to give their money, it is up to them. He pointed out, though, what the Scriptures say about giving, that people should not be compelled to give, and cited 2 Corinthians 9:7 in support. With that the European minister, who was acting as chairman, said, ‘What Bible are you using?’ The pioneer answered, ‘This Bible is the one translated by you.’ The minister then asked, ‘Then why do we differ, if we use the same Bible?’ Before the pioneer had time to answer, a local pastor stood up and said, ‘I will tell you. Jehovah’s witnesses understand the many prophecies of the Old Testament and they explain how they are fulfilled in the New Testament. Our mission does not do that and so that is why Jehovah’s witnesses are different.’ Other churchmen backed up the pastor, showing how they were disappointed in their own mission.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another experience shows the value of Bible training for children at home. During this past year the school where these Witness children have been attending has been conducting religious classes. Because of being of a different religion the young children got permission to hold their own study during this period of time. They have had as many as thirty pupils attend. Since they have not had adults giving instruction, a teacher has been there to preside over them. This meant that while the children read the Bible and studied the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise </span><span class="font5">book in English the teacher has been obliged to listen and to learn. At the close of the study she has even joined with the children in singing some of our Kingdom songs. The children say that, since these studies began, the teacher has taken great interest in all the Witness children. One can never tell what effect this will have on the teacher, but it proves Jesus’ words true when he said, “Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings you have furnished praise.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">NEW BRITAIN &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;102,192</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Early this year there was an eclipse of the sun here and someone started a rumor that during the eclipse the ground with everything on it would burn up. This caused near panic among the native population, as many believed this. Our enemies were quick to seize upon this rumor and to say that we were the ones responsible for spreading it. The newspapers then took up the story and soon it spread all over the islands and into Australia. A number of defamatory letters were written and published in the newspapers, and a number of people wrote in condemning their narrow-minded view of matters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The local government authorities called council meetings and instructed the native people not to listen to Jehovah’s witnesses. The attacks upon the organization finally culminated in the local returned servicemen’s league appealing both to the local administration and the Australian government to have our work banned. Back came the reply from the Australian Minister for Territories: “No ban on Jehovah’s witnesses.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This statement of government policy toward us, and the publicity, served a good purpose in that it helped to acquaint both local officials and the people in general more fully with our work, resulting in a marked improvement in their attitude toward us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In another instance a native publisher was preaching to the local natives from house to house and was using his new New World Translation Bible on the theme “Who is Jehovah?” One native asked if he could hold the Bible and read it for himself. Taking the Bible, he tore it up into fragments and threw it on the ground. The publisher did not get angry but went to the local police station. This same thing had happened before and nothing had been done about it by the police. This time the police officer in charge sent a native policeman with the publisher with orders to bring the offender in. The troublemaker lost his courage when he saw the policeman with the publisher and was terrified of what was to happen to him by the time they reached the police station. There the officer in charge told him, “You are a bad man, you broke God’s law and the law of the government. You must buy a new Bible for this man tomorrow, and if you don’t we will send you to jail.” Then he told the publisher to come to the police station at 10 a.m. the following morning to pick up the money for the Bible. When the publisher went the following morning the money was waiting for him. Was the publisher shaken by his experience? No! He was baptized soon after this and has now taken up the vacation pioneer service. He hopes to continue courageously serving Jehovah as a pioneer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During this year one of our young sisters was killed in a car wreck. She had been employed by the head of the Education Department in Rabaul. The funeral service was held at two o’clock at the Kingdom Hall. The hall was full of education officials, and also the local Adventist and Methodist ministers came. They let it be known they were on hand in case Jehovah’s witnesses were unable to carry through the funeral service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">After a short talk by the congregation servant, all assembled at the cemetery where a half-hour talk was delivered, showing the hope for our dead loved ones. The local Catholic priest attended the ceremony at the cemetery. After the service was over one of the education officials said, commenting on Acts 2: 29, “I read that myself that David is not in heaven, but that he is awaiting a resurrection.” So there are many honest-hearted persons yet that must join with us to sanctify Jehovah’s name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">NEW GUINEA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 1,224,003</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The brother who was the first to go to Papua to start the witness work there recently decided to serve where the need was greater. Turning their newly built home over to the Papuan branch, he and his wife moved into the mountainous highlands of New Guinea. They bought a small trade store only a few miles from territory where police patrols have never entered. He had only been there a few weeks when the local priest and Lutheran pastor began to tell their flocks not to buy, sell, trade, work for or speak to that “bad man” with the “bad mission.” As usual their efforts backfired, as many of the boys came to ask why the missions said so many bad things about him and his religion. It even helped one boy who had been trained by Witnesses in another area to locate this brother so that he could continue his study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The brothers here follow closely the instructions given in Deuteronomy 31:12, 13, where they are told to bring their little ones, that they may listen and learn. Not only do the children come to meetings, but they also show they understand by the intelligent answers they give. Children of seven or eight sit there drinking in everything that is said and are often first to have their hands up to answer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The entire north coast of New Guinea is a fruitful field, and the brothers are unable to care for much of it. It is not unusual to have a delegation come in from some distant village saying they have heard of Jehovah’s witnesses and that they have built a Kingdom Hall in their village, and asking that we please come and teach them. Many of them have to go away disappointed because there are not enough brothers available to go.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">SOLOMON ISLANDS &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;108,200</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 239 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 453</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We are truly thankful to Jehovah for the thirty-seven new publishers in our ranks and will continue to aid them to maturity. The increase has not come without opposition, as the following experience will show. Four of our brothers set out to witness to an Anglican Mission village in unassigned territory, but they got a rude reception from the native ‘father’ and were on the point of returning to town when some strangers in the village invited them to a neighboring village. They turned out to be SDA’s, and they listened attentively throughout the hour discourse, “Earth—to Be Desolate or Delight?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The talk had scarcely ended when our brothers began to be showered by their hosts with all the beliefs their mission taught them concerning how the earth would be burned up and everything on it. Quietly a newly baptized brother, who had eagerly volunteered for this unassigned territory, asked the SDA’s if they believed the Bible. They said they did. The three other brothers wondered what was coming next, as did the opposition. In an unhurried manner he asked them a further question: “Will there be any animals on earth during the 1,000-year desolation?” The reply was, “No.” “Well,” he continued, “someone has made a mistake, because the Bible says at Genesis 8:21: ‘Never again shall I deal every living thing </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font5"> blow just as I have done.’ ” This Scriptural reply touched some hard hearts, and most of the thirty-six in attendance expressed appreciation for the talk and extended an invitation to the brothers to return. Truly it is a time when people are manifesting themselves either to the right hand or the left.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A special pioneer was able to spend a short time with a large group of interested people on North Malaita during the past service year. In this area the people have left the organized missions and taken up one of their own making called Boboa, meaning “first” or “foundation.” The brother reports that during his visit a general conference was held of the twenty-eight villages under this religion, and after three separate debates with their leaders and many, many hours spent studying the truth with them, the truth has made good inroads. In public, before a large body of their own people, the leaders of this cult admitted that their teachings had been wrong and that the teachings of Jehovah’s witnesses were right. They all said that they would from that time on listen and be taught by Jehovah’s witnesses, and their twenty-eight churches would be changed into Kingdom Halls. This change will affect about 2,000 persons in these villages, but only time will tell whether these people will continue in their newly chosen course to an accurate knowledge of Jehovah’s will. We pray that if it be Jehovah’s will permanent missionaries will be allowed to go into the Solomon Islands and work with these people to help them learn what the will of Jehovah is.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">PARAGUAY &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 1,650,000</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">An excellent witness was given in Paraguay during the past twelve months. The message of the Kingdom has been spread into new fields. All the credit goes to Jehovah, and the brothers have in mind the words of the apostle Paul at 2 Corinthians 9:10: “Now he that abundantly supplies seed to the sower and bread for eating will supply and multiply the seed for you to sow and will increase the products of your righteousness.” Those who show real appreciation and do their utmost to increase the spiritual planting and harvesting work now being carried on are enjoying many fine experiences in the field in Paraguay. The branch servant reports on some of these experiences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A positive attitude in response to the Society’s call for more pioneers brought results in one Asuncion congregation. A special order of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Despertad!</span><span class="font5"> was obtained, triple the usual number. With the coming of the circuit servant a goal of ten vacation pioneers was set in a congregation of forty publishers. Would 25 percent respond? More than that did! A total of twelve enjoyed vacation pioneering during that month and placed an average of 121 magazines. One family believed that caring for their home was too great an obstacle for all of them to pioneer, so a missionary home arrangement was suggested. From a local missionary the brothers learned how to cook, and the entire family took turns in the kitchen; thus all participated in the pioneer effort during the month. This enthusiasm resulted in the placing of thousands of magazines and there were fifty new Bible studies begun! Yes, being optimistic and planning ahead brings results.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We are happy to report the penetration of the vast Chaco region with the good news. This immense brushland, inhabited by cattle, Indians and a few hardy Paraguayan workers and military men, has had practically no contact with the message of the Kingdom until now. It started when a traveling merchant of that feared area came to Asuncion to replenish his sales goods and by chance attended a Bible study being conducted by a missionary sister. His Protestant training could not stand against the Bible texts and teaching methods used by the missionary and he began to see that there was indeed a difference between Jehovah’s witnesses and all other religious groups. His enthusiasm moved him to return to the Chaco with a good supply of literature, which he fearlessly distributed as he made his rounds with mule and cart. Every time he got to one of the few far-off post offices in the Chaco, about every three months, he would write his experiences and request literature. Threats and difficult living conditions have not deterred this goodwill person, and he has expressed his desire to report as a regular Kingdom publisher and has shown interest in dedication and baptism. Therefore a yellow pin upon the large Paraguayan map at the branch office shows that there is Kingdom activity now in the Chaco. Who knows when such desert may spiritually “be joyful and blossom as the saffron”?—Isa. 35:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A new special pioneer couple had not been in their territory for long when the local priest, a Spaniard, began to feel the uncomfortable effects of the two “locusts” who were nibbling on his pasture. In an effort to intimidate he caused one goodwill person to be held in jail for a time. The special pioneers kept up their activity but prepared for the inevitable. One day while working near the police station the brother saw the priest run inside and, as expected, it was only a matter of minutes before priest and Witness confronted each other. Rash charges by the priest were made in front of the local police authority, while the brother meekly responded with well-chosen Bible texts. The priest was forced to admit that the Witnesses have the oldest religion, that they teach the Bible to the people and that they are a credit morally to the community. The </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">comisario</span><span class="font5"> spoke to the brother in the Guarani language and congratulated him for his courage and told him that he was proud of the way he stood up for his rights to visit the people in their homes and teach them the Bible, and stated that it was never one of Jehovah’s witnesses that gave him trouble by stealing or disturbing the peace. Evidently the article in the Spanish </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> on the modern Spanish inquisition against Jehovah’s witnesses had angered the local “pai” or priest; but too late! By being well prepared the Witness had turned the tables. When the brother explained to the police that the purpose of the priest’s opposition was to prevent him from going from house to house with the Bible, he laughed and said: “I suppose he expects you to just stay home and do nothing! Leave the matter to me. You will not be bothered again.” From that time many of the local townspeople have joined themselves to the growing group of Witnesses, and in just a few months a congregation was formed and now it numbers eleven publishers. According to the Bible a mild tongue can break a bone, and in this experience opposition was broken by meekly and fearlessly confronting the opposition in Jehovah’s strength.—Prov. 25:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">PERU &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population; 10,300,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 1,564 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 6,586</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">To those who make the ‘fear of Jehovah their treasure’ there is a never-ending source of new </span><span class="font6">things that Jehovah provides. (Isa. 33:6) So it has been for Jehovah’s witnesses in Peru. They had a very good increase in the number of those who have associated with them in the preaching activity during the past year, and this has brought much happiness to all. Then there was the dedication of the Society’s new two-story building, the branch home, Kingdom Hall and missionary establishment. This new building is located in a fine residential section of Lima and has become the focal point of interest in that section because of the work carried on from there. The dedication program attracted 424 persons from different congregations in Lima. It was then used for the Kingdom Ministry School, and congregation servants and special pioneers were all given the opportunity of studying there for one month. Jehovah’s witnesses in Peru are very thankful for the help from their brothers in other parts of the world that made the new building possible, and they want to show their appreciation now by good works. Their joyful experiences in the service are a real treasure to them. Here are some of these experiences that the branch servant sent in concerning things that have happened in Peru.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The new building served our expansion program very well for the Kingdom Ministry School that began in February. It would be hard to convey the real joy and happiness that the Peruvian brothers and sisters felt at being able to come in from the mountains and deserts of Peru to this lovely building to be together in peace for one whole month for dedicated study of Jehovah’s Word and organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One Indian sister who attended the school was outstanding in the progress and effort she made. When she and her husband were contacted in a high Andes village just a few years ago she did not know how to read or write. Dressed in typical Indian fashion with her several thick, heavy, llama-wool skirts and sweaters, wearing her distinctive white top hat, being the very essence of shyness, she, for her own part, would never think of addressing a stranger. One would never have thought at first glance that she would ever be a</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">minister of Jehovah’s Word. But she and her husband were “sheep.” When they learned what was required, the husband taught her to read and write. In time they both became special pioneers, doing an excellent work among Quechua-speaking Indian folk, thus serving a large section of territory that others of us would not get around to for some time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">To attend the Kingdom Ministry School it was necessary for one to come at a time, while the other stayed home, cared for the children, put in special pioneer time, and helped the small congregation that they aided and built up. The sister did well at school and her made-over personality permitted her to overcome much of her shyness with others. Her most difficult time at school was when it came time to leave. Overflowing tears and choked-up feelings told her story, which was shared by all her classmates.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Those serving where the need is great take advantage of every avenue for preaching. One couple teach English in order to be able to stay in their assignment. The wife writes: “I have a private class with two very bright Jewish girls, ages nine and thirteen. They already speak fairly good English, but they lack practice with someone speaking the language. The parents asked me to converse with them so they could become more fluent. I decided that the diversified and educational articles in the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> magazine would provide an excellent basis for English conversation. Since the magazine does touch on religion and the Bible, I suggested to the mother of the two girls that she might like to examine the material that I was using to teach them. She said she would rather just attend one of the classes to listen and would then give her opinion. I chose the topic ‘Maturity—Crown of Femininity’ from a 1958 </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> for that particular class. Afterward she expressed keen appreciation, saying ‘the class is worth while just for the good things the girls are learning aside from the good progress they are making with their English.’ Subsequent conversations showed that the girls were always amazing their schoolmates with the number of new subjects they could talk about. And mother is now a regular reader of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">PHILIPPINE REPUBLIC Population: 27,473,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 36,829 Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 746</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark205"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark206"></a>Jehovah’s witnesses have obediently heeded Christ’s command to let their light shine before mankind, and it has been done with great effect in the Philippine Islands. The preaching of the good news has brought a grand spiritual awakening, brightening the hearts of many righteously disposed persons. A Christian’s light must shine, not only by what he says, but by the way he lives. His actions and deportment have a great bearing on how people listen to his message. This is recognized by many when Jehovah’s witnesses have assemblies. The branch servant in the Philippine Islands gives us some very interesting experiences, the first of which deals with the mayor of a town who expressed his appreciation for a circuit assembly that had just been brought to a close.</span></h3>
<p><span class="font5">He said to the townspeople: “This assembly of Jehovah’s witnesses brought a good lesson to us. Our town was made happier for three days due to their presence. I would suggest that you people of Luna should begin now to read the Bible in order to understand fully what righteousness, peace, proper moral conduct and true education really mean. It would be a good thing if Jehovah’s witnesses would favor us with another visit.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">You say you have a hard time getting to meetings? Is it as difficult as it is in some parts of Mountain Province? A couple with seven children living in a particularly rugged region have not, because of laziness or neglect, missed a meeting in ten years. This family considers it a serious failure to do God’s will if they miss </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font5"> meeting. It requires a four-hour hike to the Kingdom Hall. On meeting day the family rises at dawn, breakfasts and is off. During the rainy season the rivers become swollen and dangerous, so they use a horse to cross the stream, making several trips to get the children across. Then a change into dry clothing and they are ready for the meetings. Faith on the march indeed! After ten years of this their faithfulness has been rewarded by the establishment of a congregation in their own neighborhood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Love for the “sheep” is not deterred by material loss or personal discomfort. Publishers working in a particular assignment derisively call it the “territory of no return.” Why so? Because the path leading to this territory is so stony, narrow and pressed by thick, thorny weeds growing on both sides that shoes and umbrellas are destroyed and have no chance at all of returning with their owners. Some sisters would weep from frustration, but faithfulness brings a reward. Recently a congregation of thirty happy publishers was formed in that territory. But there is more. Members of the new congregation were so impressed by the faithful example of these selfless pioneers that eight of them, including six servants, are now vacation pioneers and have expressed their hope of becoming regular pioneers. How wonderfully meaningful are the psalmist’s words: “The one that without fail goes forth, even weeping, carrying along a bagful of seed, will without fail come in with a joyful cry”!—Ps. 126:6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One big factor instrumental in building up the pioneer ranks is the willingness of theocratic families to cooperate in order to have at least one of their members serve as a pioneer. In one case a father of ten children has established a family rule whereby each one of his children will pioneer immediately following graduation from high school. In the meantime the children’s appreciation for pioneer service is built up by vacation pioneering each summer. The results of this family policy are gratifying. The three oldest children are now special pioneers, the latest graduate is preparing to enter regular pioneer service, while the mother and younger children continue to vacation pioneer during summer recess.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One remarkable and heartwarming evidence of maturity is in connection with the generous gift of money and clothing made by the Society to publishers who were sorely stricken by typhoons and floods during the year. Under instructions from the Society, the circuit servants in the affected areas made tours and spoke to congregation committees in an effort to ascertain what was needed in the way of relief. Numerous congregations in circuits that were not too badly hit reacted as typified by one congregation committee that said: “Please express our gratitude to God’s organization for this truly wonderful generosity. But, brother, we have not been too badly damaged and therefore will not accept anything. However, the brothers in [such and such a congregation] in the town of [so and so] have been terribly affected. Would you please give our share to them?” This lack of greed in a time of emergency and necessity surely gives added significance to Jesus’ words: “By this all will know that you are my disciples, if you have love among yourselves.”—John 13:35.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">PORTUGAL &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 9,470,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak </span><span class="font5">Publishers: </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">1,285 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 7,370</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">To the Portuguese brothers the 1962 yeartext </span><span class="font6">has much meaning and is very appropriate. Up until this year the brothers, even though not officially recognized by the Portuguese government, were able to go about preaching the good news of God’s kingdom without much interference. But abruptly all this changed. Newspapers began to charge Jehovah’s witnesses with Communist activities in the Portuguese province of Angola. A brother was arrested and held without charge for five months. Suddenly, in February, six foreign brothers who were residents of Portugal were given thirty days to leave the country. Two of these had been in the country for over seven years. No sooner had they been given notice when an order was issued to all post offices banning all literature of Jehovah’s witnesses. The police have searched the homes of the brothers and confiscated all their personal literature, and they have been forbidden to meet with others to study God’s Word, the Bible. However, the work continues, and the branch servant gives us experiences from Portugal, Angola, Azores Islands, Cape Verde, Macao, Madeira and Sao Tome.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Portugal is a Catholic country and many are fanatical in their worship of the Catholic saints. For this reason it came as a shock when the people heard that, by edict of the Vatican in Rome, “Saint” Philomena was no longer a saint. A sister had just finished her daily shopping in the marketplace next to a large Catholic church when she was approached by a woman asking where they had put the statue of Saint Philomena, as it was not in its usual place. She had prayed to Saint Philomena to cure her sick baby and now that the baby was well she wanted to thank the saint. The sister explained that Philomena was no longer a saint, but the woman would not believe it. Just then a Catholic priest happened by and the sister asked him to explain to the very disturbed lady. After the priest had done his best to explain, the sister asked, “But isn’t it true that we shouldn’t pray to saints but directly to Jehovah God through his Son, Christ Jesus?” The priest then tried to liken God to an important official of a state, saying it was almost impossible to see the official and one therefore had to talk with less important men in government. After being shown that it was wrong to compare the Almighty God to any mere man, the priest beat a hasty retreat. The sister then took the name and address of the woman, who by now showed much interest in what the sister had to say, and a back-call was arranged.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A seventy-four-year-old man had been baptized in the Pentecostal church and had a great appreciation for the Bible. He would spend most of his time sitting in the park reading the Scriptures. A family of Jehovah’s witnesses lived next door to him and in neighborly conversations a </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> subscription had been obtained. Due to the man’s association with the Pentecostal church the family did not follow up on the interest that he had shown when the subscription was taken. One day, as she was returning from the service, a member of the family met the old man sitting in the park and, accepting an invitation to sit down, began to talk about the Bible. This discussion led to other discussions in the park. One day the man brought a magazine written by the Pentecostal church denouncing Jehovah’s witnesses. The man was very indignant about the false statements made, and a regular Bible study was started. Now this seventy-four-year-old man is a regular attender at the meetings and regular in the field service and is planning to be baptized.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Our prayers are that the officials of the government will see that our work is a peaceful one, a work that brings comfort and hope to the people. Knowing this, they can then let us continue in our lifesaving work. But if opposition to the Kingdom message increases and times become more difficult, the brothers will continue to take Jehovah’s counsel to “be courageous and let your heart be strong.” They are determined to continue, as they realize that there are many, many more sheeplike people in Portugal that hunger for the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">ANGOLA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 9,470,000</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Angola is a land of unrest. During 1962 there has been fighting between the Portuguese authorities and the Angolan terrorists who want independence from Portugal. Newspapers and certain religious groups have used the local situation to frame mischief by law and articles have appeared in the newspapers blaming Jehovah’s witnesses for the recent troubles. Because of this some of our brothers have been imprisoned and badly treated. Nevertheless, the brothers continue strong in their faith and preach at every opportunity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A group of brothers were arrested as they gathered to study the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> magazine. After being held in jail for many months they were shipped to another part of the territory and put to work on plantations. During this time the police officials were able to see firsthand the way Jehovah’s witnesses deport themselves. The result? One police officer was noted as saying that he wished all his prisoners were like Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">AZORES &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;348,000</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The Azores are made up of a number of islands, and sometimes it is difficult to reach the less inhabited ones. As a result, some have never had the opportunity to hear the Kingdom message. With this in mind the circuit servant made a special effort during the year to witness to these isolated spots. He reports the following experience:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“On a visit to the island of Flores I entered the local general store to make some purchases and was soon engaged in a conversation with more than fifteen people. Most of them showed a keen interest, but, when the local priest entered the store, they scattered for fear of being chastised by the ‘padre.’ Later I was able to talk to some of them again, and a large quantity of literature was placed. Some time before this I had been given the name and address of a goodwill person on the island and I was happy to locate a whole family of interested persons who were eagerly waiting for someone to tell them the truth. I was unable to leave the island for two weeks because there were no boats, but the time was well spent and I placed all the literature I had with me. The goodwill family insisted that I eat and sleep in their house during my stay, and each day would begin and end with a long discussion with the family. Their main desire now is to do the divine will, and I know that Jehovah will bless them in their efforts.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The main religion of the islands is Roman Catholic, and since the local Catholic church has never advocated Bible study, most of the population do not have Bibles. So then, one of the first books that is placed with interested persons is the Holy Bible. Due to the recent ban on our literature the brothers have found it increasingly difficult to receive even the Bible. To overcome this problem the brothers began to purchase Bibles from the pastor of a small Evangelist church. The brother who regularly purchased the Bibles was quick to seize an opportunity to witness and tactfully began to discuss Bible subjects. Soon it became evident that the pastor was very much interested in our work, having a library of most of the older books of the Society. The result was that all the later books and booklets, along with the New World Translation of the Bible and a year’s subscription for </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font5">and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!,</span><span class="font5"> were placed with him and a Bible study was started. Since then he has told members of his church that they should welcome Jehovah’s witnesses when they knock at the door. The study continues to progress.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">These islands are small and news travels fast. So then, when a publisher placed just a few booklets, it was not long until he was approached on the street by various persons asking for some of the literature and expressing a desire to study the Bible. In fact, he reports that such experiences happen almost every day. Because of this it is not surprising that a special pioneer who has been there only two short months already reports fourteen Bible studies and is arranging for more.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The brothers recognize the grand privilege they have of opening up this new territory and are determined to follow the admonition: “Let them attribute to Jehovah glory, and in the islands let them tell forth even his praise.”—Isa. 42:12.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The work in Macao was started last year when a dedicated sister whose husband was transferred there began preaching, even though very few people spoke her language. Since then her husband has been recalled to Portugal and the sister had to leave the few interested people she found.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Due to this sister several subscriptions have been obtained, and these people continue to receive the magazines. It is hoped that sometime soon some brothers will be able to visit Macao and help these newly interested ones to further maturity.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">To become one of Christ’s followers sometimes is not an easy course, but with patience we receive Jeho-</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">vah’s reward. The experience of a sister who was just baptized at a recent assembly shows this. When a study was started in her home, this caused great difficulty, as her husband was violently opposed and did all in his power to stop it. However, the study progressed, and soon the sister was attending meetings and going out in the service. As her interest in the truth increased so did her husband’s opposition, until finally the sister determined to separate from her husband. The advice of the brothers was to continue living with him and be a model wife, as stated in 1 Peter 3:1, 2, so as to win him over to the truth. This she did, continually praying to Jehovah for his help and guidance. The result was that some months later her husband suddenly asked to have one of Jehovah’s witnesses come to the house to study with him. Due to this sister’s faithfulness and patience both she and her husband were baptized at the last assembly and both are now dedicated witnesses of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A sister started a study with a young woman, but it had to be conducted at a time when the young woman’s fiance was not around, as he did not like the truth. One day the young man unexpectedly entered the room and listened in stony silence as the study was concluded. In the closing prayer the sister tactfully prayed about the new world and how married couples would bring forth children in a paradise to live forever. Several days later, as the sister was preparing breakfast, she heard a knock at the door. Opening the door, she found the young man standing there. He had heard from others where the sister lived and was now wanting more information about God’s new world. A book and Bible were placed and a study started. The young man and woman are now married and are active, dedicated publishers with the hope of living in that promised new world.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Although the 1962 report for Sao Tome shows a decrease in the number of publishers, the brothers there are content, knowing that their labors have not been in vain. The island is made up of many coffee plantations and there are new workers coming and going from the African mainland. Throughout the 1962 service year the brothers witnessed to a great number of people who later returned to Africa. Some of these have continued their studies and are now dedicated publishers in Angola and Mozambique.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There has been some difficulty in receiving literature due to the current political trouble, but the brothers have made good use of what has been received by passing it from person to person. They look forward to the time when they will be able to praise Jehovah without interference. Our prayers are that this may be soon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">PUERTO RICO &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 2,349,544</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Each service year appears to be the best, but without doubt the past year has been the busiest and the best for Puerto Rico. More hours have been spent preaching the good news than ever before. More literature was placed, more studies were conducted and more people were reached by the message of the truth than heretofore in the history of the work of proclaiming the good news of the Kingdom in Puerto Rico. Six new congregations were organized, and 369 took part in vacation pioneer service. Three classes of the Kingdom Ministry School were conducted with fifty-seven overseers, missionaries and special pioneers taking the course. So it was a busy year, but a year of blessings, and the experiences enjoyed are reported on by the branch servant for Puerto Rico, Virgin Islands and Tortola.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">You said last year, Brother Knorr, that perhaps Puerto Rico had one of the highest placements of magazines in the world, and you hoped the brothers would keep up the good work. You will not be disappointed to know that they outdid the placements of last year by a good margin: the specials averaging 173, the regular pioneers 121 and the congregation publishers 17, leaving with the public 618,984 magazines for their spiritual enlightenment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">After people study a while and learn the truth they want to get out and tell others about it. A missionary tells of a woman who started to study last November. She started out in the service but was not doing much, due to ill health and opposition in the family. When it was suggested that everyone try to make a schedule of ten hours for each month, she did not think she could do it. The sister asked her if she could set aside twenty minutes a day for study. “Oh, yes,” was the answer, “because when I read </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> I don’t like to leave it until I finish it.” So she began a systematic study of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font5"> the Bible and other publications. This was the secret of a successful schedule. The increased knowledge was filling her with desire to speak to others. Given ten magazines to place in April, she placed them before she reached home. She went out in the service during the week, and on the following Monday night she appeared at the study of the missionary and said she wanted to talk to her. She explained she had taken her own Bible and books and offered them to her neighbors and had taken orders for twelve books and Bibles. She has taken a territory out near her house and averages twenty-five hours a month. She is courageous even in face of opposition, bad health and caring for two grandchildren. Her hope is rightly placed in Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If everyone that started was in the truth today there would be thousands more who would be joyfully serving Jehovah. Many of these have been helped by patience and tactfulness on the part of brothers who took to heart the Society’s suggestion to help those who had strayed away. A special pioneer who had just gone through the course of the Kingdom Ministry School was assigned to a congregation where a number of brothers had cooled off. With the instructions he had received in mind he began to visit these persons one by one. One family had become inactive in 1955. Because he applied the counsel he had received, the family is now publishing, conducts a study and never misses a meeting. Another brother who was inactive is now a demonstration of enthusiasm to the others. Four others that were in the same condition are frequenting the Kingdom Hall quite regularly and are showing a good attitude. As the brother states, “Seeing these brothers return is a joy that is animating even those who are still inactive.” It is certain that all are grateful to Jehovah for the Kingdom Ministry course that has indirectly helped them to renew their close relationship with Jehovah and his organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The clearer and more exact rendering of the Hebrew and Greek Scriptures as found in the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation</span><span class="font5"> is making itself felt in many places. One of Jehovah’s witnesses has been studying as well as instructing in the University of Puerto Rico. One of the courses that he took was “The Bible as Literature.” The professor, on the first day of the course, said it was all right to use any version of the Bible. Naturally, the brother brought the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation.</span><span class="font5"> The professor said, Tn order to appreciate the Bible as</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">literature you have to understand it.’ He would cite different texts and discuss them. The obscure ones he would call on the students to read from their different translations. The first few times he would call on the brother to read from the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation</span><span class="font5"> after he had called on the others, and he would invariably say, ‘Yes, that is the understanding we want.’ It became a regular thing for him to call on the others to read the texts first from their different versions and then say, “Now, Mr. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">C</span><span class="font5">---, would you read from your</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">version, please?” It was evident that he used the reading from the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation</span><span class="font5"> to conclude the matter. It was nice, the brother said, to hear the professor and the students begin using the name Jehovah instead of “God” or “Lord.” As a result he has placed five Bibles with the class, and it has provided him the opportunity to give a testimony concerning Jehovah and his kingdom to some who are hard to reach.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">TORTOLA. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7,760</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">For the past two years the one congregation located at Roadtown has been on the decrease. In spite of all efforts on the part of the circuit servant and even the district servant, there seemed to be no way to change this decline in the ministry. Suspecting that two sisters were not conducting themselves in a Christian manner, the servants investigated, and both of them were dis-fellowshiped. This was during the latter part of the 1961 service year. September and October of this service year passed with further decreases. Then came a change. The following months were months of increase, ending the year with a 25-percent increase, almost making up the 27-percent decrease of the previous year. So it is quite clear that where there is uncleanness Jehovah’s spirit does not dwell.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The congregation servant, commenting on the progress of the work on the island, said: “On this island there are a number of persons of goodwill, as evidenced by the forty-two that attended the Memorial. One person symbolized his dedication to Jehovah during the year and about four more are contemplating taking the same step shortly.” Then he added: “One of the outstanding experiences was the response of a whole family toward the truth due to their teen-age son. He began asking a pioneer questions, such as, ‘Who is God’s father?’ and so forth. A study was arranged for at his home and eventually the whole family was attending. It is like a happy service center when the family and friends meet together twice a week for study. As one listens to comments and questions of the little ones it makes one’s heart rejoice to see the fulfillment of David’s words, quoted by Jesus in Matthew 21:16: ‘Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings you have furnished praise.’ The mother has already attended three assemblies, and both she and one of her sons are enrolled in the theocratic ministry school. She delights in taking advantage of every opportunity to witness in defense of the truth.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The American Virgin Islands include the islands of St. Croix, St. John and St. Thomas. As everywhere else the people on these islands are being notified of the incoming new world of righteousness and the outgoing wicked system of things.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">For several years the work was dragging among the publishers on the island of St. Thomas, but last year and this there has been good forward progress. The Kingdom Hall that the brothers had used for many years was becoming too small and, besides, the owner of the building advised them that he was in need of it. To find a new location or even a lot on which to build seemed out of the question. Land prices have soared out of reason. The brothers thought they might have to pay up to thirty-five or forty thousand dollars to have a place in which to meet. Then all of a sudden a piece of land was donated to them in a very good location. You can imagine their joy on receiving such a grand gift.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A family of publishers moved here from the States for health reasons. It was necessary for them to build a house first. The sister was discussing things in general with the wife of the contractor who was going to build the house, when all of a sudden this person said, ‘‘My husband tells me that you are one of Jehovah’s witnesses. I would like to show you something.” She brought out a letter from her twenty-one-year-old son who was “earning his way around the world.” He informed his mother that he had met Jehovah’s witnesses in Tasmania and was studying with them. Then he explained to her what he was learning. The young man’s mother said, “After reading that beautiful letter I just have to know more about Jehovah’s witnesses. Do you have a group here in St. Thomas? Would you possibly have some literature that I might have?” The sister assured her that there was a congregation of more than fifty publishers and that their Kingdom Hall was only a block from where she taught Sunday school. The next day several books were placed with her and a study was started on the spot. The following day the builder said to the sister, “Oh, by the way, my wife hasn’t stopped reading that literature that you gave her since yesterday morning.” The study is being conducted regularly now, and the woman’s sister sits in on the study as well. So in some cases it takes some special shock to wake people up to the fact that Jehovah’s witnesses exist, even though they might be right under their noses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A small but very enthusiastic district assembly was held in July right in the middle of the town of Fred-eriksted. Jehovah's witnesses were under public scrutiny. There is no doubt that the impression made was favorable. For the public lecture the dean of lawyers of the Virgin Islands attended together with his wife. Afterward he approached the speaker, shaking hands with him and saying, “I am in full harmony with what was mentioned, that organized religion is the chief cause of the present troubles upon the earth.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">SIERRA EEONE &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Populations 2,500,000</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Patience and endurance are qualities that must be lived and demonstrated by Jehovah’s witnesses if they are to realize an increase and if the ingathering of the “other sheep” is to continue. Jehovah’s witnesses have worked hard in Sierra Leone during the past service year, as well as in Gambia and the Republic of Guinea. There are difficult problems to overcome, and the report from the branch servant shows how the servants of God are working on these.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There were concerted efforts during the year to overcome our big problem of illiteracy, and splendid progress was made in all the congregations and isolated groups where the literacy classes were started. Our policy has been to teach the brothers to read their own language where tins is possible, and this has meant having two or three different languages taught in some congregations. The results have been gratifying; at the close of the service year one third of the brothers were enrolled in the literacy classes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A number of brothers have come in from Nigeria and Ghana during the year to serve where the need is great, and we are grateful to Jehovah for their help. It took a great deal of planning, along with patience, prayer and perseverance, to get here, but, as one stated, surely they feel that Jehovah has blessed the efforts of those that have answered His call to serve where the need is great, and they are now experiencing real joy for having taken this step.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There was a splendid response to the call for more pioneers, and we are happy to report a fine increase in the number taking up the pioneer service. Our average of pioneers for 1961 was sixty-two, but this year we are happy to report an average of seventy-six, with a peak of eighty-one. This means about 25 percent of our publishers are in the pioneer service. This has had a strengthening effect on the organization and we hope others will copy this fine example.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The following experience enjoyed by a pioneer shows the importance of calling back on all </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> subscribers and the blessings received. “When we received the new Bible, I was very anxious to deliver it to all those on whom I make back-calls as well as to the many persons of goodwill that had subscribed for </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> After working diligently that month, I was able to distribute sixty Bibles, but had not yet made all the calls I had intended. So I decided to carry on for the second month. As the offer for that month was the book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">‘Let Your Name Be Sanctified,’</span><span class="font5"> I decided to offer both it and the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures</span><span class="font5"> on all my back-calls and to subscribers. I had a happy time during that month and was pleased to have made all the calls I had on my list. Not one to whom I presented the Bible refused, but all were delighted to have a Bible they could better understand. Many took additional copies for their friends. One man was so impressed with it and the book that he took, not only a set for himself, but four others—two sets for clergymen friends of his and two sets for his sons and their families. I was surprised and delighted when I totaled up my book placements to find that I had placed 193 books and Bibles in just two months! This certainly shows the importance of calling back on all subscribers.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">GAMBIA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;311,000</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Following the arrival of two special pioneers from Sierra Leone, the immigration officials charged them with being prohibited immigrants and they were arrested and tried in the magistrate’s court. They were convicted and given a deportation order to leave Gambia within a few days. The case was appealed to the Supreme Court of Gambia, and we won. Now the way was open for the two special pioneers to stay in Gambia. A few months later the circuit servant was assigned to serve Bathurst, but as soon as he landed he was arrested and charged with the same offense. The clergy had been stung with the scorpion-like tails of the symbolic locusts and were determined to keep Jehovah’s witnesses out of Gambia. In this they were to fail. Another trial was held in the magistrate’s court, and the circuit servant was convicted and given a deportation order to leave the country. Again we appealed the case, sending a qualified lawyer from Freetown to assist the local lawyer in Bathurst. While the governor had made an order prohibiting Jehovah’s witnesses from entering Gambia, it had never been officially published; consequently the chief justice in handing down his judgment declared the order null and without legal force. During this time the branch office in London had been busy writing to the Colonial Office, and shortly after our Supreme Court victory the newly appointed governor in Gambia sent a letter to the Colonial Office stating that the order that had been made by the previous governor had now been rescinded and Jehovah’s witnesses were no longer considered as prohibited immigrants.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">In spite of the many difficulties and troubles, the lack of mature brothers and the nationwide problem of illiteracy encountered in preaching the truth in Guinea, the brothers remain optimistic and happy about the future. Splendid progress was made in all features of the work during the service year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In one district the police and government officials had been very hostile and opposed to the brothers, and a number were thrown into jail because of their zealous preaching. In spite of the persecution and opposition, the brothers continued steadfast and never stopped preaching. Soon the tables were turned and, like Haman who built gallows for Mordecai, the majority of these officials were themselves arrested and put into jail because of political corruption. The officials who replaced them have shown kindness to the brothers. There are many of the Lord’s “other sheep” in Guinea and, by Jehovah’s undeserved kindness, they will be searched out and brought into the New World society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">SINGAPORE &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population; 1,712,008</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Jehovah’s witnesses in Singapore and the territory under the jurisdiction of the branch office there look back on their service year with appreciation and can truthfully say: “The blessing of Jehovah—that is what makes rich, and he adds no pain with it.” (Prov. 10:22) A truly fine witness has been given throughout the territory of Singapore, Malaya, North Borneo and Sarawak, with many more hours devoted to the preaching of the good news of the Kingdom than at any time in the history of the New World society in this area. Some very interesting experiences are reported by the branch servant in Singapore.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">For a Buddhist person brought up in a Chinese home where he is taught to render parental obedience to pursue a study of the Bible requires great courage. To dedicate one’s life to Jehovah, the God of the Bible, and then pursue one’s purpose in life as a full-time minister may lead to a violent break with one’s family. A Chinese-educated young man started to attend meetings after only five months of study. When he learned the Bible principle on the use of blood he refused to sell chicken blood in his father’s market stall where he was working. This enraged the father, who ordered him to stop studying the Bible. The study was moved and in nine months’ time he dedicated his life to Jehovah and enrolled as a vacation pioneer. The father became infuriated and threatened: “If you continue to disobey me and keep on with this preaching work don’t think I’m going to look after you. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Get out of my house </span><span class="font5">and see if your God Jehovah will look after you!” Doubtless the words of the psalmist now came into the mind of our brother, as recorded at Psalm 27:10: “In case my own father and my own mother did leave me, even Jehovah himself would take me up.” Packing up his meager belongings, the brother left. Would his Father in heaven stand by his promise in Matthew chapter six? Did not Jesus say he would bring a sword and a man’s enemies would be people of his own household? Resolutely he pressed on in the pioneer work and has now been enrolled as a special pioneer. No, his God Jehovah has not let him down, and what is more he now has a hundredfold ‘brothers and sisters and mothers,’ and so forth. Can you, too, with a little extra courage, effort and faith, get into the pioneer service?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A young sister writes: “Three years ago my mother dedicated her life to Jehovah. Although not knowing any English, she appreciated the need for full-time workers and entered the pioneer work. This required great faith on her part because she had my sister and me, both in school, as well as herself to support and no steady income. However, she took to heart what Jesus said about never being anxious about those things but putting the Kingdom interests first. In the last two and a half years of my mother’s pioneering, we have learned to appreciate the truthfulness of these words. She is now a special pioneer, and Jehovah has richly blessed my mother’s diligent service. Her wonderful zeal and devotion have set a fine example for me and my younger sister to follow. I am now enjoying my sixth time in the vacation pioneer work since my own dedication. I can now understand why my mother has never lost her joy and happiness even though she has had many trials and difficulties. I am happy to have had training in my youth in the way I should go.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">All the brothers here are certainly looking forward to the 1963 assembly, not only to have association with our local brothers, but to welcome and have fellowship with brothers from other lands.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">How are you getting along with your ten-hour-a-month schedule? You say you have an unbelieving husband and three or four small children and this makes it impossible to reach the goal? Maybe you can follow the example of a sister who was baptized at the Penang district assembly. She has an unbelieving husband and four small children to look after, but she never misses the three weekly meetings at the Kingdom Hall and manages to average over twelve hours a month in the service. ‘Well, what is so unusual about that?’ you say. ‘Many sisters are doing the same or even better, but my problem is much more difficult to overcome.’ Maybe so, but this sister has an additional handicap that is out of the ordinary. You see, she is totally blind and has to be led by the hand to the Kingdom Hall and out into the field. For years she was kept in spiritual darkness by one of Christendom’s sects. No one in the church had ever offered to help her study the Bible, but when the pastor found out she was studying with Jehovah’s witnesses he made a tremendous effort to break up the study, offering to read the Bible and study it with her. However, once this goodwill person saw the truth there was no holding her back. But wherein can we learn a lesson from her? What is it that makes her so zealous to do Jehovah’s will in spite of seemingly insurmountable obstacles? When she heard of Jehovah’s promise in Isaiah 35, that “the eyes of the blind ones will be opened,” she appreciated what this promise could mean. She has an overwhelming desire to see her four beautiful children, not to mention the manifold beauties of nature. The love in her heart for God, who has promised this new world, is so great that nothing can stop her from rendering exclusive devotion to him. When you read God’s promise in Revelation 21:4, that God “will wipe out every tear from their eyes, and death will be no more,” are you thrilled about this message? Do you see yourself there along with your children? Then, do you express your appreciation by setting aside time for teaching them the Bible, bringing them to meetings and out in the service? Ten hours of service to Jehovah in a month is not too much for all the blessings we receive from him, is it?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A sister with an unbelieving husband has known the truth for thirteen years. At an assembly she listened to the talk on pioneering and was impressed. The speaker stressed self-analysis. This she did. Why had she not even vacation pioneered once during the last thirteen years? Was it lack of faith? Well, no; she had won out with the medical authorities over a blood transfusion issue. Were the children taking up too much time? No, because while they were at school this would be a good time for Kingdom service. Too old, then? How about health? Could it be fear? Ah! that seems to be the point. But fear is a trait of Satan’s world, so she decided to cast this fear outside and be courageous. The first month of vacation pioneering was the most enjoyable in her life, so she arranged to extend the time to three months of the year. What a fine reward this has been because of self-analysis!</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">One afternoon a sister was visited by two Chinese men, both strangers to her family, who inquired for her by name and as the lady who sold Bibles. Imagine her joy on finding that the wife of one visitor was a subscriber for the Chinese </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> and he had come to get copies of the New World Bible and particularly the Greek Scriptures, as he had seen one at his friend’s place. On behalf of the friend accompanying him, who spoke little English, he asked for copies of all the Society’s books in Chinese. Placing those on hand and promising to order the others, she arranged to call at his home one evening. What a happy and rewarding visit this proved to be as husband, wife and children and their friend gathered with English and Chinese Bibles to share in discussion with her and another sister! Subsequent visits have cleared up numerous Bible questions and now a home Bible study has been started using </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font5"> in both languages.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">It is possible for the circuit servant to visit this country only once a year, during which time he has meetings with the brothers and visits the goodwill persons in outlying places. However, a visit is possible at least every two weeks by means of the magazines coming to the homes. This year a new magazine has entered the field, that is, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> in Chinese, and so far this has had a good reception by our Chinese readers. Hundreds of families are receiving our magazines regularly. What is needed, however, is a mature brother to remain there and organize them. This is an ideal assignment for a married couple wanting to serve where the need is great.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">The branch office at Elandsfontein in South Africa directs the work of Jehovah’s witnesses in a number of places. It looks after all South Africa, Basutoland, Bechuanaland, St. Helena, South-West Africa and Swaziland. While directing this work from a service standpoint, furnishing these places with circuit and district servants, the branch office also does considerable printing for many of the other branches in Africa. It became necessary during the past year to print 20,000 booklets, 1,694,026 </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> magazines and 529,080 </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font6"> magazines along with much miscellaneous printing. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> is printed in nine different languages and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font6"> in four in South Africa. The fifty-five members of the Bethel family had real pleasure in serving their brothers in different parts of the continent. The branch servant sends these interesting experiences that have taken place in the territories under the jurisdiction of the branch office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The highlight of the year was the United Worshippers National Assembly held in three areas for the three main racial groups, European, African and Coloured. By coincidence the ruling National Party chose as a date for the general election the date already fixed for the opening day of the European National Assembly. In a country where politics enjoys the preeminent place in the minds of the white inhabitants and where political divisions are marked and bitter, this would mean such a volume of election propaganda that normal assembly advertising would be overshadowed. However, the brothers rose to the challenge and advertised as never before, and the factory was kept working extra time printing a timely pamphlet on the assembly entitled “Which Government Will Bring Unity?” and which was distributed by the tens of thousands throughout the assembly city and nearby towns. The result was the largest attendance ever at the public talk. Plow different was the peaceful association in unity of Afrikaans, English and German-speaking South Africans within the assembly grounds to the noisy political divisions existing outside! At the three assemblies the total attendance was 22,551, and 503 were immersed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Kingdom Ministry School has had twenty-three classes thus far, with a total of 383 brothers and sisters receiving the special instruction and training. These classes were held in four languages, namely, English, Sesotho, Xhosa and Zulu. All who have attended have expressed great appreciation for this loving provision made by Jehovah through his organization to enable them to become better qualified for the ministry. “This is the best arrangement the Society has ever made.” “This is the most instructive book the Society has ever published.” Remarks such as these have frequently been heard. Said one congregation servant: “Imagine a shepherd boy looking after sheep and treating them roughly with kicks. Then one day his father sees him doing this and tells his mother to call him home to get some proper training on how to treat the sheep in the right way. That boy was me.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Indian field continues to have good attention. A missionary sister gets interested ones to take her to their friends and relatives and with this introduction many new studies have been started. Six sisters in one family were reached in this way. After a few studies these new ones are taken out in the work. The householder quickly responds when she sees the missionary is accompanied by an Indian woman. The atmosphere soon becomes warm and friendly, conducive to the giving of a good witness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Some African brothers think that Africans are too poor to subscribe for the magazines, but the experience of one African special pioneer proves the contrary. In just one month, in unassigned territory, he worked 236 hours. He obtained twenty-six new subscriptions, placed seventy-two magazines and fifty-three booklets, made fifty-five back-calls and started seven studies. He slept in a different home almost every night, having a two-hour discussion with the householder in the evening. Most of his subscriptions were obtained in this way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Victory was gained on a matter of principle, as the following experience shows. All Africans in one “reserve” were instructed to pay six cents for the purchase of cattle for sacrifice. A brother refused to pay, and the headman took him to court. The European magistrate dismissed the case. The headman then appealed to the Bantu authority, and the court judges fined the brother $44.80. The brother then appealed and, with the aid of two of the Society’s representatives, won the case. The brother’s stand for right principle resulted in a good witness being given to people of goodwill in the area, credit for the victory being given to Jehovah.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">A circuit assembly was one of the highlights in a year of progress in Basutoland. The brothers are mostly very poor and are scattered throughout this mountainous land, so their problem was how to travel to the assembly village. With no previous experience the African brothers chartered a bus on their own and organized its route, beginning at the farthest point high in the mountains and picking up delegates at each isolated group and congregation as it wended its way up and down the hills and valleys, the joyous and beautiful sound of African voices singing Kingdom songs in harmony increasing as more delegates joined the bus at the arranged stops. A very reasonable fare was worked out for each delegate and his family according to the point at which they joined the bus, but when all the fares were added up there was found to be a surplus over the cost of hire. What did these materially poor brothers decide? Not to recalculate the fares and give each one a refund, but to contribute the surplus to the Society as an expression of their appreciation for the wonderful things learned at the assembly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">You have heard of literature at pioneer rates, but have you heard of a bride at pioneer rates? A problem handled at this assembly was the case of a young sister who wished to marry a special pioneer but whose nonWitness brothers were demanding a high lobola (or dowry) of $600.00. After a discussion with the circuit and district servant, the widowed mother, a Witness, who had legal rights although not sole tribal rights over the girl, saw the wisdom of accepting a much smaller lobola and allowing her daughter to ‘marry in the Lord.’ Thus lobola was fixed at pioneer rates and the marriage arranged, to the joy and satisfaction of the pioneer, the girl and her mother.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">One outstanding feature of the year’s activity was the showing of the “Divine Will” film at Mahalapye. This was shown in the “kgotla” or place of the native court with 2,056 in attendance. The showing of the film opened the way for the brothers in that area to enjoy many opportunities for giving the witness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A circuit assembly was scheduled at one centre where there was no hall. Poles were erected and covered with tarpaulins, which were loaned free by the railway. The stationmaster came over during the weekend to see what was going on and informed the local congregation servant that he would give them a site on railway property on which they could build a hall for regular use.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">A back-call night has been arranged and the brothers have become “shining lights” in a very literal sense. The people in general rely on candle power, but on back-call night Jehovah’s witnesses go forth with pressure lanterns, which are used to help them find their way up and down the hillsides, and then they use them as the study is conducted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the year one of the congregation servants was able to come to the Republic to attend the Kingdom Ministry School. He applied himself diligently to the course of instruction and practical training and has now been appointed part-time circuit servant on the island. This added privilege he will care for in addition to his duties as congregation servant. He will visit both congregations three times a year in his capacity as circuit servant and arrange for the two circuit assemblies each year. This arrangement should build up the organization on the island still further.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">There has been some difficulty in getting the work going amongst the African people. However, the possibilities are there when there is proper follow-through. A young Nama lad of school-going age was contacted in house-to-house work. His interest was awakened by the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font5"> book, but, being unable to contribute, he asked the publisher to call again. The back-call was made, the book placed and a study started. In a few months he was attending meetings, giving student talks and engaging in house-to-house work. Recently he topped his school on Bible subjects—a happy result for following through.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The magazine work continues to be productive. An invitation was extended to a passerby to attend the circuit assembly then in progress. The man came to the circuit activity meeting and enjoyed it so much that he was back on Sunday morning and stayed the whole day. A study was started, and in spite of much opposition from the family circle he goes out in field service regularly and is making good progress. So, in addition to placing magazines, we should be alert to extend an invitation to the interested stranger to come along and attend our meetings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The expansion of the work in the territory has roused some religious leaders who have been fairly dormant until now to open hostility, and they have circulated pamphlets containing some old and some new misstatements regarding our work, signed by the clergy of five churches. Business people who exhibited posters advertising the public meeting were threatened with boycott if they did not immediately remove them, and vandals were instigated to tear down banners under cover of darkness. All this has aided some meek persons to see and appreciate the issue more clearly and to quicken in them a greater desire to increase their knowledge and understanding of the Bible.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Going from tribal polygamy to Christian marriage is not an easy matter, but it can be done when those who wish to conform to Jehovah’s righteous requirements take the necessary steps. One government official thought it was impossible, but when the matter was referred to headquarters the reply came back, “If it is Jehovah’s witnesses, put the arrangement through.” Now the former polygamist lives with his first wife and both are dedicated to Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Working the territory in Swaziland, a circuit servant and his wife find it necessary to carry literature in eight languages. Of course, they do not speak eight languages, but it is sometimes possible to overcome language barriers. On one occasion they came to a Portuguese-speaking community. At the second door a young girl who was still attending school came to the door with her mother and, having some knowledge of English, explained to her mother what the visitors were doing and a little about the message. After listening carefully the mother took a book. Before our leaving, the young girl said: “I am coming with you and I am going to speak for you.” She did just that. At the next five houses she explained the message, interpreting for the circuit servant and his wife, and finishing with, “She wants one,” which meant that six bound books were placed that morning with her help.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An induna or councilor of the paramount chief received the district servant and his wife in a kindly manner. He suggested that a talk be given to all the schoolchildren in a nearby school. The children were dismissed from their class and the induna explained the purpose of the visit. A talk was given on “A Paradise Earth” and a copy of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font5"> book was placed with the induna. The induna then instructed the teacher to conduct a study each day with the children, and the district servant demonstrated how this could be done. He also ordered a Bible for the teacher’s use.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The first few months of the service year were very difficult ones for the witnesses of Jehovah in </span><span class="font6">Southern Rhodesia. A wave of political intimidation caused some to become frightened into inactivity. Others lost their first love and their vision of the theocracy and turned back to the old world. However, by far the majority of the brothers remained firm and courageous and continued in the same frame of mind as David, who said: “One thing I have asked from Jehovah— . . . that I may dwell in the house of Jehovah all the days of my life, to behold the pleasantness of Jehovah and to look with appreciation upon his temple.” (Ps. 27:4) The Kingdom Ministry School helped many of the overseers during the year to appreciate their responsibilities and the care they must give to the “other sheep.” Here are some of the experiences sent in by the branch servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Throughout the year efforts were made to build up the pioneer ranks, with the result that seventy-seven new regular pioneers and 256 vacation pioneers were enrolled from January to the end of the year. Much encouragement was given by the expressions of those who have been pioneering for years. One sister, a pioneer for five years, wrote to the Society, “I would like to have my feelings on pioneering conveyed to others as an encouragement. When I started pioneering in 1957 I was in poor health, but now I am healthy. So I can say pioneering proved to be a remedy in my case. Even childbearing is not a bar to pioneering. I have had three children born since I became a pioneer. The youngest is just three months.” From this it is evident that mothers, too, can pioneer if given the right encouragement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Appreciation for the truth and for association grows as one progresses with the truth. A district servant wrote in an experience involving a brother who missed a circuit assembly near his home because of severe illness. Not to miss out on the spiritual benefits of the assembly, he decided to go to the one in a nearby circuit. This he did despite the fact that he had to cycle for three days, sleeping alongside the road. The distance was approximately two hundred miles. How old was this brother? Seventy-five years of age!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Not always is it necessary to be long in the truth to show appreciation. A district servant relates an experience from a territory known as “the highlands of Rhodesia,” where towering mountain peaks reach heights of over 8,000 feet. A group of six isolated publishers attended the circuit assembly there, one of them being baptized and the other five wanting to be. The district servant in talking to them learned the story of their coming in contact with the truth. This is his account:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“One of Jehovah’s witnesses contacted these five people on a new tea estate. He started studying </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">‘This Good News of the Kingdom’</span><span class="font5"> with them. Then this brother became inactive and quit studying with these goodwill persons. Later another brother moved to the area. He rejoiced to find that all five had continued the study in the booklet on their own. He took over the study and soon had them in the service with him. At the assembly all five were baptized. Just before the public talk the brother who accompanied them approached me to say that they would have to leave right after the talk as they had to walk home in order to be at work the next morning. Later, I found out that the distance they walked that night was </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">fifty-three miles,</span><span class="font5"> not on a well-trodden roadway but through valleys, over mountain passes and through treacherous rivers. Imagine walking a total of 106 miles out of appreciation for the truth and to be baptized! And one of them was a woman with a baby on her back.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The general attitude of authorities is that of appreciation that Jehovah’s witnesses are not troublemakers but live peacefully. A sister working for one of the large municipalities tells us of a very interesting conversation she had with one of her senior officials. As they were talking about unrest caused by certain religious sects, she asked how he found the Africans who were Jehovah’s witnesses. He replied, “They never give us any trouble at all. In fact, on the whole they are a jolly, fine crowd.” What a fine testimony from those on the outside!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Readers will remember that the 1960 </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font5"> carried an account of how a publisher in Southern Rhodesia had the privilege of sowing seeds of truth by letter among the inhabitants of the island of Tristan da Cunha. Since then correspondence has been kept up with some of these islanders. Not so long ago this island sprang into the news when it had to be evacuated because of volcanic eruptions. The evacuees were taken to England. The British branch was asked to have someone contact them. This was done, with the thrilling news that back-calls were being made and more literature placed. Now we are happy to know that some of them are going back to their tiny island with a greater understanding of the truth and with more Bible literature to keep their interest sharp. We await further word as to the progress made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">SPAIN' &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 29,960,000</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">It takes real courage and faith to continue preaching the good news of the Kingdom in Spain, but Jehovah’s witnesses there rejoice to do so and have reached many more thousands of people with the good news. The spreading of the good news was accomplished, not only through the efforts of our faithful brothers, but also with good results by sending the two issues of the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font6"> magazine containing the articles “Totalitarian Inquisition Revived in Spain” and “Spain Suppresses Religious Freedom” to government and local officials and lawyers. The message of truth contained in these two issues of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font6"> reached persons in high positions in Spain. However, the Roman Catholic Church and the government have not heeded the protests they received from all over the world, so the persecution of Jehovah’s witnesses continues without letup. The government officials do not realize that this work that Jehovah’s witnesses are doing is not of men, but is of God. Therefore, it will not stop despite unrelenting efforts to silence it. Good experiences have been enjoyed by our brothers in Spain and here are some of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> article “Spain Suppresses Religious Freedom” mention was made of the arrest and fining of a brother in the province of La Corufia. His wife and brother-in-law were also fined. In the appeal that was made through a lawyer to the provincial governor it was pointed out that these three persons were in no way a danger to the “Fatherland,” for they only read the Bible at home and were of very humble origin. However, their appeal was denied by the governor. So the next step was to appeal to Spain’s Ministry of Government in Madrid. This higher appeal was also denied. Note the following in the denial by the Ministry of Government as to the baseless and unsubstantiated way in which they present the “facts” to prove proselytism, which, by the way, is not listed as a misdemeanor by any Spanish law. No proof of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">commission </span><span class="font5">of proselytism was presented. In paragraph three of the document, referring to the personal literature and magazines confiscated during the search of their home, it is stated that they </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“would be destined</span><span class="font5"> to be distributed for proselyting ends, since the mentioned couple belonged in the capacity of ‘pioneers.’ ” The latter part of the statement about being pioneers is false also. The police in searching them apparently found some addresses scribbled on scraps of paper, so paragraph six declares this as a proof of proselytism and states: “Some addresses of persons were found on them </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">which they without a doubt visited</span><span class="font5"> in their work of captivating.” This same paragraph admits that proselytism would be impossible at the place where they live (a tiny village of only a few homes), but charged that they traveled weekly to the provincial capital, thirty-six kilometers away, to preach. Their appeal is now pending before the Spanish Supreme Court.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We also received much publicity through the newspapers and magazines, though most of the things written were unfavorable. Even so, the publicity has served to arouse the people’s interest and curiosity. Instead of following the advice of the apostle Peter in 1 Peter 3:15 to be “always ready to make a defense before everyone that demands of you a reason for the hope in you, but doing so together with a mild temper and deep respect,” the newspaper </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">El Diario Vasco</span><span class="font5"> of San Sebastian in its issue of March 30, 1962, stated in an editorial under the heading “Timely Door Slamming”: “It is not that we are going to admit as a principle the slamming of the door to those that call correctly at our houses, no, but on this occasion, yes, we have to make an exception and applaud and encourage with enthusiasm these door slammings, loud and impressive, one and a thousand times before the presence of elements of both sexes, that knock softly at the doors of our homes to converse with our families about religious themes. We refer to Jehovah’s witnesses.” The article then went on to warn its readers not to admit “dialogue in their homes with those who, house to house, individual to individual, try to carry you off from the bosom of the Catholic Church in order to encase you in some absurd theories, but destroy all the propaganda they offer with a generosity and humility that is very strange.” This attitude is obviously very different from the apostolic one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Even though the increase in publishers was not as great as in former years, we have much to rejoice about. The individual activity of the brothers improved to the extent that the average monthly hours dedicated to field service rose to almost twelve and an average of more than six back-calls was attained. An average of one Bible study per publisher was maintained throughout the year and many new persons symbolized their dedication by water baptism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The following experience shows how a tiny spark of interest did not become extinguished, even after more than twenty years. The publisher writes: “A few weeks ago I made a back-call on a lady in the market who had previously talked to a lady who sold eggs. This egg vendor showed such great interest in us that she gave her address to the lady so that she could pass it on to me when I saw her. I visited the egg vendor within a few days. I spoke to her of the necessity of Christ’s kingdom. Then she said to me: ‘Wait! Since you are speaking of the government of Christ, I have here a book that I found thirty years ago in a heap of used paper that was sold to me. I have been going over it and talking about it for a long time.’ She went and brought me the book entitled ‘Government.’ I looked at it surprised, for it was one of Brother Rutherford’s books and it had the address of the branch from before the civil war in Spain. She had been looking for the truth since then among the Evangelicals, Spiritualists and other sects but did not find satisfactory answers to her questions. Now she is studying with us and recently attended a little gathering of our congregation.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It certainly is a joy to serve in this country where the field is so ripe for harvesting and the blessings are many.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 81 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 11,667</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Good progress was made in the work during the year despite strong opposition on the part of the clergy and the authorities. The brothers are determined to carry on in their work in obedience to Jehovah even though men try to stop them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> article “Totalitarian Inquisition Revived in Spain” the invasion of a brother’s home by the police was reported on. More than a year later and several months after the trial (reported on in the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> article “Spain Suppresses Religious Freedom”), the brother was again called in to the police station for questioning. The police invited him to leave the island as they said that sooner or later they would arrest him again and send him to prison. The brother answered that the Spanish Bill of Rights permitted him to speak freely, but the police retorted that, yes, he could speak freely, but only with his wife. Then they told him to go to Africa because “here we have a religion of many centuries.” The brother replied that Hindus would think the same of Catholic missionaries but that would be no reason for Catholic missionaries to leave. The police went on to say that they should treat Jehovah’s witnesses badly because of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> that was circulated all over the world, and they began to read him the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> article on “Totalitarian Inquisition Revived in Spain.” They claimed that the facts reported on in the article were false and gave as an example the case of the baby that was without food all night long in the prison, together with the repeated requests that the mother and baby be allowed to leave. The brother calmly and courageously replied: “I am the father, and it is true that I entreated you (pointing to one of the three police officers present) several times to release my daughter but it wasn’t done at least until five o’clock in the morning.” Another officer then stated that people all over the world would believe that the police in Spain are oppressive. So it seems they are more concerned about what the people think than what God thinks about them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">SURINAM &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;275,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 422 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 652</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The witnesses of Jehovah in Surinam had another very joyful year of praising God’s name. This past year they were able to work their isolated territory more extensively due to good planning on the part of the organization locally. Even river territory was worked by boat so as to reach as many as possible with the Kingdom message. First, some brothers were sent out to look over the territory to see how it could be worked. They noted how many homes there were and the distances between homes, and how many publishers could be kept busy at each place along the way. They also looked for places in which to hold public meetings and the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> study. By doing this, all in the congregation in some localities were able to share </span><span class="font5">in this work in isolated locations. One congregation of ninety publishers had sixty-eight participating in this special work on Sunday. Working isolated territory offers a splendid opportunity to invite persons of goodwill to come along in the preaching work to see how it is done. Here are a few experiences from the branch servant on the activity there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font5"> the suggestion was given to exchange food for literature when people do not have money. That this can be done successfully was proved by two special pioneers in the District of Saramacca. One Saturday when working with the circuit servant they placed more than fifty magazines within two hours. Instead of their returning home with empty briefcases, the cases were full of rice, oranges, eggs, and so forth, exchanged for the magazines. Have you tried this method?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Children can be efficient praisers of Jehovah too! A young publisher eight years old worked from house to house and placed a </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font5"> book. He also offered to study the book with the two little sons. The study has been progressing for more than six months now, and the parents also are enjoying the study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When children do come along in the preaching work, they should be given something to do, even though it may be the handing out of handbills, the reading of a text or commenting on a text. A brother was assigned to work with two little children, ages seven and nine, one Sunday morning, but he did not give them any opportunity to talk. At 11 a.m. he said they could go home now because he had to make some back-calls. When he left, the two little girls decided that they had not done any preaching yet, so they went to two more doors all alone. They both were able to place magazines and went home satisfied.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is amazing to see how young persons with a love for the truth can make right decisions in order to dedicate themselves to Jehovah. A student at the university of Utrecht, in the Netherlands, returned to his home country on vacation while a Bible study was being conducted with his mother. At first he did not seem to have any interest in the truth. Personal attention was given him, and after one conversation with a missionary he made his decision to study the truth. He finished reading the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font5"> book in one week, read all the copies of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> he could find, and attended a circuit assembly the next week. Several times a week studies were conducted with him. He made a decision not to go back to the university, as he studied sociology, which denies the creation account of Genesis. He believed it would be unwise to subject himself to higher criticism, as most of his professors rejected the Bible. Although his father was very much opposed, he persevered and was baptized two months later. His mother was baptized at the end of the service year, and he is now a vacation pioneer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">SWEDEN &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;7,542,459</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 9,388 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 803</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is always a joy to go through the experiences for the year, says the branch servant, and to send some to the Society. Sweden has enjoyed many fine experiences in doing Jehovah’s will during the past twelve months and they show how wonderfully Jehovah God is using his humble servants here on the earth to sound his praise, or, as the apostle expressed it, ‘to overturn reasonings and every lofty thing raised up against the knowledge of God.’ Jehovah’s witnesses in Sweden enjoyed another increase in publishers and in hours, giving the best witness yet to the people of the land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Persistent searching brings rewards, according to a publisher who had gone to a house many times but met nobody. One Sunday, when working in the neighborhood, he tried four times, and the last time met an elderly man who knew somewhat of the truth from when he lived in Canada. He came to the public meeting and a study was started. Next Sunday he came to the meeting for field service and has been regular in service and at meetings ever since. The first time at the meeting for field service he said: “I see that it is now high time to look for the ‘sheep’ and I want to help in doing that as much as I can.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">How a lost purse may lead to a placement was told by a pioneer sister. When calling back for a Bible study with a subscriber, she was greeted with these words: “I want to thank you heartily for the subscription slip.” “How is that?” “Why, one day a policeman came and asked if I had missed something. I answered that I did not know as I was just back from shopping. ‘Do you subscribe for the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> magazine?’ he asked. ‘Yes, I do.’ ‘Well, I found a purse outside here and in it was</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">this slip, so I knew where to look for the owner of it.’ Just think of it! If I hadn’t had the slip in my purse I would never have gotten it back.” The sister then said that she had just thought of suggesting that she subscribe for our other magazine, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font5"> to which the lady answered: “Yes, I will take it for a year and will be very glad to carry that receipt slip in my purse also.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We were grateful for the privilege of having a share in distributing the facts about religious persecution in .Spain. Several reports tell how people who first refused the magazines changed their attitude when the Witness pointed to the article on Spain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Speaking of Spain, it is good to report that a good number of publications are placed in the course of time with sailors from countries where darkness rules. One day a pioneer sister placed all she had along, fourteen copies of the Spanish </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font5"> book, among the sixteen Spaniards on board a Swedish ship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Sometimes preachers from other religious groups unintentionally help spread the truth, even in a literal way. In one town the brothers in street work noticed a State Church priest selling donated books at a Lion’s Club outdoor fair. Among the books were several of the Society’s publications, from </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Harp of God</span><span class="font5"> onward. It was not long before all the books were gone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A retired preacher came in contact with the truth in this way: He had been a Presbyterian preacher in America for thirty years, but had seen that some of their doctrines were unbiblical. After his return to the old country he came to live in an Old People’s Home (he is eighty-three), and there he found some of our books in the boiler room. Some leaves were missing, but he could read enough to see it was the truth, and when brothers called he identified himself as “belonging to our faith” and asked that a testimony be given at his funeral, but first of all he wanted to be baptized and to have a share in witnessing, although he is very deaf.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">SWITZERLAND &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 5,560,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 5,402 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 1,029</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A busy year of theocratic activity was enjoyed by the Kingdom publishers in Switzerland. The Society operates a very fine printing establishment in Berne, where they print magazines in the French, Hungarian and Croatian languages. Recently some changes were made on the press they have. Whereas they used to print a 16-page magazine, they are now able to turn out a 32-page magazine like the English editions of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font6"> This has been very much appreciated by all who subscribe for the Society’s publications that are mailed out of Berne. There are forty-six members of the Bethel family in Berne, and they delight in providing booklets and magazines for their brothers in other parts of the world. Examining the report for Switzerland this year, we find that they have spent more time preaching the good news of the Kingdom than during any other year in the history of the work in that land. This is good, and they have had some fine results. The branch servant gives us some accounts of the work in Switzerland and in Liechtenstein.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The following experience shows the fruitfulness of speaking about the truth when brothers come together in public places. The circuit servant and his wife could not share a meal one day with a family as arranged, owing to sickness, so they were shown to a pension where a special pioneer and an interested person often ate. So the four of them were seated at a table and enjoyed an interesting discussion on Bible questions. Not far from them sat an elderly man with a long gray-white beard who obviously had been listening to parts of their conversation. This man got up and on leaving the dining room laid a calendar slip with a Bible text on the brothers’ table and remarked that the people in that town were not bad but one must exercise much patience and love in their behalf.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The next day an interesting discussion ensued between the interested person, the special pioneer and this elderly man while they partook of their midday meal. This man showed real interest in the truth and accepted the invitation to attend the Memorial service. After this first visit with Jehovah’s witnesses he did not miss a meeting. The special pioneer began a Bible study with him and three weeks later, on the occasion of the circuit assembly, he accompanied the brother into the field service. He felt really at home with the New World society and said he had been looking for such people all his life. He continued to make progress and, as the district assembly drew nearer, he expressed the desire to be baptized. The pioneer brother now explained the seriousness of baptism and that one ‘must put away the old personality’; whereupon the interested man promptly appeared the next day freshly shaved and without his beard! He also gave up smoking and was immersed. When the circuit servant visited this congregation again after an interval of hardly five months, he was very touched to listen to the comment on the daily text by this new brother at the service meeting. Does not this experience show too how good it is for interested people to be brought into association with the congregation as early as possible?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Is it better not to visit people again who have sent us away the first time? The following experience of a young publisher shows that it pays to call again and to keep good house-to-house notes. In her territory she came to a woman who spontaneously replied: “Do you come from Jehovah’s witnesses? I am Catholic and I don’t want anything to do with these people, and you need not bother to call upon me anymore!” When the sister worked through the territory the second time she politely called upon this woman again. The lady immediately recognized the young publisher and said: “You were here once before and I told you then that I am Catholic.” Tactfully the sister explained to her why Jehovah’s witnesses always call on the people again, and finally this Catholic lady took both magazines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A little later the sister made the back-call. The lady received her kindly and invited her to enter. She had many Bible questions and asked the sister to visit her one evening. The young publisher took a Catholic translation of the Bible with her and the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font5"> book. Although this sincere woman had grown up in a Catholic vicarage, she had never seen such a Bible. Naturally, she wanted to have a Bible too to use in the training of her three children. This she received and a study was started. After a few studies she asked the publisher: “Can I come to the meeting with you sometime?” Of course, she was only too welcome! The meeting made a great impression upon this Catholic woman; she found everything so natural and not a bit pompous. Later on she remarked to the publisher that it did not seem enough to go to the meeting only once a week and asked whether she might not also attend the congregation book study! From that time on she attended all meetings and made good progress in the truth. Unfortunately, she then had to move away from that place, but she continues to study and hopes to become a good witness of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">LIECHTENSTEIN &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14,757</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">There are now a few publishers of the good news of the Kingdom in this small land adjoining Switzerland. The brothers are making progress there in the truth. A bridgehead for the truth has been established by starting a regular </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> study in one town. As that land is very Catholic and the church exercises much authority there, the publishers usually go from house to house only with the Bible. Generally speaking, the people like to listen to the truth when the publishers call, but in view of the great pressure brought to bear by the Catholic church, it requires much time and patience to make disciples in this country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">TAIWAN &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 11,000,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 2,271 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 4,844</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The yeartext for 1962 was certainly most appropriate for the brothers in Taiwan as well as throughout the world. They needed to have courage and they certainly had to hope in Jehovah. They needed to look to their God for guidance and strength because every one of the brothers in Taiwan was beset with a trying problem having to do with cleaning up the organization and getting rid of creature worship. It is amazing what one man can do to destroy an organization that has been teaching the truth. When people go in for creature worship and then the creature goes wrong he may take away many from following the Word of God, and, of course, that will mean destruction for them by God. There has been a marked decrease in the number of publishers in Taiwan, and many of the brothers had a real battle for their lives. Those who endure to the end are the ones who will be saved. But let the branch servant tell us briefly what happened.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Early in the service year it came to light that one of the circuit servants who had been prominently associated with the work for a number of years, and who was the chief director of the International Bible Students Association of Taiwan, which is the organization under which the work is legally registered here, was found to be immorally entangled with two special pioneer sisters. Although he had been carrying on this practice for a number of years, he had used his position as chief director of the Taiwanese organization to intimidate the brothers of the Ami tribe and to make them believe that it would be useless, in fact detrimental to them personally, to try to report the matter. In this way he had succeeded in keeping this knowledge from the branch office. However, when the congregation servants and special pioneers attended the Kingdom Ministry School and learned of the importance of keeping the organization clean, threats of retaliation could no longer keep such promiscuous acts hidden. Consequently, this adulterer was expelled from Jehovah’s organization. Because of his previous capacity of overseer and also his directorship, all congregations that had been associated with him now had to be notified for their own protection. Enraged at being put out, this person vowed to destroy the organization in Taiwan, claiming that he himself was its founder. Two of the Society’s representatives at the branch who had served on the disfellowshiping committee were taken to court on charges of slander and libel. The case was heard in the Taipei District Criminal Court, and it took about three months for the judge to reach a verdict. A number of brothers were called as witnesses, and this adulterer was exposed before the judge. The decision of the judge reads, in part, as follows: “It is also noted in the manual </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Preaching and Teaching in Peace and Unity,</span><span class="font5"> paragraph 123, that when the committee finds anyone guilty and therefore disfellowships him, they should make a resolution for the use of the congregations. Since this person was not able to measure up to the standards of a Christian, the defendants . . . were justified in notifying the congregations in accordance with regulations. Moreover, paragraph 124 of the same manual regulates that all members of the congregations should not communicate with or call on a dis-fellowshiped person. With this regulation in mind, the defendants were obliged to notify all congregations to keep the plaintiff from making further calls and preaching. Therefore, no one can charge that the defendants were not acting in the best interests of the organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“In summary, the conduct of the defendants was well justified by their religion and in accordance with ... the Criminal Law Code . . . [and] are adjudged to be not guilty thereby.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An effort is being made to reach out into the more isolated districts where previously there has not been much preaching done. One circuit servant tells of an experience had while searching for the “other sheep” in these localities: “It was decided that during the visit a group of us would spend three days working the small villages scattered among the mountains. On Wednesday morning a group of twelve brothers set out, briefcases in hand, for three days of witnessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“After six hours of walking we reached the first village to be witnessed to, and this was accomplished by the group in a little over two hours. A few persons of goodwill were found, and one man was so pleased with the message that he offered to let us use his house to prepare our food and said that we should spend the night there as well. This we were happy to do, with most of the brothers sleeping outside on bamboo mats on the ground, as the house was too small. We had taken along a three-day supply of rice, which we supplemented by picking various kinds of edible fungi from the woods, while meat was provided by catching small green frogs and snails, which are commonly eaten by the inhabitants of the district.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The three days followed the same pattern, a long walk and then two or three hours of witnessing, until we at last reached the one remaining village in the territory. In this village we found that a large percentage of the people were interested in the message. After we finished calling on all the homes, we decided to hold a public talk the morning of the following day before heading back home. We were happy to see that thirty-five villagers had gathered around to hear a discussion of material from the booklet </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">‘This Good News of the Kingdom.’</span><span class="font5"> A lively question-and-answer session followed for another hour. A number took literature, and arrangements were made for the brothers to come back later to give them further help.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">THAILAND &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 26,000,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 365 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 71,233</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In southeast Asia are four countries where some of Jehovah’s witnesses are found, and they are diligently striving to carry the good news of the Kingdom to the people of these lands. In the countries of Thailand, Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam Jehovah’s witnesses can say along with the apostle: “For a certainty I perceive that God is not partial, but in every nation the man that fears him and works righteousness is acceptable to him.” (Acts 10:34, 35) Peter must have found this true in his travels even as Jehovah’s witnesses find it true today in all parts of the earth. While there are not many publishers, still those who are there are having very pleasant experiences and the branch servant reports some from each country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A missionary tells the following: One morning a Japanese Buddhist lady was contacted by a publisher in house-to-house work. Because her husband was Christian she accepted the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font5"> book to aid her in understanding Christianity. The publisher could not make the back-call so asked another publisher to visit her. This publisher started a study but since she had too many studies to conduct herself, the call was turned over to me. When I called she was still questioning the authenticity of the Bible. After my giving many proofs from archaeology, geology and fulfilled prophecy, her faith in the Bible began to grow. She asked for a Japanese Bible so she could understand better. After two studies using the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“Good News”</span><span class="font5"> booklet I invited her and her husband to attend the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> study. They came and have continued to come, enjoying the spiritual food from </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font5"> Many times she has expressed her amazement about the difference between Jehovah’s witnesses and other so-called Christian religions, and how we stand together worldwide as united worshipers. If we continue to be concerned about the welfare of those interested in the truth and make sure someone takes care of goodwill persons if we are unable to do so, more “sheep” will respond to the message.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Heavy rain did not dampen the zeal of a special pioneer in Thonburi who made the best of it by going from shop to shop. A tailor told her that he had no time for her since he was pressed for time to finish a suit for a customer who was waiting. When the sister promised to take only two minutes of his time, he agreed to listen. The sister used a one-scripture sermon and offered a set of booklets. He took them willingly and said he had been interested in that subject for a long time but never had time. The sister mentioned that she is helping many to understand the literature they have taken by visiting them one hour a week at any time convenient and she would be glad to help him too. He was very pleased but objected that with a business like his where the customers come at all times he could not make any arrangement. The sister probed for a time of the day when no customers come to the shop, and they finally agreed to study at six o’clock in the morning. When the day arrived he was waiting, reading the booklet. After a half-hour study the sister wanted to stop, since it was the first time, but he insisted to get the full hour as she had promised. After five studies he said that all the questions he used to have on his mind are answered and from now on he will just pay attention and learn in order to be able to explain the truth to others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The big event of the service year was the construction and dedication of a beautiful branch-missionary home in Bangkok. A hundred and sixty-one brothers and persons of goodwill assembled in the spacious Kingdom Hall on the second floor for the dedication program on a Saturday night, and the following morning five persons symbolized their dedication by immersion right on the premises. Since then the Bangkok congregation has been divided into two units, which has resulted in better meeting attendance and better individual assistance to the brothers. We are very grateful to Jehovah and to our brothers who by their generosity have provided us here in Thailand with this fine building to be used in carrying out the divine will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">CAMBODIA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 5,750,000</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">During the past service year we have had much for which to thank our heavenly Father. The visit of our zone servant was most stimulating. This was followed by our first circuit assembly ever to be held, with thirty-three in attendance; then the joy of receiving the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“Good News”</span><span class="font5"> booklet in Cambodian.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Regular study and regular attendance at meetings equip us with a clear vision of how to live theocratic lives and make firm decisions, as the following experience shows. A young man who had been studying for some time with one of the missionaries really drank in the waters of truth and came to have great love and appreciation for Jehovah and his people. It was not long before he was attending the meetings and participating in the ministry school. What he learned at the meetings he soon put into practice by becoming </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">a </span><span class="font5">publisher. Then a grave decision had to be made. Would he get engaged to his pretty, childhood sweetheart, who, incidentally, was a Catholic schoolteacher? Like many others, he thought he would be able to get engaged and bring his fiancee along into the truth. However, it was not long before he realized that his fiancee was doing all she could to prevent him from attending meetings. His service stopped completely and he found himself pursuing worldly materialism in order to please his fiancee. Then one evening several months later he came to the missionary home looking a little sad, yet relieved. “I have broken off my engagement,” he said. ‘‘My fiancee will never leave her church or materialistic pursuits. I want to continue my study and come along to the meetings again. This is where I belong.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">LAOS &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 3,000,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 11 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 272,727</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In this “Land of a Million Elephants” over the past year we have seen the elephantine powers of the “King of the North” and the “King of the South” vying for control. All here are grateful to Jehovah that the “civil” war has ended and that we have been able to continue in our assignments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The people of Laos are deeply entrenched in Buddhism, but they are often humble. One of the missionary sisters while doing door-to-door work met the wife of a Lao colonel who reads only Lao. The only Bible literature available in that language is the Lao Bible itself. She had never seen a Bible, but after a short explanation she asked if she too could have one. She also wanted a </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font5"> book in the related Siamese language for her family to read to her. The sister called back and began a study immediately, using her English </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“Look!”</span><span class="font5"> booklet as a subject and scripture guide and helping this little lady to find all the scriptures in her Lao Bible. An important question to her was, “What must we do to gain ‘boon’?” that is, merit. To answer, the sister used the last chapter in the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font5"> book, “What You Must Do Now to Regain Paradise.” Since then this woman has begun witnessing to any army officers and friends that come to her house and she has begun to take meeting attendance seriously. Now she no longer attends the Wat (Buddhist temple) or any religious festivals once so dear to her. Surely the Bible in any language overturns deeply entrenched things.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A short time ago a Bible study was started with the overseer of some humble people. This man was well versed in the Scriptures, but like Apollos of old he was happy to have the way of Jehovah expounded to him more correctly. Within a short time he had grasped many of the essential points of the truth. As the study progressed he remarked, “I have been studying the Bible for many years, yet my society has never told me about the ‘little flock’ or ‘other sheep’ or the ‘new earth,’ and yet these things are clearly taught in the Bible. Now your Society has shown me the truth at last.” Before long he was teaching these truths from the pulpit of his church, so that others in the congregation could find out about the paradise earth and the heavenly government. One by one as each new point of truth was revealed, pagan falsehoods were dropped. Christmas, which he had always felt uneasy about celebrating since he could find no command to celebrate it in the Scriptures, was quickly discarded as also were the doctrines of hellfire and the trinity. Finally, as the seeds of truth took deeper root, he made up a schedule of study in order to invite each one of his fellow overseers to his house and teach them the truth, so that they in turn could personally assist each member of the congregation with a Bible study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">VIETNAM &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 14,000,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 13 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: 1 to 1,076,923</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">While calling on not-at-homes one afternoon a missionary sister was invited into the house by a young Buddhist boy of seventeen who possessed a Bible. After reading several scriptures about the new world, the boy inquired whether her Bible was similar to his, since he had never seen those scriptures in his own copy. She assured him that it was, and a Bible study was started.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Regular attendance at all meetings plus the weekly personal study was something the boy never neglected despite beatings from his stepmother and opposition from his father. After one year of study he began to engage in the preaching work and with this the opposition of his parents became even greater. The climax was reached at the beginning of the “Tet,” the Vietnamese New Year, when the parents insisted that their son bow before the ancestral altar. They argued that since he was the eldest son in the family it would be his duty and moral obligation to carry on the ancestor worship. The boy refrained from bowing to his dead ancestors and said, “My grandfather is dead and knows nothing. He can neither help me nor hurt me.” Moreover, he opened his Bible to prove his point. The very next month this young boy symbolized his dedication to do Jehovah’s will, being baptized at our first circuit assembly in Saigon. He took advantage of his school vacation by enrolling as a vacation pioneer for a month. He continues to make good progress in the truth.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">No matter where Jehovah’s witnesses are, this is a time to be working hard and to be exerting ourselves, “because we have rested our hope on a living God, who is a Savior of all sorts of men, especially of faithful ones.” (1 Tim. 4:10) And so throughout the islands of the Caribbean that are under the direction of the branch in Trinidad Jehovah’s witnesses are exerting themselves and are doing everything possible to aid the “other sheep” to take the proper course of action to be saved. As long as Jehovah gives us time before the battle of Armageddon to preach the good news, Jehovah’s witnesses will walk in integrity and aid others to gain a knowledge of Christ. The branch servant in Trinidad gives us reports on this island as well as Barbados, Bequia, Carriacou, Grenada, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and Tobago.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One young man wrote: “Seven years ago when I enrolled in the pioneer service it was difficult to conceive that the privilege of circuit work would in time fall to my lot. This privilege in itself has been my outstanding experience for the past service year and, in fact, it is concrete evidence that youthful ones who conscientiously respond to the Society’s encouragement to make the full-time service their career would begin seeing the fruits of their labour even this side of Armageddon.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A sister living in the town where the last circuit assembly was held used a little strategy to implement a suggestion with her opposing husband. “I always had difficulty going out in the service,” she said, “especially on Sundays. My husband always opposed me, saying I should remain at home with him on that day. The Society put on a demonstration at the circuit assembly and I was assigned the part that fitted me completely: Sister Fearful. I managed to get my husband to attend to see me perform my part. That same night we had a nice talk during which I suggested we do just as the Society recommends: two Sundays you will have and two Sundays I will have for service. Now, thanks to Jehovah, I am free to go out with the group that meets at my home.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Often those better equipped to conduct studies neglect doing so because of indifference. One special pioneer who had difficulty learning to read and write did not let his lack of ability prevent him from seeing his responsibility. Working an isolated village one day a week, he found so much interest he could not care for it all in one day. If the interest was consolidated into one study it would be difficult to find a suitable place to keep the study. The only place large enough was the village school, which was under the control of a religious minister. One could only ask for permission and be refused, so fearlessly he made application. To his surprise it was granted. The first day of study forty persons attended! Many months later the study still continues, with an average attendance of twenty-five per study. The ages of the students range from three to seventy years. At the last circuit assembly the conductor shyly approached a missionary and said in agitated tones, “Sister! Sister! I have a problem!” “What is it?” she replied. “I have my persons of goodwill that want to go in service with me.” “That’s fine! What’s your problem?” “Look!” he said, pointing outside, “There are twelve of them and I can’t take them </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font5"> with me.” This brother who can barely read and write is doing excellent work as a special pioneer and sets a fine example for others who could do better with a little more effort.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s witnesses have become renowned for their cleanliness and the care they exercise with rented and borrowed property. Many places, before permitting clubs or organizations to rent their premises, will require a deposit in order to cover any breakage or damage to the building and its contents. In a large rural community there is a fine Community Center for which application was made to hold a circuit assembly. The secretary, after notifying the circuit servant of the approval of the application, gratuitously added a fine compliment, when he said, “In view of your past record our Committee has decided to waive the deposit.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">BARBADOS &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;232,085</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 693 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 335</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At the close of the last service year the Kingdom Ministry School was held in Barbados. During the year a graduate of the school of Gilead at Brooklyn was appointed district servant. When the zone servant visited Barbados in December, plans were discussed that gave impetus to efforts being put forth by all. The circuit servants talked everywhere about April’s 20-percent quota of 638 publishers. During the next four months all irregular publishers were called upon during their visits to the congregations, and overseers were instructed to follow up by subsequent visits. In one congregation more than twenty were thus called upon. The result of this concentrated effort was 693 publishers in April, a 25-percent increase!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">United family worship and service are most beneficial in preserving the identity of this basic unit of the New World society. This was impressed on the minds of the overseers at the Kingdom Ministry School. In serving one congregation a circuit servant noted the fine results of practicing it when an overseer was observed taking his six-year-old son in the magazine work. Speaking his sermons so well, he outplaced his father thirteen magazines to seven that morning, as many accepted them out of sheer appreciation for the parental training and the effort of the lad. There is great need to improve family worship among the publishers, and overseers are encouraged to continue setting a proper example and educate others to its benefits.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Toward the end of the service year was held a splendid Courageous Ministers District Assembly. As usual the assembly opened with a small attendance that kept growing as latecomers trickled in, until 658 were paying rapt attention. As the assembly progressed so did the attendances. For Sunday morning’s discussion of the talk on “‘The Word’—Who Is He?” 772 found their way to the assembly. By the afternoon this number swelled to 1,187. At the public talk a peak attendance of 1,478 was realized, more than double the peak number of publishers for the whole island! What tremendous potential for increase during the coming year!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">BEQUIA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3,000</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">There are no paydays on this island. It is not easy to place literature and magazines and the faint-hearted can easily be discouraged. A married special pioneer couple write to say: “We get a regular supply of eggs, dried fish, corn and peas, which the people are willing to give in place of contributions for literature obtained from us.&quot; Using this method of trading, these specials were able to increase their literature placements by 122 percent and magazine placements by 84 percent this year over last year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A Catholic lady tried to stop one of her neighbors from taking </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtoiver</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> one day when a return visit was being made. The Catholic lady also made a return visit at the same time accompanied by a man and six children. “Come on, now! Let us say the rosary,” she said to her neighbor. At once the team went to work saying the rosary. Was the neighbor impressed with this ritualistic form of prayer? At the conclusion she took a Bible and subscribed for </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> and arranged to attend the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font5">study that same day. She continues to attend meetings and now enjoys a regular home Bible study every week. “I know my sheep and my sheep know me,” is a principle to be borne in mind when working oft-covered territory.—John 10:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">CARRIACOU &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6,766</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Carriacou lies about twenty miles north of Grenada, of which it is a dependency. It has only about thirteen and a half square miles of land area, which rises quite sharply in two places to just under a thousand feet above sea level. The rolling landscape makes it difficult to work both agriculturally and spiritually.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There is a tendency on the part of the adult population to go abroad to seek a living. As a result it is difficult to find capable overseers. A pioneer responded to the call to serve where the need is great and now looks after a scattered isolated group that covers three-quarters of the island.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The triannual visits of the circuit servant and his wife are looked forward to as occasions for all to get together and enjoy spiritual blessings. The circuit servant reports that there are many opportunities to render assistance and help if others would follow the lead of the two full-time servants already on the island.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">GRENADA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;82,034</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Training received at the theocratic ministry school in each congregation is invaluable in equipping ministers, young or old. While working with the circuit servant, one young publisher spoke to a schoolteacher who was trying out a new tape recorder. At the conclusion of the presentation he asked the publisher if he had ever heard his own voice. On receiving a negative answer, he invited him to speak about anything so that he could record it and play it back. Without much ado, the young minister delivered an excellent sermon on “Life in God’s New World.” The schoolteacher was visibly impressed. “You surprised me, young man! You speak so meaningfully and coherently for your age. You will make a good speaker in the future.” Later, to the circuit servant, the young brother admitted that what helped him most was the instruction and training he had received at the theocratic ministry school.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Meeting our quota of subscriptions during a campaign is always a problem in the islands. The wife of the circuit servant explains how she surmounted the problem. “From the beginning of the campaign I resolved to use every available opportunity to introduce the subscription. One such opportunity presented itself in incidental witnessing. While awaiting the assignment of the group for field service one morning I started to offer the magazines to persons passing along the street. As they took the magazines I recommended that they get them regularly by explaining the subscription arrangement. Within thirty minutes two subscriptions for </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> were obtained. During the campaign quite a few of the thirty subscriptions received were through incidental witnessing.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">ST. LUCIA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;86,145</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 76 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 1,133</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The radio program “Things People Are Thinking About” continues to be a valuable means to instruct others concerning God’s will. One person of goodwill with whom a home Bible study is held enquired if it would be wrong to take “a dollar from her employer’s drawer if one day she didn’t have anything to feed her children.” It was explained that that would be stealing from her employer. On the next call she plaintively said, “Because I told you what I did, you told the brothers.” She had heard the program on the radio about “Applying Scriptural Principles in an Ungodly World” and assumed her case had prompted the brothers to speak on the subject. Now she thoroughly understands the principle at Ephesians 4:28 and is determined to follow it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">For his faithfulness in preaching Paul was thrown into prison more often than any other person told about in the Greek Scriptures. No doubt he continued to find hearing ears among his fellow prisoners. In Castries a missionary regularly visits the prison weekly to conduct a Bible study with a group of inmates who look forward to his visits. When the zone servant visited the island last January he also went along and spoke to the “Bible class.” A letter of appreciation for the work of Jehovah’s witnesses was received from one of the group, who wrote as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“For thirteen years as a Baptist, I’ve been reading the Bible like the Ethiopian eunuch, and in time one of Jehovah’s witnesses came to the institution where I am to proclaim the good news. ... I was brought up in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font5"> home under Roman Catholic teachings, and went from there to the first Baptist establishment in St. Lucia. But neither one of these opened up my understanding as did Jehovah’s witnesses. ... I am thankful to Jehovah for sending me his witnesses. ... I was like a spool of thread that had become unwound and hopelessly tangled. I brought my tangled self to Jehovah through Christ Jesus and he loosed the knots and made the twisted thread straight.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">ST. VINCENT &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;77,005</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Perseverance in finding and feeding the “sheep” is important for all Christians. Otherwise, we would become easily discouraged and give up. A family who had always previously received Jehovah’s witnesses favorably when they called got bitterly angry with them following a visit of the minister of their church. Whatever he told them caused them to burn up all the publications they had taken and they forbade any Witness to call at their home under pain of being bitten by a ferocious dog kept in the yard. Nevertheless, a brother courageously called and tried reasoning with the head of the house, but was unsuccessful, or so it seemed. Something must have struck right soil, though, for on a next occasion the brother was received with a barrage of questions and objections, which were overcome one by one. Gradually more calls were made and eventually more literature was placed. A study in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True,”</span><span class="font5"> one of the books the priest had caused them to burn, was ventured. Before the study went very far the publisher was requested to bring five copies each of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font5"> and the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures.</span><span class="font5"> Now the family attends meetings, one has started to publish, and others promise to do so in the near future. Courage and perseverance are a combination that pay off.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">TOBAGO &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">33 333</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 53 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 629</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Tobago lies about twenty-six miles to the northeast of Trinidad and appears to be a continuation of the northern range of Trinidad. Its history is filled with changes, as it has changed hands more often than any other island in the West Indies. Along with Trinidad, of which it is an island ward, it was granted independence from British colonial rule on August 31, 1962. In God’s due time it will feel the full benefits from the Kingdom rule by Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Theocratically there was not much change during the year. A peak of one more publisher was reached this year, but on the average there were two publishers less. Magazine placements continue to be the outstanding feature of the work in Tobago. In fact, the special pioneers there have the highest average of magazine placements per month of all the islands under the branch. At the close of the year there were no regular pioneers working in Tobago, but four special pioneers were carrying on. Tobago offers an excellent field for full-time service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">TURKEY &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 29,000,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 475 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio; 1 to 61,053</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The experiences Jehovah’s witnesses have in searching for the “other sheep” in Turkey are very trying, but despite the difficulties and hardships they go through, there has been a good increase both in the number of people who are now proclaiming the good news of the Kingdom and in their activity. Besides the legal case from the previous year, which has not yet been decided, two new cases have come up during this past service year. On January 21, 1962, two brothers were arrested and held in confinement for one month under the charge of “propaganda for communism under the pretense of religion,” because they were preaching the good news of God’s kingdom. They had to appear before the court on July 16, 1962, and they were acquitted. So with difficulties and trying experiences the good news is preached in Turkey. Here are some experiences sent in by the branch servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Sunday, April 8, 1962, twenty-seven persons, while peacefully assembled in a private home to enjoy Christian association, were arrested in Ankara and hauled off to the police station. They are charged now with “founding a new society, associating with this society, and making propaganda.” Especially since this time the police shadow these brothers closely to discourage them from their good work, even going so far as to insult them, endeavoring to incite violence against them. In spite of all this, the brothers have not lost their courage but hope in Jehovah and continue in their lifesaving work. Three of them even took up fulltime service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">While the publicity about this arrest was mostly unfavorable, the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Ulus</span><span class="font5"> newspaper of Ankara published a fair article about Jehovah’s witnesses. The writer put straight some biased statements of other newspapers and showed that this police action was a violation of the 19th article of the Turkish constitution, which guarantees freedom of conscience and religion in Turkey. After giving some information about Jehovah’s witnesses and stating that they are spread throughout the world, and, except for the countries behind the Iron Curtain, are free everywhere, he states that “if we violate the article of the constitution on freedom of conscience and religion, then, without knowing it, we cause ourselves to slip off to the way of thinking which exists behind the Iron Curtain.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">That courage is needed to continue under such conditions to serve Jehovah is shown by the following experience from Ankara. One day a young sister was waiting at a bus stop when a man from the secret police approached the people there and tried to incite them against her. Pointing at her, he shouted, “They read the Gospel and deceive people to another religion.” When the bus arrived another policeman took the seat behind the sister and repeated the same. But again nobody moved. He continued shouting, “These people read the Gospel and deceive many Turks,” to incite violence against her. The sister did not let herself get provoked but kept silent, so he cried: “Answer! Why don’t you speak? Why did you wicked people come here? You will see what we will do to you.” Now the lady next to the girl lost her patience, jumped up and asked with a loud voice: “Is there no man in the bus to make him silent?” At once all the male passengers got up, had the bus stop, took the shouting man and threw him out of the bus. Many passengers made good comments about the self-control and courage of the sister.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A single copy of the magazine is sometimes enough to stir up interest in the truth. One man found a </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> magazine in Greek in a shop selling used books, and because it was written in his mother tongue he took it. At home he read and reread it many times, comparing its message with his Bible. Since he did not know any of Jehovah’s witnesses but urgently wanted to learn more about the truth, he wrote the Society, whose address he found in the magazine, asking for someone to call on him. How glad he was to receive the visit of our brothers! As a result a Bible study was arranged immediately.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">URUGUAY &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 2,500,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 1,728 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 1,447</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The past service year has been another milestone in the expansion of the theocratic worship of Jehovah’s witnesses in Uruguay. One of the outstanding features of the year was the Kingdom Ministry School that was conducted in the Society’s new branch home. The special training was appreciated by the overseers, and it seems to have reflected itself throughout the field in Uruguay, because they had a 12-percent increase and the greatest number of hours ever spent in the witnessing work in one year’s time. The total hours came to 366,757. The brothers in this land have had a number of interesting experiences, and the branch servant reports on them and also on the Falkland Islands, where there are a few publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Showing the Society’s latest film at congregation book studies has been a great witness. One circuit servant carried the equipment to an outlying village. The home where the film was to be shown did not have electricity, but this did not pose too big a problem. A brother worked all day putting up a wire from the nearest home with electricity. The result? Seventy persons attended where an average of twenty regularly attend the book study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Reaching the magazine quotas has always been a problem in Uruguay. Four missionaries in an interior town found it rather disturbing that it seemed such an impossibility to reach the quota of 150 magazines each month. They received fine suggestions from a circuit assembly program and the zone servant’s visit, so with determination to meet the quota each one diligently put into practice the counsel received. This included working both morning and afternoon in the house-to-house work on Saturdays, working with magazines from 11 to 12 noon when householders are busy getting the noonday meal, and giving special attention to developing magazine routes. As a result of putting these suggestions into practice they are now not only reaching but, some months, far surpassing the quota. It has been found that many of the persons that had been first contacted with the magazines are now publishers, others are advancing well in a weekly Bible study, and the missionaries have found their routes a fertile field for book and subscription placements. Certainly Jehovah blesses those that make a sincere effort to follow his instructions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Patience is necessary to accomplish our ministry thoroughly. A pioneer returned three times to make a back-call but had no success in finding the goodwill person. Two months passed and this man appeared at the local Kingdom Hall, where he obtained a Bible and the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font5"> book. A study was arranged and held for a month, then again the pioneer could not find him at home. Months again passed and one day this person of goodwill returned, explaining that he had been living in the country about twenty miles away. He offered to pay the bus fare and feed the pioneer so that he could continue to study. When the pioneer went to visit him, he found out that the whole community knew about the truth because this man of goodwill had preached to everyone he met. Arrangements were later made so that both he and his wife could come to town once every fifteen days to attend the congregation meetings and participate with the local group in the field service.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">In these sparsely populated South Atlantic islands fear of one’s neighbor prevents many from listening to the truth. One lady contacted by a visiting missionary from Uruguay had been told not to listen to this Witness. Determined to find out why, she invited him into her home. Two days later a back-call was made and a study started with her and her husband in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“This Good News of the Kingdom.”</span><span class="font5"> Not being satisfied with her local church and yet skeptical of the Witnesses, she later stated: “I tried to catch one of Jehovah’s witnesses in a trap with a Bible question that I thought he could not answer, but, much to my surprise, I failed. All my questions were answered logically, and now I am prepared to question my former pastor.” She and her husband have continued to study with one of the local publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">For the first time a radio interview afforded the opportunity to explain the work of Jehovah’s witnesses. It was heard in all the camp stations and homes scattered over these islands, as everybody listens to the radio.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The visiting missionary also made a trip to the largest sheep farm settlement in the islands. Due to the kindness of the farm manager, arrangements were made to use the Town Hall for a public talk. From the twelve families in the area seventeen persons attended.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">The good counsel expressed by James, “Become doers of the word, and not hearers only,” has been well complied with by Jehovah’s witnesses in Venezuela. (Jas. 1:22) They had an excellent increase this past year, a 19-percent gain over the previous year, and 277 new publishers symbolized their dedication by water immersion. The publishers in this country of South America, for the first time, passed the half-million mark in hours devoted to preaching the good news, and this has had a telling effect upon the peoples of the land, who are facing much trouble and distress due to the political situation. Here are a few experiences sent in by the branch servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A missionary from Maracay writes: “I placed a sixmonth </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> subscription with a lady. She was friendly, but as I have not had much success from studies conducted with women, I preferred to start the study with the family group. After delivering the magazine for a few months the lady said her husband liked </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> very much, so I arranged to call when he was home, and a study was started. The second study found four members of the family ready. For the third study all five were prepared and waiting. Soon the crosses came off the walls, then off their necks. There was still a picture of ‘the sacred heart of Jesus’ over the door and I was waiting to see it disappear without my saying anything. Sure enough, one day when I arrived for a study the wife told me that when she came home from shopping there was a bonfire in the yard and that the husband had not left a single image or ‘holy’ picture. All went up in smoke. From the very start, meetings at the Kingdom Hall have seldom been missed by the father and he always brings some if not all the family with him. He is so anxious to learn the truth that he has said it is too bad there are not more meetings to attend. After studying four years to become a priest and never receiving any Bible instruction, he gave it up. He deeply appreciates learning the truth from the Bible with Jehovah’s witnesses. All five are now taking active part in the service and the parents are looking forward to the next circuit assembly to symbolize their dedication to serve Jehovah.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A young Catholic woman suffering since childhood with a heart condition obtained literature and was showing real interest in the truth, but her husband and parents did not want her to study the Bible. They rather sought to improve her health through images, faith healers and spiritism. Finally she and her husband moved to another city, where this lady noticed that her neighbors went out with witnessing bags every Sunday, and, upon inquiring, she received more explanation of the truth. They moved again, but soon Witnesses called and a study was started. She had been trying to convince her husband about the falseness of the trinity, so now he occasionally would listen to parts of the Bible study in the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font5"> book. When she was ready to begin the book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True,”</span><span class="font5"> it was thought better to turn the study over to </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font5"> brother, and this brought prompt results. The brother and his wife went to the study, and soon the couple were both attending meetings, even taking part in the ministry school. They began in the service and the next month were baptized together. He has stopped smoking, and she is in much better health. Both enjoy the house-to-house work and have Bible studies of their own. Nobody who knew her before as a semi-invalid can believe that it is the same person, not that she is well, but for the first time she is happy and hopeful for the future new world, which will be a world without sickness and heart trouble.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">TWELVE OTHER COUNTRIES WHERE JEHOVAH’S WITNESSES WORK UNDER DIFFICULTY</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 102,490 Population: 384,938,610 Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 3,756</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah’s witnesses in all parts of the world know that this good news of the Kingdom must be preached everywhere for a witness to all the nations and then the end will come. They know, too, that Jesus said: “I have other sheep, which are not of this fold; those also I must bring, and they will listen to my voice, and they will become one flock, one shepherd.” (John 10:16) Tens of thousands, yes, hundreds of thousands of these “other sheep” are being gathered into the New World society of Jehovah’s witnesses. This great gathering work is not the work of man, but it is the work of God through his Son, Christ Jesus, for his written Word declares that these things will be accomplished in the last days of this wicked system of things. To preach the good news of the Kingdom is not a difficult task in countries where there is freedom of religion, but behind the Iron Curtain, or under a government having dictatorial rule, the going is hard for a Christian and every effort is made on the part of the rulers, and the religious systems that are trying to please the rulers, to stop the glorious message of the Kingdom from being preached.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This is not an imaginary idea on the part of those living Christian lives. In a book published in Moscow, by the State Publishing of Political Literature, Jehovah’s witnesses are condemned. The book is called “Going by the Name of Jehovah God.” The author of this book says: “The Society of Jehovah’s witnesses is one of the largest reactionary sects of foreign origin. The organizational center of the sect is found in the U.S.A., in the suburb of New York, Brooklyn. Having at its disposal a large propagating apparatus and many material means, the ‘Society’ relentlessly and firmly endeavors to spread its influence among adherents in the U.S.S.R. Because of the extreme reactionary and anti-Sovietic tendencies of the sect’s teachings, its activity in our country is forbidden and the Soviet authorities have not registered the sect.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society cannot help it that the Communists will not register the sect. It is not that Jehovah’s witnesses have not tried to register the organization in Moscow. The government of Russia will not allow, the Christian gospel to be preached, and because Jehovah’s witnesses are doing this they have been fought against at every turn by the Communists. What would you do if you were a Christian? Would you throw your Bible away? Would you listen to the dictatorial rulers of Russia and close your mouth? Or would you follow the words of Christ Jesus, who said: “Go therefore and make disciples of people of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the holy spirit”? A Christian will never close his mouth as long as he lives, because he has an obligation to praise Jehovah’s name and a Christian has real joy in serving God. The book of Nehemiah (8:10) says: “The joy of Jehovah is your stronghold.” So no matter what the U.S.S.R. does, or any other country behind the Iron Curtain, the only way they can stop Jehovah’s witnesses is by murdering them. This, of course, dictators have done throughout the centuries. During the time of the early church, Christians were murdered in the arena by being put on torture stakes. They were murdered by Hitler and his Gestapo in Germany during the second world war. They were put into gas chambers and tortured to death because as Christian witnesses of Jehovah God they would not line up with the doctrine of the dictator. The New York Sunday </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">News </span><span class="font6">of October 21, 1962, shows that the U.S.S.R. is very much disturbed by what Jehovah’s witnesses are doing. The headline reads: “3 Red Films Hit Religion. Moscow, Oct. 20 (UPI).—Russia has released three new atheist films, including one denouncing Jehovah’s Witnesses as ‘connected with the U.S. intelligence service.’ The heroes in two of the films, ‘Confession’ and ‘A Sinner,’ are young tractor drivers. One quits a seminary when he</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">‘realizes how hypocritical, cruel and selfish it is,’ and the other rescues a young collective-farm girl from a marriage arranged by her Protestant parents. The anti-witness film, ‘Armageddon,’ concerns the ‘terrible price’ a girl pays for joining the sect.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Despite their book of 159 pages called “Going by the Name of Jehovah God” and their films, as well as police and organized block spies in all countries behind the Iron Curtain, the Communists have not been able to stop Jehovah’s witnesses from preaching the Word of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">How afraid can one get of the truth? It is the truth that makes one free, said Christ Jesus. A dispatch out of Moscow dated October 11, 1962, reads: “To Convert the Russians, The Word of God in Macaroni, Leaflets and Propaganda of Jehovah’s Witnesses, Moscow 11 Okt. (UP)—According to the Moscow paper </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Trud</span><span class="font6"> religious propaganda of Jehovah’s witnesses is smuggled from America to the Soviet Union. The magazines and leaflets are found in food packages which contain macaroni, raisins and rice according to the headings. The title of the article in the paper was: ‘The Word of God in Macaroni.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jesus said, ‘Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of God,’ so sometimes when good friends in America or in other countries send food packages to their relatives or friends in Russia they send them two kinds of food, the food for the body and the spiritual food that is so essential for everlasting life. But the Communists cannot stand the spiritual food, because they are trying to drive God out of the mind of every person in the world. Of course, killing people takes individuals out of the field of action so they cannot preach anymore. By harassing others and bringing terrific persecution to bear, weak ones will stop preaching the message of the Kingdom. And because true Christians are forced farther underground it is harder to get reports from them from behind the Iron Curtain and in other countries as years pass by. But lovers of righteousness can believe this, that if there is a true Christian anywhere in the world he will be proclaiming the message of God’s kingdom and he will serve Jehovah and be faithful to him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There are twelve countries in the world where preaching is most difficult, but still representatives of the Society are doing the preaching work. It is hard at times to communicate with these countries. Sometime during each year, however, reports do filter through and these reports tell of the faithfulness of our brothers. In the twelve countries that follow we have brief reports of some activity that has been taking place. We are letting Jehovah’s witnesses and the public know what is going on. We are not ashamed to say that due to the great pressure against our brothers it appears that there are fewer workers preaching the good news in these troublesome areas than during the previous year. While it appears this way, it is not necessarily true, because many of the reports from behind the Iron Curtain are incomplete. Today behind the Iron Curtain and in some other countries, where there is great pressure brought to bear upon Jehovah’s witnesses, and where we do not like to reveal just how many there are in each country, there are 102,490 faithful Christians who have been proclaiming the good news of the Kingdom. They have spent 6,621,589 hours doing that preaching and teaching work. That has been enough time to cause a great disturbance to the Communist organization and others and to cause them to fight against Jehovah’s witnesses and to try to stop the good news from being preached.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah’s witnesses are not preaching the Bible to cause trouble or to ask for persecution. No, they have an obligation to their God in heaven to proclaim this message and they prefer to do it peacefully and quietly without disturbance. The governments know that Jehovah’s witnesses are neutral. They are not engaged in politics. They are not engaged in war. They are preaching the kingdom that Christians have prayed for for nineteen hundred years, “Thy kingdom come, thy will be done on earth.” Just because true Christians pray this prayer and preach it, the dictators behind the Iron Curtain are out for the kill, to destroy Jehovah’s witnesses. Throughout other parts of the world Jehovah’s witnesses rejoice in the splendid witness that was given by their faithful brothers in these lands. Our prayers go out for them continually that they may be able to stand firm and be faithful to the end. These Christian brothers and sisters of ours in the twelve countries “are not the sort that shrink back to destruction, but the sort that have faith to the preserving alive of the soul.” They are looking to something better than the U.S.S.R. or any dictator of this world can provide for them, namely, the kingdom of God. To prove for a certainty that these brothers of ours in these difficult countries have worked diligently, it has been reported that 4,220 people in these lands have been baptized during the past year, symbolizing their dedication to Jehovah God. The record shows that the year before there were 4,690 who symbolized their dedication by water baptism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The people of goodwill in these troublesome areas are coming into God’s organization to do his will despite all the pressure that that devilish crowd can bring to bear against God’s witnesses. But let those who are from behind the wails of these dictatorial countries tell their own story, which we are sure you will find very interesting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">ALBANIA</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Communications with the brothers in Albania are very difficult, but it is a pleasure to report that the brothers succeeded in sending information on their field service activities. They were busy each month with their service and attending their meetings. They are doing their best under very difficult circumstances to proclaim the good news of the Kingdom courageously in a Communist land. One brother is serving the four groups as circuit servant as it is possible under the circumstances. The death of one faithful old brother provided an opportunity to give a great witness at the funeral services. There is no indication that any brothers have been arrested during the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">BULGARIA</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Bulgaria is one of the countries behind the Iron Curtain. Although only a small minority of its friendly and hospitable population is communistic, nonetheless the land is under strict Communist rule. This makes it difficult for our brothers there to spread the message of the Kingdom. But there are people of goodwill who long for truth and righteousness, and the isolated groups of brothers scattered over the country make efforts to bring them in touch with the truth. The people are, for the most part, dissatisfied with the churches, which cannot offer them a real message of hope in these difficult times. So there is good ground for the message of the new world to come.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Because the brothers have only very few publications in their language, conversations with the persons of goodwill are mainly held by using just the Bible. But the brothers are willing to work and to learn how to study with the people, although the work has to be done with great caution. As time goes by it is expected that a number of people of goodwill will take their stand for the Kingdom, so that a group of Bulgarians will also be among the great multitude surviving the world’s end, as foretold in Revelation 7:9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">CZECHOSLOVAKIA</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The work in Czechoslovakia has made good progress during the past service year. In this country it can be seen that the clergy do not properly care for the “sheep,” and therefore God has taken away this privilege from them and given it to His people, who take this task seriously. A brother visited a man who works beside him in the same factory and who has several children. In the course of the evening this person said to the brother that it is very difficult nowadays to educate children properly, since they receive no religious instruction in school, and he did not want his children to grow up in such a wild way, but to learn about the existence of God. After a while he continued and said: “Recently I met the pastor of our town. I took the opportunity to invite him to our home in order to teach our children something from the Bible, seeing that nothing good is taught in school about God. But how disappointed I was at his brief reply, to the effect that he really had no time for this. And now since I know that you can teach such wonderful things from the Bible, I sincerely ask you to stay a little longer with us and tell all my children something about this truth.” The brother was deeply moved to see how this father was concerned about the salvation of his children and how anxious he was to hear the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Of course, the brother, seeing the sincerity of this man, joyfully started a Bible study with them all. The next time he came he was surprised to see, not only four, but seven children waiting for him! The reason for this was that the neighbors had heard about his instruction and they felt it would do their children a lot of good to get this same Bible course. As time went on, the parents of these different children felt that it would be even to their own benefit to attend these studies, and in the following weeks a number of Jehovah’s witnesses started Bible studies with different families. There is really a hunger in the land among men of goodwill, but this hunger is not appeased by the clergy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Two publishers found out that two villages had never been visited with the message of the Kingdom. So they decided to bring the truth there. This meant an extraordinary effort, as these places were far away and hard to reach, especially in wintertime. To make back-calls there, the publishers sometimes had to spend as much as ten hours to get there and back again. But this hard work bore fruit. More persons attended the book study each time. After two years three persons were baptized, ten other persons had begun preaching, although not yet immersed, and five other people started to show interest in the truth. This fact became known in the two villages, and when the loudspeaker of the village sounded attacks against Jehovah’s witnesses, even the young lady teacher told her children that Jehovah’s witnesses are not as described over the loudspeaker, and that it is foolish to misrepresent them. Hard work and good conduct has resulted in a remarkable witness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">ERITREA</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The preaching of the good news of God’s kingdom in Eritrea advanced wonderfully during the past service year. It is still being preached in troublesome season. Despite this those who are wholly dedicated to God, including newly associated ones, are pressing on and preaching the good news. As a result many new Bible studies have been started. As the Bible says, the sheep know their master’s voice. The Witnesses in Eritrea are highly respected and well known by their Christian manner of speech and conduct. Here is an experience of one of the Witnesses there:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A young lady on a bus met a person she knew at school. She asked him why he always went home very early in the evening Instead of spending the evening in worldly recreation with the boys of his age. The opportunity was thus afforded to explain that he preferred staying at home to study the Bible rather than carousing in worldly pleasures. After listening to what he said she recognized that he was a Witness. She inquired: “Are you one of the Witnesses?” “How did you know?” he asked. She said that she used to study with one of the ministers. She told him that she recognized him as a Witness by his Christian manner of speech. The discussion continued and arrangements were made to resume the Bible study with this person. Yes, some people recognize us by our Christian manner of speech.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">ETHIOPIA</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A guest speaker, a European teacher, delivered a lecture on the subject “The Faith of Evolutionists” in the school attended by a person of goodwill. While explaining the faith of modern scientists in their ability eventually to create life independently of God, he remarked that, nonetheless, a true religion was necessary for man to gain true happiness. At this point the student asked the speaker which of all the many religions in the world today was the true one that God is using to make men happy. The teacher’s reply was to the effect that only the Witnesses could supply the answer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Perplexed, the student meditated on this and finally decided to search for the Witnesses to learn about the true religion. He asked a student friend where to locate them, but this friend strongly advised him to forget about those people as they would confuse him and cause him only trouble and woe. This did not discourage the person of goodwill, for he reasoned that the teacher’s advice was to be trusted rather than his friend’s advice. So he continued his search. After several days of fruitless search he was directed to a meeting place supposedly used by the Witnesses where the presiding minister was giving a lecture on hellfire and eternal torment. After the service, this person approached the minister and asked if he was one of the Witnesses. The minister questioned him as to why he was looking for “those people,” since they are “the most hated people because of their strange false teaching of the Bible.” (He had been directed to a religious mission.) The pastor referred him to a book opposed to the teachings of the Witnesses, advising him to read it as it would explain ‘the truth about the Witnesses and would thus save him from their evil influence.’ Undiscouraged, the student continued his search.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Shortly thereafter he entered a tearoom and asked a total stranger if he knew one of the Witnesses. To his surprise a person seated nearby was pointed out. Unhesitatingly, he approached the Witness to make known his sincere desire to study the Bible. Now an excellent study is being held, to his complete satisfaction, and he is making fine progress in learning the true religion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">EAST GERMANY</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The beginning of the 1962 service year brought a far-reaching change for the brothers in East Germany. They faced a new situation when the East German Communist government put up a stone wall across the city of Berlin by which they separated their realm from West Berlin. The connecting lines to West Berlin that had been so convenient for many years were suddenly cut off. How were things to continue?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The opposers of the Kingdom work gloatingly asked this same question, and they set themselves to work at once. They tried to infiltrate informers into the ranks of the faithful, posing as brothers that had been sent out by the Society from West Berlin to adapt the organization to the new circumstances. But the brothers did not fall for it and the informers were recognized as such, so the work moved on unharmed by their “assistance.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When the flow of spiritual food again reached the publishers, one brother in his great joy exclaimed: “It feels like new juice is coming through the line again!” These manifest blessings by Jehovah greatly strengthened the publishers. They saw that there are no impenetrable walls for him. Even when men construct a wall to keep his truth out, he just the same opens his windows and pours out his blessings in abundance.—Mal. 3:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An increasing number of publishers have been engaging in the pioneer and vacation pioneer service. They report thrilling experiences, showing that there are many people of goodwill waiting for the message and that it is urgent to keep preaching it. Some of those publishers went into territory where the need is great during their vacation period, to places where the people had never yet heard the comforting message and hardly knew of Jehovah’s witnesses. In one apartment house the publisher was invited into every home and she found so much interest that she was able to call back at every home. Two pioneers at the end of their fourteen days of activity were able to turn over to the local publishers seventy-four addresses of people who had been called on by them for the second time and who wanted more Bible instruction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A publisher giving an incidental witness came in contact with a Catholic woman who invited her to her home. There the publisher met her husband and two grown-up sons. Soon a Bible study was started. The sister showed discretion and took a brother along who was of the same age as the sons of the couple, and the two sons joined the study. A few months later the first fruits showed up. The lady handed her rosary to the publisher and some weeks later her prayer book, suggesting that the publisher may have use for it in explaining the truth to other people. She did not need them any longer. “I shall no longer pray to God these monotonous litanies,” she remarked. Some time later the publisher noticed that the crucifix that had been in one corner of the room was gone too. That was a big step forward for the family toward spiritual maturity. Now they are true worshipers and fellow praisers of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Communists have been trying all they can to break the faith of the publishers. The vicious smear campaign by means of mimeographed letters has continued, with no success, however. No lie is too big for the Communist propagandists to employ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the service year fifty-two new arrests occurred, including four sisters. At the same time seventy-five publishers were released from prison after they had served their sentences. That still leaves 242 publishers in East German prisons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One of them, a member of the former Bethel family in Magdeburg, who was incarcerated when the Bethel home was raided by the Communists in 1950, is still serving a life sentence. He is now over seventy-five years old. A number of others who had life terms too had their sentences commuted for shorter terms of ten to fifteen years. Another publisher, a circuit servant, who served a sentence of twelve years, which he received in 1950, after he had been in Hitler’s concentra-</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">tion camp for many years, recently died in prison a few weeks before he was to be released.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the course of the service year a new problem arose for our young brothers in East Germany, when general compulsory military conscription was introduced. But they have been courageous and steadfast in their decisions. So far thirty-one publishers have been arrested because of refusing military service. Government officials were surprised to see that, despite the twelve years of the ban, such a group of courageous young Christians has grown up. Their initial bewilderment expressed itself in the varying sentences passed. In recent months, however, brothers who refused military service were surprisingly treated more leniently than other individuals who refused military service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As in the days of the apostles, it is not a thing to be feared to suffer for Christ’s sake. A young brother of twenty-one years who served a prison sentence of several years said after his release: “I would not like to have missed the years of my incarceration. I am returning home more thoroughly grounded and convinced of the truth than at the time I was arrested.” Jehovah’s spirit is with his servants, and if they keep asking for it, they will be given all the strength they need to stand and keep their integrity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">HUNGARY</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">By press reports we have become known far and wide. Jehovah’s witnesses have been discussed over the radio, on television, in magazines and, in an effort to counteract our activity, a film was even shown in different parts of the country, the purpose of which was to ridicule our work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s witnesses also maintain their strict neutrality in Hungary. Because they do not serve in the army, they are severely punished. But their stand results in a witness. A young brother, engaged to a sister in the truth, was called into the army. He refused the service and was arrested. The commanding officer, however, wanted to give this young man a chance to escape punishment, so he called his fiancee to influence him to make a compromise. The fiancee came and, before a board of six army officers, she was told that her future husband was facing a prison term of ten or fifteen years. She was given twenty minutes to talk to him alone in a separate room “to bring him to his senses,” but she used this opportunity to encourage him to remain faithful to Jehovah. The board of officers was very disappointed. But the sister then had the opportunity to talk to these officers for more than two hours and explain the reason for our neutrality. One of the officers accompanied her to the railroad station. He expressed his admiration that there are still young people in this world who know no fear and who are so steadfast in their faith. “I do not understand,” he said, “why such righteous and peace-loving people are imprisoned. It would be good if all men were like them.” The young brother was sentenced to six years, and the highest court then reduced the sentence to four years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The truth will set you free,” Jesus said. If a person has goodwill and accepts Jehovah’s help, the strongest fetters can be broken. A sister who came in touch with a woman who was a spiritist started to tell her about God’s kingdom. Though she liked what the sister told her, she remained a spiritist, even being a medium in a spiritist circle. Then the sister told her that spiritism is an abomination in Jehovah’s sight and that it means to have communion with the demons and that she would go into everlasting death if she did not give it up. The woman was deeply shaken by these words and admitted that she had been a medium for twenty-five years. She was then counseled to seek Jehovah in prayer, through his Son Jesus Christ, and to ask his forgiveness and his help. This she earnestly did, and she prayed that she might not be used anymore by the demons. Her prayer was heard, and from then on, to the great displeasure of that spiritist circle, she received no more messages from “beyond.” The circle did not want to lose this medium, however, and so they invited her to be present again at their seance. The woman went there, accompanied by the sister, but instead of communicating with the demons, they gave the group a witness to the truth. Needless to say, they did not feel at ease in the presence of Jehovah’s witnesses. Their former medium, however, makes progress in the truth and is desirous of dedicating herself to Jehovah to do his will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">POLAND</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Christians are under command to meet together. Often the police appear at such gatherings in the homes of the brothers. Generally they have been informed by opposed neighbors. Everyone has to show his personal identification papers and, if nobody is from another community, the police are sure that there is no circuit servant among them; these are the ones they are looking for. Some speak well about Jehovah’s witnesses. Recently one of them said, apologizing, “We have to come because we have been informed by someone.” Even though no publishers are arrested, the householders sometimes are judged by a so-called “prosecution board” and fined about $25, which in their currency means about two months’ wages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The publishers again worked much unassigned territory. Generally they rented a bus. They would start early in the morning, leaving the bus at certain designated places and spreading over the whole territory. This was also a good opportunity for the weaker publishers to share in the work, because they feel much stronger working together with others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When such a group passed a police station the officer just nodded his head. Other people said, “Oh, they are coming to bomb us.” One group worked 1,100 houses and found forty intensely interested people. Certainly new centers of activity will develop from this year’s work, and the white spots of unassigned territory on the map will be further diminished.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">People of all kinds are reached by the truth. A boy of sixteen years lived in a village with his uncle. He had no home anymore after his mother and his foster mother died. This boy was contacted by a publisher when he worked that village. The boy had to be careful because of his uncle. But he searched for the place where the publisher lived and one day he called at his home to get his questions answered. Now he is having a regular study with the brothers, in order to become a preacher of the good news himself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Two girls of ten years went from door to door with the message. A man got very angry at them and shut the door in their faces. His wife asked him why he had been so unkind. The woman then went outside after them, having a little girl of about the same age by her hand. She met the girls still in the passageway of the house. The two little sisters did not know what was in the mind of the woman, and there was a tense situation for a moment. But then one girl said to the woman: “What a nice daughter you have.” That simple friendly word broke the tension, the children were invited in and could give their witness. They turned the back-call over to a brother, and the family is now enjoying a home Bible study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A publisher supplied a Catholic lady with a Bible. She was very glad to have it; so on Christmas morning when the priest visited the villagers, she put her Bible on the table in order to have the priest tell her something about it. But as soon as the priest turned to the Bible he threw it on the floor and kicked at it with his foot. She had not expected such a thing and was quite upset. She told the priest to leave her home. She increased her efforts to learn more from the Bible with the aid of the publisher, and after a few months she was ready to dedicate herself to Jehovah and get baptized. Thus the hostile attitude of the priest toward the Bible helped her to take her stand for the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The unity and love found among Jehovah’s witnesses is an impressive sign of Christian living to outsiders. A brother was arrested because he had been permitting literature production on his property. It was just the time of the harvest and he had a farm to take care of. How surprised were his neighbors when the next Saturday thirty-five persons worked on his field harvesting, and Sunday morning when the people went to church they noticed fifty publishers bringing in the harvest! By noon the field was completely harvested. The priest even pointed to it as an example of love and asked his parishioners: “Why is this not so with us?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The current service year again brought many arrests and imprisonment of publishers. The enemies certainly tried their best to accomplish what they announced previously: “We will soon make an end of you.” One brother in a letter to the authorities said: “We are hunted down like game that has been turned over to die, and for which there is not even a closed season.” None of Jehovah’s witnesses are safe for the morrow, because at any time they could be arrested and brought into court as some who are dangerous to the state.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There have been 140 persons tried in court during the year, not counting cases of refusal of military conscription and so-called “board trials.” Eleven of the accused brothers were acquitted. About one hundred sentences were passed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">ROMANIA</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The hand of oppression of the “king of the north” lies heavily upon Jehovah’s people in Romania. Hundreds of brothers, sentenced to many years, suffer in Romanian prisons, and from time to time new court trials take place. But our brothers endure this heat of persecution in the strength of Jehovah. They carry on with the preaching under difficult circumstances, and men of goodwill join their ranks and become disciples. This calls for courage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In a women’s public meeting where about 250 persons were present there was much discussion to prove that no God exists. It just happened that one of Jehovah’s witnesses was present at this meeting. She asked to speak. Courageously she pointed to various Bible texts and argued that it is not possible to deny successfully the existence of God. She was contradicted sharply by most of those in attendance. Three persons shared her view, however, and today these three women are visited in order to be taught about God, not only about his existence, but also about his wonderful purposes. It shows how courage under opposition results in a witness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A young sister came across a married woman and told her about the truth. A study was conducted with her, and the woman showed much interest and made progress in the truth. One day the interested lady’s husband happened to come home unexpectedly and, upon learning of the purpose of the sister’s visit, he became very angry and denounced the sister to the police. The sister was summoned by the police, but after a short hearing she was let free again. The woman continued to stay with her husband and to serve him well, but she discontinued taking part in political meetings and worldly entertainments, which she could not harmonize anymore with her conscience. Her husband declared that due to this he had decided to obtain a divorce. He then undertook the necessary steps in this direction. When the couple stood before the court and the man gave his reasons for the divorce, the presiding judge said, to the great surprise of the husband, that he must have gone out of his mind to divorce such a decent, faithful and believing woman, seeing that so many women are morally corrupt these days. The husband was so Impressed by the words of the judge that he withdrew his plea for divorce. At home he told his wife that he too would be interested to learn about her religion. So the sister, whom he had reported to the police, started a study with both of them. They are making good progress and are thinking about their dedication to Jehovah. This shows how good conduct, with no compromise in principal matters, results in a blessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">UNION OF SOVIET SOCIALISTIC REPUBLICS</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The difficult conditions that existed at the outset of the service year increased due to the stepped-up propaganda against the work. Under the influence of atheistic propaganda many people have been brought into such a frame of mind that they even refuse to discuss Bible matters. They have become so prejudiced that they want to avoid any contact with Jehovah’s witnesses. The newspapers, all of which are run by the government, publish articles about Jehovah’s witnesses, presenting them as an organization that is controlled from abroad to gather information for espionage purposes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The brothers are constantly on the lookout for new methods to approach the people. Even derogatory and slandering newspaper articles published against the work have been used as a good steppingstone for a witness to the truth. People who have a love for righteousness have been incited by the intensified propaganda to get to know Jehovah’s witnesses for themselves. They are very much impressed with the facts when they find out the truth and see that none of the slander holds true, but that these people practice in their daily lives the principles of the Bible that they preach.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Russian publishers, the same as those all over the world, like to sing their Kingdom songs. They practice singing in chorus. Often funeral services are adorned by Kingdom songs sung by such a chorus. A Greek Catholic woman attending a funeral said that she desired to have such a funeral service by Jehovah’s witnesses. A brother who heard her remark at once made arrangements for a Bible study with her. Instead of thinking of death, she learned of the wonderful prospects of everlasting life for all people of goodwill. She dedicated herself, was baptized and today she is a fellow praiser of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A young brother in a factory had a fatal accident. At first the brothers were shocked. But when the funeral came, it turned out to be a great witness to the truth. A huge crowd gathered from all over the neighborhood. Almost eight hundred publishers were present, besides many strangers. When the police learned about it they tried to break up the funeral. But so many people had come that the police could do no more than stand on the sidewalk and watch. They said it was a convention, not a funeral, because there were so many people from other places. The brothers sang Kingdom songs and one of them gave the funeral discourse. It was a public witness and also a tremendous encouragement to the many new ones in the truth who had never had the opportunity to see more than a handful of Witnesses together.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Some time after that funeral a young girl, a sister, died of a heart ailment. Again many people, among them quite a few strangers, traveled to the funeral. The police started to check the buses and trains in order to prevent them from gathering. When they saw that they were not very successful, the secret police called at the home, dressed up in white cloaks as physicians, and ordered that the dead girl not be buried publicly because of having had a contagious disease. They forcibly took the dead body and transported it to a city quite a distance away.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Article 124 of the Constitution of the U.S.S.R. states: “The freedom to practice religious cults and the freedom of antireligious propaganda are recognized for all citizens.” But in certain sections the publishers have been summoned by the police and threatened with deportation to Siberia if they do not renounce their faith. It is incredible how much some of them have to suffer because they keep their integrity to Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A sister seventy years of age was summoned to the prosecutor’s office in order to sign such a statement renouncing her faith. When she refused she was ill-treated inhumanly. The men turned into wild beasts. She looked terrible when she returned home the next morning. She had lost a tooth and had many bruises on her body; they had torn off parts of her scalp, and her lips were blue and bruised. The physician at the hospital, who was very sympathetic with her, told her that she would lose the rest of her hair because the scalp was torn off. She had to sleep with her face down and support her head on her chin, because she could not stand anything touching her head.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Many brothers were released from the compulsory work camps in the course of the past year. Other imprisoned brothers have been put together in certain camps. In one of these camps there are more than three hundred of them. The Communists are afraid of the power of the message even in the camps. Therefore they keep them isolated from the other inmates except for sectarians and clergy. In one camp six of the clergy have accepted the truth. Twenty publishers in that camp were put in special isolation because they had been actively preaching.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There are also camps where sisters have been brought together. In one of these camps criminals had been imprisoned before the sisters were put in there, and the cells were in such a filthy state that it was impossible to live in them, so the sisters decided to work overtime in order to clean up the cells thoroughly and put the whole place in good repair. There were all kinds of artisans among the sisters, such as carpenters, painters, welders, electricians and also first-class sewers, and so forth. The camp officials and onlookers were amazed and wondered what kind of people these are who get all this work done, who even go to clean up and renovate their prison cells and work overtime to do it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The brothers in Russia have asked to have their love and greetings conveyed to all their brothers throughout the world. They have asked us to continue praying for them, that Jehovah may give them strength to endure under all the trying circumstances, to his glory and praise, and to the benefit of many more people of goodwill who live in that vast country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">UNITED ARAB REPUBLIC</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is a real pleasure to report that at the end of another service year, despite many obstacles and pressure that was brought against God’s people in the United Arab Republic, a witness to the Kingdom has been given. Many brothers were called on at their homes by agents of the Investigations Department and very subtly asked whether they still continued to preach as Jehovah’s witnesses, and inquiry was made as to whether they still studied the Word of God or not. These men also wanted to know of any persons who might be doing such a thing. Why the United Arab Republic should be so disturbed over a handful of Jehovah’s witnesses is really surprising. Many have been summoned to the Investigations Department and have been cross-examined by officers. Europeans have been exiled because of their belief in Jehovah God and the work that Jehovah’s witnesses are doing. Others who happen to be Egyptians have been thrown into jail, but their integrity has not been broken. It is not easy to live the life of a Christian in the United Arab Republic. Here are a few experiences about things that have happened in that country as sent in by someone from that land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">To be God’s servant one needs to have courage and hope in Jehovah, as is well illustrated by the following event. One day a young publisher of ten, whose fleshly elder sister is a zealous witness for Jehovah, went out in the field service with </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font5"> special pioneer without her parents knowing it, because they would not let her preach under the existing conditions. Unfortunately they met some very opposed ladies who called the police and had them arrested. The police officers were amazed at the courage and faith of the young sister who was not afraid of their threats and did not agree to stop speaking about God. She was held in the Investigations Department for more than ten hours until her father was summoned to come and take her. He was very furious but was not hard with her. The girl, instead of being intimidated and afraid because of what the authorities told her and her father’s opposition for the truth, continued her activity with even greater zeal, and intends to symbolize her dedication by water baptism as soon as possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The importance of teaching with tact and patience is brought to the fore by what happened with a young girl of seventeen who heard the message from a special pioneer and became interested. She did not take a stand for the truth, although she understood that there is no trinity and that God’s name is Jehovah. She was still attending church services. One day, though, while in church with one of her relatives, she saw on one of the church walls an inscription stating that Jesus is the Son of God. In her enthusiasm she said to her relative: “If they write that Jesus is the Son of God, why do they claim that he is God at the same time?” Her relative got angry and called the verger of the church to explain this point to her. As the verger could not give her a satisfactory answer, he called in the priest. The priest, though, instead of trying to give a patient and tactful explanation, started crying out angrily and said to the young girl not to put her feet in his church anymore if this is what she believes. Thus the false shepherd lost one of his “sheep” and Jesus found it, because from that day on the girl took a stand for the theocracy and became a publisher of the good news of salvation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Materialism may be quite a temptation and a snare for some and make them neglect their spiritual endeavors, but not so with persons who let the Word of God take root in their- hearts, as in the case of a young man with whom a study was conducted for almost four months. He received a letter from his uncle in Lebanon with a very attractive proposition, saying: “I am leaving for the U.S.A., and you can come with me and live in the U.S.A, if you come to Lebanon and convert yourself to Catholicism.” The young man, who, by the way, lives in one of the poorest sections of the city, showed the letter to the special pioneer who was studying with him and, upon hearing what God’s Word has to say about the exclusive devotion asked by Jehovah, he replied with great joy, “That’s exactly what I have already done. I have written my uncle and explained that since I have decided to serve Jehovah God, I cannot possibly deny Him for any material benefits.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Notwithstanding the departure of thirty European publishers during the year from the U.A.R., the scarcity of spiritual food, the difficulty in associating together to partake of this food and carry on the Lord’s work due to the official ban of the Society, the spiritual condition of the friends is very good and is an inspiration to goodwill persons. Thus we were happy to witness during the year twenty-three persons symbolizing their dedication by water baptism and a new peak in both the number of publishers reporting in one month and those attending the celebration of the Memorial.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">YUGOSLAVIA</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The brothers in Yugoslavia enjoyed a blessed year of service. They rejoiced because it became possible to have the book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">From Paradise Lost to Paradise Regained </span><span class="font5">printed in Croatian and Slovenian, as well as the booklets </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“Look! I Am Making AU Things New”</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“This Good News of the Kingdom.”</span><span class="font5"> All this proved to be a stimulus to the work there, and many were the interesting experiences had by the brothers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The results sometimes obtained by incidental witnessing are shown by the following experience. A sister, very young in the truth, was traveling by train. A girl came into the train and took the opposite seat. A conversation developed and it turned out that the girl works in the printing establishment that printed the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font5"> book for the Society. The sister used this as an opening and mentioned the wonderful book printed there. The girl said that she also worked on this book, but being a Catholic, she actually should not read such literature. The sister then replied that she was also born Catholic and yet she felt that one should read all about the Bible and its true doctrine. She opened her bag and pulled out the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font5"> book and started to explain a few things in it. The girl was rather reserved, however, although she asked a few questions. As they came to the end of their journey, the sister tried to obtain the girl’s address, but she was not willing to give it. So the sister gave her own address, although she did not think it would be of any use to the girl. So she was quite surprised when two days later the girl showed up at her door in order to ask some questions. A regular study with the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font5"> book was then started. Soon the girl removed the golden cross she wore around her neck, and when the circuit assembly approached, she expressed the wish to be baptized, which she was.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">How difficulties in a divided household were overcome is shown by the following experience. The Moslems in Yugoslavia are very orthodox and it is very difficult to preach in Bosnia; for example, it is impossible to talk to Moslem women, because the Koran forbids it. But, in spite of all difficulties, a young Moslem man accepted the truth and was immersed. Although the Moslem women are obedient and submissive, he now encountered energetic opposition from his wife and his mother-in-law. To them only the Koran was of any value, and all Watch Tower literature as well as some Bibles that the brother brought home simply disappeared.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One evening the brother brought home his fifth new Bible, seeing that all the others had been destroyed by his wife. When the family sat down at the table, he Disced the Bible beside his plate and ordered in a severe and imperative tone of voice that the Bible be on the table at every meal, so that he could read from it. He made clear that nobody should dare take this Bible away. Again a dispute arose between the two women and the brother over the Koran and the Bible. So the brother made a suggestion that they fetch the Koran, so that they could compare its teachings with those of the Bible, for instance, in matters of women and family life. The brother said: “Please let me then know just how I should deal with you, whether according to the Bible or according to the Koran. I promise you that I will follow exactly your decision, but I shall expect you to do the same. Do you agree?” Yes, they agreed and away they hurried to get their holy book, the Koran.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Now,” said the brother, “let’s open the Koran and see what it says about women.” Then he read from the Koran that a man is entitled to have several wives. He opened another page in the Koran and read that the man can and even should beat his wife if she is not obedient and submissive and that he can send her away from his home. Now he asked the two women: “Shall I act now like this?” They remained silent. Then he opened the Bible and read them Matthew 5:27-32, where Jesus Christ gives only one ground for divorce, fornication, and where he shows that a man must not have more than one wife. Tiien he asked them why Adam had been given only one wife and not several. The reply of his wife was that one was sufficient. Then the brother read more scriptures, such as 1 Timothy 3:2-4, Matthew 19:3-9 and 1 Peter 3:1-7. and explained that according to the Bible the husband should love his wife and not beat her or even send her away. Then the brother said: “What is now the right thing in your opinion—what we read in the Koran or what the Bible teaches? According to which shall I act?” Then after a pause his wife answered that the words of the Bible are right. Since that time the brother has conducted a Bible study with the whole family, and this every evening. The brother finds his Bible and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> on the table every suppertime, so that the study can begin when the meal is over. The Bible has won against the Koran.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">PEOPLE </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">WILL </span><span class="font4">DELIVER YOU </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">UP</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark207"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark208"></a>Our brothers have had hard times to deal with, especially those living behind the Iron Curtain and in countries where special effort is made to destroy the organization of Jehovah’s witnesses. This is not surprising to Jehovah’s dedicated people. They know full well what Jesus told the disciples in his day when they inquired about the sign of his second presence and what might be expected at the consummation of this system of things. One thing that Jesus said was: “Then people will deliver you up to tribulation and will kill you, and you will be objects of hatred by all the nations on account of my name. Then, also, many will be stumbled and will betray one another and will hate one another.” (Matt. 24:9, 10) So to us it is not surprising that during the years thousands of Jehovah’s witnesses have been turned over to the authorities, especially during the years of World War II. Tens of thousands of Jehovah’s witnesses were put away in concentration camps in Germany, Poland, Russia and in other countries, and many were killed in such camps. During this particular period of wartime there was no question that Jehovah’s witnesses were objects of hatred by all the nations.</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">Even since the conclusion of the second world war Jehovah’s witnesses have not found it easy to go from house to house in the many nations of the world and preach the good news of God’s kingdom. There is still much opposition, as you have read. At the close of 1942 Jehovah’s witnesses were declaring God’s kingdom in fifty-four countries. Now, after twenty years of faithful work, believing and trying to accomplish Jesus’ command to go and disciple people of all nations, they have succeeded in getting into 189 different countries, islands, protectorates and colonies in different parts of the world. During this twenty-year period there have been years of large increases in gathering together the people of goodwill, and in other years the increases were small. But, regardless, in favorable or unfavorable season they have “endured a great contest under suffering” and have not drawn back but have diligently pressed on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When we reflect on the work performed in 1942 we find it was done by 106,000 witnesses of Jehovah. These ministered to all sorts of people throughout the world, even during the years of the second world war. Because of their diligence, in ten years’ time the organization grew to 426,704 ministers preaching regularly every month. This meant that by 1952 there was an increase of 320,704 regular ministers over the report for 1942. What happened during the next ten years, by 1962? As stated in this </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook,</span><span class="font6"> Jehovah’s witnesses have increased to 920,920 regular ministers announcing the Kingdom. In this ten-year period the increase was 494,216 additional ministers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Comparing these two ten-year periods, we see that in the first period there was an average yearly increase of 32,070. During the second period of ten years the increase was 49,421 new publishers on the average each year. What will be the yearly average increase of publishers of the Kingdom in the years to come? It should be greater because there are many more ministers of the good news going from house to house these days. Much more time is being spent in the field ministry. Just compare the hours devoted to the preaching work in 1942 with 1962. In 1942 there were 28,030,049 hours spent preaching and in 1962 Jehovah’s witnesses spent 142,046,679 hours declaring the good news. So with more hours preaching it is natural to expect greater results in the gathering of the great crowd of people before the throne of God. —Rev. 7:9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Doing this work is not easy and there will be some heartaches. Jesus said: “Many will be stumbled and will betray one another and will hate one another.” How true! We have seen it. Therefore let us make sure that none of this stumbling is because of us. Rather, let us appreciate that those who are being gathered from all the nations must be helped by each one of us. They must keep a firm grip on the Word of life, and there is where we can help. We have a much greater obligation to those dedicated to God than to those who have not yet heard the truth. As you have observed in this </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook,</span><span class="font6"> there were 46,798 new ones associated with Jehovah’s witnesses in the field ministry regularly each month during the 1962 service year. During the same twelve months, there were 69,649 different individuals baptized. The difference is about 23,000 persons. Why such a difference? We recognize that people die each year and, according to statistics in the United States, about 9.5 persons die out of every one thousand. So in an organization of 920,920 at least 8,750 people might be expected to die, and this would naturally mean a smaller increase in the publisher column. Then there are those who because of living immorally are disfellowshiped, and this keeps the organization clean. There are still others who just drift away, are stumbled or even hate the truth after tasting of its goodness. Why? It is hard to say, but they do lose their first love. When the year’s report is compiled we see a big difference between the number of those baptized and those who represent the overall increase of Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We cannot help those who died doing good works, but we surely have an obligation to our brothers still alive and near us, just as we have an obligation to the stranger that we have not yet met. Jehovah’s witnesses everywhere must set a good example for their brothers in word and in deed. They should have an optimistic outlook on the work ahead and should encourage one another to love and right works. There is no question about it, all of God’s people need encouragement, and we remember that in the early days of the congregation Jehovah provided his organization with apostles, prophets, evangelizers, shepherds and teachers. All these were provided for the purpose of training the holy ones. That work has not stopped today within the congregation of God. Jehovah God is sending forth in his organization zone servants, district servants, circuit servants, missionaries, congregation servants and other mature ministers for the training of those who are dedicated to Jehovah God today. All these servants have done a marvelous work in helping brothers grow strong, but we just cannot leave all this work to the overseers. There are not enough overseers to look after the individual care that is needed for all the new ones who are coming in and regularly associating with Jehovah’s witnesses. The Society is doing all it can to help these new ones through an excellent training program. It organized the Gilead School for its principal overseers, the Kingdom Ministry School for all congregation servants and the Theocratic Ministry School in the congregations for all of God’s ministers. All these schools have been organized within Jehovah’s organization to teach and train Jehovah’s witnesses to help others in the truth to build up their faith in Jehovah and show forth love.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This training work must go on because it is very evident that the ingathering of the great crowd is not over. As was pointed out, during the years from 1942 to 1952 there were, on an average, 32,070 persons taking up the ministerial work each year, and in the past ten years, from 1952 to 1962, that average has jumped to 49,421. What a great crowd to take care of each year! And we must keep them strong and build up their love. Jehovah’s Christian witnesses “are not the sort that shrink back to destruction, but the sort that have faith to the preserving alive of the soul.” (Heb. 10:39) How essential it is for each congregation servant, along with his ministerial assistants, to check over the Publisher’s Record cards each month! Where was Brother So-and-So last month? Sick? Visiting out of town? Moving? What happened to him? He is part of the congregation of God. Is he still active? Where? Check the record cards. Find those few who may be drifting away, and you do not know why or where they have gone. Do you follow through and encourage those who have slacked their hands? Do all those who at one time or another came to the meetings still come? Are they still in your territory? If Jehovah in his loving-kindness provided evangelizers and shepherds and teachers to train the holy ones years ago, then certainly we have an obligation as Christians to keep on training those who at one time dedicated their lives to the service of God but for some reason or another have slowed down and have stepped aside and are slipping back into the world. Real Christians are not the kind that shrink back. Help them!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Help all your brothers to see the perilous times in which we are living. Aid them to regain that first love for Jehovah and to regain the desire to praise Him. Every one of God’s servants has a responsibility toward his brothers. Every one dedicated to do the will of God must be acquainted with the Word of God and know his responsibilities toward others and carry them out. Show one another how to walk in integrity. There is no doubt about it, the larger the New World society gets on this side of Armageddon the more problems we will have. But we are not the kind that slack the hand or shrink back.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">YOU® HELP APPRECIATED</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah’s witnesses worldwide are trying to do right the work required by God. There is no other organization of people in the world that spend so much of their own time freely without compensation as Jehovah’s people have done in the last year. Just think of it! They spent 142,000,000 hours speaking about God’s kingdom without financial gain to themselves and millions more hours at congregation meetings inciting in one another love and right works. How many individuals would it require to put in this amount of time preaching—142,000,000 hours—if a man worked eight hours a day five days a week and fifty weeks a year? That is equal to two thousand hours. Well, it would take 71,000 persons working a whole year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But there is much more preaching work than what we see here. Jehovah’s witnesses are preaching by their daily course of action, by their conduct at home with their children, by their attendance at meetings and in helping new ones at the meetings. A Christian’s time spent in preaching the good news cannot be measured just in hours, for he lives the life of a minister all day long. As is well known, the majority of the ministers of God in the organization of Jehovah’s witnesses have to take care of families and devote their time to secular occupations. But even so, these brothers and sisters in the New World society have been very generous in making contributions to the Society so that the preaching of the good news can be done in other lands where they cannot go personally. They have shown a willingness to help others get there. By their unsolicited contributions to the Watch Tower Society in all parts of the world, the Society was able to spend over $400,000 in aiding missionaries and over $2,200,000 to assist special pioneers during the 1962 service year in different parts of the earth. In order to aid our brothers and sisters and the people of goodwill to be encouraged in the ministry the Society also spent over $470,000 on circuit and district servants. To help these special representatives in different parts of the world, all in the full-time service, the Society spent upward of $3,100,000. The Watch Tower Society is very grateful to all of Jehovah’s witnesses everywhere for their financial assistance. In addition to this we must recognize, too, that these servants of Jehovah are taking care of Kingdom Hall expenses, circuit and district assembly expenses, all to the honor and glory of Jehovah’s name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">OTHER INTERESTING FACTS</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At the 87 branch homes and offices established in the principal countries of the world there is a working force of 1,423 ministers. Besides taking care of the Bethel homes and offices of the Watch Tower Society they had the privilege of printing and shipping 6,438,898 bound books and Bibles, 15,871,445 paper-covered booklets, 100,361,485 </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> magazines and 90,658,305 </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font6">magazines. Many of these Bethel family members have enjoyed the fellowship of the congregation servants of their country while they attended the Kingdom Ministry School at the branch office. This four-week-long schooling and refresher course has aided the overseers of the congregations to get a clearer appreciation of their duties and responsibilities toward Jehovah’s sheep allotted to their care.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Once a year there is a very important celebration observed by all of Jehovah’s witnesses around the earth, and that is held on the anniversary night of the death of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. In memory of him all of Jehovah’s witnesses gathered together for the Memorial, known to some as the Last Supper that Jesus partook of with his disciples. At this one meeting on the night of April 17, 1962, there were 1,639,681 persons in attendance. There were 12,714 who attended that partook of the emblems, the bread and the wine, symbolizing the flesh and the blood of Christ Jesus; and these 12,714 partaking of the emblems indicated to others that they were of the anointed body of Christ, the remaining ones of the remnant still on earth. This means that 570 fewer people partook of the emblems, because during the year they finished their earthly course in death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">While the remnant of the body of Christ grows smaller, the great crowd of “other sheep” that Jehovah God through his Son Christ Jesus is gathering out of all nations, kindreds and tongues, is growing larger. These, too, like the remnant who had dedicated their lives to God’s service, have symbolized their dedication to God’s service by water baptism. There were 69,649 individuals who did this. The baptizing of such a great crowd in just one year places a grave responsibility upon those who are already in the truth. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">It</span><span class="font6"> reminds us of what Paul said to Timothy: “Fight the fine fight of the faith, get a firm hold on the everlasting life for which you were called and you offered the fine public declaration in front of many witnesses.” (1 Tim. 6:12) Here is where the responsibility comes upon God’s servants. These newly interested persons who have heard the truth and who have shown appreciation start in the service work preaching the good news, but sometimes they cool off. Their interest wanes. That is why Paul admonished the young overseer, Timothy, to fight the fine fight of faith. Of course, being an overseer, he was to help many others to do the same thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">On the other hand, it is not just the responsibility of overseers to aid people to remain Christians and to stay in Jehovah’s visible organization. It is the responsibility of every Christian within Jehovah’s organization to help each one. True, our love goes out to God, and Jesus said we should love Jehovah our God with all our heart, mind, soul and strength, but he also said we should love our neighbor as we love ourselves. If we really do this, then as Christians we must love and aid our neighbors to put up a fine fight for the faith. Why should Christians want to do this? Because, like Paul, Christians must be able to say: “I did not hold back from telling you any of the things that </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">were</span><span class="font6"> profitable nor from teaching you publicly and from house to house.” (Acts 20:20) Christians will never “get a firm hold on the everlasting life” unless they keep on serving God in every way day by day. So it is necessary to help one another, especially in these perilous times, days that are hard to deal with, days in which every man’s hand is against his neighbor, days in which the love of the greater number grows cold, days in which immorality is rampant. So it is excellent admonition that Paul gave Timothy. Every Christian should help his brother to ‘fight the fine fight of the faith, to get a firm hold on the everlasting life.’ This is in full accord with the text that Jehovah’s witnesses have chosen for 1963: “Have faith to the preserving alive of the soul.” (Heb. 10:39) With these thoughts in mind it is hoped, not only that those who are now Jehovah’s witnesses will keep a firm hold on the real life, but also that hundreds of thousands, yes, millions of other persons still groping for the light will find it, if it pleases God. Bringing them the light is the great responsibility resting upon Jehovah’s witnesses. They must take the truth and light from the Word of God to the ends of the earth. This they will do by Jehovah’s undeserved kindness right on up to the end of this system of things. Jesus has declared that it will be done. Said he: “This good news of the kingdom will be preached in all the inhabited earth for a witness to all the nations; and then the end will come.” —Matt. 24:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Truly Jehovah’s witnesses are a united people, anxious to know the will of God and to do it day by day. They love their God in heaven, Jehovah, with all their heart, mind, soul and strength, and they love their neighbor as they do themselves. This has been forcefully expressed during the year by their activity and their devotion to the service in preaching the good news. In the reports received from all the branches throughout the world every branch servant indicated that he was charged with the responsibility of sending to the brothers in each and every other country throughout the world the love and greetings of Jehovah’s witnesses in his country. So it is indeed a pleasure through this medium, the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook,</span><span class="font6"> to send to all of Jehovah’s witnesses everywhere the warm love and greetings of their fellow workers, one to the other.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During 1962 we had a very inspiring text to think about: “Be courageous and let your heart be strong. Yes, hope in Jehovah.” (Ps. 27:14) Living this text brought all of Jehovah’s witnesses real happiness, and now w<sup>r</sup>e look forward to a new year of service and we will keep in mind another important theme from God’s Word, namely: “Have faith to the preserving alive of the soul.” (Heb. 10:39) It is the prayer of God’s people everywhere that together we will remain faithful in our service to Jehovah. By the doing of the will of God day by day we will preserve alive our souls. May Jehovah’s rich blessing go with all of you as together we face the future with joy and determination, never slacking the hand or shrinking back, but having “faith to the preserving alive of the soul.” Be assured of my warm love for all servants of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Your brother and fellow servant,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">, President</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society of Pennsylvania</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark209"></a><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;"><a name="bookmark210"></a>Annual Meeting</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">On Monday morning, October 1, 1962, at ten o’clock the members of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania met at its registered office, 4100 Bigelow Boulevard, Pittsburgh 13, Pennsylvania. The meeting was called to order by the president of the Society and request was made to give proof that a quorum was present for the transaction of business. The secretary informed the members present that on October 1, 1961, there were 413 members and since that time some of the members of the corporation had passed away in death and two had resigned. This left the membership in the corporation as of October 1,1962, at 404. Proof was submitted that 396 members were present at the meeting in person or by proxy. There were many others of Jehovah’s witnesses from different parts of the United States present. In fact, when the count was taken there proved to be 2,064 in attendance, filling the main auditorium and the overflow meeting place in the basement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The first order of business was the filling of offices of two directors whose terms had expired. F. W. Franz and Hugo H. Riemer were both nominated as directors of the Society for a term of three years. By unanimous vote they were reelected.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There were a few members of the corporation in attendance from distant lands. The president of the Society had requested that these members give reports on the lands they represented. John A. Cutforth, who is the Papuan branch servant, spoke about the fine work being done by Jehovah’s witnesses in the islands of the Pacific. Then the president called on Frederick E. Harvey, a member of the corporation from Panama, and he gave some very interesting experiences concerning the work being done in that Central American country. Jack D. Powers, of Uruguay, followed, pointing out that good progress is being made by the theocratic organization in that land. Philip D. Rees, from the British Isles and serving in the London branch office, next addressed the gathering. He showed what problems the witnesses of Jehovah have in England in presenting the message of the Kingdom to the religious-minded people of that land. Korea was represented by the branch servant, Donald L. Steele, the fifth member of the corporation to speak. All these members at the time were attending the Watchtower Bible School of Gilead. It was indeed a pleasure to hear from all of them and to live with them, as it were, in their own countries during the minutes they described progress of the work in these different parts of the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A director of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania, Lyman A. Swingle, next spoke on the subject of confidence. His words were very encouraging to all in attendance. The secretary and treasurer, Grant Suiter, then gave greetings and messages from many other parts of the world from members who could not be present but who made expressions of their love for the work that they are engaged in and their appreciation of serving with God’s people everywhere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The president of the Society then addressed the audience on the subject “Strong Reason for Faith in God’s New World.” He pointed out how essential it is to have faith in these last days. The two hours and twenty-nine minutes that intervened from the opening of the meeting with prayei' to the adjourning and closing with prayer were joyful ones, and it proved to be a very refreshing occasion. It was a delight for those present to be able to meet with so many others from different parts of the earth and the United States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A few days later in New York city, on October 12, the board of directors of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania met to elect officers. All the present officers were reelected, namely, the president, N. H. Knorr; the vice-president, F. W. Franz; the secretary-treasurer, Grant Suiter; the assistant secretarytreasurer, H. H. Riemer. The other members of the board of directors are T. J. Sullivan, M. G. Henschel and L. A. Swingle. Full consideration was given to the financial report for the year ending August 31, 1962, and reports were made on how the work of Jehovah’s witnesses was going on in all parts of the earth. Truly Jehovah’s rich blessing has been upon his people who have shown great faith. All the members of the board of directors are grateful to Jehovah God for their privileges of service, and by his undeserved kindness will continue in their respective privileges of service faithfully, to the honor and glory of Jehovah’s name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“Have faith to the preserving alive of the soul.” —Heb. 10:39.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Man was made to live, but we find him dying. God’s Word tells us very clearly that man dies because of Adam’s sin and disobedience, and this same Word of God explains how Jehovah made a provision for man to regain life. “For God loved the world so much that he gave his only-begotten Son, in order that everyone exercising faith in him might not be destroyed but have everlasting life.” (John 3:16) Here Jesus plainly stated that the one exercising faith in him might not be destroyed, but he will be able to attain to everlasting life. It is not just a matter of a person’s hearing once about Christ Jesus and saying, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“I</span><span class="font5"> believe,” but it is necessary for each individual to get an accurate knowledge of the Son of God so that there will be oneness in the faith that all followers of Christ have. In order to establish this oneness in belief and to make one’s faith strong Jehovah gave to mankind “some as apostles, some as prophets, some as evangelizers, some as shepherds and teachers, with a view to the training of the holy ones, for ministerial work, for the building up of the body of the Christ, until we all attain to the oneness in the faith and in the accurate knowledge of the Son of God, to a full-grown man, to the measure of growth that belongs to the fullness of the Christ.” (Eph. 4:1113) From this it is clearly seen that faith develops, and we need help to establish this faith, to make it strong, in fact, so strong that it will preserve alive the soul.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The best definition of faith is set forth in the Bible and it is this: “Faith is the assured expectation of things hoped for, the evident demonstration of realities though not beheld.” (Heb. 11:1) The apostle under divine inspiration lists men who are outstanding in showing faith, men who are talked about by Christians everywhere because of their display of this quality. The Bible record says, “by faith Abel,” “by faith Enoch,” “by faith Noah,” “by faith Abraham,” and so on through the entire eleventh chapter of Hebrews. Yes, all these men did things that changed their whole lives and governed their course of progress. They did not just move blindly ahead, not knowing for sure if they were right or wrong. When these men and women mentioned by Paul moved</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">into action and did things by faith it was because of an assured expectation of things hoped for. A. T. Robertson in his book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Word Pictures in the New Testament,</span><span class="font5"> in discussing Hebrews 11:1, says: “We venture to suggest the translation ‘Faith is the title-deed of things hoped for.’ ” He further points out that the Greek word for “assured expectation” has the meaning of ‘what stands under anything, a building, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font5"> contract, a promise.’ If a building is set on solid rock, one living in that building is assured of an excellent foundation. A contract is made with a firm that has a long reputation of reliability. Someone promises you something, and you feel sure of the promise because of your personal acquaintance or your knowledge of the integrity of the man. There is a real sense of assurance, just as when a person buys a piece of land and he gets a titled deed. It has been searched out and there are no flaws in it; and that is the way a Christian’s faith can be.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Faith is a “title-deed” of things hoped for, or, as the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation</span><span class="font5"> puts it, “Faith is the assured expectation of things hoped for.” Christians have faith. They believe the Word of God, and when they pray: &quot;Our Father in the heavens, let your name be sanctified. Let your kingdom come. Let your will take place, as in heaven, also upon earth. Give us today our bread for this day,” they have faith in these words. (Matt. 6:9-11) Through their knowledge of the Bible, through their understanding of things that have occurred in history that prove the Bible, through the truths of God’s Word, through nature itself, the Christians know their Father is in heaven, and they do everything they can to sanctify his name. They know that from olden times, from the very beginning, Jehovah declared that he would set up a kingdom that would bless all the families of the earth. We have a very clear statement in God’s promise to Abraham that ‘in you and your seed all nations of the earth would be blessed.’ So Christ Jesus taught us to pray for that time and for that kingdom and for God’s will to take place, as in heaven, also upon the earth. Jehovah God has provided our bread every day too, sufficient for that day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We see and know these things. He said these things would occur. So our faith is like Abraham’s faith. He was awaiting a city having real foundations, “the builder and creator of which city is God.” So are we! (Heb. 11:10) Yes, there is every assurance that a Christian needs for him to press on in his service for Jehovah. With Paul each Christian must say: “Now we are not the sort that shrink back to destruction, but the sort that have faith to the preserving alive of the soul.” —Heb. 10:39.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There is work to do between now and the battle of Armageddon and this is no time to be weak in faith, but the time for strengthening our faith. Paul warns us sharply in this regard so that we do not go the wrong way in our thinking, for he says: “Beware, brothers, for fear there should ever develop in any one of you a wicked heart lacking faith by drawing away from the living God; but keep on exhorting one another each day, as long as it may be called ‘Today,’ for fear any one of you should become hardened by the deceptive power of sin.” (Heb. 3:12, 13) This is no time for any Christian to be drawing away from the congregation of God’s people. This is a time for learning more about the living God. This is a time to exhort one another every day. This is a time to keep active in declaring the good news of God’s kingdom everywhere, for it means life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s witnesses have chosen a delightful text for the year to consider along with each day’s text and comment. It is a text having to do with faith. Knowing what faith is, “an assured expectation,” just like a title-deed, just like a foundation under a building, we know it is solid, sure, and there is no question about it. With such faith Christians will continue to enjoy the study of God’s Word and to carry on the service of preaching the good news of the Kingdom. This is the time to “have faith to the preserving alive of the soul.” —Heb. 10:39.</span></p>

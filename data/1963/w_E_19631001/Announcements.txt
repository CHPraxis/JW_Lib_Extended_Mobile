FIELD MINISTRY
During the month of October, Jehovah’s witnesses, with courage and faith in their God, will take advantage of every opportunity to acquaint others with Jehovah’s kingdom and the blessings in store for all who love and serve him. As an aid in this work, they will offer a year’s subscription for the Awake! magazine, together with three booklets on Bible themes, on a contribution of $1.
HOW CAN A DEAD CITY AFFECT YOUR LIFE?
Why should a city that had its beginnings over forty centuries ago be of vital interest to you today? Because God’s Word says, “Get out of her, my people”! Yet that ancient city, Babylon, is now only an uninhabited tourist stop on the railway from Baghdad to Basra. How, then, can we heed this warning from the Bible? And why is Babylon such a deadly thing today? The answers to these questions have a direct bearing on your future. Be informed! It means your life! Read “Babylon the Great Has Fallen!” God’s Kingdom Rules! Send only 75c.

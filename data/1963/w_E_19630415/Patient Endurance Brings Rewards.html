<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">One of Jehovah’s witnesses from Ohio related this experience at an assembly in Point Pleasant, West Virginia, in 1962: “About ten to twelve years ago I was working in a little village where I knew nearly everyone, and everyone knew me. When I knocked on one door the lady said, ‘Come in. I’m a Seventh-day Adventist, and there never has been one of Jehovah’s witnesses in my house. In fact, I wouldn’t have let <em>you </em>in if I hadn’t known you. I know enough about the Bible to know there is only one truth, only one religion that God recognizes. We can’t both be right. I want the truth, and I don’t care where it comes from. If my religion can’t stand any test, it isn’t worth much.’ I agreed, ‘We both can’t be right. Like you, I want a religion that can stand any test.’</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn">“So on this basis a Bible study was started in the book <em>‘Let God Be True.’ </em>We did fine over a period of time till we came to the chapter on the sabbath. During the next six to eight years this person stopped and then resumed the study many times, and the chapter on the sabbath was studied perhaps ten or more times with different Witnesses. During the past five or six years she has been coming to the Kingdom Hall now and then. One never knew who would be with her; maybe her husband, sister, daughter or other relative, or one of the neighbors. In 1960, she started preaching the good news of the Kingdom with me. She is a regular publisher. In September, 1962, she and her sister were baptized. Today one of my greatest joys is to hear her explain the sabbath from the Bible to a person of goodwill.”</p>

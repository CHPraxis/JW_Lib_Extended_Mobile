FIELD MINISTRY
As followers of Jesus Christ, who is called the “Word of God,” Christians must be witnesses of Jehovah God, making known to all men what God has to say in his Word the Bible. (Rev. 1:5; 19:13) Appreciating this grand privilege, during June Jehovah’s witnesses will be offering to all persons the New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures, and a Bible-study booklet, on a contribution of $1.
DO YOU TREASURE THE BIBLE?
No possession can be of more lasting good to you than the Holy Bible. But to reap the benefits you must read it and follow its teachings. That means you need a copy of the Bible you can carry and use at all times. Such an edition is the New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures. This complete Bible is compact, attractively bound with gold-embossed hard cover, and contains maps, drawings and a concordance. It is $1. Send at once and receive free the booklet “This Good News of the Kingdom.”

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">One of Jehovah’s witnesses in North Carolina (U.S.A.) relates this experience: “My husband was called upon to do some electrical work for a lady who was trying to get it done as cheaply as possible. She wanted him to lower the quality standard that he felt was vital; he would not do this, so he asked her to get someone else to do the work the way she wanted it done. But she finally agreed to having it done the right way. A little later I called by this house with the <em>Watchtower </em>subscription offer, and she immediately invited me in and listened to what I had to say. After answering her many questions on the first visit, I was able to start a Bible study on the second. She said that the reason she listened to me was because of the firm stand my husband had taken in doing the work the right way rather than the cheapest.”</p>

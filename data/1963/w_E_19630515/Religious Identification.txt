Religious Identification
● The U.S. Census Bureau, in 1957, made some ambitious studies, finding that 96 percent of the people identified themselves as Protestants, Catholics, or Jews in response to the question: “What is your religion?” Yet the combined totals of all church membership figures indicate that some 68,000,000 Americans do not belong to any church or synagogue.—A Tale of Ten Cities, E. J. Lipman and Albert Vorspan, p. 316.

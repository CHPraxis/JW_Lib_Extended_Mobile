<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">◆ In Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, a sixty-three-year-old lady received a handful of old newspapers and magazines from a relative. Among these publications was a copy of <em>The Watchtower, </em>which she read. Greatly appreciating its contents, she soon tried to get other copies; but she was not able to find any of Jehovah’s witnesses. So she learned by heart the contents of the one copy she had and told everybody about the wonderful things she had learned. Only after six years did a Kingdom minister knock on her door at an hour when this elderly lady answered. She was zealous for the truth, having been sustained for six years by just one copy of <em>The Watchtower.</em></p>

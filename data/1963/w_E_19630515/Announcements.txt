FIELD MINISTRY
Keeping friendship with God requires that we practice righteousness and that we serve him wholeheartedly. (Ps. 15:1, 2) During May, as Jehovah’s witnesses render such service, they will offer to all persons the book “Let God Be True,” with a booklet, on a contribution of 50c.
A TRULY DEDICATED PEOPLE
How many issues of The Watchtower have you read? Many? And have you not found its material refreshingly different from other journals? That is because its publishers are different, with an entirely different purpose and an entirely different outlook on this world’s activities. How well do you know Jehovah’s witnesses, the real publishers of The Watchtower? What is their purpose, their objective, their background? What is their organization like and why do they preach from house to house as they do? Read Jehovah’s Witnesses in the Divine Purpose. It is a 320-page documented history of these unique people. It will reveal to you a people truly dedicated to God. Send only $1.

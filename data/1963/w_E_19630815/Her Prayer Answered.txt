Her Prayer Answered
 One of Jehovah’s witnesses in Massachusetts (U.S.A.) had this experience: “I called at the door the other day and as I started to witness the smiling lady said: ‘Are you one of Jehovah’s witnesses?’ I assented. She then asked me in and told me she had just been praying that one would call. And as soon as she had prayed the doorbell rang, and I was there. The significant part of that call was that I did not intend to call at that house when I got out of my car. I had previously left two magazines with a man who showed very little interest, but then suddenly the thought came to me to call there anyway.”

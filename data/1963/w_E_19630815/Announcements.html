<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="ss"><strong>ANNOUNCEMENT OF ANNUAL MEETING</strong></p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Yearly the annual meeting of the members of Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania is held on October 1, and in 1963 this date falls on Tuesday. The meeting will be at ten o’clock in the forenoon on Tuesday, October 1, and will be held at the office of the Society located at 4100 Bigelow Boulevard, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">A regular letter of notice of annual meeting will be sent to each of the members of the corporation. The members will wish to be certain that these letters of notice reach them by seeing to it that the secretary’s office has their present mail address to which to send the notices.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">As is the usual procedure, the notices will be accompanied by proxies. The proxies should be returned by the members promptly in order to reach the office of the secretary of the Society not later than September 15. The proxy should be returned by each member whether the member is going to be at the meeting personally or not.</p>

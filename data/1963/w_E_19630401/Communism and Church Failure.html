<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">In a speech to a Methodist convention in 1962 Bishop John Owen Smith deplored the failure of the church. He asserted that “communism came into being because Christianity dropped its cross, didn’t want to do the difficult, but just sang its songs and said its prayers.”—<em>The News and Courier, </em>Charleston, S.C., July 30, 1962.</p>

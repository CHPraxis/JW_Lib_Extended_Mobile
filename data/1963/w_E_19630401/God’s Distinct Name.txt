God’s Distinct Name
It is not unusual for modern Bible translators to obscure the name Jehovah by substituting “LORD” for the name recorded in the original Hebrew. It is interesting to note the comment of T. V. Moore, then pastor of the First Presbyterian Church, Richmond, Virginia, who wrote in his translation and commentary on Haggai, Zechariah and Malachi, page 55: ‘We have retained the name Jehovah, instead of rendering it LORD, because the sacred writers make a marked distinction between this name of God and every other, and a distinction that ought not to be concealed in translation. It is his covenant title, embodying in its structure the unchangeableness of his existence as the guarantee of his faithfulness to his people. See Exodus 6:3.”—January 1, 1856.

● Darkness hovers over mankind in both the East and the West, Christendom’s religions notwithstanding. “It would be a travesty of the truth to suggest,” asserted English minister Falkner Allison, “that the darkness which broods over human life in this country of ours, the darkness which results from rejecting the light, is any less than the darkness of ignorance which broods over India and the other so-called non-Christian lands.”

<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">PALESTINE RISETH</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">W</span><span class="font11">HEN the Zionist movement was young, and that's duly six years ago, its ardent enthusiasts used to dream of a Palestine of </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">4,000,000 </span><span class="font11">people, and possibly 6,000,000, living in a land made agriculturally rich by irrigation and industrially prosperous by hydro-electric i plants furnishing power to a varied selection of » industries; a country dotted with model garden *** and industrial villages and cities, connected with each other and with other parts of the East </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">by </span><span class="font11">railroads, electric lines and highways; a nation whose merchant marine reaches out to ■ all comers of the world from Haifa, terminal </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font11">Asiatic trade with Europe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">This dream is coming true, before our very eyes, because:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">1.</span><span class="font11"> The pledge of Great Britain, made through ; the Balfour Declaration of November 2, 1917, to do all in its power to establish the Jewish National Homeland, is about to be redeemed through the signing of the treaty of peace with Turkey, granting Great Britain a mandate over : &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Palestine. The mandate is expected at any time</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">(and may be promulgated before this is printed), as the Turkish treaty is now under discussion in Paris and it is said on the most reliable authority that the mandate to Great Britain is contained in the first ten articles of the treaty.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11">2. Millions of Jews throughout the world are awaiting the politic;’.! settlement of Palestine’s ' - status so that they can begin a mass-migration to the Holy Land, which so far has taken all the power and resources of the International Zionist Organization to restrain until the proper time for emigration arrives.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">BEFORE OUR EYES &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font11">t</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Jewish National Homeland has already been * put into operation on a small scale by the „ establishment of Jewish agricultural colonies, * reclamation of swamp lands to rid the country of mosquitoes, and medical and sanitary measures put into effect by the American Zion- : ist Medical Unit. To begin this program on a more elaborate scale and to take the first steps j toward the establishment of a flourishing coun- <sub>;</sub> j try in Palestine, the Zionist Organization of ] America is raising $10,000,000 throughout the 1 United States this year for its Palestine Re- <sup>1 </sup>storatiori Fund. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>

<p><a href="#bookmark17"><span class="font11">cooperation to the fullest extent with the Zionist</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark18"><span class="font11">Organization in preparing Palestine as the Jewish National Homeland, and declared that the</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark19"><span class="font11">present generation would yet see a population</span></a></p>
<p><span class="font11">of from three to four million in the Holy Land. ’ ;</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The reconstruction projects which the Zionist</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark20"><span class="font11">Society of Engineers will initiate through the</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark21"><span class="font11">fund now being raised throughout America,</span></a></p>
<p><span class="font11">include water-power development, by building canals, reservoirs, aqueducts and hydro-elec-trie plants; reclamation of the Hullah valley, including the drainage and clearing of the Hui-lah swamps, over 5,000 acres, and the reclama- -tion of 3,700 acres in the-Upper Jordan system; construction of a modem harbor at Haifa, making it the Amsterdam of the Mediterranean: connecting this new, great port with all parts &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;j</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">of Palestine and its hinterland and with the entire Near East by a system of standard-gauge railroads; building of roads and pavements throughout the country; providing water supply by conserving the heavy rainfall through reser-</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">voirs and wells; establishing a sewage-disposal system and converting the sewage into fertilizer; organizing various industries, chiefly cement mills with which to do most of the construction work in Palestine, owing to the lack of lumber, which will not be available until the afforestation projects are developed; shoe, clothing and furniture factories, canneries, tanneries, foundries and blacksmith shops.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Linked up with the industrial, commercial </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font11">agricultural rejuvenation of Palestine, are the plans for establishing a merchant marine, </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">for </span><span class="font11">which the Zionists propose an initial expenditure of $10,000,000. With Haifa made into the leading harbor of the entire Near East, as experts have claimed it will be, when life in Palestine is flourishing again its fleet of merchantmen will ply between all the leading ports of the world, carrying the new products of the Holy. Land. The first ship in this merchant marine was recently launched at Jaffa to sail between Beyrut, Haifa, Jaffa and Egypt. Elaborate ceremonies were held to commemorate the establishment of Palestine’s merchant marine, the wife of the English commandant at Jaffa christening the craft “Hecholutz” (The Pioneer) while Italian warships in the harbor at the time gave an official salute of twenty-one guns when the blue and white flag of Zion was flung from the mast.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">With all the vast agricultural, industrial and maritime plans which the Zionist Organization is putting into operation for the reconstruction of Palestine, what is probably attracting more world-wide attention than anything else is the establishment of a Hebrew University at Jerusalem. .Prof. Patrick Geddes of the University of Edinburgh, considered as the world’s most famous town planner, is now in Jerusalem working on-the plans for the Hebrew University, under commission from the Zionist Organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The cornerstone for the Univerity was laid recently on the Mount of Olives. Prof. Geddes has reported to the Zionist Organization that, through funds now being raised, the chemical laboratories will he completed by the end of this year, so that graduate students from the leading Universities of Europe may come to Jerusalem to work out there immediate problems arising from the agricultural rebirth of the Holy Land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">World-famous Jewish scholars have already volunteered to assist in the establishment of the University and to become part of its faculty, the most noted being Dr. Albert Einstein, who recently astounded the scientific world with his new theories on light rays, and Prof. August Wassermann, noted as the discoverer of the blood test which bears his </span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">num*</span><span class="font11">. When the Jewish National Homeland is established in Palestine and hundreds of thousands of Jews begin their mass-migration to the Holy Land, the Hebrew University will, according to the plans of its founders, be the world center for Jewish culture and education.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">In addition to working on the plans of the Hebrew University, Prof. Geddes is designing the new Jerusalem, a modern city to be the center of the new Jewish life that will soon be thriving in Jerusalem. He is planning a spacious modern city which, while capable of supporting a population several times its present size, will still retain its historical and sacred landmarks. In connection with the University, Prof. Geddes has reported that he is designing a Museum, which will be to the University what the British Museum and Louvre are to their respective Universities in London and Paris.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Lack of an adequate water supply has been Palestine’s vital need since Moses led the return from Egypt; but James Haines, secretary of the Zionist Society of Engineers and one of the leading engineers working on the reconstruction of the Holy Land, declares that there is enough rainfall in Palestine to support a population of 15,000,000—over two hundred and fifty times its present population.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“The average yearly rainfall of 26 inches, which falls in five months of the year, can easily be stored by the erection of reservoirs,” said Mr. Haines. “This r</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">ainfall</span><span class="font11"> is one-quarter greater than in California. It will supply a future population of 6,000,000 with a daily per capita supply of 2,055 gallons, which is over 1,200 gallons more than the average daily consumption in New York City.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Because the Mediterranean is at a higher level than the Jordan and the lakes, and because of the stony underground surfaces which retain the water so easily, Palestine is favored in engineering projects planned to store up large quantities of water, according to Mr. Haines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Irrigation of Lower Palestine will also be</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">, accomplished by tapping the Nile, according to Zionist engineers, who will follow British engineers in this, as all of Southern Palestine was .supplied with water from the Nile in a remark</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">able </span><span class="font11">engineering feat of the British Royal Engi</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">neers. </span><span class="font11">It has been estimated that there are between 3,000 and 5,000 square miles in the Sinai peninsula alone, requiring irrigation, which would be furnished from the Nile.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Isaac </span><span class="font11">Herbst, another Zionist engineering </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">expert, </span><span class="font11">has brought forward a plan to utilize </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Palestine’s </span><span class="font11">vast water power for hydro-electric plants, because of the lack of coal in the Holy </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Land. </span><span class="font11">He proposes building two hydro-electric &gt;&nbsp;v plants in the Upper Jordan Valley and Lake Tiberias, with a capacity of 100,000 horsepower </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">’ an </span><span class="font11">hour. Two canals necessary for the plants </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">will </span><span class="font11">divert the Jordan from the Hullah swamps </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font11">convert eight square miles of useless land into fertile fields, he points out. These plants will mark the first step in the rapid industrial development of Palestine, says Mr. Herbst.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">i </span><span class="font11">While millions of Jews throughout the world are awaiting the word that will permit their leaving for Palestine, there are thousands of tourists and pilgrims, anxious to visit the Holy ‘ Land in far greater numbers than before the </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">war, </span><span class="font11">according to the Zionist Organization. To </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">provide for </span><span class="font11">them, the erection of a chain </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font11">Urge hotels throughout the Holy Land has been </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">proposed </span><span class="font11">by the London Zionist Organization, with the principal hotels in Jerusalem, Jaffa and Haifa, and smaller ones in such historical spots as Tiberias, Safed, Hebron, Gaza, Acca and Beersheba. Health resorts, built around Palestine's hot springs and mineral waters and bathing beaches near Haifa and Jaffa, have also been proposed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Haifa, according to the Zionist engineers, will be the largest and most important city of Palestine after the Jewish National Homeland is established, as they claim it will be the principal outlet for all Asiatic trade to Europe, because of its connections with the Bagdad railroad. To provide for its increasing population, it is proposed to continue the city along the beautiful slopes of Mount Carmel; while on the summit of Mount Carmel, according to the plans, a large hotel and resort will be erected to welcome visitors to the Holy Land. Dr. Chaim Weizman, President of the Zionist Organization of England and head of the Zionist Administrative Commission in Palestine, discussing the vast commercial prospects of the country said recently that Palestine would be the bridge between Bagdad and Cairo and between Constantinople and Calcutta.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Thus ancient prophecy and modem practical idealism are uniting to bring to pass a great vision to gladden the hearts of all mankind.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">(2) </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">DENIAL OF JUSTICE—THE FACT</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19200317_files/g_E_19200317-5.png" alt="" style="width:16pt;height:18pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font11">HE realization that there are grave defects in the administration of justic&amp; Mas come but slowly. Had. not enough laws beejci passed, enough courts organized, court Mouses built, judges, clerks,, and officers provided and paid salaries? What more was necessary? AVher. Roscoe Pound delivered his epoch-making address on “The Causes of Popular Dissatisfaction with the Administration of Justice” before the American Bar Association in 1906, his was like a voice crying in the wilderness. From the reported discussion,* one would judge that most of the lawyers were incredulous, and that not a few were indignant at the intimation that pux’ justice was not closely akin to perfection itself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">In the twelve years that have followed, the evidence has become overwhelming. The facts, though not the causes which underlie .them, are well known. The administration of American justice is not impartial, the rich and the poor do not stand on an equality before the law. the traditional method of providing justice has operated to close the doors of the courts to the poor, and has caused a gross denial of justice in all parts of the country to millions of persons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Sweeping as this indictment may appear. It' is substantiated by ample authority.* A few statements deserve to be presented here:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“If there is one sad anomaly that should stand out in our present days of conscientious self-searching, it is the harsh </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">fact</span><span class="font10"> that, :vith all our prating about justice, we deliberately withhold it from the thousands who are too poor to pay for it*</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“The sources from which industrial unrest springs are: ... 3. Denial of justice in the creation, in the adjudication and in the administration of the law.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“The equal administration of the laws is a right guaranteed by the fundamental law of the land; and yet no person will deny that this privilege is more honored in the breach than in the observance; for there arc ver.' manv people in every American community who, through ignorance of their rights or their inability to pay the imposts levied by the state as a condition prece-</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">dent to the pursuit of justice in the courts, are con-^tantly being denied that equal administration of the laws and the justice that is supposed, logically, to follow it.*</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">■’Taking the country as a whole it is so obvious that we have almost ceased to remark it, that in petty causes, that is, with respect to the every-day rights and wrongs of the great majority of an urban community, the machinery whereby rights are secured practically defeats rights by making it impracticable to assert them when they are infringed. Indeed in a measure this is so in all causes. But what is merely exasperating in large causes is dowqright prohibitive in small causes. While in theory we have a perfect equality, in result, unless one can afford expensive and time-consuming litigation, he must constantly forego undoubted rights, to which in form the rules of law give full security, but for which, except where large sums are involved, the actual conduct of litigation affords no practicable remedy.*</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“Many causes have contributed to this neglect which disgraces American justice.”*</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">The </span><span class="font11">majority of our judges and lawyers view this situation with indifference. They fail to </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">see </span><span class="font11">behind this denial of justice the suffering </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font11">tragedy which it causes, the havoc which it </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">plays </span><span class="font11">in individual lives, and the influence which </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">it exerts </span><span class="font11">in retarding </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">our </span><span class="font11">Americanization pro</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">gram. “The </span><span class="font11">judicial department”, said Chief </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Justice </span><span class="font11">Marshall,* “comes home in its effects </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">to every man’s </span><span class="font11">fireside. It passes on his </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">property, </span><span class="font11">his reputation, his life, his all.” Be</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">cause </span><span class="font11">law is all-embracing, the denial of its protection means the destruction of homes through illegal foreclosures, the loss through </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">trick-or </span><span class="font11">chicanery of </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font11">lifetime’s savings, the taking away of children from their parents by fraudulent guardianship proceedings.* Hundreds of thousands of honest men, many of them immigrants, have been unable to collect their wages honestly earned.*</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Denial of justice is not merely negative in effect; it actively encourages fraud and dishonesty. Unscrupulous employers, seeing the inability of wage-earners to enforce payments, have deliberately hired men without the slightest intention of paying them.* Some of these employers are themselves poor men, who strive in this way to gain an advantage. The evil is not one of class in the sense that it gives the poor over to the mercies of only the rich. It enables the poor to rob one another; it permits the shrewd immigrant of a few years’ residence to defraud his more recently arrived countrymen. The line of cleavage which it follows and accentuates is that between the dishonest and the</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font11">honest. Everywhere it abets the unscrupulous, ,' the crafty, and the vicious in their ceaseless plans for exploiting their less intelligent and &lt;&nbsp;Jess fortunate fellows. The system not only robs ' the poor of their only protection, but places in the hands of their oppressors the most powerful and ruthless weapon ever invented. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;’</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The law itself becomes the means of extortion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">As Lord Brougham said of the English administration of justice in 1800, it puts “ a two- I edged sword in the hands of craft and oppression”. From the cradle.to the grave the poor man is the prey of a host of petty swindlers,* who find it easy, through such devices as fraudulent assignments, trustee process, or garnishment of wages for fictitious debts,* to rob and despoil. There exist today businesses estab- <sup>? </sup>lished, conducted, and flourishing on the princi-pie that as against the poor the law can be violated with impunity because redress is beyond their reach. It is this situation which allowed such unrestrained abuse of the laws regulating the assignment of future wages that a sort of quasi-slavery resulted, which brought the loan shark into being, and permitted flagrant usury to grow into a monstrous thing.*</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The effects of this denial of justice are far reaching. Nothing rankles more in the human heart than the feeling of injustice. It produces a sense of helplessness, then bitterness.* It is brooded over. It leads directly to contempt for law, disloyalty to the government, and plants the seeds of anarchy.* The conviction grows that law is not justice,* and challenges the bo-lief that justice is best secured when administered according to the law. The poor come lo_ think of American justice as containing only laws that punish and never laws that help.* They are against the law because they consider ■ the law against them.* A persuasion spreads that there is one law for the rich and another for the poor.*</span></p>

His own children </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">went to </span><span class="font11">bed supperless. The next morning he sought out a lawyer, who told him that to bring suit the costs and the fee would be $10. This he </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">could not </span><span class="font11">pay. From there he went to the Mu</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">nicipal </span><span class="font11">Court, originally known as “The Poor </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Man’s </span><span class="font11">Court”, where he saw a judge, who was </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">obliged </span><span class="font11">to explain that he had neither the time </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">nor the </span><span class="font11">money nor the right to undertake the </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">necessary </span><span class="font11">proceedings; that as the man had no </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">money, he </span><span class="font11">could not prosecute the case; and that, inasmuch as the expenses would exceed the amount in dispute, he had better drop it.

<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">• The </span><span class="font11">effect on the immigrant is peculiarly unfortunate. He comes to this country, often from lands of injustice and oppression, with high </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">hopes, </span><span class="font11">expecting to receive fair play and square </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">dealing. </span><span class="font11">It is essential that he be assimilated </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font11">taught respect for our institutions.

Through bitter disillusion</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">ment he </span><span class="font11">becomes easily subject to the influences of sedition and disorder.*</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The essentially conservative bench and bar will vehemently deny any suggestion that there is no law for the poor; but, as the legal aid societies know,* such is the belief today of a multitude of humble, entirely honest people, and in the light of their experience it appears as the simple truth. Consider, for example, this actual case !* A woman borrowed $10 in 1914, and for two years paid interest at ISO per cent. In 1916 a law was enacted fixing 36% as the maximum rate.* The lender, by a device contrary to the statute, compelled her to continue paying 156% interest. The law also provided that if excess interest were charged, the Ioan would be declared void by a suit in equity.* The law was on the books. The court house was open, the equity court in session with its judge on the bench and its officers in attendance. All that was of no avail to her; for the law could not bring its redress until $5 was paid for service of process and entry fee, and $10 to an attorney to draw, file, and present the necessary bill of complaint. Fifteen dollars she did not have and, because of her condition, could not earn. For,her there was no law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Repeated warnings have come respecting this: </span><span class="font10">&quot;When litigation is too costly, the result for many persons is a denial of justice. Such denial or partial denial of justice engenders social and commercial friction. The sense of helplessness thus caused incites citizens to take the law into their own liands. It causes crimes of violence. It saps patriotism and destroys civic pride. It arouses class jealousies and breeds contempt for law and government.* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">‘'The problem is fundamental. It strikes at the very root of our economic, social, and political structure. The man or woman who has honestly toiled and cannot obtain the wages earned, loses faith in humanity and the efficacy of our laws and courts; is often turned out a beggar, vagrant,.or criminal, or seeks redress by forcible means.*</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">‘If ever a time shall come when in this city, only the rich man can enjoy law as a doubtful luxury, when the poor who need it most cannot have it, when only a golden key will unlock the door to the courtroom, the seeds of revolution will be sown, the firebrand of revolution will be lighted and put into the hands of men, and they will almost be justified in the revolution which will follow.”*</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">In that direction we have imperceptibly, unconsciously, and unintentionally drifted. The end of such a course is disclosed by history. By the third century A. D. class distinction had been set up by the Roman law. For an excellent statement, see Davis, “The Influence of Wealth in Imperial Rome”, page 323. Differences in the ability of classes to use the machinery of the law, if permitted to remain, lead inevitably to disparity between the rights of classes in the law itself. And when the law recognizes and enforces a distinction between classes, revolution ensues, or democracy is at an end.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font3"><a name="bookmark23"></a>r SOCIAL AND EDUCATIONAL</span></h4>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">A Dying Profession</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">T</span><span class="font11">HE teaching profession has had the most exciting year in its history. It has been the most docile of all professions, and one of the most useful. It lias until recently numbered 750,000 in America and from early morning until late in the afternoon has had the care of the 20,000.000 little men and little women that in a few years will be the bulwark of the country. It has done more to Americanize the children of immigrants to this country than have all other forces put together. It has been true to its trust.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">During the war the number of teachers was necessarily reduced, the estimated number of vacancies in urban and rural schools running to 50,000. It was hoped by lovers of America and American institutions that with the opening of a new school year these vacancies would be filled and the work of instructing Young </span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">Am</span><span class="font11">erica would take on a new life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">It was a shock, therefore, when it was discovered that 22% of these teachers during the summer of 1919 had quietly folded their tents and disappeared. They did not strike. They simply quit. In six of the Southern states it was estimated that one-third of the schools were left without any teachers. Subsequently more than half of these vacancies were filled, but with teachers that were inexperienced and incompetent as educators of Young America.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Reports reached us from Utah. Colorado, Wisconsin, West Virginia, and New York states that many.schools were without teachers. In West Virginia 400 schools were without teachers, and in New' York 1000 schools; the total shortage of teachers in New York state was estimated at 5000., It was estimated that at the beginning of the school year 6% of the nation’s schools were unable to open for lack of teachers. This meant that about 1,000,000 of America’s little men and little women could receive no education at all for a part of the precious time during which they fit themselves for life’s battle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Moreover, the teachers that quit were the best ones, and this quitting of the best teachers has been a constantly progressing evil. In 1SS0 43% of the teachers in the United States were men; in 1914 this number had been reduced to 20%. There was a reason why men would not stay in the profession.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The United States does not stand as high in education as it did, or as it should. It is now eighth among the nations in literacy; one of every ten adults in cities can not read or write; and one of every five adults in the country is illiterate. In one state last year, many of whose schools were closed on account of lack of teachers, there were 10,895 children that did not have a day’s schooling in the entire year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">School-teachers have a good many discouraging conditions to meet. They do not have the equipment w'hich they should have; they do not have even enough room for all the children that should be required by law to attend. If all the children of school age in America did attend the public schools, 40% of them would have to stand, as there would be no accommodations for them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Many have left the teaching profession because of their conviction that it is not for the best interests of themselves and- their pupils that they should have nothing to say about formulating courses of study, selecting textbooks, choosing types of buildings and equipment, and formulating budgets; and it is a fact that in many places boards of education have been dictators, and incompetent if not malevolent ones at that, of matters about which the teachers knew far more than themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">In a few places the teachers have also objected because they thought they were not given sufficient liberty in respect to their political opinions; but as a rule teachers in the United States have generally and properly had a large amount of personal freedom in such matters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Wages the Real Trouble</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">T</span><span class="font11">HE teachers have not wanted to say much about it, and many of them would deny that they have left the teaching profession on account of insufficient pay; but the facts are that, the profession has been almost ruined by a tradition which has somehow fastened itself upon society that teachers do not expect and should not receive a living wage, as though teachers were a necessary evil instead of one of the greatest assets of the country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">While the United States was still poor, and even after its riches had begun to be developed, the wages of school-teachers were usually $2 per week and boarding around. There was not much inspiration to high endeavor in wages like that; but when it was die best the district could afford it was accepted as a matter of course, though merely as a stepping stone until the teacher could get something else to do. Up to 1900 it was a good country school that paid more than $35 per month; but board was only $2.50 to $3 per week and what was left would go much farther than it does today.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Within the past year the whole subject of wages has been pretty generally overhauled in public. The school-teachers are among the most intelligent of all readers; and as they read the published facts they began to think of their own wages and to make invidious comparisons of what they considered the public thought of the services of others as compared with their own.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The average teacher spends fifteen years preparing for his work; but at seventy years of </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">age </span><span class="font11">his total earnings, counting the value of board and room, are not much above that of a domestic servant. When he is seventy years of </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">age </span><span class="font11">he has received only as much money as a plumber can make by the time he is forty. Teachers receive 16 cents an hour, but skilled manual workers 60 cents to $1 an hour. The average teacher receives $1.63 per day; she must usually spend hours at night preparing her lessons, with no pay for overtime.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">It is said that school-teachers in New York begin with $80 a month, while ragpickers get $33 per week, window cleaners $7.50 per day, and bricklayers $8.75 to $10.00. The street cleaners, garbage collectors, motormen, subway guards, janitors, teamsters, and laundresses are all better paid. The street cleaners get $400 per year more for initial salary than do the teachers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">In an issue of the Raleigh </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">News Observer </span><span class="font11">appeared two advertisements, side by side, one for a colored barber, guaranteeing $25 per week with $35 if satisfactory, and the other for a white teacher of Latin in a high school at $70 per month for the ensuing nine minths. Thus, for improving the inside of the head a total of $630 was to be had, but for arranging the hair on the outside a possible $1820.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">An investigation conducted in La Crosse, Wisconsin, showed that in a year the high school pupils expend $4000 more for candy and movies than the sum total yearly salaries of the high school teachers. There the parents seem to think more of the entertainment of their children than of their instruction, their life capital, so to speak, though actually not so. But what can we say to the children when the grown folks pay a single player $20,000 for six months’ service on the ball field, and a prize fighter $250,000 for a single fight and do not pay their professors enough to live on?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Last Fall the Manchester </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Union</span><span class="font11"> advertised for 100 teachers for New Hampshire rural schools at $15 per week, while most of the young women in the neighboring cloth and shoe factories were making $30 per week. About the same time, in England, the Kent Urban District Council advertised for an official rat catcher at £250 per annum, but pays its teachers £240 a year after twenty years in the service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">There were twenty-nine American states last year where the average teacher’s wage was under $550. The minimum wage of the teachers of Worcester, Mass., is, or was until recently, $675 per year. The minimum wage in Iowa is $57 per month, in Illinois $1000 per year. California, Massachusetts and Illinois pay the highest salaries to teachers and have the least shortage of members of this profession.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">What has happened is that low wages have driven many of the best teachers into better paid positions, and that those who are left very probably, whether they would admit it or not, feel a certain amount of resentment against the public for treating them so unjustly; and yet it is upon these teachers that the chief responsibility devolves of making the boys and girls into true Americans, proud of their country aud of its institutions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Practically all the college women are turning away from teaching to better paid occupations. One woman’s bureau reports more vacancies than applications. The teaching profession is dying at both ends. Attendance at normal schools is falling off. In New Jersey, where there were 2200 students in the normals in 1916. there are now but 1400. New York state normal schools also report a big decrease in enrollment. </span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">Am</span><span class="font11">bitious young men and women will not train to be teachers when there is not a commensurate living in the work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">In this country there arc oeelesin’tical politicians of a certain type that would like well to see </span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">Am</span><span class="font11">erica's public schools ruined. These</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">same ecclesiastical politicians are to be found in all so-called civilized countries. Their constant effort is, and for fifteen centuries has been, to get education out of the hands of the people and into the hands of priests and nuns, thus to kill it. Illiteracy in Spain is 70%, in Italy 73%, and in South America it is 90%.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The country needs more teachers, not fewer. There was never a time when they were so much needed. Besides the regular school-teachers we </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">need a </span><span class="font11">trained corps of visiting teachers to make a constant round of homes, prevent truancy, prevent children leaving school prematurely or unnecessarily, prevent delinquency and other-f &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wise assist socially. To draw proper talent</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">J ‘ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from other lines of business and save a ruined</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">profession the minimum wages of all teachers L should be at least $1500, sufficient to allow for f proper culture in the form of travel, books, I &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;music, and necessary recreation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">jj &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Teachers* Labor Unions</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">W</span><span class="font11">ITH everybody else organizing, it is hardly to be wondered at that the prevailing fever <sub>f</sub> should have hit the teachers. Some time ago the American Federation of Labor had 126 local <sup>1</sup> organizations of the American Federation of Teachers affiliated wi th them. These locals were <sup>f</sup> to be found among the college professors of the ( University of North Dakota, the University of Montana, Columbia University, sixteen other universities in New York state, high schools in Kansas City, Kansas, and many other places. Practically the whole teaclung force of California was said to be thus organized. These unions have succeeded in some instances in raising the 1 minimum salaries of grade teachers over 100%.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The teachers in Pittsburgh must be organized, too; for we notice a dispatch saying that they ■ have served notice on the board of education that they must be paid a flat increase of $500 per year, to take effect within thirty days, or they will quit in a body. Similar demonstrations • have recently taken place in New York.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Teachers’ unions operating along similar lines have been organized in France and England.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">, When the British government awarded its railway men 100% increase as the least they could offer in view of the greatly increased cost of living, the teachers also demanded 100% in-• crease, not discerning any good reasons why 1 heir advance in wages should be no more than 10% to 30%.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">During the vacation season last Summer the New York Mayor’s Committee of Women on Reconstruction and Relief proposed to assist the teachers who did not get enough wages to exist upon, and at the same time to aid the women who did not want to do their own housework wliile on vacation, by sending out a letter advocating the employment of teachers to do the work. The letter suggested that the teachers do the work for about half the usual pay, and thus get a nice vacation in the country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Most of the teachers to whom the plan was suggested did not seem to see anything very attractive in a proposition to cook for a large f</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">amil</span><span class="font11">y of s</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">umm</span><span class="font11">er vacationists as a means for obtaining a “nice vacation’’ for a tired teacher, nor were some of them able to see their way clear thus to break down the wages of the regular household servants. They prefer to be paid a just wage for the services they render to society and to plan their own vacations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">In the long ago the teachers taught only a handful of followers grouped about their feet. Thus the Apostle Paul speaks of himself as . “brought up in this city at the feet of Gamaliel”. (Acts 22:3) We have no doubt that Gamaliel was well recompensed for this work, as he should have been. St. Paul is supposed to have come from a wealthy family and to have been well able to pay adequately for service rendered. We do not suppose it was necessary for Gamaliel to wash dishes during vacation in order to make a living.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">There is one kind of teaching that will be entirely discontinued some time in the earth, and that is religious teaching. This all seems very strange in view of the strenuous efforts now_ being made to get pacific China, Siam and India up to the high standard of the three great Protestant nations: Germany, England, and America , as they were on August 1,1914. Yet the Scriptures are very plain. They read:</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“After those days, saith the Lord, I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people. And they shall teach no more every man his neighbor, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for they shall all know me. from the least of them unto the greatest of them, saith the Lord: for I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more.’’'—Jeremiah 31:33,34.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">These figures are authoritative because based on the universally recognized monthly “price </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">index” </span><span class="font11">published by Bradstreet’s. If the objection were raised that the comparison is made with the lowest year, the figures would be increased only a few percent if comparison were made with the average of the years 1895 to 1899.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">In other words, the dollar is worth a third now of what it was in 1896. The 1896 dollar would buy three times what the 1918, or 1919, dollar would buy. If, instead of the average buying power of the twelve months of 1919, the month of December, 1919, is compared with 1896, the buying power of the dollar is 29 cents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Expressed in terms of salary or wages, the 1896 clerk earning $100 a month ought to have had a salary of $345 in December, 1919, in order to be able to purchase the same quantity of the ninety-six commodities in both instances. The laborer earning 1.50 or $2.00 a day then should earn a wage of $5.17 or $6.90 today. A worker that is earning less than 345% of what the same position paid in 1896 is that much poorer off than he should be.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Figure up your wage or salary, and see how well off you are. Then, if the production of President Day, of the Equitable Life Assurance Society, comes true in 1920, watch the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">29-eent </span><span class="font11">dollar shrink; for he, and other members of Big Business think ‘ the possibility of reducing the high cost of living is very remote”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">It is all right for presidents and financiers to spend money prodigally; but it is an economic evil for common people to pour out easily-earned funds like water, if said people are not in the president-financier class. “The war”, laments Mr. Day, “thrust upon us an unnatural and unbalanced prosperity and left us a legacy of inflation, speculation and excessive improvidence. A large volume of easy money has found its way into the pockets of many people to whom a substantial cash surplus &quot;was a new and tempting possession, followed by a great passion for expenditure and pursuit of pleasure by those of improvident and self-indulgent tendencies. With so many people in this spendthrift mood, so many outbidding each other for some of the necessities and most of the luxuries of life, any material reduction in the cost of living seems a remote possibility.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">But are the people such spendthrifts f To do a normal amount of spending in </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">December, 1919, </span><span class="font11">one would have to spend 345% as much as in 1896 for the same things. To enjoy a really 100% spending spree a man—or a woman— would have to exceed perceptibly the 345% limit; and it is doubtful if </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">the many</span><span class="font11"> are so doing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">One class that is hard hit by the 245% rise in living cost is the owner of bonds, mortgages, notes, or of other documents or securities pronu ising only a fixed rate of interest. In the earlier period of 1896, a first-class bond paying 44% would sell at, say, $100. Conversely a high-grade railroad bond could be sold for $100, if it paid 4|%, the regular earning power of money.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Thousands of careful investors in the '90’s filled their safe deposit boxes with securities bought on a 4.50%<sub>o</sub> basis. A $1000 bond would pay its owner the modest sum of $45, and the $45 in money would buy a real $45 worth of commodities. For that investor to be as well off today as he was in 1896, his bond ought to earn him 345% as much as in 1896. A $1000 bond should pay the investor now 345% of $45, or</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">$155.20. If it does not, its owner is that much poorer. The value of railway bonds, expressed in terms of the purchasing power of income, has declined about 70% since 1896; for the income will buy only about 30% of what it would then. The value 01 the bond itself has gone off a like amount for the same reason. The owner of a snug little figure of $100,000 in 1896, if he still has the $100,000, is really worth only about what an 1896 savings of $29,000 would have amounted to; for $29,000 in 1896 would buy the same things as $100,000 today. The other things that </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">make up a </span><span class="font11">fortune have lessened in worth. Land, houses, stores, apartment houses, factory buildings are worth as much less today than they </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">would have </span><span class="font11">been worth in 1896, if their selling value, or the rentals they pay have not kept up </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">with </span><span class="font11">the 245% increase in commodity prices. Stocks that sell for $100 today are of the same real value as stocks that sold for $29 in 1896.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">In this invisible manner rich and poor </span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">alik</span><span class="font11">e have grown poorer in the last few decades, excepting the favored ones that have received the 245% increase in income. It is curious that something like this was foretold about 1900 years ago in the following language: “Go to now, ye rich men. Your riches [money, stocks, bonds, properties] are corrupted, and your gar-• ments [fortunes then consisted partly of costly garments stored away] are moth-eaten. Your gold and silver is cankered [rusted away]. Ye [profiteers] have heaped treasures together for the last days.” (James 5:1-3) But these strange things are now seen to be among the steps by which the Father is leading the world as he guides them to the doors of the Golden Age, the portals of the kingdom of heaven on the earth, for soon men will be more like brothers, and the pride of wealth and the envy of poverty will no longer exist.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Sugar Situation</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">T</span><span class="font11">HE average American f</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">amil</span><span class="font11">y consumes 465 pounds of sugar per year, 116 pounds of which is produced in </span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">Am</span><span class="font11">erica; 302 pounds comes from Cuba and the balance from Hawaii, Porto Rico and the P</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">hili</span><span class="font11">ppines. Cuba lies so near the United States that during the war, when shipping was hard to procure, practically the whole crop was marketed here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Prior to the war Great Britain had obtained her sugar from Germany and Austria; but during the war this supply was not obtainable and the ravages of the conflict destroyed a large part . ' of the fields and factories of France, Belgium, | Germany, Austria, Rumania and Russia. These 1 former sugar-producing areas are not now pro-during half of their former output, but merely enough to take care of their own requirements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">During the war the cane-sugar countries increased their production from 10,000,000 to 12, 000,000 tons per year, in partial offset of the reduction of output of the beet sugar countries &lt;&nbsp;from 10,000,000 tons per year to about 5,000,000 tons per year. It is estimated that in the Fall 1 of 1919 the net situation was that at the conclu- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark26"><span class="font11">sion of the ca</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">nnin</span><span class="font11">g season the w’orld had about</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark27"><span class="font11">4,000,000 tons less on hand than is usual.</span></a></p>
<p><span class="font11">Directly after the armistice, and for several ' months following, the times were not good in the</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark28"><span class="font11">United States or anywhere, and the allotted - * American two-thirds of the Cuban sugar crop</span></a></p>
<p><span class="font11">did not find ready purchasers. Additionally the Atlantic Coast refineries and warehouses were crowded with the </span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">All</span><span class="font11">ies* allotted one-third, sent there to be refined. Meantime, speculators who understood the real situation secured op- . tions upon </span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">imm</span><span class="font11">ense quantities, and concealed it * with the sure knowledge that in 1920 they would be able to make great profits upon it</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The close of the 1919 canning season found the </span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">Am</span><span class="font11">erican portion of the Cuban crop gone, but the warehouses still bursting with the sugar which </span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">had</span><span class="font11"> been reserved for the Allies, and to which they were entitled. Since then we have , been on a sugar rampage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">During the war the United States was Cuba's only direct customer; but when it came to disposing of the 1920 crop she refused to be gov-emed any longer by the war arrangements and, before Uncle Sam knew what she was about, had sold half of her crop to foreign buyers. So it happened that in the Fall of 1919 we were short of sugar, largely through the activities of ’ speculators, and we shall be more short in the Fall of 1920, for Europe is to get still more of <sub>f </sub>the Cuban crop than in 1919. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Some est</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">ima</span><span class="font11">te the shortage as running to several million tons and are fearful that the price to the consumer may go to 35 cents per pound. The experts agree that there is an actual sugar shortage in the world due to the destruction of European fields and factories and that it will be some years before new fields and factories, there and here, can meet the situation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">In the end the sugar scare will be a good thing</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">for the United States. It will encourage sugarbeet farming, which will improve vast areas of now unprofitable land. The sugar-beet tops and pulp, when returned to the soil, enrich it and make it suitable for production of other crops. The United States has only 514,000 acres in sugar beets, while Europe has 6,000,000 acres but there is enough available sugar-beet acreage in the United States to raise all the sugar in the whole world. Meantime, even at present high prices, it is best for </span><span class="font10" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Golden Age </span><span class="font11">readers to buy sugar during March, April,, and May, when it will be on hand in good supply, if they want any later. Uncle Sam has been paying for foreign sugars $500,000,000 per year. ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Crystallized sugar, made from sugar cane, was imported into Europe from India as early as 500 A. D. In Bible times honeys and syrups took the place of sugar. For an interesting honey story read Judges 14:1 - 20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Square-Deal Johnson &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">By j. </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;">r.</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"> aoranfio</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">INDUSTRIAL rest and prosperity in and around Binghamton, N. Y., are due largely to methods that will obtain during the Golden Age. Endicott, Johnson &amp;&nbsp;Workers, Inc., the largest shoe manufacturers in the world, are the direct cause. Mr. George F. Johnson, who has risen from a shoe worker at the bench to the managing head of this large concern, deserves the lion's share of credit and is able to appreciate the position of both capital and labor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">All through his thirty years of m</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">a</span><span class="font11">nagement Mr. Johnson has kept the confidence and esteem of his employes, and is thought of not as one who has exploited labor in the past and has watched to take advantage at the first opportunity, but as an elder brother or father: one to whom they can go in trouble of any land and receive help and advice cheerfully given.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Mr. Johnson says that the employer should be the natural labor leader, and that if he is not, labor will look elsewhere for a leader. So he has instituted what he calls the square-deal policy ; and the workers, appreciating that they are getting a square deal, have erected an arch at the entrance to Johnson City, N. Y., and Endicott, N. Y., with the inscription: “Entrance to the Square-Deal Towns&quot;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The Endicott-Johnson corporation believe that their responsibility does not end with just compensation for work done in the shop, but that the outside environment should be made as pleasant as possible. To quote Mr. Johnson, “I do not believe in having a few millionaires’ homes on the hills overlooking the factories, and tho workers living in poverty&quot;. But he suggests what he calls his labor creed: “A great industrial establishment should as closely as possible follow the old idea of small business, in which the master had his shop and his house adjoining, and he and his workers and apprentices lived as well as worked together&quot;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">And this creed is carried out by this employer. His home is not a great mansion, but a modest home right among the workers—not even a “Keep off the grass&quot; sign, or a fence to keep others from enjoying the lawn surrounding it. Not content with having a home for himself, his present building program calls for approximately six hundred modern homes which are being built and sold on easy payment plan to the worker at cost Thus we can see already having a fulfillment conditions of which tho prophets spoke, when each shall live under his own vine and fig tree.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Then, too, spacious parks are provided for the use of the workers and their families as well as others, no one in the community being barred from the privileges. There are playgrounds for the children, swimming pools with all kinds of contrivances for water sports, and a racetrack with some of the best horses in the country appearing there free to all. The best bands in the world are brought here for open-air concerts without charge. In addition to this the musical program calls for the services of about ten local bands, which give free concerts throughout the community each evening.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The health of the workers is looked after at the corporation’s expense, they maintaining livery efficient and up-to-date medical department, equipped with all that the latest medical science affords, the service of which is also free for the use of the workers’ families. A sick relief, whereby the worker receives $15 dollars a week when ‘sick, is maintained at a cost of 10 cents a week to the worker, the company making up most of the amounts paid out in benefits.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The old dinner pail and cold lunch have given way to large, modern restaurants, where good wholesome food is served three times each day for 15 cents a meal, a posted notice calling attention to the fact that this price entitles tho worker to all he wants to eat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Under the control of the corporation is a number of theaters where the best high-grade pictures are shown tor a small price, the company paying the difference between the admission charged and cost of operation. </span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">A</span><span class="font11"> monthly magazine is published which is open to the employes for exchange of ideas, suggestions of efficiency, etc., subscription free to the workers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font11">forty-eight-hour week is maintained with Saturday a half-holiday. Recognizing the need of change and recreation, each worker receives </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">two </span><span class="font11">weeks' vacation with pay, and in addition is paid for five holidays </span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">ann</span><span class="font11">nally.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Although we find many heads of different industries with ideal policies, yet very often these policies are not carried out by their subordi</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">nates. In the </span><span class="font11">case under consideration this is guarded against in that the power to discharge </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">any </span><span class="font11">worker has been taken from foremen and superintendents and now rests solely with the general manager, who is always w</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">illin</span><span class="font11">g and anxious to hear any grievance or comp</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">lain</span><span class="font11">t the worker may wish to bring to him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Much has been written recently regarding the bringing together of capital and labor and having them work in harmony. It also has been pointed out that this is impossible under the ordinary arrangement, because their a</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">ims</span><span class="font11"> are </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">opposite. Mr. </span><span class="font11">Johnson has evidently solved this problem by making the aims of both capital and labor identical, through a bonus or profit-sharing plan. Under this arrangement the management claims that capital is entitled to a fair return for money invested and that labor also is entitled to a fair wage, good working conditions, reasonable hours and proper treatment—the remaining profits belonging to neither capital nor labor, but to both.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">So after paying a 7% dividend on the preferred stock and 7% dividend on the co</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">mm</span><span class="font11">on stock, and 3% to reserve, the balance of the surplus is split fifty-fifty between the workers and the owners of the common stock, which profit may be distributed in common stock or in cash, at the option of the board of directors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">To qualify for this distribution the worker has to be in the employ of the company throughout an entire year prior to the day upon which the dividend is declared. All workers share alike. The liigl st paid man and the lowest paid office boy get exactly the same share of surplus, their varied abilities having been taken care of in their salaries or wages. A further policy of the company along this line is that all the best jobs in the factories are filled from the ranks—no good positions filled from the outside, but always from the inside.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Nor has the good work of this great concern ended with the immediate community, but the entire world is a benefactor; for this company has eliminated practically all middle-men and, instead of taking the middle-man’s profit, has given it to the consumer by having its own tanneries as well as retail stores, thus carrying out the concern's slogan, &quot;From hide to wearer&quot;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Telephone and Storm.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="text-decoration:underline;">W</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">HA</span><span class="font11">T a storm may do to the telephone service is little appreciated by any but the executives and the workers of the telephone system. In Northwest Ohio a hurricane swept out of the north, and before blowing out over Lake Erie greatly injured that part of the telephone investment represented in outdoor equipment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The wind ran as high as ninety miles an hour, which is 132 feet a second. The pressure exerted upon a building, tree or pole with its wire equipment may be appreciated from the simple fact that every second the weight of air hurled against a 30 by 30 foot side of a building at .080681 pounds per cubic foot would be 4.79 tons. Terrific pressure is brought upon often weakened poles when the wind blows, as it did, 78 miles an hour at Toledo, 79 at Elyria, 65 at Sandusky, and up to 90 at some points. The poles went down by wholesale — 798 in the Toledo exchange and hundreds at other points, totaling over a thousand, about 80% of which could be reset. Where poles did not go, wires were broken, putting hundreds of individual phones out of co</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">mmis</span><span class="font11">sion. Trees went down before the wind and tore down the wires. Tn one place a barn door sailed through the air and brought down its quota of lines, together with three poles, which could not stand the impact in addition to the wind pressure on the swaying wires. Everywhere the damage was repaired in remarkably short order. Within an hour after the storm struck Dayton, where 160 poles were down, and 51 circuits out of commission, the repairmen were out; and within twenty-four hours service was restored on all but one line out in the country with 85 poles gone over a distance of forty miles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Users of telephones realize little of the amount of hard and dangerous work sometimes required to keep the service going.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Color Quality and Quantity</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">rpHREE factors enter into the determindtion -*• of color quality; viz., </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">hue, value,</span><span class="font11"> and </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">chroma</span><span class="font11"> or intensity, as there are three factors in connection with tone (i. e., pitch, intensity, and duration), three in connection with light (i. e., wave length, wave amplitude, and wave complexity), and three in the realm of the electric current—voltage, amperage, and ohmage.</span></p><img src="g_E_19200317_files/g_E_19200317-6.png" alt="" style="width:234pt;height:47pt;">
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">CH/ZOHA</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Hue has to do with the chromatic scale of primary and binary colors, ranging from pure yellow as the highest note to pure violet as the deepest. But any one hue on the chromatic scale can be diluted with either white or black, thus forming tints and shades respectively, ranging all the way from almost white to almost black. All these tones (either the normal color or its tints and shades) we call </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">values</span><span class="font11"> of the given normal color. A new scale is formed by this process, very much as a singer ascertains his own “register’, then sings the scale within his own range and with his own personal quality of note. Or it is perhaps more nearly comparable with a musical key. But any value of any hue can be grayed by the addition of its complement, and thus the intensity or luminosity of the original tone is reduced.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font11">color dictionary has been published with some thirty thousand hues, values, and intensities printed and designated. This means that instead of the twelve hues shown here, there would be, say, sixty; instead of seven values there would be, say, fifty of each hue; instead of two intensities there would be, say, ten. This would make the thirty thousand, though the hues, values, and intensities may not be divided in just that proportion. Probably the trained eye can discern twice this many tones, but they would not be practical for present-day commercial purposes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Mass is, of course, the sole distinction as to quantity; but it is important. A small amount of brilliant red might be very pleasing, but a great quantity abhorrent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Making Kalahari a Garden</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">A</span><span class="font11">LL Africa needs”, every one from Africa says, “is more water and more good people.&quot; Turning the vast Kalahari Desert in South Africa into a garden spot is one of the new projects. This desert covers some 300,000 square miles, and is sandy and dry beyond any present use. It is proposed by. irrigation to bring into being in this immense area a lake twice as big as Lake Erie. The Chobe River in the long ago ran through the Kalahari Desert? and the proposition is to dam up its present course and turn it back to become the agency for making happy homes for the thousands of immigrants that are to be attracted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Rivers and lakes disappear in the Dark Continent. It seems as though much of the vast territory of the continent might dry up and become as Sahara and Kalahari. Lake Ngami in British South Africa was described by Livingstone as a vast inland sea; now it has become a body of water some twenty miles long and but five miles wide. Once there were large rivers in this region; now they are gone. At times in heavy rains, the level country is covered with water as far as the eye can see; but it quickly-dries up. The estimate is made that in a hundred years this section of Africa will be seemingly a hopeless desert like the Sahara.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The move to recreate a great lake in the Kalahari is something that looks forward to the better things to come, when the minds of great and powerful men will no longer be upon war and destruction, but upon gigantic projects for the beneficent purpose of making this a better world to live in; for it is written that in the Golden Age, “in the wilderness shall waters break out ’ [probably by irrigation, but no doubt partly by divine power], and streams in the desert: and the parched ground shall become a pool, and the thirsty land springs of water'”.—Isaiah 35: G, 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">• Ice Houses Healthiest</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">I</span><span class="font11">T IS for Eskimos, not for Americans, that ice houses are best. The Eskimo ideas and ideals of sanitation are primitive, and any attempt to &quot;modernize’’ the race by having the cement trust supply them with concrete homes in place of ice or snow igloos, would kill them off. The Eskimo is healthier, warmer ami more comfortable than he could possibly be in a house that obviously is a good thing in a country where water—and sewage—remain liquid and can be conducted away from the premises.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">According to the explorer Stefansson,</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">&quot;The Igloo, or domed snow hut, serves as a home for two or three weeks. Then they build a new one. Because it is new it is clean and sanitary. It is as warm and comfortable as an American library. A candle gives os much illumination as an electric light, because of the intense whiteness of the snow. The snow house will stand under any conditions. It is as comfortable a home as man could wish. But the concrete hut, like the wooden hut, must be uncomfortable and unsanitary. Wherever the natives have changed from the snow to the wooden home there have followed pneumonia, typhoid and a tremendous increase in the death rate. Contact with civilization has already affected the Eskimos and they are dying off. They must soon be extinct, and the concrete hut would only hasten the extinction.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Americans like “civilization’’ and are proud of it for the same reason that the Turk likes his style of living—because they are used to it. There is nothing ideal anywhere, but the time is at hand when ideal conditions will be discerned; and the race, Eskimos and all, under the inspiration and the wisdom of the Golden Age, will move up to higher levels and will ever be following the vision just beyond of better and better things to come.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Waking Up to the Typewriter</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">W</span><span class="font11">ITHOUT a typewriter an American office would not be an office, but a relic of a past age. But Europe has been writing with pen and ink, and is just waking up to the typewriter. In France the courts are working on the problem whether a document such as a deed or a mortgage is legal if written on a typewriter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The world war taught Europe many things, among others to value the typewriter. Prior to the conflict the proportion of the .American writing machine output that was exported was to 40%; now it is .'lEl . The machines would be going over t he water much faster if Europe could get the credits, necessary to correct the unfavorable conditions of exchange. When the great loans that are expected have been made, the situation will be improved and a much greater volume of typewriter exports is looked tor as a result of the credits.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Europe needs among other things modern office methods. She will be helped in effecting this improvement, because the prices of writing machines have not increased nearly as much as those of other products, partly perhaps because the prices were unduly high before the war. Improvement is the order of the day, and the tendency will become ever more marked as the Golden Age comes on.</span></p>

<p><span class="font16">T</span><span class="font11">HE sound-proof telephone booth is a rarity, but it has been discovered that any booth can be made absolutely sound-proof if it is lined with tin. The new idea is applicable in other places where it is desirable to exclude needless sounds. One or two layers of tin or aluminum in partitions or between floors is equally effectual in shutting out the noise of the neighbor’s daughter’s piano, or the music of the ragtime phonograph in the flat above. Family quarrels can be conducted without risk of the neighbors’ listening, the dog can bark to his heart’s content, and the head of the house can indulge a man’s prerogative of relieving himself with unseemly vocal sounds. The tin-lined house would be fire proof, or fire resisting. If the tin manufacturers can be waked up to the new field for sale of their products and the architects roused to the desirability of getting inexpensive soundproof effects, the era of the tin house may become a reality.</span></p>

Between the Southern Pacific Railroad tracks and the Gulf of Mexico, at a point some 125 miles west of New Orleans it is reported that a vast body of minerals has recently been discovered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Within 150 feet of the surface is the top of </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font11">vein of good bituminous coal which has the extraordinary depth of seventy-nine feet; and below the coal, with an interval of only twelve . feet, is a bed of pure rock salt which was penetrated for 1949 feet without reaching its bottom, that being the point at which the drill was withdrawn. This makes this deposit one of the five greatest salt deposits in the world, and possibly the greatest. Other notable deposits are located in Western New York, Germany, Czecho-Slov-akia and India.

<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Governmental Limitations </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">By Frank Burnett </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">MR. </span><span class="font11">EDITOR: I have lately subscribed to</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Golden Age,</span><span class="font11"> and like it very much; but I would like to criticize your article on “Governmental Limitations”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">In the first place you fail to distinguish between brute competition and friendly competition. Experience proves that the former degrades to the level of the brute, while the latter has an elevating effect and increases the total of human happiness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">You say in the article, “Any man who has the idea that it would be better for the government to own and operate all industries would do well to visit any public building and note the general shiftlessness,” etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Now that may be in the East, but not so on this coast. I have lived in fourteen counties on the Pacific slope, have traveled in many more, and have done some janitor work; hut never have I seen any public building that was not as neat and clean as the private ones.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Further, you seem to recommend government ownership and operation of telephones, and later yon say that municipalities have engaged in the milk business with good results. Now I want to ask, If the principle of public ownership is good in the matter of telephones, why is it not good in the matter of public buildings? And whose fault is it if there is lack of efficiency along any line in government if not that of the people? The success of any kind of democratic form of government depends upon the intelligence of the common people, and their diligence in seeing that the law is enforced.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">May we not reasonably hope that in the Golden Age, now dawning, employes of any kind in their labors will be inspired with the idea of cooperation embodied in the words, ‘•Love one another”, uttered by “The Man of Galilee '? Then there will be no question of efficiency along any line.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Farmers in Politics</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">A</span><span class="font11">S A matter of self-protection the farmers are entering politics in an extensive way. determined to take over the supervision, through legislatures and Congress, of the packing and other industries that handle the food products of the farm, as well as of the railroads that have not always been quick to adjust things to the advantage of the agricultural interests. Hitherto the farmers have been a comparatively helpless class, but shrewd observers say that the 1920 elections will see the American farmer taking up the reins to drive the horse himself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The way has been blazed in Canada, where the farmer-labor combination controls Ontario,.and where the politicians promptly rescinded all the laws they feared might bring down on them the displeasure of the new element in control. England has followed Canada’s lead; and British labor men are taking their places in government, local and national, in the face of the powerful opposition of even Lloyd George.. Soon it is predicted the British government will pass into the hands of the duly elected representatives of labor. An astounding fact, to the old-line British politicians, was that they were deserted by the middle-class clerks and other white-shirt workers, who for the first time threw in their lot with the rest of the working people. In France Clemenceau went down before the workers'* choice, Deschanel</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">New Power* in Politics</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">I</span><span class="font11">T IS becoming quite evident that 19'20 has in store some surprising events in the November elections. It is freely predicted by party managers that the successful party will be the Republican or the Democrat party. This may be so,- for it is a tedious task to get voters into a new party. But it is the attitude of those elected, not their party names, that is liable to prove significant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Two entirely now political forces are in the field, or will enter before the elections. Both have grievances strong enough to make them try to see that they are represented in legislative halls and perhaps in executive chairs. The working men realize that the efficacy of the strike as a tool for advancing their material interests was largely destroyed by the Anderson injunction against the coal miners and the active operations of the executive branch of the government in the coal strike. It was widely predicted then that the nullifying of the purposes of the trades union would drive the workers to the Ballot. That this will be the case no one can doubt, who has perceived the drift of sentiment on this subject.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The workers may be expected to do hard and effectual work toward putting men to represent them in the various legislatures and in Congress. It will be easier to get voters to cast their ballots for workers running under old party names than to disconnect them from their parties in large enough numbers to elect, for example, a new Labor party, though this will have a large vote. Labor men can readily enough be elected as Republicans or Democrats, but especially as the former, on account of the unpopularity of the Democratic party, owing to certain of their policies and acts. As.Republicans, labor men could vote in the interests of labor just as effectually as under a new banner. It will not be surprising, then, to see a solid block of labor Republicans, perhaps added to by a block of Democratic labor representatives.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">A similar attitude of dissatisfaction exists among the largest single element of voters, the farmers. Some 40% of the voters are probably in this class. The farmers have learned well the lesson that the easiest method of obtaining direct representation is under the old party names, as was done in the Nonpartisan League.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">There are many legislative and Congressional districts where the farmers are in an overwhelming majority, and it is thought that the election next fall may see the quiet lining up of the farmer vote under the banner of whichever old party is predominant. The purpose of the farmers will not be to elect a Republican or a Democrat, but to choose </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">a farmer,</span><span class="font11"> to see that no longer are the interests of the country’s most important class of producers made the football of the giants of wealth and business.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">With the advent of the farmer and the laborite on the floor of legislative bodies and perhaps in executive chairs, the new phenomenon will appear of the control passing from the hitherto powerful—the rich and the old-style politicians—to classes having more at heart the interests of all the people. If absolute control is not vested in the combined labor and farmer legislators, there should be enough of them to hold the balance of power, which is sometimes as effectual ns having all the power. The common people may expect to get back some of their lost liberties. If people do not now feel free to talk, to write, to print things, or to assemble in peaceable fashion, it will not be long before they will enjoy the old-time American freedom, for example, of talking without the suspicion that some one may be listening to throw them into the courts. Writers will be able to write with the chains off their pens. Peaceable assemblies of common people will be held without the slightest apprehension of invasion by mobs or of personal injury at the hands of representatives of the law. And when people can talk, write, and think as they please, they will no longer care so much about the liberty to do these things; and the fires of unrest and agitation will die down from lack of fuel. Then, their minds free and easy again, they can get to work and produce in the old fashion. —</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">It is well known in England that there is nothing to fear from the labor men; for once in power they become conservative from the very responsibility of power.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Likewise nothing need be feared from such a change in the United States; for the farmer is naturally a wall of conservatism, and even extremely radical workers, if any, would soon find that the weight of the cares of the actual conduct of government would sober them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">This is a period of change. The change is in' the direction of the good of all the people. It is the transition from the old order to the new —from the old “'world”, or state of affair.-, toward the better one of the Golden Age.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Farelest Street-Cars</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">OT that street-cars are to see their patronage diminish until no one rides on them; but an ideal, to be reached when there will be countless riders and not one of them would pay his fare directly, though indirectly it would be paid at cost price.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">.The electric railway business has reached a distressing state. The traffic is making a normal increase from year to year, but in certain cities the fare remains the same, in the face of mounting costs. In other cities the fare has been “adjusted”—in plain words, raised—to from six to ten cents a ride. Even this expedient has failed to give much relief; for less people ride, the volume of business falls off, and the additional revenue per fare is in danger of being eaten up by increasing overhead costs, which are heavier per fare, because there are less I'- fares. The net profit is about the same, as far as the financial condition of the roads is con-1 </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">i</span><span class="font11"> cerned. Everywhere that the fare jumps up, , private enterprise steps in and provides bus lines to carry the people, more uncomfortably, but at the old price of five cents, making an additional reason why the number of fares on the electric railways should decrease.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Evidently the time predicted is at hand when the owners of the electric railways would find their investment a burden. They are beginning to see a light which they could not discern while the roads paid a good profit. Even in New York City the railway owners are thinking that perhaps municipal ownership is not such a bad tiling, especially when the city may be induced to take the bad-bargain electric railways off the hands of private enterprise. A few years ago public ownership was anathema; for the roads \ paid •well. Municipal ownership was making good in some important cities, but the railway “experts” were at hand in the newspapers columns to “prove” that there was no failure anywhere like that of municipal ownership everywhere. O Wali Street, thy name is legion!</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The common people care nothing who owns the street railways. What they do care for is service. They want the service at a reasonable price, though under private ownership they object to paying for the dead horses contained in stock issues nearly all water and bond issues 25% to 40% water, which have been foisted upon the railway companies by the enterprising promoters who issued the securities and with them “sold'’ a small army of “innocent” third-party investors, who at the outset were willing, to take their share of the initial profit, but now are bad losers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">However, the railways may soon gain municipal owners. Then the new owners will have to meet the same old problems. The lines must pay, and that means the maintaining of the balance between fares received and expenses paid. If the fares are raised the people will growl at the municipal administration and perhaps change it. If the fares are kept stationary, the service may run down at the heel, and the people may change the administration for giving poor service. Cities grow, and extensions of lines must be built This takes money; and if the lines have poor prospects of paying, the money cannot be had from private owners, and must be raised by taxation. There is little chance of greater economy under public than under private ownership, and the net result is liable to be more taxes. Then the big taxpayers will use money and power to change the administration. Coming and going, under public ownership, the administration will see “parlous times” before matters are adjusted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">It has been suggested that under municipal ownership the lines might be run on the same basis as the streets and all the costs be paid by taxation. Streets cost a great deal of money, but no one has to pay to ride on them. Sidewalks are costly, but no one pays a fee to walk on a sidewalk. Why, then, should one pay to ride- on a municipal railway!</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">We are talking of something that may be considered an ideal, not as immediately practicable. People do not pay to ride on elevators vertically. What greater reason is there why they should pay for being transported horizontally? Neither is a charge made for a ride on an escalator in an obliquely upward direction. In the less enlightened days of the nineteenth century it was the rule to pay to pass over a</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">road—“turnpikes”, they were culled then—now it is a mark of backwardness to see a region with toll gates. Xot over two decades ago the privilege of going over a highway bridge was paid for; now practically all bridges are free.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">At first the people would ride on the fareless street-cars more than they needed to do; but the novelty would quickly wear off. In candy factories the girls are encouraged to eat all the candy they want; but it soon cloys. Boys and idlers might think they could spend their time on free street-cars; but they would tire of the same ride; and as- idlers now are not permitted to spend their time in public buildings, so they would not be allowed needlessly on the cars.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The person riding on a street-car is not by any means the only one benefited by the transportation. Without the street-cars the great stores would be impossible; for they draw patronage from a wide area, and the trade they now handle would be taken care of in smaller stores serving smaller areas. The store benefits from the cars, as does the owner of the store building, the managers and owners of theaters, hotels, markets, churches, offices and the lesser stores. All the unearned increment of downtown real estate comes from whatever transportation brings the people to the doors of the stores and offices. The mill and the factory are possible because the people are brought by a transportation system, without which the owners would have to establish smaller industrial institutions or none at all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">It is a little unreasonable to let the people that are brought to the stores, offices and factories, pay the entire cost of their transportation; for they are not the only beneficiaries. If all paid that are benefited, part of the burden of the street-car would fall on the owners of real estate, and of the various businesses that live on the people assembled by the street cars.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">If the street transportation were supported by taxation the burden would fall with practical equality, especially if the head, or per capita, tax were raised a little to take any undue burden off the property and business owners. Then the street railways would be operated for service; and while the taxpayers would call for as low operating cost as consistent with proper service, the question of profit would not enter in, any more than a municipality thinks of making a profit off the streets or the schools. The question of raising money for betterments and extensions would be readily met because the value of the investment would be in the improvement, and private investors would put their funds into such bonds as readily as into any other municipal bond backed by city credit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">It would make little difference to a working man where he lived, so far as cost of getting to work is concerned. Time would be the only factor. Family after family would move out of the tenements and slums, the children of the city workers would get their place in the sun, and each working man might have a little home and a garden of his own off in the suburbs or out in the country. The city's density of population would be relieved, and there would be a chance of having better apartments for the poor as the pressure for homes lessened and competition for tenants sprang up among owners of tenement and flat buildings. Gradually the factories would move out where the workers lived, the city would move out toward the country. In place of the unsanitary crowding of the &quot;modem” city, as one looks into the future, there would be the pleasant vision of the stretching out of suburban or village life for mile after mile, out in the fresh surroundings of the big healthful world that encompasses the comparative squalor of the city.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">In the event of municipal ownership becoming a reality, it should not be forgotten by those in charge that the promotion, financing, and developing of the electric railway system w’as a work calling for great ability, energy, labor and selfsacrifice: and those that bore the burden and heat of the day should be given a square deal, and paid a just price for their properties. The fact that the railways, through world-wide conditions, have become unprofitable should not lead to the driving of a sharp bargain in their acquirement. The people appreciate the service rendered by the men of ability and foresight who projected and executed vast plans that have proved of inestimable benefit to all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Whether these things are realized or not, something like them will become an actuality in the not distant future. It would seem that however we may forecast the future, the actuality is always a little, or a good deal, different and better. If the cities are not to have free streetcars, they will have something better. For the Golden Age is about to come, and the minds of millions of able men and women will work out things better than today we can even dream.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Arid Acreage at $525</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">T T SEEMS almost impossible for the Eastern 1 man to realize that arid lands in the West, which were entirely worthless a few years ago, ' wore sold in the year 1919 for as much as $525 per acre; yet it is said that even this high price was secured for some lands in the Snake River Valley, in the vicinity of Twin Valley, Idaho. A price of $350 per acre was obtained for a ten-acre potato ranch near Nampa, in the same state. These prices are unusually high.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Some farmer accustomed to the development of irrigation lands gets his farm in good condition for cultivation and his fruit trees approaching maturity, when along comes a man from the Middle West with plenty of hard cash that he wishes to invest in just such a piece of land. The deal is closed, and away goes the first farmer and his family to do the pioneer work on </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">; f</span><span class="font11"> another tract.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The continual moving around of the progressive farmers of the West is doing 3 great deal for them and for the country. Farmers from the Atlantic states, the Southern states, the Middle West, and the Far West are brought into contact with each other; each has something of information to impart and something of i value to learn. In a very brief time men of this stamp turn a wilderness of sand, upon which it looks as if nothing of value would ever grow, into a thriving city or village of several thou-! * sand people, all by the wise use of a little water carried for many miles from its source in a mountain torrent, hugging the hillside, winding in and out like a snake until finally the vantage </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">J</span><span class="font11"> point is reached where the waters can be diverted to the plains below.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">A curious sight to the Easterner is his first observation of these irrigation ditches, usually first discerned in the vicinity of Denver, but - . common to all points west of that gateway to the Rocky Mountain and Pacific Coast states. As one goes westward from Denver to Golden City the grade of the boulevards is so slight as to be hardly noticeable to the eye. Away up on the edges of the foothills, hundreds of feet above the highway, he sees irrigation ditches in parallel lines leading from the mountain streams out to the plains about Denver, but to the eye having the appearance of water running up hill; The slopes of the land are so gradual in the valley as to deceive the eye respecting the actual down-grade, but seeming up-grade, of these irrigation ditches.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The government’s stories of what has been accomplished on some of its reclamation projects read like fairy tales, but are the most simple, matter-of-fact truths. Nine years after the water was turned into the ditches at Orland, California, it had three banks with deposits oyer $1,000,000, real estate improvements amounting to $960,000, live stock values of $640,000, and irrigated acreage estimated as worth $2,610,000 exclusive of improvements. The Orland Jerseys won all the grand prizes at the Sacramento state fair. All of this development has occurred on a property est</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">ima</span><span class="font11">ted as worth but $25,000 nt the time the water was first brought into the community by irrigation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">At an irrigation project in Colorado in 1919, a canning company put up a million and a half cans of tomatoes; and a grower of Elberta peaches marketed 50,000 boxes from fifty acres, at an average price above 90 cents per box. (While we are on the peach question we remark an item which appeared in the papers last Fall that an Indiana consumer of a box of peaches found a memorandum from the grower in Texas stating that he had received 50 cents for the box; the consumer paid $2.50—nice little profit for some “business men” on the way!) </span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">_</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">At another Colorado irrigation project, on thirteen acres of land, some Japanese farmers made $9,000 in 1918 and repeated the performance in 1919, raising onions. At the. latter project, and at many other places throughout the West,-the farmers are organizing beet sugar companies, to take advantage of the high prices for sugar now obtainable, and expected to continue for many years to come.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">In the Boise Valley, Idaho, the key to prosperity for the farmers was found largely in live stock, it having been discovered that the valley was a natural section for blue-grass, and therefore particularly suited to the raising of cattle and hogs. At the Milk River project, Montana, the farmers gathered a third cutting of alfalfa in 1919. This is unusual for Montana. (It is said that in places in Palestine as many as eleven crops of alfalfa are now being gathered in a year, due to ideal climate, increasing rains, and a hot, limestone soil.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">On the Newlands irrigation project in Nevada a small boy marketed $125 worth of canteloupes which he raised on a plot of ground one-eighth of an acre in extent. On the Carlsbad project in New Mexico cotton to the value of $1,000,-000 was raised in 1919. On the Rio Grande project, near El Paso, Texas, there were produced in the Mesilla Valley 625 cars of canteloupes, seventy-seven cars of cabbage, and thirty-two cars of pears, besides thousands of crates of other fruits.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">On the Umatilla project in Oregon the frosts have usually given the fruit growers much trouble, and some have become discouraged and have either gone in for alfalfa farming or moved away. However, some years are very good. The peaches in this section were sold to the local evaporating companies at $40 per ton. A {&gt;rice of two cents a pound does not seem very arge to pay for fine peaches.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">There is a good deal of water in. a peach, and it must take considerable expense to get the water out. We do not know how many peaches go to make up a pound of peaches either in their natural state or as dried peaches; but we do know that the wholesale price of dried peaches in New York is 23 cents per pound, and it looks to us as though buying natural peaches at two cents per pound and selling them in the dried form at 23 cents per pound left the way open between Oregon and New York for a number of “business men” to be nicely cared for. We cannot see any reason &quot;why anybody on the road could be as anxious about the weather as the poor fellow to whom a frost may mean ruin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">On the Strawberry Valley project in Utah 540 cars of peaches were marketed in 1919, and in the same season 100 cars of pears at $800 per car, 60 cars of prunes at $750 per car, and 200 cars of apples at $800 per car. The total value of the fruit crop to the growers is estimated to have been $900,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The Yakima project, in Washington, produced in 1919 a trainload of fruit twenty-two miles long, worth $4,000,000; the Yakima apples are famous in all parts of the country. The district also produces large quantities of soft fruits, potatoes, hay, and pork. At the Okanagan project, in Washington, it is estimated that a single highway bridge sustained during the season the carriage of 1000 carloads of apples inbound to the station, with 500 carloads of box shooks, lumber, coal, and wheat outbound over the same bridge. This load was so heavy as to require the services of two traffic officers, one at each end of the bridge, to keep the traffic spread out sufficiently to maintain safety.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Great and wonderful as have been the irrigation projects already developed in the Far West, we presume that they are as nothing compared with works yet to be undertaken and successfully carried to completion in those regions. The sources of the great rivers of the West— the Rio Grande, Arkansas, Platte, Missouri, Yellowstone, Snake, Columbia, and Colorado— are far up among the everlasting snowa of the Rocky Mountains, and most of their waters come from the melting of those snows. Great as would be the expense and the difficulties encountered, there is nothing impossible in the thought that nearly all the waters of those rivers may yet be diverted so that every part of the basins which they traverse shall receive a due proportion of the life-giving floods. This would not quite, but almost, cause the Great American Desert to disappear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The actual disappearance of the Great Desert, and of all deserts, will surely come about in the Golden Age, in many instances — possibly in most instances—by the gradual work of reclamation, but in other instances by such changes in the climate as the Lord sees will be best calculated to bring the desired result.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The snowfalls in the mountains can usually be depended upon as sufficient to provide reason-ably full streams throughout the season; but occasionally, as was the case last Summer in Montana, the snows went off the mountain tops too early in the season, and a drouth resulted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">During the winter of 1918-1919 the snowfall was unusually light in some parts of the Sierra Nevada mountains of California. A similar condition prevailed during the winter now dosed, and leaves a few power plants and other projects short of water. It is comforting, under such circumstances, to reflect that the Lord has the Pacific Ocean right at hand, and that in places it is seven miles deep. When he gets ready it will be easy for him to sprinkle as much of it on the Western states as he sees best.</span></p>

<p><span class="font16">A</span><span class="font11"> LITTLE friend in Indiana asked us this . question and we replied as follows:</span></p>

This is the best we can do by way</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">of explanation at present.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">■ We </span><span class="font11">have heard from the lad to whom we for-</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">warded </span><span class="font11">the query and he writes us as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“Dear </span><span class="font10">Dad: </span><span class="font11">I </span><span class="font10">have just received a letter from The Golden Age, stating that a boy in Indiana wishes to </span><span class="font11">know </span><span class="font10">what makes the earth go 'round, and that they are sending his letter to a boy who has the ‘Book of Knowl-</span><span class="font11">&quot; edge', </span><span class="font10">in the hope that </span><span class="font11">he </span><span class="font10">will look the matter up for him. I presume I am the boy. If I am not, I beg The Golden Age's pardon. But anyway, I have looked up the answer, and you will find it enclosed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“Business </span><span class="font10">attended to, I wish to speak to you per</span><span class="font11">sonally. Look </span><span class="font10">out for the flu! 1 </span><span class="font11">I </span><span class="font10">hear it is raging down </span><span class="font11">there.

Affectionately, Jr.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The extract from the &quot;Book of Knowledge’’ follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">s </span><span class="font10">&quot;The sun's gravitation is certainly not the answer to this; for if the earth became still, the sun would pull it into itself at once. There is some other source of the </span><span class="font11">earth's </span><span class="font10">motion, which was imparted to it or present in </span><span class="font11">;it when it was </span><span class="font10">formed, and which through all the ages </span><span class="font11">has not been done </span><span class="font10">away by friction—since, as it appears, </span><span class="font11">t the* </span><span class="font10">is </span><span class="font11">no </span><span class="font10">friction </span><span class="font11">as </span><span class="font10">the earth swims through the ether.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">If there </span><span class="font10">were any, surely by this time the earth would </span><span class="font11">have </span><span class="font10">been slowed down much faster and would have </span><span class="font11">; rushed </span><span class="font10">into the sun.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“This </span><span class="font10">original motion with which the earth began, </span><span class="font11">and </span><span class="font10">which it. still has, must have the some origin as the earth’s twisting motion on itself, the motion through space, the twisting motion of the other planets, and the twisting motion of the sun. We know that all the planets twist and move in the same direction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“For the source of all this motion, we must go back to the source of all motion and all power, bode to the Author of all things. This is only to say, in other words, back to the Creator. No astronomer, however wise, has yet been able to ascertain the true cause of the earth’s motion.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Eight-Day Watches</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">F</span><span class="font11">ROM the tiny “dime” watch movement, the size of a dime, to the new eight-day watch is a long step in watchmaking. The little watch, one of the smallest of the watch family, is a marvel of workmanship, and when set in its platinum case, encrusted with rubies and diamonds, it is a jewel of a watch, a combination of rare beauty. The new watch, is the result of long experimentation. Efforts were made long ago by the founder of the Waltham watch industry to make an eight-day watch, but it was found that a movement of ordinary eighteen size could not be relied upon to maintain a constant rate for an entire week, and the manufacture of the watch was abandoned. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">New ideas in watchmaking and new demands have brought about further research work and now there is a reb'able eight-day watch, the movement of which is two and three-eighths inches in diameter. It would take up the whole of an ordinary vest pocket and could not be worn as a wrist watch, but it is accurate enough to be used as a ship chronometer, as an automobile watch and in airplanes. Whether it is equipped with a bell and can be used to get up-by mornings is not stated, but its convenience where continuous service is a desideratum is manifest. There are clocks operated by dry batteries that will go for a year and a half, but the two-year watch has yet to appear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Whether man will ever gain the ability that some animals seem to have of telling time accurately without a time machine is not certain, but it would be convenient, if in the Golden Age one could merely refer to an inner consciousness of time with a mechanical adjunct.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Revelation 10:6 teaches not that time will cease, but that a certain longed-for and prayed for event will be no longer delayed.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Intravenous Therapeutics</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">HE ancient and honorable way of medicating a sick person is by giving him the medicine to eat. What becomes of the drug when mixed with the powerful acids of the stomach appears to lie something of a mystery, but it is reason' able to think that any medicine that the stomach acids could affect would be changed in chemical composition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The modern way of introducing some medicines into the system is with a hypodermic needle, in the manner in which morphine and other drugs are injected. The difference is that the remedial agent is introduced directly into the blood stream in a vein, rather than into the tissues. The medicine is immediately carried unchanged wherever the blood goes, instead of with the delay occasioned by slow absorption from the more or less dense tissues.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Any physician who is able to introduce a fine needle into a prominent vein in the bend of the elbow can now administer intravenous medication, as it is termed, without the least misgiving or doubt. It is considered that many of the older remedies are better received when given intravenously than by the mouth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">‘ During the epidemic of influenza many physicians obtained truly remarkable results by the intravenous method. With a single administration of the drug the patient usually began a healthy recovery within three days. By this method one physician with a particular prescription claims not to have lost a case of pneumonia in a dozen years nor a case of &quot;flu’’ during the recent epidemics.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">_ The persons that are liable to get influenza are those in whose blood there is a lack of the white blood corpuscles, or leucocytes. This lack is technically termed leucopenia. The function of the leucocytes is to range about in the blood stream and to attack and literally absorb and ' thus destroy any bacteria or germs that may exist. Anything thdt increases the leucocytes increases power to resist disease, in other words immunity to disease. The effect on the number of leucocytes of the injection of a preparation of sodium salicylate and sodium iodid is as follows: number of h-ucoeytes before injection respectively 5500,7000,6500,6500,6000,8000; number after injections respectively 16,000, 15,000, y . 20,000,16,000, 20,000,18,000. This indicates that such an injection increases the leucocytes two to three times and in some measure, perhaps not in the same degree, increases the defensive pow- ' ers of the body against the disease. It would seem that if the intravenous injection effects a , 8 cure after the disease is in the body, it would O create temporary immunity if given to a person 7 • before he catches the influenza or pneumonia. d Just how long the immunity would last is- not <sub>&gt;5</sub>. certain; for no study of the permanency of the increase of leucocytes has been published.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">In order that there be no mistakes made we would state that such an administration of a medicine should be made by a physician, with an all-glass syringe, and should not be attempted by a layman; for there are dangers from improper or insufficient measures for sterilization of instruments, the skin, etc. As the publishers of this magazine do not wish to handle any remedies, we suggest gratuitously that a specialty of intravenous preparations is made by the New York Intravenous Laboratory, 110 East Twenty-third Street, New York, and that ? y almost any such preparation can be obtained ; from them through a pharmacist for use by a | physician only. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>r</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font11">No one can tell to what extent drugs will be employed as remedial agents in the Golden Age, but we do know that the time will come when the inhabitant shall not say, I am sick”. (Isaiah</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">33: 24) By the advances in the healing art then ; known the disease-resisting powers of the entire, population will be so increased that people will be healthy, sickness will be unknown; and finally death itself will become a thing of the past. <sup>;</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">This will take some time; for the last and greatest conquest of all will be that over death, as it is written, “The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death”.—1 Corinthians 15: 26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">This destruction of death is referred to again in Revelation 20:14 as the casting of death and &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">hell into the lake of fire.

Including an interview with Judge Rmherford. President of the Russellite organisations, was at our solicitation kindly contributed by Mr. G. G Driscoll, of Los Angeles. Cat, orgaulzor and manager of the Pastor Russell Lecture Bureau, which f-om IDOS to 1016 had Its headquarters In .New York City, London, England, and Melbourne, Australia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">C</span><span class="font11">HARLES TAZE RUSSELL, who at his death had a very large following in many countries throughout the world, and who was known the world over as Pastor Russell, was born in Pittsburgh, Pa., in 1852, and died in Texas in 1916, while on a train en route from Los Angeles to his home in Brooklyn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Pastor Russell's fame was largely based upon his interpretation of the Scriptures predicting the recent world war, which he in his writings for thirty years had shown would begin in y 1914, and by his insistent and continuous public proclamation by every' means possible repudiating the theory of a literal lake of fire and brimstone as a place of punishment for the wicked. Bible tracts distributed everywhere by the hundreds of millions; free booklets on special topics by the million; books, “Studies in the Scriptures”, which were sold in many countries with a total circulation of approximately twelve million volumes; and by the Photo Drama of Creation, a twelve-reel moving picture exhibition accompanied by phonographic talking records, which was exhibited as a road show in the larg</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">est theaters throughout America, Canada and Great Britain, especially elucidating the antihell-fire Scriptures—all these brought this work very prominently before the people, and all known supporters of this work became known as “Russellites”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Notwithstanding the long list of Scripture citations to prove his prediction of the then future world-war of 1914, Pastor Russell’s writings and lectures on the subject were not taken very seriously by the public until the actual breaking out of the war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Pastor Russell on many occasions by his individual activities and so-called “unorthodox” teachings aroused the ire of individual clergymen and sectarian partisans; but it remained for the world-wide anti-hell-fire campaign, which was greatly augmented by the publication of his weekly sermons in four thousand daily and weekly newspapers affiliated with the American Press and similar associations, to arouse the enmity of the clergy everywhere against Pastor Russell personally and against those who officially assumed the direction of and responsibility for the continuation of this world-wide work under the auspices of the Watch Tower Bibb' and Tract Society, the International Bible Students Association, New York People’s Pulpit Association. Associated Bible Students, and other auxiliary associations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'—</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Every denomination in the Evangelical Alliance, which was formed in 1846 to restrict further independent effort, openly opposes and cordially hates the Russellites. This enmity is declared by the Russellites to- be a case of “darkness hating the light”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The Russellites claim that the clergy, both Catholic and Protestant, have endeavored and are still both secretly and publicly endeavoring, to influence all, as they would have the public believe that the Russellites are Bolshevists, slackers, unpatriotic and unchristian imps of Satan, on the sure road to an eternity in a boiling lake of fire and brimstone in which to blister. burn and stew forever and forever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Russellites, calm under both pei-secutions and</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">prosecutions,’ have continued to prosper; and they state that (lie past year has witnessed the most phenomenal growth of interest since their organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Judge Rutherford, successor to Pastor Russell as President of the organization, when quizzed on the matter of Bolshevism, slackers, etc., said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Regarding Bolshevism: “I am not fully advised as to what Bolshevists teach, but insofar aa any </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">of</span><span class="font10"> them teach a resort to violence, we could not be in sympathy with them. For forty years Pastor Russell taught that he who has peace of mind and heart ia the one who trusts in the Lord; and he who would be shielded in the great time of trouble which is now upon the earth would be the one who would seek righteousness and meekness, </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">aa </span><span class="font10">the Scriptures teach. A resort to violence is contrary to the teachings of Jesus and the apostles. The members of our Society diligently seek to follow such teachings. Any accusation made that we are Bolshevists is wholly contrary to the truth, and we cannot believe that any one who knows us would make such a charge. We realize that we are living in the time foretold by Jesus when he said, &quot;The sea and the waves roaring’, meaning that the restless elements of humanity would be dashing against the solid part of society represented by the governments. We know what this trouble means, and we try to stand aloof from it and to point the people to the solution through Messiah’s righteous reign.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Regarding Slackers : “A slacker is one who refuses to do his duty. But a blacksmith would not be expected to practise medicine, nor would one training for a physician devote his time to political economy. By these illustrations we mean that men are specialists in their lines. A Christian of necessity must be a specialist, and his specialty is to prepare himself for the kingdom of Messiah. Wien he consecrates himself to do the Lord’s will, then he must follow the expressed will of the Lord as set forth in the Bible. For many years Pastor Russell conducted a theological school from which numbers of profound Bible Students have been sent forth as ministers of the gospel. Many of these ministers officiate as elders in organized Bible classes throughout America and foreign countries. Instead of being slackers, they give their time, strength and energy, often paying their own expenses, to carry out what they conceive to be their commission—to tell the people the divine plan for their blessing.</span></p>

(2 Corinthians 10: 3.4) The Congress of the United States recognized that there arc Christian people who cannot conscientiously engage in taking human life, and consequentlv incorporated in the Selective Service Law, Section IV. a provision that no one shotdd be com</span></p>

<p><a href="#bookmark48"><span class="font10">service when called for, and have readily done so.”</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark49"><span class="font10" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Regarding Patriotism: “True patriotism means ‘ love for the people of one’s own country; and surely no</span></a></p>

<p><a href="#bookmark53"><span class="font10">directing his words to the Christian, the Apostle says:</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark54"><span class="font10">‘Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves; but rather give place unto wrath; for it is written, Vengeance is mine;</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark55"><span class="font10">I will repay, saith the Lord*.—Romans 12:19.</span></a></p>
<p><span class="font10">“Of course, the man who has not devoted his life to the Lord is not governed by this rule, but may take a different course. His responsibility is different from , that of a Christian. The Quakers, Dunkers, and other religious organizations have made the matter of taking human life a special feature of their statements of belief or creeds. There seems to be no good reason why t other Christians holding similar views of the Scriptures cannot be governed by the same principles. For forty years or more Pastor Russell set forth the teaching of the Scriptures on this point, and those who agreed with . him followed these teachings. I dare say there are no people on earth who more willingly give their time, strength, and energy for the betterment of their fellow men than those who are followers of Pastor Russell.”</span></p>

And, of </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">’ course, we </span><span class="font10">expect the adversary and his instruments to </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">^war against us, </span><span class="font10">but we will not resort to his weapons </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">of warfare.

<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Concerning Persecution: Is it a new thing f to be persecuted for righteousness* sake?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">$ “It </span><span class="font10">is true that numbers of the members of the Inter</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">national </span><span class="font10">Bible Students Association throughout the </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">?

(1 Peter 4:12,13) It </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>J</sup>was Jesus </span><span class="font10">who said, If they have persecuted me they will also persecute you. If ye were of the world the world would love its own, but because you are not of this world, [not conformed to this present order] but I have </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Chosen </span><span class="font10">you out of the world, therefore the world hatcth </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">you.’—</span><span class="font10">John 15:18- 21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">“Jesus </span><span class="font10">was tried before the Supreme Court of the </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Jewish </span><span class="font10">nation and was unjustly condemned. He was then charged with sedition against the Roman government </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font10">put to death for that reason. The first Christian martyr after his time was Stephen, condemned on the same charge and stoned to death. St Paul on the same charge of sedition was imprisoned for four years. St. John on the same charge was imprisoned on the Isle of Patmos, during which time he wrote the wonderful book </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font10">Revelation. John Bunyan, because he refused to conform to the state religion of Great Britain, was held in y prison for twelve years. During that time he wrote ‘Pilgrim’s Progress’, which has thrilled the hearts of Christians from then until now. It will be neted that each one of these in turn was persecuted by men who claimed to be the followers of the Lord. We are not finding fault We are citing the facts and showing that * they are exactly in harmony with what Jesus and the apostles said would happen; and we are striving to follow the admonition of these great teachers: to rejoice in tribulation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“Every reformation has met a violent opposition on the part of ultra-religionists. It has been a favorite indictment to charge with the crime of sedition the followers of Jesus who have meekly tried to walk in the Master’s footsteps. History discloses this throughout the entire gospel age. Martin Luther did a wonderful work of reformation, and he had his portion of persecution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“Since Luther’s time no reformation along religious lines has taken place to compare with that which has been conducted by the International Bible Students Association. Our association has sought to turn the minds of the people to Bible study and to encourage mankind, by showing that the divine plan holds out the hope for the blessing of every one who wants to do right”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Why was “The Finished Mystery” published and later suspended?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“In 1869, as a young man, Charles Taze Bussell was engaged in business in Pittsburgh, Pa. He was an earnest Christian. The doctrine of eternal torture, taught by the church to which he then belonged, became repugnant to him, and believing that the Bible supported the church’s teaching, he refused for a time to have anything to do with it Then he turned to the Bible for a personal investigation and learned that the Bible does not teach that God will punish any one in a place of fire and brimstone, but that as taught by the Bible destruction is the everlasting punishment of the wilfully wicked. He began a more extensive study of the Scriptures and to write and publish his findings thereon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“In 1879 he started an organization for the promulgation of the great truths of the Divine Plan. In the early 80’s he established </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font10">journal, The TFatch </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Tower, </span><span class="font10">which is yet published, devoted entirely to religious teachings. In the early 80’s he published the bode, ‘Food for Thinking Christians’. In 1886 he began the publication of a series of seven Volumes designated 'Studies in the Scriptures’. In the preface of the first volume^ published in 1886, he stated that there would </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">be seven </span><span class="font10">volumes covering this series. Time and again he published the statement that the seventh volume would treat particularly the prophecies of Ezekiel and Revelation. He wrote and published six volumes of this series, which up to the time of his death had reached the eleventh million edition, the greatest circulation that any books have ever had aside from the Bible. Upon his death-bed he stated, in response to a question, that some one else must publish the seventh volume. Within a month after his death the Society which he had established, through its properly constituted officers directed the collection and preparation of the data for Volume Seven. This book was designated ‘The Finished Mystery’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“Carrying out Pastor Russell’s original plan, formulated more than thirty years previous, this book deals particularly with the prophecies of Ezekiel hnd Revelation. By the 1st of March, 1917, the copy was prepared and ready for the printer. All of this was done—even the proof-reading—a month prior to the time the United States entered the world war. The book was in the hands of the printer about the 7th of June. The Espionage Act was passed thereafter: on June 15th, 1917. That this book was prepared and published without any thought, much less intention, of- interfering with the government, must be clear for the reason of -its con-temptation long before the country was at war and its ' completion before the passage of the Espionage Act.</span></p>

<p><span class="font16">T</span><span class="font11">HE Canadian people have recovered many of the liberties they voluntarily surrendered under the War Measures Act. At midnight of December 31^hundreds of Orders in Council of the War Measures Act came to an end, under which some of the people feared they might have to suffer restraint for some time. Generally speaking, full liberty’ on a pre-war basis is now enjoyed by the Canadian nation, including freedom to enjoy rights like those guaranteed in the American Constitution regarding freedom of speech, the press, and the exercise of religion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The press censorship is gone, with the other Orders. Objection was raised, however, by the Canadian clergy, who put themselves on record by a resolution opposing the restoration of freedom of speech and the press. This relief is the first-fruits of the Farmer-Labor revolution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Just why the Canadian clergy should want war-time restrictions maintained during peace was not stated, but it is well known that during the war and since, some of the clergy have acted in what was termed a high-handed, oppressive and intolerant manner in connection with some who did not agree with them in things religious. Possibly the ministers think that time heals all wounds, and if the matter can be kept quiet it will be forgotten in a year or two, and are playing for a safe position in this respect.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">“On the 6th of May, 1918, an indictment was returned in the District Federal Court against eight of the officials, and members of the International Bible Students Association, charging a violation of the Espionage Law. Upon the trial of the case, the part of the book objected to was found on pages 247 to 253 inclusive: .</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">one paragraph on page 247 being an explanation of Revelation 16: 13, which St. John wrote on the Isle of .Patmos while serving a term of imprisonment on the charge of sedition. The other objectionable quotations cited were: a quotation from a sermon delivered by the Rev. Dr. John Haynes Holmes in New York City, and a quotation from another sermon ' by a New York clergyman, which had been published previously in </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“The members of the International Bible Students Association were charged with conspiracy to interfere with the progress of the war, and that they had published this book and attempted to get exemption under the Selective Service Act for the purpose of carrying out the allcg- ’ cd conspiracy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“As a matter of fact, a conspiracy and interference with the government was t’.' last thing they would have thought of attempting: ant thus they all testified on the witness stand.

<p><span class="font10">&quot; ‘Good men differ as to the meaning of God’s law. and herein is where the law of the land justly recognizes that each man shall be granted liberty to exercise his </span><span class="font11">f ' </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">conscientious </span><span class="font11">religion* convictions.

<p><span class="font11">“The fact that these Bible Students sincerely intended i </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">to preach </span><span class="font11">the Gospel of Jesus Christ and to not inter</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">. fare with any </span><span class="font11">one </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">else seems </span><span class="font11">to have been lost sight of. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">‘ The result </span><span class="font11">of their trial in the District Court before t </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Mr. Justice Howe is </span><span class="font11">well known.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">United </span><span class="font11">States District Court in Brooklyn, sentenced the </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">religious persons before </span><span class="font11">him to twenty years each in </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">prison. </span><span class="font11">It </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">was </span><span class="font11">necessary, he said, to make an example </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">of those </span><span class="font11">who sincerely taught this religion, which, like</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">that </span><span class="font11">of the Mennonites and the Quakers, and many </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">other sects, </span><span class="font11">fbrbids the taking up of arms. They were gnffty, plainly, of having urged men to follow what </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">they </span><span class="font11">considered the teachings of the Lord, and to apply </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">literally the </span><span class="font11">commandment, “Thou shalt not kill”. So </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">the jury could </span><span class="font11">do nothing less than find them guilty of </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">having </span><span class="font11">violated the statutes of the country, whatever </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">mtj</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"> be </span><span class="font11">the correctness or incorrectness of their attitude </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">toward </span><span class="font11">the moral and religious law.

<p><span class="font11">. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;judge's opinion that teaching any religion save that</span></p>

<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Is </span><span class="font11">there any special connection with the persecution just described and your present lecture, “The World Has Ended, Millions Now Living Will Never Die’’!</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">‘Tor many years Pastor Russell called attention to the Scriptural teaching that the world would end, ana that 1914 marked an important date in connection with the world’s end. Ho based his conclusion upon the pronhcxic</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">statements of Jesus and other Biblical witnesses. Several years in advance, he brought proof - from the Scriptures that the world war would begin in 1914. It began exactly on time. He showed that Jesus taught that this war would be followed closely by revolution; and that prophecy has already been fulfilled with reference to Russia and Germany, and other countries are threatened with similar trouble. He told the people that Jesus and the apostles taught that this war would be accompanied by famine and pestilence; and this has been clearly </span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">fal fill</span><span class="font11">ed- He called attention to the fact that the world would pass through the greatest time of trouble ever known; and surely no one will attempt to gainsay that this prophetic statement is now in course of fulfillment. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“Many people have foolishly taught </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">that the end of </span><span class="font11">the world means the burning up of the earth. That is an entirely erroneous view. The word world means social order of things, conditions </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">of society </span><span class="font11">prevailing for a specific time. There was a world, or a social condition or order of things, which </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">persisted from Adam </span><span class="font11">to the Flood; and that world ended, as the Scriptures clearly state in 2 Peter 3:5,6.' Then fallowed another social order or arrangement of things, called in the Scriptures ‘the present evil world’. This order of things began to pass away in 1914 and therefore, technically speaking, the world ended then. Ho thoughtful person will attempt to say that society will </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">ever </span><span class="font11">return to the conditions that prevailed ten </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">yean ago. Wo are </span><span class="font11">in a time of reconstruction,, and in due time the people will be greatly blessed. The reason for this is set forth in the Bible, one which Pastor Russell and his </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">associates </span><span class="font11">clearly taught and yet teach, namely: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“That Adam’s disobedience forfeited for him tile right to life everlasting in happiness; and by inheritance this condemnation passed upon the entire human family. God promised to redeem, the human race and ultimately restore mankind to its former condition, which is to be accomplished through the great atonement </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">sacrifice-ef-</span><span class="font11">Jesus Christ. Since the time of Eden </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">man has </span><span class="font11">diligently sought three things, namely: life, liberty and happiness. All of his efforts to gain these have failed. The majority of men have reached the conclusion that these, desirable things are unattainable. We are glad that they err in this; for the Scriptures teach, and this is what we are trying to tell the people, that in Jehovah’s due time every man shall </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">have a </span><span class="font11">full and </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">fair </span><span class="font11">opportunity to render </span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">himself</span><span class="font11"> in obedience to the laws of God, and that all who do so shall ultimately attain life, liberty and happiness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“This was the teaching of Jesus and the apostles; but shortly after the apostles died, Satan blinded the minds of professing Christians generally and turned them away from the beauties ox the divine arrangements. This resulted in great persecution of those who claimed to be Christian, and then the formation of many Christian </span><span class="font10">sects, some teaching one saying and some another, and all departing in some measure from the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“To revive the message of good cheer taught by Je.rus and the apostles has been and is the object and nurnose of the International Bible Students Association, which was organized by Pastor Russell. This association is not political in any sense, but its work is wholly educational' along Scriptural lines, and its members believe that Messiah’s kingdom is the only panacea for the ills of humankind. Jesus taught his followers to pray for the coming of that kingdom, stating that when it comes God’s will shall be done on earth as it is done in heaven. The establishment of that kingdom of righteousness will quite naturally mark the end of Satan’s power to deceive and blind the people, and will destroy wicked schemes and schemers from the earth. This is the reason that the followers of Christ have earnestly desired his second coming. Our society, in harmony, as we believe, with the Bible, is vigorously endeavoring to get before the people the truths now due to be understood; among</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">- which are these:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“That no one is to be/ tormented eternally in hell-fire and brimstone, but those who have died will be awakened out of death and given a fair trial for life, and those who are living will be given the first opportunity; and that with the establishment of Messiah’s kingdom, millions of people then living on earth will never die. The Scriptural evidence shows, in conjunction with evidence that is daily before our minds, that we are now in </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font10">great transition period, passing from one order to a new and better order, and that Messiah’s kingdom with all its beauty and glory for the blessing of the human race, is now about to be inaugurated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“We, of course, expect Satan and his instruments to strive to blind the minds of the people to these great truths. But under the reign of Messiah the long-cherished desire of man will be realized, namely: life, liberty, . and happiness. Of course, you cannot now expect me here to give a full statement of the process of applying these blessings, but this is exactly what I do explain in my public lectures and what Pastor Russell explained in his lifetime. I am trying to point out nor/ that what Pastor Russell taught would happen is actually taking place; and if the people could realize this, Bolshevism and Anarchism would eease and the people would return to a sane condition. We are not fighting anybody. We are merely trying to get the Truth before the world.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Whence do you get your money*</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“That has been a source of mystery and annoyance to many religionists who spend much of their time in soliciting money. During the fort}’’ years or more of his experience, Pastor Russell never took up a collection, nor has any one of the International Bible Students Association solicited for money.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“The association is composed of men and women who believe the Bible and arc engaged in preaching the message of Messiah’s kingdom. For several years they have been expecting the trouble that is now upon the world, and marked its coming as a fulfillment of divine prophecy ; and they expect this to be followed by the Millennial reign of Christ, that will bring order out of chaos and blessings to all the people. So thoroughly do they believe this that they have been glad to devote their time and money to the proclamation of this message that others might know that there is a better time coming and might have hope for the future.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“They really love their fellow creatures, even those who persecute them; and so sincere is their interest in telling others of a better time to come that instead of soliciting others for money they voluntarily contribute according to their ability. They believe this work is the Lord's work and that the Lord will not permit his work to suffer because of the lock of money. Many professional and business men have left lucrative positions and have voluntarily engaged in the work without money and without price. Not one person in the association draws a large salary, and none get more than what is necessary for their actual necessities.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">What is there of special interest respecting your memberships!</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“The International Bible Students Association does not solicit members. It never has done so. Jesus foretold that the age would end with a harvest, during which time his true followers would be drawn together without regard to creed or denomination. Believing that the pajt forty years or more have been included in that harvest time, Christians from the Catholic and all Protestant denominations have united together in this work. Their sole purpose is to bring the message of the Lord’s kingdom to all who have a disposition to hear, to the end that truly consecrated Christians, regardless of creed or denomination, might be gathered unto the Lord and ultimately participate in aiding the up-lift and blessing of humankind.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The foregoing interview with Judge Rutherford was secured just prior to his leaving for his home in California. Upon his return he is scheduled to deliver an address in the New York Hippodrome, March 21, on “Millions Now Living Will Never Die”. This lecture is the real beginning of an announced world-wide campaign, and well illustrates the general plan which for years has been followed by the Russellites, by using the largest auditoriums for lectures with seats free and no collections taken, and with every one invited.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">I think I can well close this article by quoting a remark once made by a Brooklyn, N. Y., clergyman, who said: “What chance have we against Pastor Russell, who offers seats free, no collections, a free lunch, and no hell-fire!”</span></p>

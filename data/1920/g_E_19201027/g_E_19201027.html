<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">Journalistic Truth Expiring</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-variant:small-caps;">T</span><span class="font11" style="font-variant:small-caps;">he Golden Age does not make a practice of reviewing books, but “The Brass Check, a Study of American Journalism,” by Upton Sinclair, Pasadena, California, contains facts that should be widely known.<a name="footnote1"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark15">1</a></sup></span><span class="font11"></span></p>
<p><span class="font11">We submitted this review to Mr. Sinclair for preliminary examination, and he wrote us as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">“I have your very friendly letter and I certainly appreciate your taking the trouble to send me the review. If I might make a suggestion it would be this: that you introduce a preliminary paragraph quoting from the introduction of ‘The Brass Check<sup><a href="#bookmark15">1</a></sup>, and explaining my attitude toward my personal experiences with newspapers; that is, I tell about these experiences because they are cases I happen to know beyond dispute; I am offering evidence as if before a jury. Otherwise, you see. the reader will think my book is just a ventilation of my personal grouch, and he may be so repelled at the beginning that he will not read the rest of the review.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Without referring back to</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">the preface of “The Brass Check” we now give the review’ just as we prepared it:</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">From his own personal experiences Sinclair first shows how a New York </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">American</span><span class="font11"> reporter stole his first wife’s picture (a feat subsequently duplicated in the theft of a group picture by a Philadelphia reporter) and how the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">American </span><span class="font11">and its allied papers still use the stolen picture to represent his present companion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">He goes on to show how </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">Collier’s</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;"> got the first</span><span class="font11"> opportunity to publish the expose of the condemned meat industry (which subsequently made Sinclair famous),'but preferred the revenues which flowed to it from advertisements of the packing-house products. '</span></p>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">“TT7TTH the invention of news-v V papersand since journalism has attained full bloom, the good spirit of the people has been forced to retire altogether from public life. For now only opinion rules, and indeed public opinion; it is to be had for money;... whoever takes a newspaper has procured not only the waste paper, but also its opinions; he no longer needs to think or to reflect; what he is to believe of God is already thought out for him in black and white.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">' —Richard Wagner in his ''Essay on Beethoven”.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font11">How the editor of the Chicago </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Tribune</span><span class="font11"> ostensibly wrote a reply Co that expose, denying its truthfulness, but it was subsequently revealed that the editor’s criticisms were prepared for him by the publicity agent of the-packers themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">How the New York </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Evening Past</span><span class="font11"> denounced the charges against the packers as false, but when confronted with the query as to the respects in which they were false was unable to answer, and has never corrected the false impression it conveyed to its readers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">How when Roosevelt had been induced to investigate the packers, the Chicago Tribune made it appear to its readers that he was really investigating Sinclair with a dew to denouncing him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">How that when the report, justifying all the charges against the packers, was ready, the Associated Press refused to have anything to do with it: how it filially got to the world through Sinclair’s persuading the New York </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font11"> to publish it. and they, though they made a fortune out of it, never paid him anything for the news.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">How, with other writers and teachers, men and women of the highest moral character, he organized </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">sr</span><span class="font11"> cooperative home known as Helicon Hall; bnt, because he is a reformer, the New York </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Sun.</span><span class="font11"> New York </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">World,</span><span class="font11"> and New York</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Journal</span><span class="font11"> made it a constant batt of ridicule, writing of it in such a jesting manner as to convey the Impression that it was an immoral </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">How the principal press agencies of'America telegraphed to all' the world a lie which had 'appeared in the Morning </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Telegraph</span><span class="font11"> to the effect that he had hired out as a servant and listened at a keyhole on board the private yacht of an . </span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">Ame</span><span class="font11">rican millionaire, but that when this was indignantly denied, not a line of correction was sent ou?t. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■ ■ -</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">How’, when he wrote a polite note to the management of his hotel in San Francisco calling attention to an overcharge, the San Francisco </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Examiner</span><span class="font11"> published a falsehood that he had </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">refftsed </span><span class="font11">to pay his bill and had raised a disturb</span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">ance </span><span class="font11">in the dining room, which lie was sent out </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">as </span><span class="font11">news to all the world; how that the same paper, two or three days later, falsely accused </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">him </span><span class="font11">of having said he was sorry he was married; </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font11">this lie, also, was heralded around the world and never corrected.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">How when his first wife left him with another man, and he was reluctantly pressed by a reporter into admitting that he was preparing to bring suit, the New York </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">American</span><span class="font11"> published <sub>:</sub> a full page, malicious, lying burlesque purport-| ing to explain &quot;Why Hungry Mrs. Upton Sinclair Went Home to Mamma”; how that for several years this one lie completely destroyed his earning power as an author.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">How that when sued for thirty-eight dollars worth of fertilizer which he had never purchased or received, and for which no bill was rendered until four years after the alleged purchase, the New York </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Wo rid,</span><span class="font11"> which had sought an interview regarding it, so stated the matter as to make it appear that he had himself brought it to the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">World's</span><span class="font11"> attention with a view to securing notoriety.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">How when he visited the striking silk-workers at Paterson, to urge that they endeavor to use the ballot to secure a better government, the New York </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Tinies</span><span class="font11"> falsely represented him as having encouraged the strikers to attack the police forcibly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">How that when he had made an ironclad agreement with the managing editor of the New York </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Evening Journal</span><span class="font11"> for the sum of three . hundred dollars to he paid for a conununication &quot;&nbsp;from an unfortunate woman that the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Journal </span><span class="font11">was trying in vain to locate, and the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Journal </span><span class="font11">had published the gist of the story which it had covenanted its honor not to publish under any consideration, unless it paid the three hundred dollars to the destitute and distracted woman, whom it was at that particular time engaged in persecuting, it subsequently went to unbelievable lengths to evade payment of the money, even going so far as to send false wireless messages, with Sinclairs name signed to them, to two persons that it hoped might be able to locate the poor woman. Moreover, it never paid the three hundred dollars. '</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">How* the Associated Press sent out a false . statement that his wife had been arrested in New York; resulting in her disinheritance, and nearly causing the death of her mother, and made no correction although their attention was called to the error by a special delivery letter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">How that when a Governor of Colorado had falsely stated to President Wilson that the legislature had arranged for mediation in the coal strike then in-progress in that state, and Sinclair had drawn the attention of the Associated Press to the facts, they failed to carry the news to the rest of the country, and even refused to do it after the facts had been published in one of the Denver papers. . &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">How the Denver </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Post</span><span class="font11"> accused him of prevarication when he had told the proven truth about the Governor’s misstatements, and refused him an opportunity to defend himself in their paper by a statement of the facts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">How the New York </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Evening Post,</span><span class="font11"> its attention having been called to the suppression of this news by the Associated Press, promised to have the matter investigated, but was never able to do anything about it, for the good and sufficient reason that the Associated Press can strangle any newspaper to death over night by the simple act of shutting off its news.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">How a representative of the Denver </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Post </span><span class="font11">undertook, respecting Sinclair, the regul'ar, established policy of Denver papers, which is to blacken the moral reputation of those it wishes to discredit, but backed out of the programme when told in advance by Sinclair that he knew just the game they had in mind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">How the Los Angeles </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Tinies</span><span class="font11"> published such </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font11">perverted and unjust account of a dignified and thoughtful address by Sinclair before one of the clubs of that city, that when he spoke before the club again on the succeeding week, the</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">I; •- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">members rose from their seats in an ovation, as a mark of protest against the injustice that had been done him.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>Subservience to Advertisers</span></h3>
<p><span class="font19">L</span><span class="font11">AYING’ a foundation in these, his personal experiences, Sinclair proceeds to show some of the reasons why the press is in the condition in which ail thoughtful and experienced persons know it to be. One of these reasons is the fear to do anything that would interrupt the revenue which comes from advertising. Only one-third the receipts of a paper come from its subscribers. The other two-thirds come from the advertisers and if the advertisers withdraw their patronage the paper dies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">£ A great amount of the advertising comes from department stores; and nothing unfavorable to these stores ever appears in the local papers. If the stores are closed temporarily and the owners fined for profiteering, the matter does not get into the papers. &quot;When the girls go on strike to better their condition, the papers say nothing, as a matter of course. When a Woman was killed by falling down the elevator shaft of a New York department store, not a paper in the city mentioned the name of the store. When shoplifters are arrested the name of the store is never given.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">When an underpaid worker in a New York department store committed suicide, leaving a note to the effect that she could no longer stand twenty-cent dinners, the New York </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">World</span><span class="font11"> issued </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font11">solemn preachment respecting “some people who make too large demand upon fortune” and [who “measure their requirements by their desires”. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">During the war those patriotic papers, the Boston </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Herald and Journal</span><span class="font11"> and the Boston </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Post, </span><span class="font11">rejected paid advertisements containing quotations from President Wilson’s speech urging the people to purchase only necessities. Such advertisements would have been offensive to department stores carrying large quantities of advertising with them regularly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">gpWhen one of the Gimbel brothers was ar-flrested in Philadelphia, charged with a vile berime, and cut his throat, not a Philadelphia .'paper mentioned the news, ami when papers <sub>p</sub>from out of town containing the news were Coffered for sale on the Philadelphia streets, the ^police stopped their sale, took away the papers, ?and the Philadelphia papers were silent.</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19201027_files/g_E_19201027-4.png" alt="" style="width:43pt;height:245pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font11">When the vice-president of Gimbel Brother Milwaukee, was indicted for bribing an aide! man, and burned all the evidence before he c be arrested, the Milwaukee papers said nothin of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">When Wanamaker was detected in custon® violation, only one Philadelphia paper repo the matter. When a New York merchant w convicted for selling furs under false names, riftS mention was made of it. When several Chieagd firms misbranded goods, the papers kept-st about it. When four Milwaukee firms-sol potted cheese doped with chemicals, their name: were withheld.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">One of the world’s most prominent edifpS wrote an article (leploring the use of packag^ cereals and the advertising department object that it would cost the paper a hundred thousan dollars a year; when he wrote that stiff hats cause baldness they objected again on behalf of the hat dealers; when he urged the use of square toed shoes he was obliged to throw the article into the waste basket because it would offend th&lt;S shoe dealers; when he wrote an editorial siip^S porting a municipal subway it was objected thara it would not Be .satisfactory to Wanamaker’s.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Criticisms of indecent plays were forced oura of the New York </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Tribune</span><span class="font11"> and the New York Nutw because they offended advertisers of those! plays. But when Arthur Brisbane wrote double column editorial praising a play, the^ Evening </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Journal,</span><span class="font11"> two or three days later,| carried a full-page advertisement of that play.* It works both ways with the paper. If it| offends the advertiser, it loses; if it praises himJ it is rewarded. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;v </span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">affi</span><span class="font11">'</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">When </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Everybody’s Magazine</span><span class="font11"> published Si^ clair’s “Condemned Meat Industry” it lost manyS pages of advertisements of hams, lard, fertilize ers, soaps and railways. It never forgot this; loss and is unwilling to make any further, emr? tributions of this nature to the public welfare.</span></p>

<p><span class="font19">S</span><span class="font11">INCLAIR supplies data to show that the fifteen directors of the Associated Press are connected with huge financial undertakings and that the policy of the Association is to give scant courtesy to movements for constructive legislation in the public interest, to belittle municipal ownership and to keep silence on the successes and to give publicity to the defeats of reformers. Much of the strike news is sent out in the form of propaganda .which has for its, purpose the breaking of the strike rather than the telling of the facts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">When the Associated Press was being investigated by the United States Senate the senators who were conducting the investigation observed that it reported nothing of the adverse • evidence, but only that which was in ita favor. . What confidence can we place in any institution -that possesses this kind of “moral courage’’? Some items involving the Associated Press have , already appeared in this article aud other items follow:</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">When Debs was sent to prison word was sent out that he had given an interview to* the effect that he would call a general strike. Debs gave no such interview, but his denial has never been given publicity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;J</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The Associated Press sent out a report that Gaylord Wilshire, had spoken in York, Peimsyl- 3 vania, that in his<sup>-</sup> speech he had denounced the courts, and that he had&quot; been mobbod by the T citizens.

<p><span class="font11">The Associated Press sent out a dispatch from Centralia, Washington, narrating how L W. W. members had fired from their windows upon an Armistice Day parade of returned soldier boys. Not till long afterward did the truth come to light that the former soldier boys attacked the I. W. W. hall before any shots were fired, and « were battering in the door when the first shots were fired through it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The Associated Press carried a story from West Virginia as though striking miners had fired upon a passenger train. As a matter of fact &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">the train was a special train organized for the 1 express purpose of shooting at the. strikers. It was made up at Charleston and returned to Charleston after it had passed through Holly 5 Grove and fired a gatling gun at the tents in which the miners were living. Robert Estep. ? one of the miners, was killed in this premeditated murder, which began the shooting.</span></p>

The miners, ill paid, ill treated and badly housed went on strike and the usual gang of thugs and gunmen was provided to preserve “order”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">While.a Labor Day procession was being held at Kearsarge in that district, a hand of these gunmen, without excuse and without occa-• sion, attacked the procession and broke it up, firing about one hundred shots.

<p><span class="font19">S</span><span class="font11">INCLAIR proposes laws that no newspaper should print an interview without having' it first approved by the person interviewed: that when a newspaper has had its attention called to a false statement it shall publish a correction in the next edition, in the </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">same spot, and with</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">the same prominence given to the false statement; that the distribution of news to American newspapers should be made a public utility, available for any one who wishes to pay for it, . and that the faking of telegraph or cable dispatches should be forbidden. He also suggests that workers on newspapers in America should do as in Argentina, refuse to set type, or print, or distribute any item which is manifestly . aimed at the interests'of the workers. This has l;een tried on a small scale in Boston and Seattle, and it </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">worked.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">. He also proposes a daily paper, fashioned .-.i rer the principles upon which we have tried to ’ uild The Golden Age, a paper that shall really try to find out the truth on all subjects, and to tell it. We feel satisfied that something of the kind must come soon. The present condition is too intolerable to last.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">! We concede that we are living in the time . when the “people perish for lack of knowledge” and when “truth is fallen in the streets”, just as the prophets have declared, but we have confidence that this very condition precedes by but a little the day when &quot;there is nothing covered that shall not be revealed, nor hid that shall not <sub>f</sub> become known”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Of the men of wealth and power that are driving civilization on the rocks, and bringing . * ruin upon themselves and millions of others, it</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11">• is very true, as the Psalmist (82:2-5) has declared:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">“How long will ye judge unjustly, and accept the persons of the wicked? Defend the poor and fatherless: do justice to the afflicted and needy. Deliver the poor and needy: rid them out of the hand of the wicked. They know not. neither will they understand; they walk on in darkness: all the foundations of the earth [existing order of things] are out of course.” '</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark26"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark27"></a>Achievements of Union Labor</span></h3>
<p><span class="font11">THE achievements of Union Labor should not A be passed by without pointingout some of the great things in which they have had a leading part. In 1906 six men holding paid-up trade union cards were elected as members to the national House of Representatives. This was Labor’s debut in the national legislature. In 1914 the group had grown to seventeen members in the House and one member in the Senate, A very incomplete list of the legislation enacted at the suggestion of these men. or with their verv active support and cooperation is as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Limiting railroad men’s hours of labor to sixteen in any one day; employers' liability; District of Columbia child labor; self-emptying ashpans on locomotives; Bureau of Mines establishment; requiring railroads to report all accidents; standard equipment of railroads; federal locomotive boiler inspection; white slave act; eight hour naval laws; amendment to Constitution providing for income tax; publicity of campaign contributions; eight hour postal laws; Children’s Bureau establishment; anti-phosphorus match bill; physical valuation of railroads and express, companies; parcel post; seamen’s law; Shipping Board; Department of Labor establishment.</span></p>

<p><span class="font19">A</span><span class="font11"> CORRESPONDENT sends us some little blue slips which the Government is distributing for the sale of saving’s certificates, calling attention to the fact that whereas one hundred men at the age of twenty-five years are self supporting, with good prospects, forty years later out of the same one hundred men </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">fifty-four </span><span class="font11">are in the poor-house or -totally dependent on others’ charity, </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">thirty-six</span><span class="font11"> are dead, </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">six</span><span class="font11"> are still working for a living, </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">three</span><span class="font11"> are well-to-do and </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">one</span><span class="font11"> is rich. Our correspondent says: “This, it seems to me, is self-explanatory of the present ability of men to form a perfect government. If the best government on earth, which we have, can offer real success to only 1- in 100, and if 54 out of that 100 become objects of charity, it looks to me as if the world needed the Kingdom of Christ much more than men realize.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The most curious thing about the foregoing is the fact that the one man who is rich and the three well-to-do so manipulate public opinion as to persuade the six who are still working and the fifty-four who are in the poor-house, a« they previously persuaded the thirty-six who are worked to death, that it is absolutely impossible to improve upon the plan by which they, the on« rich and the three well-to-do, have absorbed all of the good things of life. If the fifty-four wh&lt;» are in the poor-house or the six who are s^ll working for a living attempt to negotiate e”v close inquiry as to how the one r’ch and the three well-to-do obtained din &lt;jood things of life, they ar&quot; looked u.non fit subjects for S<sup>:</sup>b»ria or Guam.

<p><span class="font19">I</span><span class="font11">N JULY the Canadian Government sent a judge two thousand miles by steamer from ’ Ottawa to Hudson Bay to try an Indian who murdered a fellow man to gain his wife. The I object of this long and difficult trip was to , impress upon the native mind a reverence for the law. This is using the power of the law in a proper manner.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11">* ’ What a pity it is that, while wise men are</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">trying to uphold the law and make it respectable in the great country to the north of us, America should have such a case on its books as that of 1 ,. the innocent labor leader Tom Mooney, proven ' by dictaphones in the office of District Attorney Fickert, of San Francisco, to be the object of <sub>(</sub> one of the most sickening conspiracies of repre</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">sentatives of the law ever known in history. At last accounts Mooney was still in prison, despite the fact that a snapshot of him showed him a mile away from the crime laid at his door at the -time the crime occurred. • । &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>;</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Neither Great Britain, nor Germany in her palmiest days, ever had such a riot of government by injunction as has been witnessed in the United States within the past year, but the curious thing about these injunctions is that so many of them seem to work against the miners and other workers but in. favor of the profiteers..</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">- Thus in Pueblo, April fourteenth, the United States Circuit Court issued an injunction against the District-Attorney,' enjoining him from presenting evidence of profiteering collected against thirteen Denver merchants and . three coal companies. This injunction completely broke the spirit of all the men in that section of the country who were trying to insure fair prices for the people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;..</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Commenting upon the present condition of the judiciary &quot;in this country Chief Justice Morris A. Soper, of the Supreme Bench of Baltimore City, said at Atlantic City, June 24:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">‘•The courts are under fire. They are justly under fire because for a century, during which: we have paseed from a primitive frontier society to a complex industrial civilization, the instruments for administering justice have remained substantially as they were when first projected. No institution can hold up its head under these conditions, and no body of men can secure respect for an instrument of government so far out of date.” -</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Of course the difficulties with reference to the courts are largely those of the legal profession. The American Judicature Society, of Chicago, a body of clean, high-minded men who are anxious to raise the standard of things jndicntU and legal in the United States, is authority for the statement in its Journal of date June, 1920, that •■’more or less legislation will not clean up a profession which has got lousy. There must be a regeneration of both court and bar.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Our two latest presidents have expressed themselves in the following language respecting the need of improvements in judicial matters in the United States:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;One great crying need in the United States is cheapening the cost of litigation by simplifying procedure and expediting final judgment. Under present conditions the poor man is at a woeful disadvantage in a legal contest with the corporation or </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">tc</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"> rich opponent. The^ necessity for reform exists noth in the United States and in all the state courts.”—WtHiam </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">H. Taft.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">‘•I do know that the United States, in its judicial procedure, is many decades behind every civilized government in the world; and I say that it is an immediate and an imperative call upon us to rectify that, because the speediness, of justice, the inexpensiveness of justice, the ready access of justice, is the greater part of justice itself.”—</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Woodrow Wilson.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">England and Ireland Again </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">By c. 1. Bobton </span><span class="font11" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Mb. Editor: A paragraph in The Golden</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Age, written by Robert Whittaker from an intensely vitriolic standpoint, condemns English rule in Ireland as the cause of all the unhappy conditions existing in that distressful country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Mr. Whittaker may be familiar with </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">English </span><span class="font11">history—as he has taken care to mention in his </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">letter </span><span class="font11">to you—but it is painfully evident that </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">his </span><span class="font11">knowledge of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Irish</span><span class="font11"> history is a limited quan</span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">tity. </span><span class="font11">What he seems to know regarding Irish history is based upon what he saw while making </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font11">hurried visit to Belfast. And surely he will </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">be </span><span class="font11">honest enough to admit that social conditions, be they what they may, afe no evidence </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font11">misgovernment; but rather the result of tarrying too long at the wine cup, and similar </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">causes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Every reformer and Christian worker, is painfully familiar with facts such as your correspondent has pointed out, and, unfortunately, we have not to travel quite so far as Belfast to find a parallel for what he has written.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">I am Irish, lived thirty-five years under feritish rule and have not a fault to find. Nor can I refer to any act of seeming injustice practised by that government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">. I am aware; however, that the Roman Catholic church in Ireland has for centuries endeavored to nullify and make British rule impossible; that the church of the majority has impeded the British government in its efforts to make new laws for the betterment of the people educationally, and otherwise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The result of Romish disloyalty has been the enactment of laws which were intended as a curb upon that cult, and also to provide an antidote to the vaporings of the church, and for which England has been in no way to blame.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">No coercion act has ever been enacted to compel the Protestant inhabitants to observe the law. They are loyal and true to everything • that makes for law and order.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Now Mr. Whittaker might wish to know my authority for entering this controversy. I beg to inform him that I have spent ten years of my life (my best years) working for the uplift of the Irish people. I am a diligent student- of Irish history, the author of three volumes on that subject, and a member of all her principal Historic Societies, North and South.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">I will conclude this note by stating as strongly as I know how that the statements of Mr. Whittaker are a gross libel on the British government and I am surprised that they should be permitted to appear in a paper like The Golden-Age, professing, as it does, a character for truth and righteousness.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark30"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark31"></a>Scotchman Takes a Hand Too</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">By Bdward B. Taylor</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-variant:small-caps;">M</span><span class="font11" style="font-variant:small-caps;">r. Editor:</span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"> I </span><span class="font11">wish to reply </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">to an </span><span class="font11">article I observed in your valuable paper regarding conditions in Ireland by an Englishman who must have studied his family history much deeper than he did the cause for the condition of affairs in Ireland.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">He is like a good many more who saw the poverty as they passed through Ireland from place to place and put the blame on the British Government and the British people, without finding out more about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">If he had found out about the taxation which the government takes and the fees that the Roman Catholic church exacts from the poor people I think he would change his opinion-about how the British Government serves the Irish people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">I am a Scotchman, born and bred. I have never lived in Ireland but I have had many pleasant trips through it, and, as Mr. Whittaker writes, there are poor in the North of Ireland, but I think that had he investigated he would have found the large majority of the poor were Roman Catholics: and in .cases where Protestants were poor, rum was the root of the evil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">There are thousands of Irish in Scotland and England who come over and never seem to be able to come up to the same standard of living as their fellow-citizens do, and yet they get the same chance under the same government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">This question of home rule and an Irish republic is not a political one, but a purely religious one; and Ireland is an example of what would happen if we were ever to come under such a dominating rule as the Church of Rome.</span></p>

<p><span class="font20" style="font-variant:small-caps;">M</span><span class="font11" style="font-variant:small-caps;">r. Editor: I wish to call your attention to a very erroneous and misleading article ' entitled? &quot;Insurance Business Profitable,&quot; appearing in your issue of J une 23, page 598. The writer .is evidently ignorant of insurance «• practice and policies or he would never have written such an article.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">He gives the impression to his readers that <sub>£</sub> the $22,641,383 is clear profit for the insurance companies. He makes no mention of the expenses of operating the companies, or of the amounts paid out on matured endowments, * of the amounts paid as cash values on policies cancelled before maturity, or of the amounts added to the reserve to provide for future pay* ments on such policies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Every company must lay by in the reserve out of premiums received the amount required to produce the face of the policy at maturity, if an endowment. or at the expectancy of life, if a life contract. For instance, on a Twenty Year Endowment Policy, at age 35, the company must each year put in the reserve $34.17 out of a premium of $42.00, and in like proportion for any other kind of-policy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">’ The cash value of the policy increases each : &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;year by about the amount added to the reserve</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">and interest, so that if the insured wishes to discontinue at any time, after the third year, this money must'be paid by the company upon request of the insured. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Carrying the illustration further, the insured pays in twenty years, if he is so fortunate as to 2 live that long, twenty times $42, or $840, and the company must pay $1,000 at death or maturity. ' The statement of ‘'elderly friend” is untrue <sup>J</sup> and unfair for the reasons given aliove. When all the persons now holding policies in the state of Michigan shall have received the proceeds of 1 rheir policies by death or maturity, they will have received more than was paid by them. Ou • very few policies do the companies pay less than ' was received bv them, and then onlv on life contracts where the insured lives far beyond the expectation of life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Briefly, then, of the amounts received by the ’ insurance companies. almut three-fifths are paid ‘ out as claims, endowments, cancellations, etc., and about one-fifth is used for the* expenses of , the business, and the remaining one-fifth is added to the reserve to be paid to the policyholders when required.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">I happen to be in the insurance business myself, and I know whereof I speak on these matters. I do-not consider it good policy on the part of your paper to publish such articles until you have established the correctness of the facts from reliable sources.- I invite you to prove my figures from any reliable source of information on the subject of insurance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Other Insurance Items</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">T</span><span class="font11">HERE have been insurance companies in the 'world since the days of Demosthenes when, -for the first time, shippers began to bet that they would not return safely with their cargoes, and the insurance companies bet that they would. There are now insurance companies in which a man can insure against almost any possible loss or accident.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">One of the newest insurance specialties in the United States is rain insurance. It can be had in either way, either against.too much wet • weather or-against too much dryness. There are certain businesses, such as picnic grounds, open-air shows, pleasure-boat owners, country and river-side hotels, moving-picture companies and department stores that find it desirable to insure against too much rain on certain davs when they have special events on hand for which good weather is a necessity.

<p><span class="font11">The life insurance business has now become a thoroughly scientific business, based upon carefully collected statistics. When well managed it is a profitable business, as stated in our issue of June 23rd. We did not go into details in that article. Two elements tend to make the insurance business a money maker. One is the fact that, for various reasons, many people cannot go on with their payments and so lose a large part of what they have paid in, and another reason is that the insurance companies have the use of the vast sums of money which have been paid in as premiums, and the profits which are made by the skillful handling of these vast sums in a brief space of time are sometimes most extraordinary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">If the history ever comes to the light as to how the savings of the people, as represented in life insurance payments, have been used to swing the stock market first one way and then the other, as suited the financiers who have control of the life insurance funds, it will make interesting reading. Some of this information did come to light many years ago when the Morgan interests were seizing control of the New York Mutual and Equitable Life Companies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">It was the investigation of these companies by Charles E. Hughes that made him Governor </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">of New </span><span class="font11">York State, Justice of the Supreme </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">Court, </span><span class="font11">and </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font11">candidate for President. One of </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font11">interesting items he uncovered at that time was that Chauncey M. Depew was receivftig $20,000 per year from one of these companies, </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">and when </span><span class="font11">asked what services he performed, or </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">had </span><span class="font11">ever performed, in return for it, he was </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">unable </span><span class="font11">to offer «ny explanation other than that it was paid him because of his general standing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Current Insurance Statistics</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">D</span><span class="font11">URING the year 1919 the two hundred and thirty-seven life insurance companies doing business in the United States received from policyholders $1,209,000,000 and paid out to policyholders $741,507,787, a difference of $457,-492,213. The total income of these companies during the year amounted to $1,555,000,000, exceeding the total outgo of $1,095,000,000 by about $460,000,000. Of this difference the sum of $279, 000,000 was added to assets and about $8,500,000 to surplus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Reports from California are that the state insurance law which went into effect on January 1, 1914, has proven to be a great success. The original capital provided for this experiment was $100,000, but this amount has never been touched, and' in five years, not counting the dividends paid to policyholders, the average profit per year has been 338 percent. A surplus of $1,038,959 has been accumulated and $1,039,-533.57 have been returned to policyholders in the form of dividends, ranging from fifteen to twenty percent per year. The state transacts its business on twelve percent of its receipts, including the payment of taxes, labor, rent, and all other items of cost incurred in doing an insurance business. This is claimed to be much less than the cost of any other insurance company doing business in the state; it is also claimed that the ratio of loss is lower.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">In England and New Zealand employers are. compelled by law to insure their employes, and may either provide the means of insurance themselves or arrange with an insurance company to do it for therm There is state insurance in New Zealand. The state company does only ten percent of the insurance business done in the state, but what it does do tends to regulate the rates.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Ordinary life insurance companies generally decline to take risks on miners’ lives, but in June, 1920, the G. B. Markle Company, of Hazleton, the largest individual coal operators, insured all their underground miners for $500 to $1,000, according to length of service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">In July, 1920, the New York Stock Exchange took out a group policy in the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company in favor of its seven hundred employes, providing $18 a month benefi t for five years for total disability, and $500 to $2,000 in case of death, according to length of service. The face of the policy was for $1,000,-000. Group insurance is a comparatively new form of insurance, but the Metropolitan Life Insurance has already issued policies amounting to $122,000,000 in this form.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark34"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark35"></a>Who Framed The Law?</span></h3>
<p><span class="font19">I</span><span class="font11">T HAS the appearance that judges in this country have an unusual amount of difficulty in placing blame upon a rich man or a rich corporation. This is very singular. The Lever Act was passed to prevent profiteering in clothing. Taking advantage of the shortage in wool, caused by the manufacture of soldiers’ uniforms and blankets during the war, the American-Woolen Company held up the public in 1918 and 1919 to the extent of profits running up to tliree hundred percent and away into the many millions of dollars. Here was obviously one of the principal companies that the Lever Act was intended to hold in check.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Yet when the American Woolen Company and its president, William Wood, wer-» indicted for profiteering in clothing (and there seemed to be no possible question of their having profiteered in cloth) a Massachusetts federal judge quashed the indictment on the ground that woolen cloth is not clothing. This decision narrowed the field of prosecution of profiteers in clothing down to the men of smaller capital and smaller profits who make and sell clothing.</span></p>

<p><span class="font19">T</span><span class="font11">HE word molecule is obviously of Latin origin, and means simply a </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">little muss</span><span class="font11"> of matter, and is usually defined as the smallest mass of any substance which can exist by itself, or the. smallest mass into.which any substance can be divided by physical processes; that is, by processes that do not change its chemical nature. As to size, these molecules have been calculated to have a diameter of one five hundred millionths of an inch: to illustrate this graphically—if we conceive a sphere of water the size of a pea to be magnified to the size of the earth, each molecule being magnified to the same extent, would appear about the size of lead shot.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The molecules are to the physicist real magnitudes, which are no further removed from our ordinary experiences on one side than are the magnitudes of astronomy on the other.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">All matter is huilt up of these isolated particles or </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">molecules,</span><span class="font11"> and these invisible molecules are composed of smaller elementary </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">atoms, </span><span class="font11">which are electrically united together to form the molecules. The atoms have long been considered the smallest bodies in nature, and as absolutely solid and everlasting; but recent advances in science have given us evidences that they are neither solid nor everlasting, hut that the atom is made up of yet smaller particles which may lie changed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Tins idea floes not rest upon pure theory, but upon observed facts. It can Im- proved by direct experiment that particles smaller than atoms do exist. This may seem ridiculous when even the giant niob-cnles are hopelessly beyond the reach of the most powerful microscope, but these ultra-microscopic particles can just as surely be measured and weighed as our own world and its neighboring planets can.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The story of the discovery of the invisible particles, electrons, composing the atoms is an interesting one. It has been known for a long tune that an electric spark will pass more easily through a tube of rarefied air than through the ordinary air at atmospheric pressure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">To demonstrate this take a glass tube or vessel into which are placed two brass rods, one of which is fixed to the base of the vessel, while the other slides through an air-tight bushing at the top. The whole vessel should be air-tight, having at the bottom an outlet to which can be attached an air pump. By connecting the outer</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">ends of the brass rod to wires coming from an induction coil connected to a battery; electric sparks can be made to pass between the two brass rods within the vessel. ‘ If we gradually separate the ends of the rods in the vessel, the sparking will cease, owing to the intervening air-space causing too much resistance to the electrical discharge. If we pump out a little air the sparking w ill re-commence, showing that the thinner air is a better conductor. As we-continue exhausting the air we observe that the sparking changes into a silent stream of light. As the vacuum increases the whole vessel becomes <sup>;</sup>llu-minated with a glow. Then a little later the glow breaks into narrow horizontal discs-or slices. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;’ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">If the air becomes too rarefied or the vacuum too great it loses its good conducting qualities and. requires considerable electrical pressure to cause a discharge to pass through this high vacuum. When the exhaustion has reached a certain point all the glow disappears from the interior of the vessel, and all would appear totally dark; hut when this high state of exhaustion is reached the walls of the glass vessel begin to glow xx ith a phosphorescence. This is caused by the shooting off from the-cathode terminal of those invisible bullets of radiant matter which, colliding against the walls of the glass vessel, cause it to phosphoresce. ’ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">This radiant matter may be termed the fourth ; tate bf matter, as the solid, liquid and gaseous states are called the first, second and third states. The physicist has found the flying particles to he very much smaller than the smallest known atom, which is that of hydrogen. These flying particles are called electrons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">These flying electrons are quite invisible in the highly exhausted vacuum tube. It is only the phosphorescence of the glass caused by the bombardment of these invisible bullets against the inner walls of the vessel, that we see. By making the cathode terminal saucer-shaped the electrons can lie focused to one spot. When a magnet is brought near, a deflection of the electrons is noticed. The magnet deflects them much as it does an electric current. These electrons are negatively electrified because they are shot off from the cathode or negative electrode. The velocity of these electrons is calculated at about</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">60,000 miles per second or about one-third the velocity of light. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">' When an opening cut into the wall of a glass vessel was again closed air-tight with a piece of thin aluminum, and the electrons focused on this, it was found that the electrons would pass through the metal, but as they encountered the molecules of the outer air their progress was arrested and they could not get farther than about one inch from the aluminum plate. This was detected by the glow which could he seen only in a dark room. The smallest atom is that of hydrogen gas, the lightest substance known; and yet that gas could not pass through the alu- minnm plate. Titis shows that the electron is ? smaller than the smallest known atom, as it readily passes through the aluminum plate with very little resistance. Therefore we say that an electron is nothing more or less than an electric ■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;charge in motion—a unit of negative electricity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">It is quite impossible to form any mental j,. .picture as to the actual size of the electrons. __ The following analogy has been suggested: Imagine an atom magnified to the size of a bin one hundred sixty feet long, eighty wide, and fifty high, this filled with a very fine seed, such t as the clover seed. The proportion and number of these seeds to the size of the bin would be about the same as the electron to the atom. '</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">i The electrons are exceedingly small, invisible vortices of negative electricity constantly repelling each other while they as a whole are held within the atom by attraction of the positive electricity of the atom. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">If the atom containing a certain amount of electrons were to receive or have forced into it an extra electron it would have an overcharge of electrons and would display a tendency to give off just what it received. This atom would therefore be negatively electrified and would tend to discharge the electron to its neighbor atom which may have less electrons and thus again become ]x&gt;sitive. If it were given to another, it would again pass it on to the neighbor. and the neighbor pass it on to the next and so on until it found its level, so to speak. If j these atoms are in the form of a wire it is very easy to see how the electrons would be passed through it if they are set a-going by a battery &quot;&nbsp;or dynamo. This shows how an electric current is passed through a conductor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">i The atoms themselves which go to form matter are neither gas nor metal; they are revolving systems of electrons—pure electricity. In short we picture all matter, whether it lie a valuable diamond or a rare gas, to be composed of atoms, and these atoms are nothing more or less than little spheres of positive electricity, within which tiny units of negative electricity are constantly revolving in certain definite orbits, the one atom differing from another only in the number and arrangement of its negative units or electrons. If this theory be true—then all matter is made solely of electricity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The electron theory finds many facts to support it. The electron has actually been separated from the atom, as in the vacuum tubes where we produce a real stream of pure electrons. But we have not been able to separate the positive electricity in the same way. Therefore the positive sphere of electricity in which the real electrons revolve, is at present purely hypothetical.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The stream of flying electrons passing through the vacuum tube behaves exactly like a conductor carrying an electric current. From this we will understand that the moving electrons constitute an electric current. Therefore an </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">electric</span><span class="font11"> current is nothing more nor less than an </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">electron</span><span class="font11"> current. This theory gives us a fairly clear idea of an electric charge and an electric current; but we do not find any clue as to what electricity and the electron are. Xo one knows what they are, and it may never be found out.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark39"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark40"></a>Uses of Dynamite:</span></h2>
<p><span class="font19">T</span><span class="font11">HK general idea of most people regarding dynamite is that it is simply an agent of destruction and is almost certain to &quot;blow up” any person using or handling it, unless he is familiar with it and skilled in its use.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">This is a deficient conception; for dynamite is now one of the greatest agents of construction extant, and is rapidly coming into use on the farm, and for many other purposes which were unheard of a few years ago.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The writer, who is an expert in the use of dynamite, has often wondered how many people in this country, when enjoying some luscious fruit, ever think of the tons of dynamite that are used annually in tree and vine planting and culture; how many ever think when using a spade, hammer, plane or even a knife or spoon, of the thousands of tons of dynamite used in mining the minerals from which same are manufactured; how many ever think when coaling up their furnace or stove, of the tons and tons of “permissible explosives” (which are </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">simply </span><span class="font11">dynamite of special manufacture) used in mining the coal, to say nothing of the millions of pounds used in the oil industry, the lumber industry, the building of railroads, the removing of sunken vessels from harbors, the deepening and dredging of rivers and harbors, the building of canals, the reclaiming of swamp and waste lands, the quarrying of stone for improved roads, ditching for irrigation projects, etc., etc., besides the more every-day uses of blasting sewers, cellars, boiler pits, etc. And then comes the blowing out of stumps and blasting of boulders and-ditches on the farm. •</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Dynamite is also rapidly coming into use for the breaking of ice jams and gorges, straightening of streams, underground drainage, loosening of coal and other ores and material when frozen iii cars or piles, razing of walls of burned buildings and also the razing of old foundations, either inside or outside of buildings, and so on indefinitely.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Ignorance of dynamite and its uses and fear of it (caused by ignorance) still restrict the use of dynamite to a large extent and the writer has often been amazed as well as amused at the look of fear and horror which will sometimes come over the face of a manufacturer or property owner when the use of dynamite</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">inside his building is suggested as a means of facilitating some operation of importance. But it is mainly of the use of dynamite on the farm that this series of articles is intended to treat, so I will confine myself to that subject, and for a starter will try to show to the uninitiated that they need have no fear of using dynamite for many uses on the farm, if they are simply careful, and use a little common sense,, while at the same time following a few simple instructions given here, which I shall try to make as clear as possible. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Tree planting, subsoiling, rejuvenating of old fruit and shade trees, the blasting of boulders, the blowing out of small and medium-sized stumps and the blowing of ordinary-sized ditches are entirely within the range of operations of the amateur. But the rejuvenating of vines and shrubbery, the blasting of large stumps and very large boulders or large ditches had better be left for the expert or at least experienced blaster; as an amateur is likely to make costly mistakes if he attempts this work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">However, if the amateur wishes to try some of the larger kind of blasting, he may do so with reasonable safety and success. If he is painstaking and careful and if he closely watches the results of his first shots and loads his next ones according to results as observed in his first attempt, success may be had beyond belief or . expectation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">If an amateur wishes to become proficient at this work, he will do well to obtain some of the excellent booklets on the subject which are published by the various manufacturers of explosives and by them mailed free of cost to any one desiring such information. A careful study of these booklets will be of immense benefit to one just learning to dynamite. I have studied them myself with much profit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">As I understand that I am dealing with people who are content to do the simpler jobs of blasting at first and learn by experience, I shall not take up the subject of electrical detonation of explosives (at least not as yet) but confine myself to the one-shot-at-a-time, or cap-and-fuse method of detonation.</span></p>

Don’t be foolish. The dynamite which is generally most easily obtainable is 40% ■ ' &nbsp;&nbsp;• ammonia dynamite, so we will consider this as</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">ji primer, and is prepared as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, cut the fuse the required length, which</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">should be the depth of the hole. The fuse should project from the hole about four inches, hut as it goes into the top of the stick of dynamite this ' will bring it about right if yon are using full stick charges: hut, at any rate, the fuse should : &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sub>f</sub> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be at least four inches alxive the top of hole</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">. &nbsp;&nbsp;when loaded/ If you are blasting boulders by</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">. means of mud caps, cut your fuse about eighteen ! inches long.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">I . one foot, so this will give you .plenty of time to get far enough away for safety before the explosion. Always cut off about one inch from the end of a new roll of fuse and throw it away.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">After cutting fuse the required length (be sure to make a nice square cut) carefully remove one No. 6 blasting cap from the box by tipping box on side and picking out one with fingers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Place the end of fuse in cap, being sure it rests on bottom of cap, but do not twist it or force it down unnecessarily, unless you have more fingers than you have use for. Then crimp the cap on fuse with cap crimper if you have one. If you do not have one a pair of pliers or a jack knife can be used to make the crimp, but be sure you keep close to top or open end of cap when so doing, as the fulminating charge in cap is in the closed end.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Now take your dynamite and open paper on one end, punch a hole in the dynamite with a .. sharpened stick and insert cap in the hole thus made, being sure to have cap well down Iwlow <sup>1</sup> top of paper, then fold paper around fuse and tie tightly with a piece of strong, light cord, and your primer is complete.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">If you are using half-stick charges (and you will seldom use less in any kind of farm blasting) cut your stick into halves by rolling it -gently on the blade of a sharp knife. Do' not try to break dynamite unless the paper is entirely cut through. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;’</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">When handling dynamite and caps, do not mix them up with metal tools of any kind; keep caps and dynamite a few feet apart; do not smoke; and always remember that you are handling a mighty engine of destruction in a small space, if it is allowed to get away from you, but absolutely safe if handled carefully.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">If you have any dynamite or caps left from your work, put them in safe storage. The dealer from whom you purchase supplies will tell you what the law requires. Do not leave them where children can get them and do not keep, caps in your pocket.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">The significance of this seems to us to lie more in the expression that this has happened frequently in the past twenty years than in the fact itself. Frequent repetition would seem to suggest what we anticipate, namely that the earth having produced in past ages all it can comfortably support in the resurrection era now drawing near, reproduction will gradually cease. Be good to the kiddies, love them and care for them while you can: for the time is surely coming when the last one will be born, and grow to maturity, and childhood with all its infinite graces and sunshine will he a thing of Messed and hallowed memory, supplanted by the not less grace and sunshine of childlike guilelessness and simplicity of everyone.</span></p>

<p><span class="font19">I</span><span class="font11">F IT isclaimed ip a dispatch from Pittsburgh, that Robert Hyde, a chemist of that city, has discovered a plan for making three-quarters of a pound of sugar out of every pound of common excelsior, at a total cost of three and one-half cents per pound, and in ten hours time, it looks as though the laugh might yet be on the-sugar profiteers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">This seems almost too good to be true, yet nothing is impossible with God. We get sugar from the maple, and we know that the beautiful diamond and the carbon in common use are the same substance.

<p><span class="font11">One of the first plans under consideration by the board is to prepare to send an engineering commission to Palestine, to survey the needs and possibilities of the country* as well as proposed sites for all the huge engineering projects, particularly in water power development, now under consideration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The directors of the technical board will spend part of their time in Palestine, according to Mr. Haines. Dr. Lowenstein, recognized as one of the leading public utility experts in this country,has already made four trips to Palestine.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Color and Temperament</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">F</span><span class="font11">OR modern, practical purposes classification of people into three groups, vital, motive, and mental, is sufficiently accurate. However, some finer analyses are possible; though the other divisions, with the exception of phlegmatic, are really secondary or binary in their natures, because partaking of two other basic temperaments. Other names have appeared in both, ancient and near-modern psychological literature, but they are identifiable as one or another of those pictured above. Motive was formerly, though unhappily, called bilious—or more properly fibrous—and its perversion was sometimes referred to as choleric; the mental was better known as melancholic; and the nervous occasionally denominated classical.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">In attempting to classify the organisms of mankind it is essential at the outset to recognize the fact that there are no absolute types. Every one has some vital, some motive and some mental qualities in his makeup; but one of these may predominate so noticeably as to serve for </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font11">type. If two qualities are about balanced, and the third of small force, life in that individual will take on a violet, an orange, or a greenish cast, acording to the component elements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The vital temperament is characterized by rotundity of organism and an indisposition to marked activity. Persons of this type make much better managers than workers. Strength in and activity of the abdominal viscera predominate over that of other body parts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The motive temperament, as the name implies, abounds in action. Whereas with people of the vital stamp movement is a luxury, with those of the motive strain movement is both a necessity and a comfort. In this temperament the muscular portion of the system predominates in activity and is evinced by strongly marked and firmly set features, firmness of flesh, moderate fulness: the general functional activity extends also to the brain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The mental temperament is that in which the purely intellectual activities preponderate. People of this class tend to the shadow side of life; they are not able to radiate cheerfulness, because they do not possess it. They manifest, on the psychical side, deep and enduring sensibility; the fancy, as arising from receptivity, predominates in these passive people. The feeling is disposed to sadness; desire shows itself more as yearning. Men eminent in art and science fall usually into this class. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">“When I compare the season of youth (not childhood) to the melancholy temperament, you will perhaps be astonished and ask whether youth is not the time of pleasure. But it is, above all other ages, the age of the ideal; and this is the feature which places the young among the melancholy. They mentally build up a world of their own—an ideal world, of which their fervid imagination is enamored—and deem themselves to be raised far above the common-place world around. There is something lovable in this youthful disposition; and we ought all to keep young in this sense, in which it has been well said that they who grow old never were young, But the danger in this stage is the pride which despises others, and that revelling in fancy and sentiment which, shunning real earnest work, seeks its ideal in enjoyment, and at last in very un-ideal enjoyment Manhood is the time of work. . . . Our will contends against the resistance offered by actual life, and strives to master it.” </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">—Luthardt. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">The phlegmatic temperament is the direct antithesis of the motive. In it action, so far from being a necessity or comfort of life, is a positive extravagance. Perhaps no more perfect example of this type could be found than the-old darkey who was observed day after day to sit at his cabin door in a state of lassitude so complete that he did- not even draw on his drooping pipe, in which the fires of industry had long since died out: on being asked by a passerby what he did, the old man, after much deliberation, made answer: “Well, sah—sometimes ah sets and thinks—and sometimes, ah jest sets”. But even this is not a perfect type: for he confessed to a slight tinge of the mental. The truly phlegmatic, like the pyramid, “jest set”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The nervous or sensitive temperament confers great quickness and vivacity of mental action, without a corresponding capability of endurance. The brain is so active that it is very easily excited and, for the want of endurance,</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;soon exhausts its powers. The most exquisite</span></p>

<p><span class="font19">W</span><span class="font11">E READ and hear much concerning the small birth rate of the present time. By - some in this country, it is considered to be an alarming condition. Yet is is not only the - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;strictly Americans who have small families.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The foreign family which came to this country</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">some twenty or twenty-five years ago, averaged 1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from seven to ten children. Those children are</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now grown and married. It is the exception if</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">j &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;any of these children have as many children as</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">' &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the parents had. Possibly the oldest child has.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">. There are many causes why the families are small. Poor health on the part of the wife and mother is one big factor; and everyone knows j that thoughtless, pleasure-loving people do not • desire the responsibility of parenthood. There , is another considerable class of earnest, serious people who look upon it as wrong to have children unless good advantages and right conditions can be provided for them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">But the economic conditions of life are really the largest factor in determining the size of the family.. Many families would welcome more than two or three, but feel that the expense of supporting more than that number, according to our standards of civilization, cannot be met.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Then, too, more than half of our young girls go to work as soon as <sub>t</sub>they are out of school. Having once entered the field of industry, they are inclined to remain in it for some years. This is especially true of those who have trained or studied for a special line of work. They gener-. ally marry in time, but their youth is past, and if they have children, these are usually but few.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">This is not a condition in this country alone.. In England and France the same conditions prevail; in fact everywhere the more highly civilized is society, the smaller the family.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">There must be some great reason for these conditions. Can it be that the hand of the Lord is on the people to check the size of the families? The Lord told the people to multiply, and they have done so. He told them to be fruitful and fill the earth, and the people have increased an&lt;i have to a considerable extent subdued the earth, and occupied it, wherever it is possible under present conditions for people to dwell'</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Is not this condition one of the sure signs that the time of the resurrection is near! It is no longer necessary that there should be large families; for when the dead are brought to life again, we who are alive (if we remain alive) must share with them our portion of the earthr</span></p>

It needs no proof to any thoughtful person that 1914 marked this time, when the okl order began to disintegrate. All the statesmen of the world realize that the old world is gone and that the people will never again return to pre-war conditions. * All are looking for a reconstruction; but thg student of divine prophecy is lifting up his head and rejoicing that the reconstruction will be. accomplished by the Lord in His own good way for the general benefit of mankind, lie appreciates the fact that the hour is here to announce to the people that millions of people now living on' this earth will never die.

<p><span class="font11">• a prophecy uttered by Daniel centuries ago. He said: “In the time of the end many shall run to „ and fro, and knowledge shall he increased’’.— Daniel 12: 4-.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Happy is-thc man who knows and fully appreciates that we are living in the time when the world is ending, i?e., when th^ old social order is passing away and the new and better time is coming in. It is the time for the fulfillment of the prophetic utterances of Jesus. The question was propounded to Him shortly before His crucifixion: &quot;Master, tell us. what shall be the proof of the end of the world We are certain . that He knew' how to answer the question and that His answer is just and 1 rue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Among the answers H-' gj»v«&gt; at the time was that there would lie a great world war. accom-tions of Christians, the return of the Jews tn Palestine, and the scoffing of the clergy, as well as a general falling away of the nominal churches from the teachings of Jesus and the disciples: all of which we have witnessed fulfilled or in course of fulfillment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Gospel means good news. It is good news to oppressed humanity to know that the good time for the establishment of Messiah’s kingdom of righteousness is at hand and that millions now living will never die. Tn answer to the question concerning the end of the world—the time in which we are now living—and what would be the duty of Christians in that time. Jesus said: &quot;This gospel [good news of the kingdom and that millions now living will never die] shall !&gt;-• preached in all the world for a witness unto «’i nations: and then shall the end come”. Wid'o it</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">a doubt He meant here that this message must go to'all Christendom. When Christendom has heard it as a witness, then the old order shall . completely disintegrate, and the kingdom of righteousness shall be in full sway.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">• With full faith and confidence in the teachings </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font11">the Lord and the holy prophets our party was formed and is proceeding to Europe to make proclamation of this message as we go; and furthermore, to make a number of moving • pictures as a means of instructing the peoples</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>:</sup> along Biblical lines, proving thereby that prophecy has been fulfilled and that this fulfilled prophecy shows that we have reached the time when the world shall be blessed. Our purpose will be to make extensive pictures, particularly </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">. of the </span><span class="font11">conditions among the Jews in Europe, where they are now living, and of the land of - Palestine, to which they are bound, and of the reconstruction pf that land; all of which is clearly in fulfillment of the words of the prophets. Our sole purpose is to aid mankind in g</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">ainin</span><span class="font11">g an.understanding and appreciation of </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">the fact </span><span class="font11">that the time has come for the uplift </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font11">blessing of the human race.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Splendid opportunity is afforded upon the bosom of the mighty deep for meditation upon 7 the majesty and the power of Jehovah, and the ' grandeur of His. creations. The reverential f mind is drawn closer to Him and with greater confidence relies upon His promises. The mighty </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Imperator,</span><span class="font11"> with her 52,000 tons of displacement, her tons of dead weight, her tons of human freight, was lightly and gently home over the waves. In this vessel we found the very highest achievement of man in shipbuilding; and yet the waves of the mighty ocean bore it up as though is were a cockle shell. If man is inclined to egotism, if he is self-centered, if he feels that he has some power, he has but to consider the greatness of God and His creation, amongst which is the mighty ocean, in order to realize that he is nothing. He is reminded of the words of the prophet, who, speaking of the majesty and power of God, said: “Who hath measured the waters in the hollow of his band, and meted out heaven with the span, and com, prehended the dust of the earth in a measure, and weighed the mountains in scales, and the hills in a balance? Behold, the nations are as a drop of a bucket, and are counted as the small • dust of the balance; behold, he taketh up *th.e isles as a very little thing. All nations before</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">him are as nothing; and they are counted to him less than nothing, and vanity. To whom then will ye liken God! or what likeness will ya compare unto him? It is he that sitteth upon the circle of the earth, and the inhabitants thereof are as grasshoppers; that stretcheth out the heavens as a curtain, and spreadeth them out as a tent to dwell in; that bringejh the-princes to nothing; he maketh the judges of the earth as vanity.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">It is this same mighty God who created the first man perfect in body and mind; who endowed him with the right to live on the earth forever and to enjoy all the blessings incident thereto; who made these blessings dependent upon man’s obedience to His law; and when man violated His law and forfeited these rights he was by the same Jehovah sentenced to death. It was through the-disobedience of this one man that the whole race has been dying from then • until now; but it was the same great Jehovah that made promise that He would redeem man from death and purchase him from the power of the grave (Hosea 13:14-); and who through* the sacrifice of His beloved Sou has- provided redemption for all and that all shall hear this testimony in due time (Hebrews 2:9; 1 Timothy 2:5,6); and who through the mouth of all His holy prophets has promised that will restore all the obedient ones of mankind to life everlasting on the earth, and that they shall dwell on the earth in happiness forever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Of this same God the prophet says: “There hath not failed one word of all his -good promise”. The same prophet above quoted in the same chapter (Isaiah 40:9-11, 31) foretold the blessing of mankind and how the Lord will act through His chosen one, Messiah, to bring<sup>-</sup>this blessing, saying: “0 Zion, that bringest good tidings,- get thee up into the'high mountain; O Jerusalem, that bringest good tidings, lift up thy voice with strengths lift it up, lie not afraid: say unto the cities of Judah, Behold your God I Behold, the Lord God will come with strong hand, and his arm shall rule for him: behold, his reward is with him, and his work before him. lie shall feed his flock like a shepherd: he shall gather the lambs with his arm, ami carry them in his bosom, and shall gently lead those that are with young.... They that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">ran and not be ..weary; and they shall walk, and not faint.’* </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">1<sub>1</sub></span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The time musfcome when man will have these blessings. </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">We are </span><span class="font11">entering upon that time. It is therefore the privilege and duty of every one ■ to declare these glad tidings to the suffering millions of earth, that their hearts might be lightened of the burden and that they may look forward with joy to the time of their blessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Surely the man who stands upon the top of a-ship at night and gazes at the brilliancy, of the myriads of stars and planets in the heavens above while he rides the mighty waves, and who remembers that there are millions -of suns and satellites which the naked eye cannot see, but </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">which </span><span class="font11">are performing their functions, cannot </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">for one </span><span class="font11">moment doubt the existence of an all</span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">wise Creator </span><span class="font11">or question His power, His diver</span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">sified </span><span class="font11">wisdom, His exact justice and His great </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">love. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The Captain of the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">tmperator,</span><span class="font11"> Mr. Charles A.

He was very kind </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">- and </span><span class="font11">considerate of our party. We had aboard </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font11">Magnavox Telemegafone, a recent and wonderful invention'for magnifying the human voice. It was used recently to address a great audience ' </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font11">the Stadium at Tacoma, Washington, and people more than a quarter of a mile from the speaker’s stand could hear every word dis-. tinctly. Captain Smith was deeply interested in this new iiivention, inspected it, and asked the privilege of using it. He invited our party on the bridge of the ship when it was nearing the shores of France. The Magnavox was installed; and as we entered the harbor of Cherbourg, the Captain used it to speak to men on other vessels. Hearing a voice from the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Imperator,</span><span class="font11"> the men on the other ships were astonished, never before having heard of this new invention. Officers in different parts of the ship hearing the Captain’s voice likewise turned in astonishment to knowhow he could speak so loudly and clearly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">On arrival in Great Britain, according to previous arrangement a public lecture began at Birmingham on the evening of August loth, in a hall with a seating capacity of 2500. Long before the meeting great crowds surged to and fro in the streets. The hall was quickly filled while the crowd attempted to break in the doors and were held back by the police. The interest manifested in. the subject, &quot;Millions Now Living</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font11">Will Never Die,&quot; thrilled many a sad heart and caused them to lift up their heads with new ' hope. We are to remember that the British people have suffered great sorrow in the past few years resulting from the war.. We also remember that their-clergy, instead of comforting them with </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">the message </span><span class="font11">of </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font11">gospel, urged the young men, according to the London </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Mail,</span><span class="font11"> to breed and then go </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">to-war. </span><span class="font11">Many clergymen sat in this great </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">audience and </span><span class="font11">the speaker appealed to them to do their duty and tell the people the truth. </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">They withdrew </span><span class="font11">in silence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The night following,</span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">ah audience </span><span class="font11">of 3,200 listened to the same </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">message </span><span class="font11">at Leeds, while thousands were turned </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">eager </span><span class="font11">to hear. The same interest </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">waa manifested as </span><span class="font11">at Birmingham. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;v &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Then </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">followed a great meetnsgat St.‘ </span><span class="font11">Andrews </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">Hall, Glasgow, Scotland, where^ddhe than 5,000 people heard and fullyaamany stood in the street for hours, hoping thatsome inside would </span><span class="font11">■withdraw and </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">permit tl»Mn td enter;_yet were </span><span class="font11">turned </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">away disappointed. - • - •</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">In Edinburgh, </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">Scotland, thegreat </span><span class="font11">Usher Hall was packed to its utmost </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">capacity </span><span class="font11">with more than 3,000 people, </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">who listenedwith the </span><span class="font11">keenest interest; and even some of the clergymen here handed in their names and addresses asking that they might have </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">the lecture </span><span class="font11">in </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">printed </span><span class="font11">form or other literature </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">to aid them </span><span class="font11">to become familiar with the subject.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">At Dundee, Newcastle and Hull, great crowds came and many were turned away.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">At Liverpool on Sunday evening, September 5, the great Philharmonic Hall with 3,000 seats was packed, while many stood .and thousands remained in the streets. Two overflow meetings were arranged, addressed by other gentlemen of<sup>-</sup>our party; and still thousands failed to gain admittance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">An interesting incident at the Liverpool meeting suggests how the people are turning away from the Babylonish teachings of the nominal systems. Just across the street from the Philharmonic Hall stands one of the most prominent Protestant churches in the city of Liverpool. The clergyman had widely advertised-a meeting at this church for the same hour of our public meeting, his subject being </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">“The </span><span class="font11">Everlasting Mercy”. He was seen standing in the entrance to the church together with his gray-haired deacon, anxiously waiting for some one to come while they watched </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">the throng trying to get </span><span class="font11">into</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font11">the Philharmonic Hall. Mr. Driscoll and our camera man, Mr. Soper, noting this, took a picture of the “divine” and his assistant. After the crowd in the street were convinced that they could not gain entrance to the hall, one lone wo</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">man</span><span class="font11"> was noticed walking into the church across the street, and she was warmly greeted by the clergyman and his deacon, who accompanied her to the inside.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">In the center of the Jewish section of Glasgow, Sco</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">tlan</span><span class="font11">d, the Jews erected a monument in 1878 commemorating that date as important to themselves. Bible Students know that this is the date from which God’s favor began to be returned to the Jews. This monument is situated in a section of Glasgow inhabited by some very poor. Jews. We made some pictures of the monument, together with the class of people living thereabouts, showing the conditions which European Jews, are now in and which many of them are leaving to make their way to Palestine and build their homes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The citizens of Liverpool erected a monument to the memory of Lord Beaconsfield, whose real name was Benjamin D’Israeli, an orthodox Jew, and who was Prime Minister of Great Britain, commemorating his great service to the nation. It was Lord Beaconsfield who in 1878 forced the Russian Government to recede from the treaty of San Stephano, and in doing so brought to bear upon that nation the threat to use the power of the British army and navy. The treaty of San Stephano was harsh upon the Turks, who were then in possession of Palestine. Due to the influence of Lord Beaconsfield, the Berlin Congress was convened on the 13th day of June, 1878, attended by eleven nations and presided over by Lord Beaconsfield, who wrote the treaty which annulled the treaty of San • Stephano. The new treaty between Russia and Turkey was guaranteed by Great Britain in behalf of Turkey upon the express consideration that Turkey would grant to the Jews in Palestine and those who might go there certain civil and religious liberties which they had not enjoyed for more than 1,800 years. This marked the beginning of the fulfillment of the double, or the beginning of the return of God’s favor to the Jew. as foretold by the prophet Jeremiah 2,000 years previous. Of course we included in our moving pictures the monument erected to the memory of Lord Beaconsfield, which will be of</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">. interest to all people, Jews and Christians.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">As though by instinct, the whole creation, while it groans and travails in pain, waits for, longs for and hopes for the day, calling it the Golden Age; yet men grope blindly, because not aware of the great Jehovah’s gracious purposes. But their highest conceptions of such an age fall far short of what the reality will be. The great Creator is preparing a &quot;feast of fat things”, which will astound His creatures, and be exceedingly, abundantly beyond what they could reasonably ask or expect. And to His wondering creatures, looking at the length and breadth, the height and depth Of the love of God. surpassing . all expectation.

<p><span class="font11">Since, skepticism is </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">rife, the- very </span><span class="font11">foundation of true religion, and </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">the foundation of</span><span class="font11">truth, is questioned often, even by the </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">sincere; </span><span class="font11">We have endeavored to uncover enough of the foundation upon which all faith should be built—the Word of God—to give confidence and assurance.in its testimony, even to the unbeliever. -And we have endeavored to do this </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">in a manner </span><span class="font11">that will appeal to and can be accepted by reason as a foundation. Then we have endeavored to build upon that foundation the teachings of Scripture, in such a manner that,-as far as possible, purely human judgment may try its squares and angles by the most exacting rilles of justice which it can command.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">-■&gt;. Should we expect the divinely provided foundation for our faith to be harmonious with reason and justice? And what should be our object as truth-seekers?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Believing that the Scriptures reveal a consistent and harmonious plan which, when seen, must commend itself to every sanctified conscience, this work is published in the hope of assisting students of the Word of God, by suggesting lines of thought which harmonize with each other and with the inspired. Word. Those -who recognize the Bible as the revelation of God’s plan—and such we specially address—will doubtless agree that, if inspired of God, its teachings must./when taken aa </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font11">whole, reveal a plan harmonious and consistent with itself, and</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">with the character of its divine Author. Our object as truth-seekers should be to obtain the complete, harmonious whole of God’s revealed plan; and this, as God’s children, we have reason to expect, since it is promised that the spirit of truth shall guide us into all truth.—John 16:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">As inquirers, ■what two methods are open to us?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">As inquirers, we have two methods open to us. One is to seek among all the views suggested by the various sects of the church, and to take from each that element which we might consider truth—an endless task. A difficulty which we should meet by this method would be, that if our judgment were warped and twisted, or our prejudices bent in any direction—and whose are not </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">T—</span><span class="font11">these difficulties would prevent our correct selection, and we might.choose the error and </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">reject </span><span class="font11">the truth. Again, if we should adopt this </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">- as </span><span class="font11">our method we should lose much, because the truth is progressive, “shining more and more unto the perfect day,” to those who search for it </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">and walk </span><span class="font11">in the light of it, while the various creeds of the various sects are fixed and stationary, and were made so centuries ago. And each of them must contain a large proportion of </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">error, </span><span class="font11">since each in some important respects</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">1</span><span class="font11"> contradicts the others. This method would lead I into a labyrinth of bewilderment and confusion. I </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">The other </span><span class="font11">method is to divest our minds of all prejudice, and to remember that none can know more about the plans of God than He has revealed in His Word, and that it was given to the meek and lowly of heart; and, as such, earnestly and sincerely seeking its guidance and instruction only, we shall by its great Author be guided to an understanding of it, as it becomes due to be understood, by making use of the various helps divinely provided. See Ephesians </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">4:11-16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">7. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">What is a common failing of the present and'of all times with respect to accepting certain doctrines, and what should be the test of all religious teaching and teachers? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">■ As an aid to this class of students, this work is specially designed. It will be noticed that its references are to Scripture only, except where secular history may be called in to prove the fulfillment of Scripture statements. The testimony of modern theologians has been given no weight, and that of the so-called Early ■ Fathers has been omitted. Many of them have testified in harmony with thoughts herein ex</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font11">pressed, but we believe it to be a common failing of the present and all times for men to believe certain doctrines because others did so, in whom they had confidence. This is manifestly a fruitful cause of error, for many good people have believed and taught error in all good conscience. (Acts'26:9) Truth-seekers should empty their vessels of the muddy waters of tradition and fill them at the fountain of truth—God’s Word. And no religious teaching should have weight except as it guides the truth-seeker to that fountain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">For even a general and hasty examination of * the whole Bible and its teaching, ‘this work is too small; but, recognizing the haste of our day, we have endeavored to be as brief as the importance of the subjects seemed to permit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">3. TTAat </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">is the method of Bible study pursued in this study of &quot;The Plan of the Ages”? And why is careful and orderly study of this work essential to a thorough ■ understanding of &quot;present truth&quot;?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">To the interested student we would suggest that it will be useless for him merely to skim over this work, and hope to obtain the force and harmony of the plan suggested, and the Scrip-, ture evidences herein presented We have endeavored throughout to present the various fragments of truth, not only in such language, but also in such order, as would best enable all classes of readers to grasp the subject and general plan' clearly. While thorough and orderly study is necessary to the appreciation of anjr of the sciences, it is specially so in the science of divine revelation. And in this work it is doubly necesSary, from the fact that in addition to its being, a treatise on divinely revealed truths, it is an examination of the subject from, as far as we know, an altogether different standpoint from that of any other work. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">9. TFAfff </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">is the object of the prophecies contained in the Scriptures?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">We have no apology to offer for treating many subjects usually neglected by Christians —among others, the coming.of our Lord, and the prophecies and symbolism of the Old and New Testaments. No system of theology should be presented, or accepted, which overlooks or omits the most prominent features of Scripture teaching. We trust, however, that a wide distinction will he recognized between the earnest, sober and reverent study of prophecy and other Scriptures, in the light of accomplished historic facts,</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font11">to obtain conclusions which sanctified common sense can approve, and a too common practice of general speculation, which, when applied to divine prophecy, is too apt to give loose rein to wild theory and vague fancy. Those who fall into this dangerous habit generally develop into prophets (!) instead of prophetic students.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">No work is more noble and ennobling than the reverent study of the revealed purposes of God —&quot;which things the angels desire to look into”. (1 Peter 1:12) The fact that God’s wisdom provided prophecies of the future, as well as statements regarding the present and the past, is of itself,a reproof by Jehovah of the foolishness of some of His children, who have excused their ignorance and neglect of study of His Word by saying, &quot;There is enough in the fifth chapter of Matthew to save any man”. Nor should we suppose that prophecy was given merely to satisfy curiosity concerning the future. Its object evidently is to make the consecrated child of God acquainted with his Father’s plans, thus to enlist his interest and sympathy in the same plans, and to enable him to regard both the present and the-future from God’s standpoint. When thus interested in the Lord’s work, he may serve with the spirit and with the understanding also; not as a servant merely, but as a child and heir. Revealing to such what shall be, counteracts the influence of what now is. The effect of careful study cannot be otherwise than strengthening to faith and stimulating to holiness.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">* In ignorance of God's plan for the recovery of the world from sin and its consequences, and under the false idea that the nominal church, in its present condition, is the sole agency for its accomplishment, the condition of the world today, after.the gospel has been preached for nearly nineteen centuries, is such as to awaken serious doubts in every thoughtful mind so misinformed. And such doubts are not easily surmounted with anything short of the truth. In fact, to every thoughtful observer, one of two things must be apparent: either the church has made a great mistake in supposing that in the present ago. and in her present condition, her office has been to convert the world, or else God’s plan has been a miserable failure. Which horn of the dilemma shall we accept? Many have</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">“Even as to the 11$ millions of nominal Protestants, we must remember how large a proportion in Germany, England and this country have lapsed into infidelity—a darkness deeper, if possible, than even that of heathenism—and how many are so blinded by superstition, or so buried in extreme ignorance that while eight, millions of Jews still reject Jesus of Nazareth, and while more than 300 millions who bear His name have apostatized/ from His faith, 170 millions more bow before Mohammed, and the vast remainder of mankind are to this day worshipers of stocks and stones, of their own ancestors, of dead heroes or of the devil himself; all in one way or other worshipping and serving the creature instead of the Creator, who-is God</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">to the proportion of Christians is too dark and rather overdrawn, but we think the reverse of this. It shows nominal Christianity in the brightest colors possible. For instance, the 116,000,000 put down a-' Protestant is far in excess of the true number. Sixteen millions would, we believe, more nearly express the number of professing church believers of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">adult </span><span class="font11">years, and one million would, wo fear, he far too liberal an estimate of the ‘‘little flock”, the “sanctified in Christ Jesus,” who “walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit”. It should be borne in mind that a large proportion of church members, always numbered in the reckoning, are young children and infants. Specially is this the case in the countries of Europe. In many of these, children are reckoned church members from earliest infancy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">But dark as this picture appears, it is not the darkest picture that fallen humanity presents; The cut here given represents only the present living generations. When we consider the fact that century after century of the six thousand years past has swept away other vast multi- . tudes, nearly all of whom were enveloped in the same ignorance and sin, how dark is the scene! Viewed from the popular standpoint, it is truly an awful picture. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">The various creeds of today teach that all of these' billions of humanity, ignorant of the only name'under heaven by which we must be saved, are on the straight road to everlasting torment; and not only so, but that all of those 116,000,000 Protestants, except, the very few saints, are sure of the same fate. No wonder, then, that those who believe such awful things of Jehovah’s plans and purposes should be zealous in forwarding missionary enterprises! The wonder is that they are not frenzied by it- Really to believe thus, and to appreciate such conclusions, would rob life of every pleasure, and shroud in gloom every bright prospect of nature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">To show that we have not misstated “Orthodoxy” on the subject of the fate of the heathen, we quote from the pamphlet—“A Mute Appeal, on Behalf of Foreign Missions”—in which the diagram was published. Its concluding sentence is, “Evangelize the mighty generations abroad —the one thousand million souls who are dying in Christless despair at the rate of 100,000 a day”. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">m«*</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">But though this is the gloomy outlook from the standpoint of human creeds, the Scriptures present a brighter view, which it is the purpose of these pages to point out. Instructed by the Word, we cannot believe flint God’s great plan of salvation was ever intended to be, or ever will he, such a failure. It will be a relief to the perplexed child of God to notice that the Prophet Isaiah foretells; this very condition of things, and its remedy, saying, ’‘Behold, the darkness shall cover the earth, and gross darkness the people; but the </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">Lord </span><span class="font11">shall arise </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">upon thee, and </span><span class="font11">hits glory shall he' seen upion ’thee.

<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">This book was made doubly famous by the fact that its publishers, seven Christian men, were each sentenced to eighty years imprisonment under the so-called Espionage Act. Later they were released, their judgments being reversed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">It was not the object of this work to interfere with the Government; for it was written before ■ this country entered the war. Its object waa and is to explain prophecies which bear on the troublous affairs of this present hour.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“Millions Now Living Will Never Die:’’</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"> This is the marrow of the message of hope now due to a war-weary and revolution-racked world. Everlasting human life on a perfect earth!</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">A most serious proclamation built on Bible facts, as abundantly set forth on the pages of this remarkable little work ; showing that we are even now living in the end of the age. and in the “time of trouble, such as was not since there was a nation.&quot; spoken of by Jesus in his great prophecy of Matthew 24. There the Master said: “If those days were not shortenetL there would be no flesh saved”—implying that some would.live through the trouble and never die.</span></p>

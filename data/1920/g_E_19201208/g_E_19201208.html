<p><span class="font11">Because of their extravagant training, or lack </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font11">training, the lot of many of the princes and princesses that have been cast off within the turee is changed. This makes the wash bills enormous, and it takes time for the’ light to dawn upon them that this form of cleanliness, while agreeable and hygienic, is also expensive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The condition of the princesses is especially difficult. They cannot secure positions as governesses, because parents fear to have habits of extravagance taught to their children in these parlous times. A very few have been able to secure employment as singers, trained nurses and saleswomen, but many have come down to takingk&gt;mployment in cheap restaurants. They cannot get positions in the best restaurants; for these are usually filled by men. A restaurant in Zurich, Switzerland, has become famous because of the number of princesses it employs.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">ALL reports seem to indicate that the English </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">11 </span><span class="font11">Crown Prince is a simple, sensible, unaffected, democratic and agreeable young man, and a trifle shy. Born in 1894, he delighted his parents, when they set sail for a tour of India, by making the volunteer proposition, “I will look after them all”—the “all” being his little sister and his four little brothers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">During the war he was constantly under shellfire for four years, lived on the same rations as the other soldiers; and, though not allowed to i &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;go over the top, he did go with his company</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">! &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on three occasions to take over posts just after</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">the enemy had been driven out of them. He i was present at more than half of the major engagements of the war..</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Just before he sailed for his </span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">Am</span><span class="font11">erican trip, Prince David refused to attend a farewell private dance given in his honor at Buckingham palace, because his list of personal friends was </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">■J</span><span class="font11"> . not invited. This act was virtually the dis-\ obedience of a royal command; for royal invi-i . tations are essentially commands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The prince is athletic, has done a great deal of flying, and usually goes between England and France by the air route. At Saskatoon, in Western Canada, he proved that he could mount an untamed broncho and hold his seat until the &quot;* beast tired out</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">&gt; At Calgary, still further west, he began one day with a ten-mile run before breakfast, spent the morning in the saddle rounding up cattle, spent the afternoon tramping with a gun, took an automobile ride over a rough road, followed that with a railroad journey and then danced</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">until the wee small hours of the morning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">While in Canada he let the crowds do with him about as they pleased, shook hands with so many people that he contracted neuritis in his right hand and subsequently, while in the United - States, was obliged to use his left hand. When in New Z^alarid he refused to ride on the royal train while a strike was in progress, saying, &quot;Until the people can yide I shall not ride, for I am one of the people”. This offset to some extent the resolution of the Australian Workers’ Union opposing his visit to that country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Out of a total appropriation of $120,000, ike ’ j Canadian Government expended $101,790 on the ■ Prince of Wales' visit. For the same trip the prince himself had been granted $125,000; but as he spent only $35,000 there was a profit of ? $90,000 which he was able to return to his royal . . 1 dad, and which, no doubt, King George was glad ■ | to get. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;’</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">King Albert of Belgium commended himself to the whole world for his resolute stand against the invasion of his country by Germany.

Illinois was one of the largest contributors to the Belgian relief fund; and Wisconsin contributed a larger number of volunteers for the World War, in proportion to its population, than any other state in the Union. _ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The Belgian king visited Boston, Buffalo, Davenport, Minneapolis, Spokane, Portland, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Albuquerque, Kansas City, Omaha, St Louis, Cincinnati, Pittsburgh, Philadelphia and Washington all in nineteen days, and anybody who has ever visited the same towns knows that it was a hard ride to take in that time.</span></p>

<p><span class="font15">O</span><span class="font11">NE reason why most of the former nobility of Germany are in Switzerland is that it was the easiest country to reach and enter when the German militaristic system broke down. The Prince of Lippe-Detmold is there, the grand duke of Hesse, the grand duchess of Mecklenburg-Schwerin and the former king of Bavaria. The latter, Ludwig the Third, who recently celebrated hls-.seventy-fifth birthday, says that he is having the best time of his life; and without doubt he tells the truth. He is living at Tizera, in an old manor house, half convent and half fortress, wit^ onjy one retainer, an old Bavarian general, and speftds much time studying botany.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The German Crown Prince is in Holland, to stay. The Dutch government has bought for his use the parsonage on the island of Wieringen. The German Kaiser is also in Holland to stay, the Allies having “accepted&quot;’ the Dutch govern</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">ment’s offer to keep a strict watch over him so that he shall never again become a menace to the peace of Europe. The Dutch refused to give him up, so the only thing the Allies could do was to “accept”. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">For a year and a half the Kaiser was the guest of the von Bentinck family at Amerongen. Last Fall, however, he purchased an estate of sixty acres, including the House of Doorn, having twelve rooms besides servants quarters. During the winter the house was made over, and on May fifteenth the Kaiser removed to it The Kaiserin was so affected at moving from Amerongen that she almost died from heart failure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">When the Kaiser moved into the House </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font11">Doorn he at once raised the salary of the gardener forty cents a week. Dr.Foerstner. his family, physician, had to leave him and return to Berlin, because he could not live on the meager salary paid him. The Kaiser has sold many of his household furnishings and is now seeking </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font11">market for his two yachts, estimated as worth about $360,000 each. One of these is said to </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">be </span><span class="font11">the fastest vessel of its size afloat</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The Kaiser is writing a history of the World War which will be principally a history of </span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">him-</span><span class="font11">’ self. He no longer has his mustache trained in a warlike manner, has discarded, his uniforms, has grown a beard, and allows his hair to grow to a good length instead of having it cut in precise military style.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The Kaiser’s great-great-grandmother was a French woman, Eleonore d’Olbreuse; and his mother was the oldest daughter and the oldest child of Queen Victoria of England. He claimed the right to the English throne and hoped to win it as another William the Conqueror.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">TTtaAxcis Joseph, the aged emperor of Austria-</span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">X<sup>1</sup> </span><span class="font11">Hungary, is claimed by some to have com- • mitted suicide by hanging at 10:30 on the morning of November 21, 1916. The truth of this cannot be proven yet. The official report, possibly shaped by reasons of state, is that death was due to natural causes and occurred at nine o’clock in the evening of the same day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Francis Joseph was succeeded by Karl, or Charles, once referred to during the war, in a German military announcement, as “his-apostolic majesty”. Shortly after the close of the war Karl left Austria for Switzerland, where</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">he has two valuable estates, the castles of Wartegg and a mansion on the shore of Lake Geneva. He has five children, one of whom was born after the family had arrived in Switzerland.- Karl spends most of his time limiting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">_ Owing to depreciated exchange Karl’s income has been reduced from $3,500,000 a year to $750,000. xln American paper offered him $500,000 for his reminiscences, but he would not </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">S'</span><span class="font11"> accept. He asked the Allies whether he might live in Hungary, as he finds the cost of living in Switzerland very excessive; but the Allies would not permit it. He then asked permission ~ to live in Prague, but the Czecho-Slovakians would not allow him to come.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">~ Eighty grand-dukes and grand-duchesses went into exile with the fall of the house of Hapsburg. All the larger imperial palaces have &gt;&nbsp;been seized for public purposes. All members of the House of Hapsburg w ho would not renounce their claims and become loyal citizens of the Austrian Republic were expelled from the country and their estates confiscated. Austrian money has so depreciated that a fortune which would have been equal to $250,000 before the war yielded when transmuted into Swiss currency only $850.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Early in the year Hungarian estates valued at $100,000 to $200,000 were being purchased by 'Americans, Englishmen and Frenchmen at $5,000 to $10,000. The crown of Hungary, used for eight hundred years in the crowming of monarchs, was put up at auction and sold to a profiteer- f-or $20,OCX). Nicholas, ex-King of Montenegro, is in exile at Neuilly, France.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Italian and Greek Nobility</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">A</span><span class="font11"> YEAR ago King Victor Emmanuel, one of • the best of modern kings, renounced all crown lands throughout Italy for the benefit of the peasantry, and announced that hereafter his own private property would be taxed the same as others. In December the Italians took away from ttte king the power to make war. Unprogressive kings are being dethroned, and progressive one are being tied so that they can do no mischief henceforth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">King Cpnstjmtine of Greece was-removed by the Allies because he was pro-German. and his eldest son was refused the succession for the * same reason. With his queen, Sophia, sister of the Kaiser, Cmistantihe has been in exile in Switzerland. The Kaiser has shut down on</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">QueVn .Sophia and will not let her have any money, and so Constantine is having a hard time, of it. In January he had a representative in London trying to sell his crown, reputed to be worth $150,000. He has had to change to a cheaper hotel, his Ford is gone, he has no. carriage; and he walks up and down, melancholy and shabby, in constant fear of being assassinated. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Upon Constantine’s expulsion from Greece, June 12, 1917, the Allies washed the crown upon his second son, Alexander, who in a brief time &quot;&nbsp;got himself into no end of trouble. A year ago he married a peasant girl, tlelen Manos, daughter of Colonel Manos, head of the royal stables. Under existing Greek laws the girl could not be the queen because not of noble (I) birth. Public sentiment forced the young girl to flee to Paris for safety.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Not long ago King Alexander secured permission of Venizelos, the Prime Minister, to visit his bride. He did so; and they were seen together in Paris, enjoying each other’s society to the utmost. Alexander thought he could fix it up with his mother, Sophia, but he^did not know-the Hohenzollems; for when he attempted to introduce his wife her mother-in-law lunged at her with an umbrella and with such a. torrent of abuse that the young couple fled from her presence. It was believed that the Greek parliament would probably pass a law enabling Alexander’s wife to become his queen, for the reason that Venizelos has said that it could matter little, because in fifty years the king of England will be the only king left in Europe. Venizelos is more than right in that statement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">King Alexander’s gallant fight for life, after having been bitten by a pet monkey, has enlisted the sympathies of the world. During his fatal illness his girl wife nursed him faithfully, with a devotion w-hich is most commendable.</span></p>

<p><span class="font15">A</span><span class="font11"> YEAR ago, in October, the Egyptian royal prince eloped with an Italian princess and attempted to escape to America. His income is $2,000,000 a year; and he thought it sufficient to maintain a family without his worrying over affairs of state.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Crown Prince Charles, of Roumania, married in September, 1918, a Miss Zyzis Lambrino, renounced the crown and accepted a lower rank in the army. His parents forced him to separata from his wife, but later he rejoined her, and then his parents forced a divorce. Meantime his wife has borne him a son and th* Crown Prince has made two attempts at.suicide. His father and his mother, King Ferdinand and Queen Marie, expect to visit the United States next spring; but if their caliber is shown by the treatment they have accorded their son and his' wife, they would better remain in Roumania, where they will be more appreciated.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">When the World War came to an end King Ferdinand of Bulgaria fled first to Austria. There he was roused in the middle of the night and ordered to leave again. This he did, going this time to Germany. Neither the Swiss nor the Czecho-Slovakian government would grant him a place of refuge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Russian and Asiatic Nobility</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">ABOUT 12:30 in the morning of July, 1918, as A the Czecho-Slovakian army was nearing Ekaterinburg, Siberia, where the Czar Nicholas and his f</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">amil</span><span class="font11">y were then confined, the local commissary, , one Jourowsky, or Youroffsky, or Kourovsky, as it is variously spelled in English, ordered the death of all the captives; and there followed one of the bloodiest deeds of history.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The Czar and all the members of his entourage, eleven in number, including his wife and all his children, were taken to the cellar and killed by rifle fire, hand grenades and bayonets. The bodies were placed in a mcfor truck, carried eighteen miles into the woods and burned to ashes. The ashes were thrown into an abandoned mine shaft.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Numerous effects of the family were recovered from residents of Ekaterinburg; and from the mine shaft were obtained some jewelry, identified as belonging to the royal family, fragments of their bodies, and splinters of the hand grenades used in the work of destruction. Twenty-eight men were put on trial for the murder. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Iri-is said that the beautiful crown jewels of Russia, in hiding since the overthrow of the Romanoffs, are now beginning to find their way into the London jewel market. This was the most valuable collection in Europe, estimated as worth .$100,800,000. The most important gem in the collection, the Koh-i-tur, together with its companion gem in the British crown, the Koh-i-noor, ouee constituted the eyes of the golden lion in front of the throne of the grand mogul at Delhi, India. If the grand </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">mogul</span><span class="font11"> had understood the civilizing and Christianizing influences of modern explosives and poison gas he might have had these diamonds yet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The crown of Catherine the Great, Russia’s principal diadem, was set with 2,536 diamonds. The czarina was exceedingly fond of diamonds. When the Kerensky government took charge of Russia and attempted to collect the crown, jewels, the crowns and other royal paraphernalia were found, but the original jewels had all been removed and paste jewels substituted. It is not known who did this; but it was a poor haul compared with what some of the profiteers in America have made during the war and since. We refer to the unprosecuted profiteers, still at liberty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">But three Romanoffs survived the massacre. One of these, Olga, age thirty-eight, the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">ex* </span><span class="font11">Czar’s sister, was found by the Red Cross near Novotossiski, South Russia, where she </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">was </span><span class="font11">living in rags in a box ear. She was brought </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">to-</span><span class="font11">Belgrade on a relief train, hatless, with worn-out shoes and empty purse, glad to take a plateful of hot soup from the food kitchen. •</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">In April of this year the yacht Ostara escaped from Odessa with eleven members of the Russian nobility on board.

<p><span class="font11">Tn Helsingfors, Finland, a Russian aristocrat earns a living by playing second violin in </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font11">restaurant; another bakes cakes at night which his wife sells during the day; another drives </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font11">drosky. carrying luggage and taking tips.

<p><span class="font11">Constantinople has great'humbers'ot Rosian refugees, admirals without ships, generals without soldiers, courtiers without courts. Some are living by rough work as porters, others upon the charity of the Allies, others ujvon the proceeds of their furs and gems, while these last. The Russian ruble is now so greatly deteriorated that the simplest dinner costs about six thousand rubles—formerly $3,000.^</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Occasionally there is a ray of sunshine left for £ some of these unfortunates. One Russian prin-' —eess who fled from Moscow married a Texan connected with the American relief expedition ,.and is now glad to be plain Mrs. Gillespie, of ; Houston, Texas. The estates of the Tolstoy family were seized for use as a pubEc institution for_the education of the people; hut they were placed in charge of the Tolstoy family, - who are invited to live there and to act as - teachers, on the national payroll.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">- Turkey has been divided up among the victors, Persia has been seized by England, CTuna has had no monarchs for a long time and the Emperor Yoshito of Japan has suffered a physical and mental collapse. When he recently - appeared in public he was cheered, instead of being greeted with the reverence of absolute quiet, as hitherto. This is the first sign of disin -tegration, a sign that the Japs are putting the monarch on a par with themselves. The Japanese royal f</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">amily</span><span class="font11"> is believed to be the oldest in . the world, reaching back to near the beginning of the Christian era.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">From the data here presented we think it clearly evident that all the kings of the world </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">are </span><span class="font11">making way for the great King, the true King, the Lord Jesus, &quot;whose right it ic* to reign.

<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Prohibition Misconceptions: </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>B</sup>u Frank Burnett </span><span class="font11" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Mr. Editor: Your article entitled &quot;Prohibition at Work”, in your issue of May 12, while'good in some respects, is,-on the whole, rather misleading.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">You say: &quot;Grape culture languishes, as does that of the hop”. That is not the case in this state. I^have seen it stated by the Stockton </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">' Record,</span><span class="font11"> a pajter of perhaps the largest circulation of ally iu the interior of California, that seventy dollars per ton is being offered for the coming crop of grapes, and it is even thought that the price may go higher. In former times grapes sold from about ten to twenty-two dollars -per ton; andT have even known the price to be so low that in some districts they were not gathered at all . Hops are now quoted at one dollar per pound. So these interests are not suffering _ at all, but are prosperous. Barley, which is supposed to be used in the making of beer, never was higher that I can remember than during the last year. Therefore the liquor men’s direful predictions have failed to materialize.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Furthermore, you seem to think that the success of prohibition is due to the efforts of the -orthodox churches in its behalf. While it is strictly true that they did take the lead in the agitation for prohibition, it was not due. to their superior leadership, or to their influence alone. The church people afre greatly in the minority . in this state, in both numbers and influence. The voters who made prohibition a fact, were, as </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">far </span><span class="font11">as I have observed, for the most part outside of any religious organization. A great many of them were dissatisfied with what the preachers . were giving out in their campaigns for prohibit <sup>1 </sup>tion. These complaints became so numerous' that I . wrote twice to the headquarters of the Anti-Saloon League requesting them to he more practical and to place their arguments more on economic grounds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">. Therefore I believe that the success of prohibition was rather in spite of the church leadership than as </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font11">result of it. Looked at </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">from a </span><span class="font11">material point of view it seems far more reasonable to suppose that the “dry” law won because the great mass of the people, </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">seeing </span><span class="font11">the evils growing out of the saloon, so obvious to aD, voted it out regardless of religion or their own personal habits in regard to liquor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">However, in accounting for the downfall of the liquor traffic is there not a higher reason than any that is usually given 1 It is said: &quot;There is a tide in the affairs of men”. I take the position it was due to the fact that the &quot;due time” had arrived for the tiquor traffic to go. Like Napoleon in his last defeat, it had made too many orphans, robbed too many women and children, gained great political power and thus came athwart the path of h</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">uman</span><span class="font11"> progress, and in doing this came in conflict with the divine Power of the Universe, and hence its Waterloo. We may well believe that the benefits of prohibition already experienced, so wall set forth in your article, indicate the near approach of a Golden Age, &quot;long foretold by seers and sages”.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>Petty Frauds and Their Detection</span></h2>
<p><span class="font15">N</span><span class="font11">OT merely do Americans have to keep themselves set in battle array against the brood of giant corporate enemies exacting huge but invisible taxation in the form of company profits, but against the little sneak thief of the retail dealer galvanized to activity by the boldness of his big brother in crime. Where the criminal of great wealth steals by thousands or millions, or tens of millions of dollars, the tiny weasel of business gets his a little at a time, by pennies, nickels or dimes. It is a pity that the river of trade should be polluted with the slimy trickles of petty fraud, but it is sometimes difficult to escape under present conditions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Each person must be his own inspector of weights and measures, or continually suffer loss. He should see that all scales rest at the zero point without load, and must practise quick and accurate reading of scales. If there is any question as to correct weight, an honest dealer welcomes reweighing without protest or discussion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Scales are &quot;fixed” in a variety of ways. Meat dealers commonly use a flat-pan scale suspended from above with a dial indicator. A dishonest dealer may hang a lock or weight of several ounces in such a manner that the added -weight goes into the price of every purchase weighed. This fraud may he known by the fact that the scale will not rest at zero.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Computing scales are made to weigh falsely by adjusting them out of the level position. The indicator should rest at zero; but when out of level it may register several ounces too much on every article weighed&quot;. The customer should see whether the indicator hand rests at zero.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The iceman gets an excess profit by stretching his spiral-spring scale, until the spring is weakened, thus enabling him to obtain payment for several pounds more ice than he sells. This fault is ascertainable by observing whether the scale'hegisters zero when at rest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">In the equal balance scale, where merchandise in a tin scoop is balanced by weights, a rubber may connect the merchandise end of the scale with the^ase of the scale, making the merchandise seem to Keigh too mueh. Springs of various hands, oflroneealed weights, or the out-of-level position of the scale, may increase the buyer's already high cost of living. His self-protection lies in seeing that the scale balances freely.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">When faulty measures are used customers are fooled in buying liquids, as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Measures bent and denied, bottom cupped, measure leaky, syrup, oil, etc., caked on side or bottom, false bottom or side, or too short.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Liquid measures are falsely used for dry measures. Nursing bottles a,nd glass graduates are wrongly graduated, and should be compared with standards at drug stores or local office of weights and measures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Every dry measure should be looked over. The bottom may be reduced in diameter and the sides relapped. This can be detected by the poor nailing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Buyers can save money by observing the following suggestions:</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Save a penny ; by refusing to accept weight of paper and parchment with cheese; by demanding a full quart of milk; by insisting pn full weight in the loaf of bread; by watching the man pump gasoline into the automobile.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Save two pennies: by demanding full weight for onions, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Save a nickel: by demanding a full quart of berries; by not paying for weight of tray with the butter; by watching the iceman weigh the ice; by buying by the pound or the quart, not by the box or measure; by insisting on 15 pounds to the peck of potatoes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Save a dime: By watching the meat man weigh the poultry; by refusing to accept coal bags not filled to the top; by buying a &quot;pound” of candy, not a &quot;box”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Inaccurate linear measures defraud as fol-, lows: Yard-sticks are bent, warped or worn; advertising yard-sticks may be long or short by as much as half an inch; cloth tapes are inaccurately divided or are stretched or shrunken. Dealers should use steel tapes, and save losses for themselves or their customers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">It helps the high cost of living, if milk bottles are examined as to capacity; if the coal-man delivers 20 bags to the ton, and fills up his coal bags, or empties all the coal in your load; if purchases are made in definite quantities, as pounds, bushels, barrels, quarts, etc.; if buying in small quantities is avoided when possible; if purchases are not made by the &quot;can”, “pail”, &quot;basket”, or “box”; if the housewife equips herself with kitchen weights and a measure outfit to check all purchases; if false onmisleading state-</span></p>

<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Wool Production: <sup>B</sup>y <sup>B</sup>-</span><span class="font11"> <sup>E</sup>- <sup>Co</sup>ff<sup>c</sup>i*</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">W</span><span class="font11">OOL has for thousands of years been used for* clothing. Most wool comes from the back of the sheep; and in the United States, the Western grazing. regions produce the largest quantities. Small flocks of sheep, however, may be seen on many of the farms in the East, and their presence is said to increase the fertility and productiveness of the soil. There are three principal grades of wool produced; coarse, medium and fine. The coarse wools are produced by the mutton breeds of sheep, such as Shropshire, Southdown, Hampshire, etc. The fine wools are produced by the French and American merino. Medium wool is produced by a crossing of the mutton and the merino breeds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The coarse wool was in the greatest demand during the war and brought the highest prices. This was on account of the large quantities of this grade consumed by the Government in the manufacture of army uniforms and blankets. Now the fine wools are bringing the top prices; for they are in greater demand for worsted and fine woolen manufactures. Merino sheep are bred for wool production, and are the best adapted to range conditions, because they stand exposure and flock well together. The mutton breeds, as the term implies, are bred with mutton qualities uppermost in mind, and their fleece is giveij only secondary consideration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The fleece is removed from the sheep once each year, the average weight of each fleece being about six pounds. Whether or not sheep shotfld have their fleece washed before shearing </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">: has </span><span class="font11">been a much debated question, but now the</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font11">general conclusion is that better results obtain by leaving the fleece unwashed. Since the coarse wool shrinks 30 percent </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">when secured </span><span class="font11">and the fine wool 50 percent, it </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">can be easily </span><span class="font11">seen that an enormous saving in </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">transportation </span><span class="font11">charges could </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">be </span><span class="font11">effected by installing </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">securing' </span><span class="font11">plants near the eenters of production. '</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Not all of the shrinkage, </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">however, is waste. -</span><span class="font11">A good percentage of potash </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">salts is nh</span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">h«</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">tri</span><span class="font11">ad, and these are. valuable ingredients of commercial fertilisers. Another valuable </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">by-product </span><span class="font11">removed in scouring is the </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">natural wool-fat, </span><span class="font11">called “lanoline”. This substance is extensively used by dairymen for sore and </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">chapped udders,' </span><span class="font11">and is valuable, too, in treating </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">cracked hoofs. </span><span class="font11">The labor of shearing has </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">been greatly reduced </span><span class="font11">by mechanical shears, and it is now possible for a skilled laborer to shear from </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">100 to 200 hea&lt;F </span><span class="font11">of sheep per day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Each fleece, as it is removed from the </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">sheep, ’ </span><span class="font11">is tied separately and placed in </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">the baling </span><span class="font11">machine or wool sack. The sack in common </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">use </span><span class="font11">can be made to hold from two </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">hundred to three — </span><span class="font11">hundred fleeces. After </span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">Racking</span><span class="font11"> </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">or baling the </span><span class="font11">wool must be hauled to market </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font11">in </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">South’ </span><span class="font11">America this often means </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">a journey of fifty </span><span class="font11">miles or more. When marketed, </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">the yool may-</span><span class="font11">being the </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">producer fifty or sixty cents per </span><span class="font11">pound.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Before the Work! </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">War there was just one </span><span class="font11">woolen mill in the United States </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">that made np </span><span class="font11">wool on shares. </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">It was possible to get a first </span><span class="font11">class pair of woolen blankets </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">weighing seven </span><span class="font11">pounds for fourteen pounds of </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">scoured wook It </span><span class="font11">would take less than this amount </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">of wool to </span><span class="font11">obtain the material for a fine dress suit; and i&gt; Texas the cost for tailoring </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">was ten dollars. </span><span class="font11">Now this mill no longer deals with the consumer; for it finds other avenues of trade more profitable. The .price for a suit, which </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">could </span><span class="font11">be </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">made </span><span class="font11">from ten or twelve pounds of wool in the grease, now ranges from sixty dollars up.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">There is something radically wrong with our present system: it is based on selfishness. The great labor-saving machinery and methods of our day should be for the benefit of all. Each should enjoy in equity the fruits of his own labor. But this cannot be until man learns the futility of his own efforts to bring about righteousness. “Man's extremity will he God's opportunity’: and so it is written: ‘’The desire of . all nations shall come&quot;—the long-looked-for Golden Age.—Haggai 2:7.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">The Glories of Sunlight:</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">C</span><span class="font11">OME—let us give heed for a little while to that which is such a common thing in nature, to that which enters incessantly into our daily activities and which so often causes our hearts to throb with gladness, as it lends lustre to all we see and touch, to that glorious gift of our benevolent Creator which men call sunlight.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">No matter how sunlight may be regarded we are conscious of the fact that all animate </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">creation</span><span class="font11"> in connection with this sphere is dependent upon the daily bath of these precious rays; and if we could conceive of a complete cutting off of this suffusing radiance, we know that all things breathing would soon cease to exist; for sunlight is the prime essential for perception,* warmth, growth and health of plant and anima] life. We agree therefore with the words of the wise man (Ecclesiastes 11:7): &quot;Truly light is sweet, and a pleasant thing it is to behold the sun”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">This element is so fundamental that 'all good gifts around us’ are dependent upon it for their own continued existence. The very earth began its course under the benign influences of some form of light. “Let there be light” was the initial divine command. Then command followed command till the earth, once dark and *without form and void,’ moved upon its axis, carrying with it countless creatures, small and great, in which was the 'breath of life’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">When the sun disappears at the close of the day and consigns us to darkness, we console ourselves for its absence as best we can, and adopt such, expedients for the' supply of light as ingenuity can devise. Howbeit night is always a time of gloom, and sometimes of dread, notwithstanding we know the sun will soon reappear. But should the bright orb forsake us for a few days—what then! It is recorded that during th£ three days of Egyptian darkness ‘they saw not one another, nor rose any from his place’; and Josephus the Jewish historian relates that many died miserably under its terrors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">But how long would it take for the world to become a dark dikinal chaos full of horror and desolation! ^Ehere would be no more cheerful colors or beautiful forms. The faces of our friends would cease to beam upon us. All the warmth of the atmosphere would speedily steal away and give place to universal frost. Arctic</span></p>

<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">By Frederic Lardent, D.B.O.E. (London.} </span><span class="font11">explorers report that the effect of the long winter darkness in the polar regions is keenly depressing. Even the native dogs are unable to withstand it; the sight of a lighted candle—faint resemblance to the sun—has caused them to express the most exuberant cries of satisfaction. But death comes to many as a welcome release.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">But to cut off the sun’s rays completely, would-cause the earth to grow exceedingly cold; and in such a state of things no living creature could survive. The trees would be blasted and withered; crops would die: beast and bird quickly yield their breath, and all mankind w.ould be involved in speedy destruction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Without light of any kind everything is rendered invisible. Nothing could be distinguished, no matter how close to the eyes. Hence a complete absence of light equals the condition of total blindness, from which standpoint the gift of light and the faculty of sight are inseparable companions. Remove one or the other and darkness ensues to the individual. This is equally true concerning all the other senses which belong to the animal organism. Sound, for instance, is of no use without a hearing' apparatus, and the latter is unnecessary unless the former is in operation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">From this we learn the essentiality of an accurate formation of the various organs to correspond singly and collectively with the many influences which abound in nature. The fact that all is so well arranged, and justly proportioned, evidences conclusively that the Framer of nature’s laws was also Architect of the various functional organs. And here again we quote the words of Solomon—&quot;The hearing ear, and the seeing eye, the Lord hath made even both of them”.—Proverbs 20:12.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">Whatever value there is in the lesser sources of light, we know they pale into insignificance as compared to the sun. We do well therefore to cull together a few facts relative to that wonderful ruler of day. The deductions of science reveal that the sun is situated about ninety-three millions of miles away from the earth—a distance so great,that two hundred years would elapse before a locomotive, traveling at fifty miles an hour, without a stop, could</span></p>

(Psahn 84:11) The symbol is also appropriate </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">for the </span><span class="font11">Lord Jesus, who is now “the express image </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font11">the Father’s person”, and who&quot; will arise as the Sun of Righteousness with healing in His wings. (Malachi 4:2) The saints, those faithful overcomers who have followed in their Master's footsteps, will “shine forth as the sun. in the kingdom of their Father”. (Matthew 13:43) They are thereby promised a nature akin to God’s and will therefore be fully equipped to dispense grace, blessing and life to the whole world in the Golden Age now dawning.—Romans 8:19-22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">What is Light?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">What is it that the sun emits to mitigate darkness, and bring in the glories of day! The Emission Theory, at one time advanced, looked upon the sun as yielding a mass of luminous particles, propelled at tremendous force, and eventually reaching the earth in the form of light. This theory has since been abandoned in favor of the wave or undulatory theory. This assumes the existence of a fine elastic, subtle, invisible medium filling all space, permeating all matter, and called .ether; and it is the specific vibratory motion of this substance which results in light. The remarkable thing in this connection is that the agitated particles are not transmitted hut only the disturbance or vibration.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font11">A suggestive example of this law is the casting of a stone into a placid pool of water. The result is the setting up of symmetrically everwidening waves or ripples arising from the force of impact and lessening in their power according to distance. The water corresponds to the all-pervading sether, the stone to the sun and the waves or ripples to light. Hence we see that just as those ever-widening circles of waves could not exist without water, so, too, light could not be formed without the presence of an elastic medium capable of vibratory motion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Truly ffither must be a marvel of the Creator’s handiwork. It is interesting to note a scripture which, perhaps, establishes this scientific truth. In Isaiah 40: 22 we read of </span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">Him</span><span class="font11"> who “stretcheth out the heavens as a curtain and spreadeth them out as a tent to dwell in”. The word “tent” has reference to a covering or dwelling place and is appropriately translated &quot;tabernacle&quot; in Psalm 19:4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The word “curtain” (Hebrew—</span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">doq)</span><span class="font11"> is rendered by learned Biblical expositors to mean “thin veil” or “film” or “fineness” giving the thought of a highly attenuated medium in which all the heavenly bodies move and by which they are all connected. Daniel prophesied that “knowledge shall be increased” (Daniel 12:4) and surely this astonishing discovery evidences the truth of this statement. By the practical use of this medium the Golden Age is being prepared to surpass, in time, even the fanciful dreamSof the idealist. Already astherical messages in the form of “wireless” are being sent world-wide in a moment of time. Ships in midocean may now receive and exchange news: and, more astounding still, sounds can now travel as fast as lighi through the medium of tether. As a practical example indicating the great strides which have been made in wireless telephony, the music of an orchestra has been heard hundreds of mil 's out in the Atlantic Ocean, while actually played at Chelmsford, near London, Eng.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Some Marvels of Light</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Light travels at the astonishing rapidity of 186,000 miles per second; a velocity like that of light is capable of girdling the earth’s equator over four hundred times in a single minute; and light actually crosses those ninety-three millions of miles between the sun and the earth in eight minutes and fourteen seconds. Our nearest neighbor among the suns of space is Alpha Centauri and that is so far away that it takes about four years for its light to reach our eye. .When we strain our eyes through a telescope to distinguish points of light in the haze of the Milky Way, astronomers declare we are catching glimpses of light which started on its way -46 us before the opening of human history.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">In other words, presuming that there were optical instruments efficient enough,' and that we were residing as far away from the earth as Alpha Centauri, we might be able to witness—■ through the transmitted light from this sphere— some of those dreadful scenes enacted during the Great War. From an abode billions of miles still farther away we might see—as though it were being enacted—the French Revolution or the American Wat of Independence. Farther away still we might discern our Master performing His miracles and ‘going about doing good’. At a still greater distance we might catch glimpses of the bursting of the flood of waters over all the earth and then receding; still farther we might watch the beautiful garden of Eden lit up by a glory of sunlight revealing the sweet innocence and perfect happiness of our first parents just prior to that dread fall. This seems an imaginative picture; but as to its possibility we have an evidence in photography which proves that light bears with it the precise expression of the condition of scenes and objects at the moment the light left them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">To our finite minds we are assured that much which may be said along these lines comes far short of Divine Power as indicated by the significant words, “The Lord looketh from heaven; he looketh upon all the sons of men, from the place of his habitation he looketh upon all the inhabitants of the earth”. (Psalm 33:14) Again, we read: “Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight: but all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do”.—Hebrews 4:13. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">various means, one of which was through the i. - experiments of a young scientist,' Professor Hertz. In 1888 he discovered that by means of quite a simple apparatus he could send electro- magnetic waves across his room. Every time he ' made an electric spark from a battery he &amp;&nbsp;noticed that a spark also was generated between * a small loop of wire held at a Little distance away, thus proving that some invisible force had been propelled abroad. In due course this led to the invention of wireless telegraphy, for the practical use of which we are largely indebted to Marconi. Hertz, morever, discovered that . these invisible waves travelled at precisely the : &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;same velocity as that of light, evidencing</span></p>

And, as it is gauged that i the earth intercepts only one twenty-two hili' lionth part of the sun’s mighty and glorious ■ radiations we are awed at the sublime spectacle : &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of that glorious creation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">It is well known that sunlight exerts a peculiar and vivifying force on the three kingdoms, of nature. Fruits, flowers, and animal life find it necessary to their prosperity, and the healthiest portions of a hospital are the wards which have the maximum of sunshine. The work done by it in the green leaves of trees in past ages resulting in vast coal seams must have been something enormous; and were it possible to produce the - data it would be an interesting problem to ascertain how many millions of tons of wood were annually produced by the chemical action of light. Light travels in its course with wonderful mathematical order and precision, and many books IvTve been written on this theme affording . a field of profound reflection for scientific minds. Passing through an arrangement of lenses light proceeding from far distant regions may be so affected thpt scenes and objects become appar-| ently near.^ Through another arrangement of I lenses the fhost minute objects are seen in. all their ingenuity and beauty. Optical instruments enabling light to serve innumerable useful ends ... <sub>v ?</sub> are now many and varied. Truly wonderful is</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">the discovery of photography by means of which ■ • light as it radiates from objects may be per- \ manently recorded. Then we have the X or <sup>1 </sup>Rbntgen rays, which are able to pass through many opaque objects and are therefore of the ' ‘ utmost value in surgery, to detect growths, fractures, etc. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;’</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">natural effects and marvels of sunlight, we । may perhaps see more clearly why the language flight and darkness’ is so expressive and full </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">of . </span><span class="font11">meaning. No wonder they </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">are used as apt </span><span class="font11">1 metaphors denoting prosperity, happiness, </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">and &nbsp;&nbsp;- ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">intelligence on the one hand and adversity, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&gt;</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">sorrow and ignorance, on. the other! In the. ■ .; Scriptures we find very appropriate eompari- j sons between light and truth: the latter affecting s 1 the mind and heart, illuminating and. uplifting them. Of the great source of ‘every good and .<sub>4 </sub>perfect gift* we read: “God is light and in him </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">Is ; ■&gt; </span><span class="font11">no darkness at all”. (1 John 1:5) Concerning His message through the prophets we read: “We &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;g</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">have a more sure word of prophecy, whereunto j i 1 ye do well that ye take heed as unto a light that . shineth in a dark place until the day dawn”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The. only lamp which will illuminate the path <sup>:</sup> * leading towards that Golden Gate of Eternal &quot;&nbsp;Life is the neglected Word of God—“Thy word । &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path”.—Psalm 119:105. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The Master possessing the Divine Message could say with assurance: “I am the light of ; the world; he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness but shall have the light of life”. (John 8:12) True to those prophetic words His faithful followers have since been the flights of the world*. • The advancing knowledge on all themes, especially Biblical truth, is in fulfillment of Daniel 12:4. Again we read: &quot;The , path of the just is as a shining Kght that shineth * more and more unto the perfect day**.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Few of earth’s teeming millions are aware of the “marvellous light” thrown upon the Scriptures which all sincere Bible students are now so privileged to enjoy. The wondrous foregleams of “perfect day” are truly transporting. To them “morning is spread upon the mountains”, while to others whose “hearts are failing them through fear” it is “a day of gloominess, of clouds and of thick darkness”.—Joel 2:2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Few, too, are able to realize that earth’s rightful king has indeed come to illuminate the darkness and disperse the gloom. His majestic presence however cannot be localized but is compared to advancing daylight. &quot;For as the lightning [Greek </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">astrape,</span><span class="font11"> meaning bright-shining] cometh out of the east [like sunlight] and shineth even unto the west so shall be the coming [Greek, </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">parousia,</span><span class="font11"> meaning presence] of the Son of Man”.—Matthew 24:27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">When Bible students declare concerning the manifold glories of the coming kingdom some of their hearers express their unbelief in the words—“It is too good to be true”. On the other hand these faithful messengers say that words fail to express the unutterable joys which will surely come to the willing and obedient. In confirmation hearken to those highly figurative, yet exquisite words of the prophet: “Then the moon shall be confounded and the sun ashamed when the Lord shall reign in mount Zion and in Jerusalem before his ancients gloriously”. (Isaiah 24:23) Again, “The light of the moon shall be as the light of the, sun, as the light of seven days, in the day that the Lord bindeth up the breach of his people, and healeth the stroke of his wound”.—Isaiah 30:26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">A distinctive feature about literal sunlight is that it performs its mighty work in silence. In sublime quietude it sets the delightful music of earth and sky ringing. How' like that Truth which culminates in righteousness! We are told that ‘its rare and precious fruit &quot;is sown in peace”. (James 3:18) The poet has well said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">&quot;The light is ever silent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It sparkles on morn’s million gems of dew.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It flings itself into a -hnwer of noon,</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">' It weaxvs iti, gold into the clouds of sunset.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Yet notpi sound is heard; it dashes full</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">On yon broad rock, yet not an y'cho answers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The light is ever pure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">No art of man can ever rob it qf its beauty, • Nor stain its unpolluted heaven lines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It is the fairest, purest thing in nature;</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">, Fit type of heavenly truth, which is all pure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Truth too, with noiseless grandeur, Upon its heavenly mission goeth forth. ' It shineth on, till ’neath its rays benign, The buds of heavenly virtue do appear And earth gives promise of a summer time*, And so ’twill ever shine,&quot; till fruit and flower Of virtue, peace and praise bedeck the earth. Truth, like the light, is pure, And no device to rob it of its glory Or drag it down base purposes to serve ‘ Can e’er succeed. Ah no I its heavenly glory Shall in due time the universe pervade.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">In conclusion we may well look upon the rising of the sun whose influence entirely disperses the gloom of some dark and weary night as reminding us of the rising of the Sun of Righteousness —Jesus and His faithful bride—whose presence and benign influence will mean the removal of all sin, sorrow, and wrong, and result in the blessings of grace, health, and life, to all families of the earth, and as the literal sunlight will bring to view scenes which artists spend their lives in an endeavor to copy on canvas, charms which inspire the poets and all lovers of nature, the blue dome of heaven with its ever-changing sunlit clouds, the living green of the meadows bespangled by a thousand lovely flowers, the luscious fruit of the orchard, the picturesque landscape, the lofty majestic mountains, the dew sparkling like millions of diamonds, the glittering waterfall, the rushing cataract, the joyous birds of beautiful, and gorgeous apparel—all expressing the varied glories of sunlight—we are thereby reminded of those essential inner charms which belong to heart and mind and which will surely spring forth under the marvellous and wonder-working influence of the divine spirit of truth. Then will those remarkable prophetic words be fulfilled—“I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh”. “As truly as I live, all the earth shall be filled with the glory of the Lord.”—Joel 2:28; Numbers 14:21.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">, Milk as a Food: </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">By Mrs. Andrew J. Holmes</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font15">A</span><span class="font11">S FAR back in history as the Bible record • goes, we find* that milk and milk-products have been among the principal foods of man. More especially is this true of the peoples of the Far East. Cow’s </span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">milk</span><span class="font11">, however, was not the only </span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">milk</span><span class="font11"> used. In the desert regions camel’s and mare’s milk, and in. the mountains goat’s and sheep's milk, were in general use, according to local conditions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">As a food, milk ranks high in nutritive value, in digestibility and in palatability. The flavor of milk varies; for it is. often influenced by the food of the cow, especially when the animal has eaten some substance with a strong taste. This is due to the fact that the volatile oil or other flavor of the food has passed directly through the animal tissues into the milk. Milk also absorbs flavors and odors from the air much more quickly than do most foods. The animal or “cowy” taste or smell often noticeable in new milk is believed to be due in part to this absorption. But it may also be due to carelessness in milking.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">There are various ways for preserving milk for a short time. The best means of so preserving it as to insure its wholesomeness for a short period is pasteurization. In this process the aim is to destroy as many bacteria as possible without producing any change in the chemical constituents of the milk. This destruction begins at a temperature of about 167° F. During the process the temperature should not exceed 185° F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">To pasteurize milk at home place the liquid in air-tight bottles and immerse these to the neck in hot water. Then heat it, for instance, to 149° F. for one half hour or to 167° F. for fifteen minutes; and then quickly cool it to 50° F-, or lower. This rapid cooling lessens the “cooked, taste which many persons find objectionable. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The relative constituents of milk are : Water, 87.27: casein, 2.88: protein, .51: fat, 3.68: carbohydrates, £.94; mineral matter, .72.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The valu^ of milk as a food is not so generally understood as it should be. Many adults think of it as a beverage rather than as a food. One quart of average milk contains the same amount of nutritive ingredients as twelve ounces of the best beefsteak or as six ounces of bread. As compared with meat, milk contains more carbohydrates, and there is no waste. Of the first importance is the fact that </span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">milk</span><span class="font11"> is a perfect food. Notwithstanding its present high price it is the cheapest of all animal foods. Because of not understanding the cheapness of </span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">milk</span><span class="font11"> at any price many housewives cut down the </span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">milk</span><span class="font11"> supply, and substitute other foods of inferior nourishing properties which cost more relatively than even the highest-priced </span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">milk</span><span class="font11">. •</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">It has been demonstrated that of all food values in the food consumed by farm animals we get in return less than four percent in beef; whereas eighteen percent is recovered in the form of milk. It is not generally known that as . a food meat contains a vast quantity of water and also waste matter. Meat provides principally protein and fat in the diet, while milk affords every element required by the human body and in the right proportion and combination to be turned quickly into blood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Milk is such a perfect food that some physicians call it &quot;white blood”, for the reason that it is quickly converted into blood, with no waste in the process. All the carbohydrates, all the fats, all the protein essential for the building up of a strong, healthy body immune from disease—all these are contained in milk. The folly of reducing the quantity of milk used in the home is so far-reaching in its results that no matter how difficult to obtain/ milk should be the last article of diet to be reduced in quantity. There is a vast army of people who would be benefited beyond belief if they would only use milk as a food.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">When I included milk in my diet I had been a physical cultnrist for some years, but was not fully satisfied with my physical condition. I saw an advertisement of a concentrated food in tablet form, secured a package and found that it was milk. After reading of what the tablets were composed, I thought: Why not get these ingredients firsthand, fresh and directly from, milk in its natural state, instead of in a concentrated condition, and without the chemical changes of the constituents, due to the putting of it into tablet form? This I did; and the results have been all that I could desire. ' <sub>x</sub></span></p>

<p><span class="font11">* I studied myself and my husband. We both ' needed better blood and more of it. Gradually I came to believe that milk was the best thing</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">1 I could use in connection with other health-। building materials. The first result that I observed was a better circulation of the blood. My hands and feet were warmer. I seemed to have more, blood, and I soon felt stronger. T did not weigh myself; but my husband weighed himself, and from June to October he gained</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;38 pounds. We both felt better, slept better,</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">j &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;were able to do more work without feeling tired;</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">. and altogether a more satisfactory state of • &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;health obtained.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">I We began with five quarts of milk daily. We have only two meals a day; so for each meal 1 we each drank a quart of milk, and the remaining quart I used for cooking or otherwise. We always drink all the milk we care for or enjoy । in addition to the food; and this is always two i &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;quarts apiece. I have been told that some people</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">I &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;yrnnnot take milk satisfactorily with other food;</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">but I have found no difficulty along-that line when the </span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">milk</span><span class="font11"> is used in combination with other ’ . foods of the right kind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Milk is a food that tends to the normal. If . one is too thin, the use of the proper quantity * of milk will plump </span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font11"> up to the normal weight.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">If on the other hand enough milk is used, and <sup>!</sup> not so much fat-forming foods, those who are 1 too fat will reduce to the normal, if sufficient exercise is taken to keep the body in a healthy condition. By regular exercise I keep myself - in a firm, vigorous condition, and I practise what I advise others to do. I work every day in the week, the year around, from fifteen to seventeen or eighteen hours: and then I am not ’ &quot;all in”, but just tired enough to go to sleep as soon as I retire. When I awake I am refreshed, and ready for the same number of , hours'work again.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Milk is the greatest curative food known. The benefit of the exclusive milk diet, when properly <sub>r</sub> taken, has been demonstrated in a great number of instances. But the proper method of taking this treatment's not generally understood, nor is it always convenient. So the best thing to do is to try the use of milk in connection with other foods of the right sort and with other ■ methods of health-building, which The Golden</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Age publishes from time to time; and in a few - . weeks you will be gratified with the results.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Moreover, as you study the body and its needs you will soon have a fund of information which . you can impart to others; and they-in turn may be benefited.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">When taken cold, milk is often more palatable i than when warm. But if one is weak or if a large amount of milk is taken at one time, it ■ is better to warm the milk, unless it is supped . slowly. The tendency to constipation is not t uncoirimon in the early use of milk. But it can . &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">be overcome by using a larger amount of </span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">milk</span><span class="font11">, . 1 less solid food and more fruits. The belief that -only whole milk is fit for food is erroneously . &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">held by many housewives. This thought is perhaps due to the esteem in which cream in held. ' But cream is less easily digested than is the ' same amount of whole milk, because the former contains so much fat After milk has been — skimmed it is deficient only in fat, but not so in regard to protein, carbohydrates and the J other elements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">If combined with cream, cottage cheese is a ? very nutritious dish made from skim milk after . J it has become sour. Junket is a good dish for invalids. When properly prepared, it also makes a good dessert Junket is made by adding rennet, .’ sugar and some desired flavor to the skim milk, and then allowing it to stand undisturbed until . it has coagulated, or thickened — that is, until the casein is precipitated. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Butter is one of the most important sources of fat in our diet. Buttermilk is often used as a beverage, and has much the same food value as skim milk. Clabber is an article of diet liked by many people. It is wholesome; and those who like it find it refreshing, especially when it eon-tains all the nutritive ingredients originally present in the milk. When only skim milk is used, the clabber contains the casein and all the other ingredients of milk except the fat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">In conclusion: I do not think that any one is as healthy and as immune to disease as he would be if he included at least two quarts of milk per day in his diet. And children certainly cannot grow and develop strong, healthy bodies unless | they are given all the milk they can use. The &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">material for making bone, teeth and tissue, as &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">well as all the elements required by the human system for carrying on the process of growth and development, is contained in milk and in the right proportion and right combination to be utilized by the digestive system. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">jb </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">TN </span><span class="font11">THE Buddhist faith one of the standards fZ A is reverence for the relics of Buddha. Con-ceming ti\e Holy Coat of Buddha it is told that the nephew of Buddha, “by his supernatural gift, springing up into the air to the height of seven jr &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;palmyra trees and stretching out his arm,</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;brought to the spot where he was poised the</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">shrine in which the coat laid aside by Buddha was enshrined, and exhibited it to the people”!</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The teeth of Buddha are in equal respect _ among the Buddhists; and the Rajah, the King of Devas, was the possessor of the right caninetooth relic of Buddha, as well as of “the right collar-bone of the Divine Teacher”. How fortunate, too, was Emperor Francis Joseph of Austria-Hungary, when a few years ago he . received “from the pope as a mark of his special . regard and favor, a tooth of Saint Peter”! The bones of Buddha were inexplicably scattered all j - over the earth, like those of Osiris and Jupiter; and to collect them was the pious duty of his •. followers; great is the joy of the faithful when it is announced that one of the bones of “the - Son of the Spirit of Heaven” has been rescued *f- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from profane soil and is about to find a shrine</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">L &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;suited to relics of “The Great One”. Egypt, too,</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">3|; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;had its hopes; for there were literally hundreds</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">of sepulchres of part or all of the martyred Egyptian god; and rival cemeteries boasted of . ■ many a leg or arm, vouched for by the priests as genuine, and not merely being sacred themselves, but possessing the power even of making the very ground sacred where they were en-’ shrined. Rome, too, has its bones — seven or eight arms of Saint Matthew, two or three heads of Saint Peter, and numberless teeth and bones —so many, indeed, that any of the saints could spare a few more or less complete skeletons to unfortunates who might want to replace their lost bones, if the coming forth of the dead were like what some of the clergy say it will be.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">But there is one great religious body that has had the reputation of preserving “the faith” in good order. It is today generally acknowledged ' by the adherents of the principal body of England and its American followers, the Protestant Episcopal church, that whatever may be said of others, the national church of Russia is worthy of all reverence and affiliation; and at a recent : . -• Episcopalian conferefice in Detroit, the repre</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark18"><span class="font11">sentatives of the Russian Greek Church were received as brothers. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark19"><span class="font11">It is distressing, to say the least, to have the • public press come out with stories of the lack of due respect with which the shrines of the</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark20"><span class="font11">national Church of Russia have been recently</span></a></p>
<p><span class="font11">treated. For Russia has its bones, and concerning the relics of Saint Tikhon Zalinsky, the Archbishop of Voronezh says; “I specially • believed in the relics of Saint Tikhon. They &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;’</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">stood out with such clearness from the eoffin &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">that one had the perfect impression that in the coflin was a man who had just been put there.” ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Russia really had the best of the other coun— 1 tries; for, while others had only bones or teeth, Russia had nondecomposable bodies, which . t from generation to generation remained the same as when the life of the saint left the body. These were doubtless the most wonderful relies <sub>} </sub>in the world, and so the faithful regarded them. As one of them, honest old Constantin N. Stche- <sup>s </sup>lokov, says: ‘T, as a believer, remained in the church with my hat off, in spite of the bitter * * cold, and felt fear in my heart”. In </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">Russia it </span><span class="font11">t is not necessary to heat up churches </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">for the </span><span class="font11">common people. , &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;&nbsp;1</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">There are many venerable relics of </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">saints, &gt;&nbsp;</span><span class="font11">and whole saints themselves, in Russia. Scores of monasteries have relics of saints, venerable and hoary with age, and invaluable in maintaining the religious spirit among the common peo-pie. There is Saint Mitrofan at Veronezh. There is the monastery of Tver, visited yearly by thousands of people. At Yaroslav, are the famous relics of Saints Vasili and Constantin. At another place is the nondecomposable body . of Saint Alichael the Pious, and one of Saint , Arseni, the miracle worker. One of the most eminent saints of the Russian national Church is Saint Alexander Svirsky, the sight of whose body, with proper faith and prayer, has made ' miraculous cures for hundreds. Indeed the Rus- . sian people, by thousands, have to thank the ... saints for their nondecomposable bodies and the healing gift so beneficial to many. For the Russians worship, not only their ikons, or statues, but most of all the miracle-working bodies of the saints.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Among the faithful no one in Russia had anything but reverential awe for the saints. Not</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font11">even Chureh dignitaries (including some that recently came to Detroit) who hud charge of and bccasiqnally dusted off the nondecompos-able bodies admit that they knew aught but that the bodies were what they appeared to be when viewed in the dim religious light from a distance. For the dignitaries and the priests repeatedly have preached to the people that these were the very bodies of the very saints.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">It seemed to give-pain to the dignitaries a short time ago, when the Russian government ordered an investigation of the saints. The grateful common people had contributed largely and consistently for centuries wherever there was a good nondecomposable saint; and what happened caused the Archbishop of Voronezh to exclaim, “It is very sad!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">For at the Monastery of Saint Mitrofan the nondecomposable body of the saint was an imitation of a human body, stuffed with cotton, and the inside of the figure was stuffed so much that the saint had a small head and an enormous body.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The Archbishop of Veronezh, who had had charge of Saint Tikhon Zalinsky, regre</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:line-through;">t</span><span class="font11">t</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:line-through;">ed t</span><span class="font11">he ■occurrence and stated: “When I received from the Abbot of the Zadonsky Monastery the information of what was really found, I was much grieved; for it was the general conviction that the relics of Tikhon were fully preserves!”. The government inspection had made a change in the general conviction, and Saint Tikhon could no longer be relied upon to fill church coffers; for he was made of cardboard with a few small bones. Saints Vasili and Constantin consisted of bones, cotton, coal, splinters and other nondecomposable substances.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The revelations hare from the priests’ viewpoint had a most unfortunate effect upon the people. One peasant says: &quot;When the relics were opened and the deception revealed, all the faith I had vanished and gave way to a sense of disgust and contempt for this brazen deception”. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">For many centuries the faithful Russian people. in innocence of the fact that they were dupes of aSschepiing priestcraft, made pilgrimages to the famous monasteries, viewed the nondecomposable bodies, and gave contributions which were the largest source of income of the Russian church. This stream has practi</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">call</span><span class="font11">y dried up.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Very -likely some of the lower priests of the Greek Church were not a party to this infamous deception; and one of them expressed himself strongly in a letter to the Bishop of Olonetz and Petrozavodsk: “The relics of Alexander Svir-sky, which were disclosed to be a plain figure of wax, showed the blasphemous exploitation of the common people by a group of selfish persons. You, the high priests, could not be ignorant Of -this; but you carefully hid it from us, the Common priests, and even more so from the people. You allowed the worship of idols in place of saints, encouraging.it by your own examples and preaching. You purposely darkened the eyes and the minds of the people, together with the uninitiated monks, who through their ignorance deceived trusting Russia. This flock of your servants, which served as milkers of the people for those who knew the truth, are now placed in the position of a blind man who sod-denly had his sight restored by a stroke of the sun. Woe to you, when the enlightened people rise and move on you in terrific anger, demanding an answer and an account, which you will be unable to give!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Milking and duping the people is no new occupation for priestcraft; for it was the regular thing by an apostate body of ecclesiastics in Bible times. God said then: ‘TE have not sent these prophets [Israel’s false preachers], yet they ran; I have not spoken to them, yet they prophesied [preached<sup>1</sup> I have heard what the [false] prophets said, that prophesy [preach] lies in my name. Therefore, behold, I am against the [false] prophets, saith the Lord. Therefore, behold, I. even I. will utterly forget you, and I . will forsake yon. and cast you out of my presence. And I will bring an everlasting reproach upon you, and a perpetual shame, which shall not be forgotten.”—Jer. 23:21, 22, 30, 39, 40.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Heart, Mind, Soul, Strength</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">J</span><span class="font11">ESUS, the great teacher, ratified the current epitome of the Godward side of the law to Israel which said: “Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">heart,</span><span class="font11"> and with all thy </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">mind,</span><span class="font11"> and with all thy </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">soul,</span><span class="font11"> and with all thy </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">strength&quot;.</span><span class="font11"> Evidently He meant to convey the thought that love for and worship of Jehovah should not be one-sided, but all-sided—that it should engross to the fullest capacity every power of mind and body.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The TiearV evidently includes the sentiments and emotions—love as it finds utterance in the human life. Sentiment is feeling, a perception of personal weal or woe; while emotion is the effect produced on the nervous system by strong sentiment. Sentiment is the river flow, now placid and deep, now shallow and noisy; emotion is the dammed-back water head, used here, perhaps, to drive something useful, there merely to flow over the dam or to tear it from its moorings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The ‘mind’ would seem to have reference to the reflective powers, the judgment, the capacity for decision on right and wrong, to measurable</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Strength depends not so much on either muscular energy or nervous force alone as<sup>-</sup> on </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font11">proper balance between the two. But at all events ‘strength' refers to the organism, the means or agency at our disposal for carrying out what the heart prompts, the soul perceives, or the mind directs. In fact, neither sentiment, judgment, nor perception can.function without the cooperation of organism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The greater the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">balance</span><span class="font11"> existing between these foufpowers the greater the individual’s capacity to love God, because he will have more in common with God. The priceless'power to restore lost balances, or to reinstate a temporarily disturbed balance, we call </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">humor —</span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"> or </span><span class="font11">ability to see one’s self in proper perspective and to realize one’s actual, not imagined, relationship to other persons and things. No imperfect creature can attain a perfect balance without divine aid; and even then not while </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">he </span><span class="font11">remains imperfect</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Sidereal Heavens: By a. p. </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Bridget</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">D</span><span class="font11">AVID trufy said; “The heavens declare the glory of God, and the firmament showeth his handiwork”. There is no better manifestation of this than in the study of the sidereal or starry heavens. As we contemplate the great distances which separate us from some of the heavenly bodies we perceive how small we are; and we exclaim, “What is man that thou art mindful of him T”</span></p><img src="g_E_19201208_files/g_E_19201208-21.png" alt="" style="width:200pt;height:33pt;">

<p><span class="font11">ability to introduce equity by such decision. The judgment is good or bad, helpful or harmful, in proportion as it is aligned with justice, the divine and perfect standard, without acquaintanceship with which no mind can glorify God or enjoy Him forever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The ‘soul’ is another way of referring to the sentient ^owefs or the perceptions, the moral perceptions in particular. Perception in general is the conscious reference of a sensation to the cause which produced it; it is wisdom, discernment of right and wrong in their relationship to happiness and unhappiness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The most intense light we know of comes, of course, from the bright orb which rules'the day. The sun pours his unrivaled beams around us in all directions with prodigal abundance, notwithstanding his remoteness of 93,000,000 miles. &quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Light travels at the amazing speed of 186,000 miles a second. A ray of light could make almost eight complete circuits of the earth between two successive ticks of the clock. It takes a little over eight minutes for a ray of light to travel &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">from the sun to the earth. While we think of &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">93,000,000 miles as a very great distance, yet when we compare this with some of the other i suns we see, it is insignificant. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;L</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">It is a remarkable fact that the beautiful star ; known as Vega, (Vega is the brightest star in : the Lyre) is so far from us that it takes a ray of light eighteen years to reach us from thence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">And knowing that this light has |&gt;een travelling i all the time at the rate of 186,000 miles every second of the time, we figure that the distance is almost inconceivable. Vega could have been annihilated seventeen years ago, and yet we would receive light from it for another year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">But Vega is near to us compared with other suns. Astronomers tell us of stars that are one thousand times farther away from us than is . Vega. That is, tonight we may receive from a star light which has been travelling 18,000 years. Imagine a ray of light leaving this heavenly body 12,000 years before Adam was created, and just getting here. Our minds cannot grasp such numbers as are thus revealed. Neither can our minds grasp the distance which is between us and these bodies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Now think of what God has said. “As the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways; and my thoughts than your thoughts.&quot; There are some wise (1) men who tell us that they know more than the Bible, men who are seeking to disprove the existence of God. God says that His thoughts are as far above theirs as the heavens are higher than the earth. Evolutionists and higher critics find their true measure in this comparison.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The east is as far from the west as the heavens , are higher than the earth. Now note how far God removes sin from His people. “As far as the east is from the west, so far hath he removed our transgressions from us.&quot; Is it not glorious to know this, tool</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">- Because our minds are imperfect through the Adamic fall we are not able to see these things perfectly. “We see through a glass darkly.” In the Golden Age man shall see these things perfectly; for “the knowledge of the glory of God shall cover the earth as the waters cover the mighty deep”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Three Thousand a Month for a Teacher</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">T</span><span class="font11">HREE thousand rubles a month is not an attractive enough offer to secure teachers from Odessa for the Hebrew schools of Bessarabia, according to a report on Hebrew education in Bessarabia received by the Zionist Organization of America. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Revival of Hebrew learning in Bessarabia, due to the rapid development of Zionism, has produced an acute shortage of teachers for Hebrew schools, the report states. With no chance of securing additional teachers in Bessarabia, efforts were made to induce teachers to come from Odessa at the heretofore unheard of figure of 3,000 rubles monthly. But the offer went begging; for the increased interest in Hebrew education in South Russia has produced a similar shortage there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Thousands of Bessarabian Jews, it is reported, are studying Hebrew, preparing to emigrate to Palestine. This has resulted in the ’ establishment of many additional Jewish schools and libraries in spite of Roumanian govern- ' mental restrictions against them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Recent Jewish educational accomplishments in Bessarabia include the est</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">ablishm</span><span class="font11">ent of ± popular Hebrew University at Kishineff, evening classes and elementary schools in each of the 35 Bessarabian towns, and kindergartens, secondary schools and special training courses for teachers in the principal cities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">All the work of the schools, from kindergartens to university, is conducted in Hebrew. The rapid growth of Jewish education in Bessarabia in the short period since the close of the war is considered remarkable, because of the -• severe limitations placed upon all Jewish schools by the Roumanian government.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">’ Thus it appears that this distinguished law. giver, so far from seeking to perpetuate or increase his own power by placing the govern' -ment of the people under the control of his ; direct relatives, of the priestly tribe, to use their religions authority fo fetter the rights and liberties of the people, on the contrary introduced to the people a form of government calculated to cultivate the spirit of liberty. The histories of other nations and rulers show no . parallel to this. In every case the ruler has sought his own aggrandizement and greater power. Even in instances where such have aided in establishing republics, it has appeared . &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from subsequent events that they did it through</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">.. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;policy, to obtain favor with the people, and to</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">\ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;perpetuate a fraud upon the people, would</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">■ have worked for greater centralization of power L in himself and his family; especially as this ” would have seemed an easy task from the religious authority being already in that tribe, and from the claim of this nation to be governed by God, from the Tabernacle. Nor is it suppos-. able that a man capable of forming such laws, and of ruling such people, would he so dull of comprehension as not to see what the tendency of his course &quot;would he. So completely was the government of the people put into their own hands, that though it was stipulated that the weightier cases which those governors could not decide were to be brought unto Moses, yet they themselves were the judges as to what cases went before Moses—“The cause which is too hard for you, bring it unto me. and I will hear it”.—Deuteronomy 1:17.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">59. (rit'e </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">a Concise definition of Israel’s government. How long-tdid it last, and under what conditions was it changed to a kingdom?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">Thus seen, Israel was a republic whose officers acted under a divine commission. And to the confusion of those who ignorantly claim that the Bible sanctions an established empire rule over the people, instead of “a government of the people by the people”, be it noted that this republican form of civil government continued for over four hundred years. And it was then changed for that of a kingdom at the request of “the ’ Elders”, without the Lord’s approval, who said to Samuel, then acting as a sort of informal president, “Hearken unto the voice of the people . in all that they shall say unto thee, for they-have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me, that I should not reign over them”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">At God’s instance Samuel explained to the people how their rights and liberties would be ’ disregarded, and how they would become servants by such a change; yet they had become infatuated with the popular idea, illustrated all around them in other nations. (1 Samuel 8:6-22). In considering this account of their </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">desire</span><span class="font11"> for a king, who is not impressed with the thought that Moses could have firmly established himself at the head of a great empire without difficulty?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9">60.</span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;"> Explain the custom of the tribal division in Israel.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">While Israel as a whole constituted<sup>-</sup> one nation, yet the tribal division was ever recognized after Jacob’s death. Each family, or tribe, _ by common consent, elected or recognized certain members as its representatives, or chiefs. This custom was continued even through their long slavery in Egypt. These were called chiefs or elders, and it was to these that Moses delivered the honor and power of civil government; whereas, had he desired to centralize power in himself and his own family, these would have been the last men to honor with power and office.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9">61) TT/iat </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">were the instructions given to the civil rulers under this government?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">The instructions given those appointed to civil rulership as from God are a model of simplicity and purity. Moses declared to the people, in the hearing of these judges: “I charged your judges at that time, saying, Hear the causes between -your brethren, and judge righteously between every man and his brother, and the stranger [foreigner] that is with him. ¥e shall not respect persons in judgment; but ye shall hear</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font11">the small as well as the great; ye shall not be afraid of the face of man, for the judgment is God’s; and the cause that is too hard for you, bring unto me, and I will hear it.&quot; (Deuteronomy 1:16, IT) Such hard cases were, after Moses’ death, brought directly to the Lord through the High Priest, the answer being Yes or No, by the IT rim and Thummim.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">In view of these </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">facts,</span><span class="font11"> what shall we say of the theory which suggests that these books were written by knavish priests to secure to themselves influence and power over the people! Would such men for such a purpose forge records destructive to the very aims they sought to advance—records which prove conclusively that the great Chief of Israel, and one of their own tribe, at the instance of God, eut off the priesthood- from civil power by placing that power in the hands of the people! Does any one consider such a conclusion reasonable!</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">Again, it is worthy of note that the laws of the most advanced civilization, in tins twentieth . century, do not more carefully provide that rich and poor shall stand on a common level in accountability before the civil law. Absolutely no distinction was made by Moses’ law. And as for the protection of the people from the dangers incident to some becoming very poor and others excessively wealthy and powerful, no other national law has ever been enacted which so carefully guarded this point. Moses’ law provided for a restitution every fiftieth year— their jubilee. &quot;This law, by preventing the absolute alienation of property, thereby prevented its accumulation in the hands of a few. (Leviticus 25:9, 13-23, 27-30) In fact, they were taught to consider themselves brethren, and to act accordingly; to assist each other without compensation, and to take no usury of one another. —Sec Exodus 22:25; Leviticus 25 26, 37: Numbers 26:52-56.</span></p>

We read:</span></p>

Indeed, it is not infrequently misrepresented by a modern priesthood, which urges a similar system now, using that as a precedent, without mentioning the condition of things upon which it was founded, or its method of payment. -</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">’ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6?) IFos </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">the position of the priesthood a specially</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">favored one in Israel? Hate were the Levites supported?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">It was, in fact, founded upon the strictest ' . equity. &quot;When Israel came into possession of the land of Canaan, the Levites certainly had as much right to a share of the land as the other tribes. Yet, by God’s express command, they got none of it, except certain cities or villages for their residence, scattered among J the various tribes, whom they were to serve in religious tilings. Nine times is this prohibition given, before the division of the land. Instead of the land, some equivalent should - surely be provided them, and the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">tithe</span><span class="font11"> was ' therefore this reasonable and just provision. - - Nor is this all. The tithe, though, as we have seen, a just debt, was not enforced as a tax, but • was to be paid as a voluntary contribution. And ‘ no threat bound them to make those contributions; all depended upon their eonseientious-' ness. The only exhortations to people on the subject are as follows:—</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“Take heed to thyself that thou forsake not the Levite as long as thou lives! upon the earth.” ■ “And the Levite that is within thy gates, thou shalt not forsake him; for he hath no part nor inheritance with thee” [in the land].—Deuter-onomy 12:19: 14:27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Is it. we ask, reasonable to suppose that this order of things would have been thus arranged by selfish and ambitious priests?—an arrange-inenth&gt; disinherit themselves and to make them dependent for support upon their brethren?

<p><span class="font11">Tn ha’ftnony with this, and equally inexplicable on any other grounds than those claimed— that God is the author of these laws—is the fact that no special provision was made for honoring</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">the priesthood. In nothing would impostors be more careful than to provide reverence and respect for themselves, and severest penalties -and curses upon those who misused them. But nothing of the kind appears; no special honor, or reverence, or immunity from violence or insult, is provided. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'■ ~ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The common law, which made no distinction between classes, and was no respecter of per- ’■ sons, was their only protection, This is the <sup>: </sup>more remarkable because the treatment of servants, and strangers, and the aged, was the • subject of special legislation. For instance, ‘Thou shalt not vex nor oppress a </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">strtenger, or widow, or fatherless child;</span><span class="font11"> for if they cry at all -unto me [to God] I will surely hear their cry; ; and my wrath shall wax hot, and I will kill you <sup>: </sup>with the sword, and your wives shall be widows and your children fatherless. (Exodus 22:21-24: &nbsp;&nbsp;. ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">23:9: Leviticus 19:33,34} “Thou shalt not oppress an </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">hired sen-tint</span><span class="font11"> that is poor and needy, whether he be of thy brethren, or of strangers that are in thy land, within thy gates. At his day thou shalt give him his hire, neither shall, the sun go down upon it, for he is poor, and setteth his heart upon it, lest he cry against . thee unto the Lord and it be sin unto thee.” (Levitiens 19:13: Deuteronomy 24:14, 15; Ex- . odns 21:26. 27) “Thon shalt rise up before the . hoary head and honor the face of the old man.” (Leviticus 19:32, 14) AH this, yet nothing special for priests, or Levites, or their tithes.</span></p>

The law of Moses had also a typical character, which we must leave for future consideration; but even our hasty glance has furnished overwhelming evidence that this law, which constitutes the very framework of the entire system of revealed religion, which the remainder of the Bible elaborates, is truly a marvelous display of wisdom and justice,-espe- . . cially when its date is taken into consideration.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">doss? What was the burden of their messages? And what does the term </span><span class="font11" style="font-variant:small-caps;">prophet </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">signify?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Glance now at the general character ot the <sup>1</sup> prophets of the Bible </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">and</span><span class="font11"> their </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">testimonies.</span><span class="font11"> A rather remarkable fact is that the prophets, &quot;with few exceptions, were not of the priestly ’ class; and that in their day their prophecies were generally repugnant to the degenerating &gt;&nbsp;and time-serving priesthood, as well as to the , idolatrously inclined people. The burden of their messages </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">from God to</span><span class="font11"> the people was generally reproof for sin, coupled with warnings of coining punishments, intertwined with which we ‘ find^occasional promises of future blessings, after they should he cleansed from sin and should return to favor with the Lord. Their &gt;&nbsp;experiences, for the most part, were far from enviable; they were generally reviled, many of them being fmprisoned and put to violent deaths. <sub>f</sub> (See 1 Things 18: 4, 10, 17, 18: 19: 10;*Jeremiah 38: 6; Hebrews 11:32-38) In some instances it was years after their death before their true character as God’s prophets was recognized. But we speak thus of the prophetic writers whose utterances claim to he the direct inspiration of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">It is well in this connection that we should re- ; member that in the giving of the law to Israel there was no priestly intervention; </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">it</span><span class="font11"> was given by God to the people by the hand of Moses. -(Exodus 19:17 - 25; Deuteronomy 5:1-5) And<sub>r</sub> | furthermore, it was made the duty of every man, seeing a violation of the law, to reprove the sinner. (Leviticus 19:17) Thus all had the <sup>1 </sup>authority to teach and reprove; but since, as in our own day, the majority were absorbed in the cares of business, and became indifferent and irreligious, the few comparatively fulfilled this requirement by reproving sin and exhorting to godliness; and these preachers are termed “'prophets” in both the Old and New Testaments. The term prophet, as generally used, signifies </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">puttie expounder, and</span><span class="font11"> the public teachers of idolatry were also so called; for ' instance, “the prophets of Baal”, etc.—See 1 Corinthians 14:1-6; 2 Peter 2:1; Matthew 7: 15; 14:5; Nehemiah 6:7; 1 Kings 18:40: Titus 1:12. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;’</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Prophesying, in the’ ordinary sense of teaching, afterward became popular with a certain class, and degenerated into Phariseeism—teaching, instead of God’s commandments, the traditions of the ancients, thereby opposing the $ truth and becoming false prophets, or false </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">“f-</span><span class="font11">teachers.—Matthew 15:2-9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">(72) </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">What were the characteristics of the class of prophets specially commisioned by the Lord?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Out of the large class called prophets, Jehovah at various times made choice of some whom He specially commissioned to deliver messages, relating sometimes to things then at hand, at other times to future events. It is to the writings of this class, who spoke and wrote as they were moved by the holy spirit, that we are now giving attention. They might with propriety be designated divinely commissioned prophets or seers.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">Though written by many pens, at various times, under different circumstances, the Bible -is not merely a collection of moral precepts, wise &gt;&nbsp;maxims and words of comfort. It is a reasonable, philosophical and harmonious statement of the causes of present evil in the world, its , only remedy and the final results as seen by divine wisdom, which saw the end of the plan from before its beginning, marking as well the-pathway of God’s people, and upholding and strengthening them with exceeding great and precious promises to -be realized in due time.</span></p>

The necessity of the death of a redeemer as a sacrifice for sin, and of his righteousness as a covering for our. sins, is pointed out in the clothing of skina for <sup>8 </sup>Adam and Eve; in the acceptance of Abel’s -offerings; in Isaac on the altar; in the death of the various sacrifices by which the patriarchs. j had access to God, and of those instituted under the law and perpetuated throughout the Jewish age. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;;</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The prophets, though credited with understanding but slightly the significance of some of their utterances (1 Peter 1;12), mention the laying of the sins upon a person instead of a dumb animal, and in prophetic vision they see Him who is to redeem and to deliver the race led &quot;as a lamb to the slaughter”; that “the chas-tisement of our peace was upon him”; and that &quot;by his stripes we are healed”. They pictured Him as “despised and rejected of men, a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief,” and declared that “the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all”. (Isaiah 53:3-6) They told where this Deliverer would be born (Micah 5:2), and when He should die, assuring us that it would be “not for himself”. (Daniel 9:26) They mention various peculiarities concerning Him—that He would “righteous”, and frte from “deceit”, “violence”, or any just cause death (Isaiah 53:8, 9, 11); that He wouldbe betrayed for thirty pieces of silver (Zechariah</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">11:12); that He would be numbered among transgressors in His death (Isaiah 53:12); that not a bone of </span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">Trim</span><span class="font11"> should be* broken (Psalm 34:20; John 19:36); and that though He should die and be buried, His flesh would not corrupt, neither would He remain in the grave. —Ps</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">alm</span><span class="font11"> 16:10; Acts 2:31.</span></p>

(Isaiah 1:18) They trace the entire plan in a most logical and forcible manner, appealing neither to the prejudices nor to the passions of their hearers, but to their enlightened reason alone, furnishing some of the most remarkably close and cogent reasoning to be found anywhere on any subject.—See .

<p><span class="font11">’ Moses, in the law, pointed not alone to a sacrifice, but also to a blotting out of sins and a blessing of the people under this Great Deliverer, whose power and authority he declares shall vastly exceed his own, though it should be “like unto”.it. (Deuteronomy 18:15, 19) The promised Deliverer is to bless not only Israel, but through Israel “all the families of the earth”. (Genesis 12:3; 18:18; 22:18; 26:4) And notwithstanding the prejudices of the Jewish people to the contrary, the prophets continue the same strain, declaring that Messiah shall be also “for a light to lighten the Gentiles” (Isaiah 49: 6; Luke 2:32); that the Gentiles should come to Him‘‘^rom the ends of the earth&quot; (Jeremiah 16:19); that His name “shall be great among the Gentiles” (Malachi 1:11); and that “the glory of the Lord shall be revealed and all flesh shall see it together”.—Isaiah 40:5.

They, though prejudiced as Jews to think of every blessing as limited to their own people (Acts 11:1 -18), were enabled to see that -while their nation would be blessed, all the families of the earth should be blessed also, with and through them. They saw' also that, before the blessing of either Israel or the world, a selection would be made of a ‘flittie flock” from 3 both Jews and Gentiles, who, being tried, would . be found worthy to be made joint heirs of the -glory and honor of the Great Deliverer, and sharers with Him of the honor of blessing Israel • , and all the nations.—Romans 8:17. &nbsp;- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;; ■</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">The thought of Messiah as a ruler of not only Israel, but also of the world, suggested in the ' books of Moses, is the theme of all the prophets. The thought of the kingdom was uppermost also &quot;&nbsp;in the teachings of the apostles; and Jesus ; taught that we should pray, &quot;Thy kingdom -come,” and promised those a share in' it who - ' would first suffer for the truth, and thus prove <sup>4 </sup>themselves worthy.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">This hope of the coming glorious kingdom gave all the faithful ones courage to endure persecution and to suffer reproach, deprivation and loss, even unto death.

<p><span class="font11">The resurrection of the dead is taught by the prophets; and the writers of the New Testament base their hopes of future life and blessing upon . it. Paul expresses it thus: &quot;If there be no resur-reetion of the dead, then is Christ not risen; and * if Christ be not risen, then is our preaching vain and your faith is also vain;. . . then they which are fallen asleep in Christ are </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">perished. \</span><span class="font11"> But . now is Christ risen from the dead, and become <sub>:</sub> the first-fruits of them that slept; ... for as in ' Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.”—1 Corinthians 15:13 - 22.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">Like a watch, whose many wheels might at first seem superfluous, hot whose slowest moving wheels are essential, so the Bible, composed of many parts, and prepared by many pens, is one complete and harmonious whole. Not a single part is superfluous, and though some parts take a more active and prominent place than others, all are useful and necessary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">It is becoming popular among the so-called “advanced thinkers” and “great theologians” of the present day to treat lightly, or to ignore if they do hot deny, many of the “miracles” of the Old Testament, calling them &quot;nld wives’ fables”. Of these are the accounts of Jonah and the great fish, Noah and the ark, Eve and the serpent, the standing ttill\of the sun at the command of Joshua, and Balaam’s speaking ass. Seemingly these wise iiieii overlook the fact that the Bible is so interwoven and united in its various parts that to tear from it these miracles, or to discredit them, is to destroy or discredit the whole. For if the original accounts are false, those who repeated them were either falsifiers or dupes, and in either case it would be impossible for us to accept their testimony as divinely inspired. To eliminate from the Bible the miracles inen-</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">The story of the fall is attested by Paul (Romans 5:17); also Eve’s beguilement by the Serpent. (2 Corinthians 113; 1 Timothy 2:14; see also our Lord’s reference to the latter in ' Revelation 12:9 and 20:2) The standing of the sun at the overthrow of the Amorites, as an evidence of the Lord’s power, was evidently typical of the power to be displayed in the future, in “the day of the Lord,” at the hand of Him whom Joshua typified. This is attested . by three prophets. (Isaiah 28:21; Habakkuk ..</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">2 :l-3,13,14 and 3:2-ll; Zechariah 14:1,6,7) The account of the speaking ass is confirmed by Jude, verse 11, and by Peter. (2 Peter 2:16) And the Great Teacher, Jesus, confirmed the narratives of Jonah and the great fish, and of - . Noah Qnd the flood. “For as Jonah was three -days and nights in the whale’s belly, so shall the Son of Man be three days and nights in the heart of the earth*; “For as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and ’ d</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">rinking</span><span class="font11">, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noah entered into the ark, and knew not until the flood came, and took them all a wav; so shall also the coining of the Son of Man be.” — Matthew 12:40; 24:38, 39;</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Luke 17:26; see also 1 Peter 3:20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Really these are no greater miracles' than . those performed by Jesus and the apostles, such as the turning of water into wine, the healing of diseases, etc.; and as a miracle, the awakening of the dead is most wonderful of all.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">Here we rest the case. Every step has been tested by reason. We have found that there is a God, a supreme, intelligent Creator, in whom / wisdom, justice, love and power exist in perfect <sub>A</sub> harmony. We have found it reasonable to ex-j peet a revelation of His plans to His creatures capable of appreciating and having an interest in them. We have found the Bible, claiming to be that revelation, worthy of consideration. We have examined its writers, and their possible objects, in the light of what they taught; we have been astonished; and our' </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">reason</span><span class="font11"> has told '• us that such wisdom, combined with such purity of motive, was not the cunning device of men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>!</sup> Beason has urged that it is far more probable that such righteous and benevolent sentiments and laws must be of God and not of men, and has insisted that they could not be the work of knavish priests. We have seen the harmony of testinfbny concerning Jesus, His ransom sacrifice, and the resurrection and blessing of all as the outcome, in His glorious kingdom to come; and reason has told us that a scheme so grand and comprehensive, beyond all we could otherwise have reason to expect, yet built upon such reasonable* deductions, must be the plan of God for which we seek. It cannot be the mere device of men, for even when revealed it is almost too grand to be believed by men. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>

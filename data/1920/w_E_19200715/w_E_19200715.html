<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">THIS JOURNAL AND ITS SACRED MISSION</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">T</span><span class="font10">HIS journal is one of the prime factors or instruments in the system of Bible instruction, or </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">•‘Seminary Extension”, </span><span class="font10">now beinjf presented in all parts of the civilized world by the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, chartered A. D. 1884, “For the Promotion of Christian Knowledge”. It not only serves as a class room where Bible students may meet in the study of the divine Word but also as a channel of communication through which they may be reached with announcements of the Society’s conventions and of the coming of its traveling representatives, styled “Pilgrims”, and refreshed with reports of its conventions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Our “Berean Lessons” are topical rehearsals or reviews of our Society’s published Studies most entertainingly arranged, and very helpful to all who would merit the only honorary degree which the Society accords, viz., </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Verbi Dei Minister (V.</span><span class="font10"> D. M.), which translated into English is </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Minister of God’s Word.</span><span class="font10"> Our treatment of the International Sunday School Lessons is specially for the older Bible students and teachers. By some this feature is considered indispensable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">This journal stands firmly for the defense of the only true foundation of the Christian’s </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">hope now </span><span class="font10">being so generally repudiated — redemption through the precious blood of “the man Christ Jesus, who gave himself a </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">lansom</span><span class="font10"> [a corresponding price, a substitute] for all”. (1 Peter 1:19; 1 Timothy 2 : 6) Building up on this sure foundation the gold, silver and precious stones (1 Corinthians 3: Ilir, ; 2 Peter 1:5-11) of the Word of God, its further mission is to “make all see what is the fellowship of the mystery which. . .has boon hid in God, ... to the intent that now might be made known by the church the manifold wisdom of God”—“which in other ages wj- not made known unto the sons of men as it is now revealed”.—-Ephesians 3:5-9,10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It stands free trom all parties, sects and creeds of men. while it seeks more and more to bring its every’ utterance into fullest subjection to the will of God in Christ, as expressed in the holy Scrip lures. It is thus free to declare boldly whatsoever the Lord hath spoken—according to the divine wisdom granted unto us to understand his utterances. Its attitude is not dogmatic, but confident; for we know whereof we affirm, treading with implicit faith upon the sure promises of God. It is hold as a trust, to be used only in his service ; hence our decision.*, relative to what may and what may not appear in its columns must be according to our judgment of his good pleasure, the teaching of his Word, for the upbuilding of his people in grace and knowledge. And we not only invite but urge our readers to prove all it* utterances by the infallible Word to which reference is constantly made to facilitate such testing-</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">TO US THE SCRIPTURES CLEARLY TEACH</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Thar the church is “the temple of the living God”, peculiarly “his workmanship” . that its construction- has been in progress throughout Ilie gospel age—over since Christ became the world’s Redeemer and the Chief Corner Stone of Ins temple, through which,, when finished, God’s blessing shall come “to all people”, and they find access to him.—1 Corinthians 3 : Id, 17; Ephesians. 2:20-22; Genesis 28 : 11 ; Galatians 3 : 29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">&quot;’hat meantime the chiseling, shaping, and polishing of consecrated believers in Christ’s atonement for sin. progresses: and when the-last of these “living stones”, “elect and precious,&quot; shall have been made ready, the great Master Workman will bung all togerher in the first resurrection; and the temple shall be filled with his glory, and be the meeting place between God and men throughout the Millennium.—Revelation 15:5-8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">That the basis of hope, for the church and the world, lies in the fact that &quot;Jesus Christ, by the grace of God, tasted death for </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">every </span><span class="font10">man,” “a ransom for all.” and will be “the true light which lighteth </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">every man that cometh info the world’,</span><span class="font10"> “In due time”.— Hebrews 2:9; John 1:9; 1 Timothy 2:5, 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">That the hope of the church is that she may be like her Lord, “see him as he is,” be “partakers of the divine nature’/ and share his glory as his joint heir.— 1 John 3:2; John 17:24; Romans 8:17; 2 Peter 1 : f.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">That the present mission of the church is the perfecting of the saints for the future work of service: to develop in herself every grace; to he God’s witness to the world; and to prepare to be kings and priests in the next age.—Ephesians 4:12; Matthew 2lz 14 ; Revelation 1:6; 20: 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">That the hope for the world lies in </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font10">blessings of knowledge and opportunity to be brought to all </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">by </span><span class="font10">Christ’s Millennial kingdom, the restitution of all that was lost in Adam, to all the willing and obedient, at </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font10">hands of their </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Redeemer and </span><span class="font10">his glorified church, when all the wilfully wicked will be </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">destroyed.—</span><span class="font10">Acts 3:19-23; Isaiah 35.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">GENERAL EASTERN CONVENTION AT SCRANTON</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Arrangements have been made for a five-day convention for the benefit of friends living in Eastern and Northeastern States. This gathering is to be held in Scranton, Pennsylvania, a city of some 150.000 people, at practically the top of the Moosic Mountains. Pure air and good water are among its at tractions ; the streets are shady and the nights are cool. It has long claimed to be the best-lighted city in the world, and has what is probably the most beautiful railway station m America.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Wo quote an attractive description of the city’s environs •</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">•’The Elmhurst Boulevard rivals in scenic attractions the very finest scenery in the Fast. In a few minutes one rises from the comer of the city to the edge of the clouds, and below him is spread •* panorama of unexcelled civic beauty and industry, stretching aw iv from north to south within the mighty mountain walls as far a- the eye ran reach The boulevard encircles Lake Scranton by a four inile drive through the forest which reaches down to the edge of the lake throughout in entire length. Although the edge of this lake is vv itluri one and one-half mill’s of the center of the city, there is but one house in sight of the traveler as he encircles the I ike and this can he glimpsed for but tin instant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“Cars run from the city to Moosic Lake, two thousand feet above, every thirty minutes. The nde is along the edge of the c inyon wall deep within which the Lackawanna climbs to the summit of Mount Poeono on its way to Delaware Water Gap and New' York. Scores of other lakes are within a short ride by trolley or automobile.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">All sessions of the convention will be held in the Town Hall, 315 Adams Avenue, August 4 to 8, inclusive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Scranton is reached by through trains from New Y’ork, Philadelphia, Albany, Utica, Syracuse, Buffalo, (Teveland, Detroit, and Chicago, In addition to this excellent service, there are direct Pullman cars to and trom Wilkesbarre (only a few miles distant) and Pittsburgh, as also Hamilton and Port Huron. When purchasing full-fare one way ticket to Scranton secure certificate account of 1. B. S. A. Convention. If agent is not provided with certificate blanks, then procure a receipt. But before such a ticket is purchased inquiry should be made concerning any other possibly better summer-resort rate from your locality to, say, Chautauqua Lake, N. Y.. or Asbury Park, N. J. Scranton is distant from New York, 134 miles: from Boston. 364 miles; from Philadelphia, 164 miles; from Washington, 258 miles : from Pittsburgh, 312 miles ; from Cleveland, Detroit. Columbus, and Cincinnati, 445, 514, 503, and 573 miles, respectively; from Indianapolis and Louisville, 684 and 795 respectively ; and from Chicago and St. Louis, 797 and 924 miles. The best service from Western points is usually via Buffalo, 262 miles distant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">This convention promises to be one of the largest, if not the largest, of the year Scranton is well known among the readers of \\ vtch Tower publications as being the place not only where “The Finished Mystery”, under the Lord’s providence and guidance, was collated and written, but also where the first arrests were made in rlii&lt; country for the selling of that book. It is a uniquely appropriate place for a convention for these reasons, in addition io those mentioned above.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Those desiring to have sleeping accommodations arranged for them will please address F. Kintner, 1505 North Sumner Ave, Scranton, Pa., stating price preferred to be paid, whether in hotel or private home; number, sex. and color in party. As far as possible such requests will be filled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">CONVENTION AT TORONTO</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">July 2'h 30, 31 and August 1 are the dates for a convention of the International Bibb’ Students Association at Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The first three days of the convention mootings will be held at the Masonic Temple. ssO onge Street : and the fourth day will be at Massey Hall, Shutor Street. 'This convention will furnish opportunity for fellowship and spiritual refreshing for the friends in Ontario, Quebec, and the bordering States. Communications concerning accommodations should be addressed to W. G. Brown, 51 Tnorton Avenue Toronto, Ont.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Friends from bordering States who plan 1o attend the convention at Toronto will doubtless be able to lake advantage of the usual low summer round-trip rates to Niagara Falls-—proceeding from there by tuun. or by trolley car and boat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">SPECIAL TRAIN TO COLUMBUS CONVENTION</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The Cincinnati friends contemplate securing a special train via the B &amp;&nbsp;O. Railroad to the Columbus. Convention. All the friends from Kentucky. Tennessee, and such points west of Cincinnati in Indiana and Illinois as arc reached by the B. &amp;&nbsp;O., should communicate with IB-other II. Schultz, Box 754, Cincinnati. Ohio, in regard to the time the proposed special train will leave Cincinnati. In order to secure the advantages of fellowship on this train have jour tickets read via “Baltimore and Ohio Railroad”-—if not from the starting point, then from Cincinnati (o Columbus.</span></p>

<div>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Psalm 18:30</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font22">F</span><span class="font13">ROM sin to gloiy is an eventful and momentous, but not necessarily a long journey. In traversing this ground we make use of certain major and indispensable steps, as well a&gt; many minor and, it must be feared, often unnecessary ones. Sometimes we wander a little because an attractive bypath has claimed our attention until we become confused as to the right direction. But the main steps must be taken if we are to have and retain the fjord’s approval. A brief review of these main steps or stages of our pilgrim's progress cannot be out of place for those whose eternal destiny hangs upon their faithfulness in the Ixird’s way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The Bible is very plain in telling us that the most of men do not walk </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">with</span><span class="font13"> God. Further than this, they do not even walk </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">toward</span><span class="font13"> God with a view to attaining his fellowship and smile. “The whole world lieth in wickedness’’ (1 John 5: 19) is the clear word of the Apostle. He cannot mean that there is no good in the worldly; for often they possess very admirable traits. But he does mean that the world, as a whole, is dominated and ruled over by Satan, “the god of this world” (2 Corinthians 4: 4). who exercises dominion in the hearts of the children of disobedience (Ephesians 2:2) by encouraging the conditions which make selfishness appear easy and profitable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">NOT ALL SINNERS WILLFUL</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">But while it is true that “there is none righteous, no, not one” (Romans 3: 10), while no one is able to do perfectly because of his inborn lacks, all do not have the sime attitude of mind and heart toward their unrighteous condition. Probably the majority of people have found themselves in very good harmony with the way of the world, which means that they were in harmony with “'the prince of this world”, who is out of harmony with Jehovah, being hi&lt; adversary, or opponent. (John 12 :31; 11:30) The Scriptures imply that there has been a measure of responsibility and willfulness in mankind in this matter. It is true that all were born imperfect, because of inherent death, but this would not account for willing cooperation with Satan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">That there </span><span class="font10">is </span><span class="font13">some willing cooperation </span><span class="font10">is </span><span class="font13">shown by the Apostle when he says that “knowing God, they glorified </span><span class="font10">him </span><span class="font13">not as God, neither were thankful : but became vain m their reasonings, and their foolish heart was darkened. . . . And even as they refused to have God in their knowledge, God gave them up to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient: being filled with </span><span class="font10">all </span><span class="font13">unrighteousness, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, strife, malignity; whisperers. backbiters, haters of God. insolent, haughty, boastful, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents, without understanding, covenant breakers, without natural affection. unmerciful.&quot; Romans 1: 21. 2S - 31.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Not all imm have all these failings in a notable degree, but all these imperfections are easily discernible in men - some here, some there. These arc they who “walk after their ungodly lusts’’ (Jude 18) “with froward heart&quot;. (Proverbs (&gt;: 12) Among those who are in harmony with the world’s way might be found many people who do not think that they have received their share of the world’s good things, but who do approve of the world’s method of getting those good things and who, as soon as an opportunity offers itself, will gladly make use of selfish methods for personal aggrandizement, even at the cost of another’s happiness, and feel that the method is quite all right. The world has their approval: they love both the world and the things that go to make up the world. “The ways of [such] a man are clean in his own eyes.’’—Proverbs 16: 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">LOOKING TOWARD GOD</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Occasionally, however, is one whose judgment has ceased to approve of the world’s way. To himself he thinks: There is something wrong about this; this system of doing things, this manner of acquiring advantage and prestige over others cannot bring real happiness. And is such a one a Christian? Oh, no; he is merely thinking. His condition is advanced in comparison with the great mass of people who do almost no thinking on matters higher than their mouths, but he is not walking </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">with</span><span class="font13"> God as yet. though it may prove to be a step of walking </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">toward</span><span class="font13"> God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">One who goes no further than this cannot be very pleasing to either Jehovah or the world. He will be a grouch, a faultfinder, an unwelcome member of human society. But this ceasing to approve the course of the world is </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">repentance</span><span class="font13"> in its elementary sense; for repentance is a change of mind respecting one’s relationship to evil. What next can he do? He can either stay in the stream, continue to float along in the ordinary practices of the world, which he has ceased to approve, or he can determine to quit tho=e practices—he can be </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">converted. </span><span class="font13">Many of the so-called social and political “radicals” of the world are found in one of these two classes, probably more of them in the first than in the second class. They are able to see the discrepancies in the conduct of the “reactionaries” of earth (those who are well pleased with the world as it is), but seldom go far enough to do more than find fault.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">HEATHENDOM AND CHRISTENDOM</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Those whose minds and hearts are both in harmony with the world are heathen, no matter what their names, or where they were born. Those whose minds have ceased to approve of the world, but who love the things which the world has to offer—wealth, distinction, social emoluments—are in a condition comparable to “Christendom”, they are convinced of one thing and still love the thing they know to be wrong. It is a notable fact that a great deal of the preaching of Christendom is of the quit-your-meanness variety. But do we not all do imperfectly? Yes; but not all take unfair advantage of the imperfections of ourselves and others to further selfish ends.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Before our Lord’s first advent there was no special inducement held out by Jehovah to the Gentile peoples to abandon their course. “The times of ignorance God therefore overlooked; but now he commandeth men that they should all everywhere repent; inasmuch as he hath appointed a day in which he will judge the world in righteousness.” (Acts 17: 30, 31) While the appropriateness of repentance is thus made known, few have given the matter any heed, even as the Lord foreknew.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">But surely when one has repented and is converted he is a Christian ? No, not yet. Christendom is full of confusion on this very point. If he were already in covenant relationship with Jehovah, had committed some sin, then had repented of that particular sin and had converted his course away from it, such conduct would bring him into contact with the cleansing arrangements the Lord has made for his church through Christ, and would restore such an one to the covenant privileges lost. We have an example of this in the words of the Apostle Peter to the Jews on the day of Pentecost. He told them: “Repent, therefore, and be converted that your sins may be blotted out”. (Acts 3:19) But neither repentance, nor conversion, nor both together, will bring the individual, in the first place, into relationship with God Jehovah. For that still further steps are necessary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">FEELING AFTER GOD</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">One whose mind has ceased to approve the course of the world and whose heart has ceased to be attached to the things of the world is in the condition mentioned by the Apostle of ‘seeking God, if haply he might feel after him and find him’. (Acts 17: 27) Both repentance and conversion, in their elementary meanings are negative steps. They are quitting something, presumably with a view to taking up something else more desirable. Something more definite than merely feeling after God must be attained if the individual approaches near enough to God to have his favor. Of course Jehovah looks with measurable approval upon repentance and conversion, because he has ordained both steps, but while approving the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">steps</span><span class="font13"> he cannot yet admit the searching one into his favor or fellowship. Faith, the condition of intelligent heart harmony with God, comes not by feeling but by hearing.—Romans 10:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">There are several primary lessons concerning God which may be learned before one has a knowledge of the Bible. Indeed, some of these must be learned before the message of the Bible will appeal to one. Two of these lessons are: (1) to believe that God is; and (2) that he is a rewarder of them that seek after him. (Hebrews 11: 6) The secret of the ability to learn these lessons lies in the fragmentary faculties which men have. Alas, the fragments are too broken, too much subdued and overridden by more tangible interests in the minds of the great mass of earth’s inhabitants to make it possible for them to be very much convinced of godly things now. Many there are who still say in their heart, if not with their lips, “There is no God”.—Psalm 14: 1-4; 53 :1-4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">“THE TESTIMONY OF THE LORD”</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">But the one who is seeking God is invited to “forsake the foolish and live”. (Proverbs 9:6) To do this what does he need? He needs information, instruction. And for this “the testimony of the Lord is sure, making wise the simple”. (Psalm 19:7) To those who are feeling after God, he sends forth a message through Christ Jesus his Son. This message is: “Come unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest”.— Matthew 11:28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">But not many believe this report, and hence to but few is the power of the Lord revealed. (Isaiah 53:1) The one who repented has said concerning the world: I don’t like this condition of affairs. The one who is not only repentant but contrite, whose heart’s attachments have been converted away from the world, has said: I’m tired of this and I’m going to hunt for the Lord. He feels, as all such feel, that they “have given time enough in the past to doing the things which the Gentiles delight in”. (1 Peter 4: 3, </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Weymouth)</span><span class="font13"> On hearing the offer to supply his needs the honest seeker must come to Jesus, at least to the extent of examining the message and of finding out the ground for reconciliation with God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“O hope of every contrite heart O joy of all the meek;</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">To those who ask, how kind thou art! How good to those who seek!</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“But what to those who find? Ah! this, Nor tongue nor pen can show;</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The love of Jesus what it is, None but his loved ones know.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">“’TIS ALL THAT I CAN DO”</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">To become the beloved of the Lord we must not only say that we do not like the world and that we are tired of it, but that (after some knowledge of God’s purposes is received) we are going to apply ourselves to the Lord’s way. We say: Blessed Lord; I commit myself to thy arrangements; here I am. Until such a determination is arrived at there is no opportunity for being benefited by anything more than the most generalized providences of the Lord, such as rain, sunshine, information, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">But, says one, is it not necessary for a believer to have a legal standing before Jehovah in order to make such a decision ? To this we reply that he could not have a legal standing before his case is taken up, and there is no case to take up until the consecration is made. As well say that a foreigner must have the standing of American citizenship before he can declare his intention to become an American citizen, as to say that justification must precede consecration. Why should the mighty Jehovah bother himself at all about one who still prefers his own way to the way of the Lord ? “God resisteth the proud.” (1 Peter 5:5) And those do still prefer their own way, do still lean to their own understanding, who have not forsaken their way for God’s way, who have not determined to commit themselves to the Lord’s arrangements in Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">But is it not necessary- for one to have the merit of Christ imputed to him before his consecration can be accepted by Jehovah? Yes, yes, surely; but our making of the consecration and God's acceptance of it are two very distinct matters, though usually closely connect'd in point of time. Suppose a man determines that it ito Ins best interests to have an audience with the King of Denmark. There is nothing to hinder him from making -ncli a determination right here in America: hi<sup>1</sup> does not need an\ standing before the Danish court io make that decision. But whim he reaches Denmark he may find the need of various helps, to sav nothing of instructions, without which he cannot reach the King.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">THE ACCEPTABLE TIME</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">What, then, happens when we make a consecration to the Lord? Why, our case is taken up to be decided according to the w isdom of the wisest Judge. God has not obligated himself to accept all consecrations unconditionally. They must he made in the •‘acceptable time'’ (Isaiah !!•: S) and must be made with an approvable motive. The acceptable day will soon pass (Hebrews 3: 13), and we have at least one example of a . enseera-tion made which was wrong in motive, and which was therefore rejected. This is the case of Simon Magiis. who was excluded from the privilege of divine favor be-&lt; arise his ‘heart xvas not right before God'. Acts 8: 21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The Master has promised: “Him that cmnetli unto m&lt;' I will in no wise cast out&quot;. (John (&gt;:3?) That is. he will not decline to present any genuine consecration before the heavenly Father. But. mark you, the consecration must be made before it can be presented, and it must bi<sup>1</sup> presented before it can be either accepted or rejected. Jesus further said: “No one cometh unto the Father but by me”. (John 14: G) This is but another way of saying that some do come to the Father, and that they come through Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“And can I yet delay</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">My little all to Rive?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">To wean my soul from earth away For Jesus to receive?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Besides receiving or taking up the consecrator’s case, Jesus as the Advocate, for the consecrated, presents that case before Jehovah for his decision concerning its acceptability. Of course this presentation implies a guarantee on the part of Jesus that he will make good the bodily imperfections of the one whose case is being presented. Thus, if all the other conditions are met, the consecrating one is “accepted in the Beloved”.— Ephesians 1:6; 1 Peter 2 : 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">“GOD THAT JUSTIFIETH”</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">At that stage, then, “it is God that justifieth ; who is he that eondemneth?” (Romans 8:33,34) No one, if he be well informed. God has stamped the organism of the consecrated with approval; for though that organism was inherently imperfect, it was made acceptable by the merit of Christ. What is the object of all this work; why does not God simply accept believers into his friendship when he sees their hearts are right, without all this insistence on certain standards? Did he not do just that thing before our Lord Jesus’ first advent?</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">That would be only a partial statement of the truth. In the first place, no one whose heart was not devoted to God ever had his friendship, and, in the second place, no one was admitted to the relationship of friend who did not acknowledge his imperfections of body, the customary manner of doing this being by offering slain sac-iitiees. For instance, it was not the hazy acceptance of a few facts on the part of Abraham which made him the friend of God. It does not say that he believed </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">facts, </span><span class="font13">bm that he &quot;believed </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">(toil&quot;</span><span class="font13"> (Romans 1:3), he trusted Gud, he committed his cause and himself to the divine arrangements. His heart was shown to !&gt;&lt;’ of righteous .■damp when ho so trusted God that he was willing to -aerifies his only .-on. And it wa.- this act. as attestation of his failh, St. James tells us. that called forth the div </span><span class="font10" style="font-variant:small-caps;">uh'</span><span class="font13">approx al of his heart.- James 2: 21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The smie degree of faith as was shown in all of the ancient woitbi&quot;- would, if shown during this gospel age, lead the individual to the fullest consecration. How is it then, that arrangements are made for the justification of the organism of believers now, whereas there was no such arrangement then? The answer is that now- Jehovah i- not looking merely for friends, but (1) for joint-saerifieers with his Son Jesus and (2) for children to he associated with his Son in the great future work of restoriim mankind. As it is written. “Behold I and the children which God hath given me&quot; (Hebrews 2:13) lor the purpose of destroying Satan and of delivering of&gt;j11</span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">1•--!</span><span class="font13">■&lt;I and fear-stricken humanity.- Hebrews 2 : 1</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">THE FAITH OF ABRAHAM</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Even a free man may have a slave as a friend if there arc noble qualities of heart and mind in him. But the slave could not be adopted into the free man’s family until -onie arrangement had been made for the slave’s purchase. It is just so now between Jehovah and those who &quot;walk in the steps of the faith of our father Abraham&quot;. ( Romans 4: 12) He seeks to make of them </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">sons </span><span class="font13">in his royal family, </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">brethren</span><span class="font13"> of Christ Jesus. As the Psalmist-Prophet long ago said for Jesus: “I will declare thy name unto my brethren”.—Psalm 22: 22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Since there, is no other purpose in accepting consecrations in this gospel age than the purpose of sacrifice, we have no reason to expect that any other thing will happen to our flesh, when we arc accepted through the merit of Christ, than that we shall be sacrificed. This means death : and it would mean immediate and total obliteration of the being were it not for the fact that the Lord starts a new life when the old one is slain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">True, there is no cessation of activity in the body and only faith can grasp the fact that the human life is gone for ever and that all hopes of future existence shall find their fulfillment, if at all. on some other plane than the earthly. And how is this new life started? The Apostle answers: “Of his [God’s] own will begat he us with the Word of truth&quot;. (James 1: 18; 1 Peter 1:23) What does this mean? Does it mean that if some one of the world takes up a Bible, reads it and gets a few ideas that he is thus begotten and that a new life has started in him, within the meaning of this text ? Oh no, it is not merely the Word, but the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">truth</span><span class="font13"> which is used by the Lord for this begetting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">A NEW LIFE STARTED</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The new will (the resolve to commit one’s way unto the Lord and to take God’s will as the sole deciding factor in one’s life) is the ovum, so to speak, which is engendered and fructified by the truth. This new will, under the stimulus of the truth, gradually gathers around itself a set of new impressions. The only place these impressions can be retained is on the brain, exactly the same place where all other intelligent impressions are received, and where a good many old ones are retained which we could well afford to dispense with.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The new will, the new mind, coupled with the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">divine authorization</span><span class="font13"> for the new life, is all there is of the new creature in Christ this side the vail. This new life thus started by the spirit begetting is in a precarious position from every standpoint save that of faith. Viewed humanly, it stands about as much chance of prospering as a young bird would in a reptile’s den. But from God’s standpoint, all power in heaven and earth is pledged to the protection and nourishing of this priceless little life which is destined to be a prince of the royal line in glory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">And what does the Apostle mean when he speaks of walking “in newness of life”? (Romans 6:4.) Some light is shed on this question in the passage which says : “If any man is in Christ, he is a new creature; the old things are passed away; behold they are become new”. (2 Corinthians 5: 17) There is a newness of life which results not from being transferred to some other sphere, but from being given a new dominating factor in our lives—the will of God. We have new hopes, new aims, new ambitions, new aspirations, new ideals. The old ones are gone. And since these things, rather than environment, make up our lives, when they are changed our lives are new and different, as when one puts on yellow glasses there is an added buoyancy to the landscape, an increased cheerfulness in everything seen which we never saw with our unaided eyes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">OLD LIFE AND NEW</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Again the Apostle tells us: “Ye died [as human beings] and your [new] life is hid with Christ in God”. (Colossians 3:3) This new life, the new man or creature, can be renewed, refreshed, invigorated, fed, and strengthened by knowledge. This is not ordinary knowledge. It is an intimate acquaintance with God’s will, a deep appreciation of his motives. (Colossians 1:9) Those who learn the charm of this special knowledge have something which the world does not know.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“Let worldly minds the world pursue: It hath no eharms for me;</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Once I admired Its trifles too. But grace hath set me free.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">In another place we are admonished to “be not conformed to this world [the present world, which flieth in wickedness’]: but [to] be . . . transformed by the renewing of [our] minds”. (Romans 12: 2) What does this mean? How can we avoid being conformed to this world when we are in it and when our five senses are constantly open to the impressions coming to us from the world? In general, we see about the same things which the worldly see, we hear about the same things they hear, we touch, taste, and smell about the same things which they touch, taste, and smell. What then: are not these the very influences which go to make up the world ? Yes, with two important differences in the case of the new creature. One difference is the new will or new determination on our own part to do the Father's will; and the other difference is the holy determination on the Father’s part to cooperate with us in our new desire. By way of effecting this cooperation Jehovah exerts on our behalf his sacred influence, or holy spirit. This spirit, power, or influence is rightly called holy because it emanates from him who is holy, Jehovah God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Then the Father has not left us alone in this great work of keeping the new creature alive ? Thank God. no. A reigning sovereign who is hoping for an heir to his earthly throne, after starting the little life, is very careful to see that it is nourished and that the best influences of his realm are brought to bear upon his unborn child. He will do this even if he does not love the mother of the child. We could not expect that the Emperor of the Universe would do less for his begotten children.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">“THROUGH THY TRUTH”</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The part which God plays in the care and development of the new creature is summed up largely by the word sanctification; and the Master indicates as much when, praying to the Father, he said: “Sanctify them through rhy truth, thy Word is truth”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">What does sanctify mean ? One answers that it means sinlessness in the flesh; another, that it means a tremendous exuberance of feeling, that when one becomes so excited in religious matters that he cannot keep his seat any longer, but feels obliged to jump up and throw his hat, </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">that</span><span class="font13"> is sanctification.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">But neither of these views has support in the Scriptures. Another and very common view in Christendom is that sanctification means a </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">setting apart,</span><span class="font13"> and that it is practically synonymous with consecration. This view has had some little substantiation by the unfortunate usage of the English word sanctify to translate the Hebrew word </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">kawdash</span><span class="font13"> in the Old Testament. The word </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">kawdash</span><span class="font13"> really means to consecrate, to dedicate, to hallow, and would be more happily rendered by one of these words (as it often is) than by the word sanctify.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">But if there is excuse for confusion in the Old Testament there is none in the New, as the word is used in relation to new creatures. Everywhere in the New Testament </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">sanctify</span><span class="font13"> is used to translate the Greek word </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">agiahzo, </span><span class="font13">which means </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">to make holy,</span><span class="font13"> or more literally, to </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">holify. </span><span class="font13">The Greek word is used twenty-eight times in the New Testament, usually translated </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">sanctify,</span><span class="font13"> but twice </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">hallow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">RIGHT THOUGHTS AND RIGHT WORDS</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">But some one suggests: What difference does it make what word is used so long as the thought is right? That is true in a sense; but if we use words which are more nearly expressive of given thoughts—and all words are only relatively expressive of thoughts—we are more likely to retain the right thought and more able to convey the right thought to others. If we call a duck a goose, it may lead to confusion,, though there is great similarity between the birds; if we say lend when we mean borrow v\e may get into trouble.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Consecration* is our part, as we have already seen. It is a thing which God will not do for us. He will never coerce the will. He has so much respect for even the fragmentary image of himself in man that he lets man do the deciding on matters touching his own destiny. Man may make a miserable choice, but the Lord lets him do it just the same. On the other hand, sanctification is God’s part, a thing which we cannot do for ourselves, because it requires superhuman wisdom and power.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Who of Christ’s followers, for even one hour, to say nothing of a lifetime, could guarantee that all things shall work together for his good? To do that it is necessary to have knowledge and foresight to an extent now impossible for us. How could we know what experiences to choose? We might choose some that would be too easy and some that would be too hard for ourselves. In no case could we be sure that all the influences which we would seek for ourselves would be such as to work to our eternal welfare. Furthermore, which of us has the power sufficient to hold back harmful influences, to divert them, or to counteract them, so that we would not be overwhelmed ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">PERFECTING THE SAINTS</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Sanctification, then, refers to the great process of making us “meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light&quot; (Colossians 1: 12), to the “perfecting of the saints”. (Ephesians 4 : 12) This is the great process which begins when Jehovah accepts our consecration, when he. begets or starts in us a new life, and it does not end until the termination of our Christian experiences, whenever or however that may be.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">While there is considerable association between the ideas of .set </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">apart</span><span class="font13"> and </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">make holy,</span><span class="font13"> there is a clear distinction. One might set a chair apart, and to holy purposes too, but that would not imply any change in the chair itself. But when we say </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">to make a thing holy,</span><span class="font13"> especially to make an individual holy who was not holy to start with, it does imply a change, a transformation in the mind and in the inmost life of the person.—2 Cor. 7: 1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Consecration is a decision made in a moment, though one might be contemplating it for some time. Sanctification is an extensive process, as the Apostle implies: “The very God of peace sanctify you </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">wholly”.</span><span class="font13"> (1 Thessalonians 5:23) He begins the good work in us when, having accepted us for the purpose, he impregnates our new wills with the truth, and he continues the good work under the same influence of the truth; this grand work as a whole being completed by the time the day of the Lord Jesus shall have fully dawned.—Philippians 1 : G.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">PRAYER FOR THE CONSECRATED</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">It will be noted that the Master was praying on behalf of a class which was represented at that time by his dis-</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">*It is conceded that the word “consecrate” is sometimes used in the Authorized Version as indicating what the High Priest did respecting sacrifices already presented and accepted, but for this act of dedication or setting apart for sacrifice we have other words just as good or better. At all events, in this article, and in these columns generally, consecrate is used in the sens© defined on page 220, column 2. </span><span class="font13">ciples, including the apostles. Sanctification, therefore, could not mean consecration: for the apostles were already consecrated. They were members of a consecrated nation, which had all been “baptized into Moses in the Red Sea and in the cloud” (1 Corinthians 10:2); they were faithful ones among that nation, being Israelites indeed in whom there was no guile; and. thirdly, they had especially consecrated themselves to follow the Master, and had done, so for three and one-half years. They surely were fully consecrated. In the same prayer the Master said: “I pray for them, I pray not for the world”. (John 17: 9) He was not praying that goats he made sheep, as many have mistakenly prayed during this gospel age, but he was praying for those who already believed in him, had faith in him. The scope of this prayer was extended when he said: “Neither pray I for these along [the individual disciples then present], but for them also which shall believe on me through their word”. (John 17: 20) He was not praying for those to be sanctified who had not already believed; and </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">belief </span><span class="font13">in its New Testament usage means to have </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">more</span><span class="font13"> faith in the Lord than in one’s self.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">But why should “saints”, holy ones, need perfecting ? If the divine influence which started their new lives is holy, how is it that they have to be made holy? It is true, the new creature is sinless at the time of spirit begetting, for “whosoever is begotten of God sinneth not” (1 John 5: 18), but there is a distinction between being sinless and being holy. Sinlessness is a negative ,'tate. It might be said that a stone or a tree is sinless, but they would hardly lie spoken of as holy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">ESTABLISHING IN HOLINESS</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Holy as applied to persons means morally </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">pure.</span><span class="font13"> As applied to inanimate things it sometimes means ceremonially </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">clean,</span><span class="font13"> and hence acceptable. (Matthew 23: 19; 1 Timothy 4 : 5) It is true that the holy spirit starts a holy mind, but if that mind is to predominate over the natural tendencies of the body it must be not only started but added to. and it is this adding to. this ‘renewing’ (Romans 12:2; 2 Corinthians 4:16; Colossians 3: 10), this ‘changing’ (2 Corinthians 3: 18), this ‘stablishing, strengthening, settling’ (1 Peter 5:10) of the new mind, as well as the starting of it, which is included in the term sanctify. In short, it includes all the work of the holy spirit on the life of the new creature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The Apostle tells us that he had been &quot;made the messenger of Christ Jesus among the Gentiles, doing priestly duties in connection with God’s good news, so that the sacrifice—namely the Gentiles— may be acceptable to him, being as it is an offering which </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">the holy spirit has made holy”.</span><span class="font13"> (Romans 15:16. </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Weymouth)</span><span class="font13"> Again: “Both he who sanctifies and those whom he i’,s </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">sanctifying </span><span class="font13">have all one Father; and for this reason he is not ashamed to speak of them as brothers”. (Hebrews 2: 11, </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Weymouth) </span><span class="font13">It is not. therefore, simply that they </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">were </span><span class="font13">sanctified when first brought into contact with God’s holy power, but that that purifying, that holifying influence continues. If it does not continue, the cares of this life and the<sup>1</sup> deceitfulness of riches will soon quench the little flame of now life which the spirit kindled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">If this holy life is quenched, this sacred group of impressions entirely displaced by earthly things and by willful sin, then there is no hope for that soul, or individuality to be perpetuated. The opportunity for human life which it had at one time was removed when that human life was slain as a joint sacrifice with Christ: so that if the life there started, and by which the individuality was intended to be preserved, dies out, there is nothing left for that individual but the “blackness of daikness , . . forever”. (Jude 13) He is “twice dead, plucked up by the roots” (Jude 12)—both roots, both his terrestrial and his celestial promises of life, having been discarded.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">“YE SHALL BE HOLY”</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">We are. spoken of as new creatures and as new men but we are not spoken of in the Scriptures as having a new nature; for nature is determined by organism. If </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">faithful</span><span class="font13"> we may become “partakers of the divine nature” (2 Peter 1:4); if </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">less faithful</span><span class="font13"> we would not be worthy of it, but unless </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Unfaithful</span><span class="font13"> the new mind can be transferred to the kind of organism which pleases heavenly wisdom best.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">'Going back to our Master’s prayer, “Make them holy through thy truth, thy Word is truth,” we are reminded of the word of the Lord through the Apostle Peter when, addressing the church, he said: “Not fashioning yourselves according to your former lusts in the time of your ignorance; but like as he who called you is holy, be ye yourselves also holy in all manner of life; because it is written, Ye shall be holy; for </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">I am holy”.</span><span class="font13"> (1 Peter 1: 14- 1G) Here is our clue to the inspired usage of the word holy. Whatever it is, God is it. Holiness is the absolute and inherent state of Jehovah’s being. And when the Master prays “Make them holy”, he is praying in effect: ‘Make them like thyself, which art holy’. And how can the new creature be like God now, seeing that he has but an imperfect organism to practice with ? Manifestly we cannot be very'much like him in wisdom until we have new mental machinery, wherewith to gather complete knowledge and to apply it where most appropriate. We shall never be distinguished for our wisdom as long as we are in our trial state. Neither can we be like Jehovah in our conception or practice of justice; try as we will, we still come far short. And we are not much like God in power. We shall never have his attributes to the same </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">extent</span><span class="font13"> as possessed by Jehovah, but when we have a perfect body we may have them in the same </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">proportion</span><span class="font13"> as he has them. In the realm of wisdom, of justice, of power we shall find the Lord supplying us with what is necessary; but it is only in the realm of good will that we can be just like God. It does not require a perfect organism to wish another well, to have at heart the welfare of all mankind. Unless we do •wish them well we are not conformed to the image of ■God’s dear Son, we have not responded to the holy influences which the truth has brought us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">BENEVOLENCE LIKE GOD</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">This settling and establishing of benevolence as a habitual attitude of mind, as the customary motive of our lives, stamps us, more than anything else, as true sons of the Highest. On the other hand: “If any man have not the spirit of Christ he is none of his”. (Romans 8:9) If we are carrying and entertaining the least spirit of ill will or malice, the least desire for revenge or retaliation, we cannot be said to have the sanctifying work sufficiently done to be in the “image of him that hath created” us, as new creatures. (Colossians 3:10) Malice may </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">arise</span><span class="font13"> under great stress, or under extraordinary circumstances, but if we have the spirit of the Lord Jesus we will not </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">harbor</span><span class="font13"> it but will ‘commit our cause to him who judgeth righteously’.—1 Peter 2: 23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">It is the truth that is to do the sanctifying. Error never makes any one holy. It cannot. For error comes, directly or indirectly, from Satan, the great opponent of God. Satan is actuated by other than the holy spirit, and influences which emanate from him could not, therefore, lead one into closer conformity with God’s will and character. Are we, then, to expect that we shall be sanctified by the truth only after we have gotten rid of all error ? No: for if that wore so, none of us would have any chance at all. As long as we are in the flesh we shall be finding error there, as the light shines brighter and brighter toward the perfect day. We are sanctified by the truth which we see and love in </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">spite</span><span class="font13"> of the error, but not </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">because</span><span class="font13"> of it. Probably many a faithful saint has been sanctified by the truth that “God is love” even while he supposed that a part of God’s system of judgment was to torment sinners. His supposition about torture did not help him to appreciate Jehovah; it hindered him. But he believed that God is love in spite of his erroneous conception about some of God’s doings; and as a plant is .turned toward the sunlight, so his mind grew in the direction of love.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">SPECIFIC SANCTIFYING TRUTH</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">It is not truth in its general sense that is apportioned for the work of making us holy. Doubtless if we were perfectly balanced, every item of truth, every fact in the universe, would deepen our devotion for and heighten our praise of Jehovah. But since we are very imperfectly balanced we find that extraordinary knowledge in any line tends rather to puff up than to build up (1 Corinthians 14:1), if there is not something humiliating connected with the possession of that truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">It is not, then, truth about or in mathematics, for instance, which the Lord has provided for this purpose. He has not left us in doubt, for it is “Sanctify them through thy truth, </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">thy Word is truth”.</span><span class="font13"> -The Vatican Manuscript has it: </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">“Thy Word is the 'truth”</span><span class="font13"> i. e., thy Word is the truth apportioned for this special purpose of purifying and edifying the minds of those who are called to be partakers with Christ in his glory. If no qualification had been made of the word truth, there would be no common basis for fellowship among the followers of Christ, and only a very hazy and distant common hope. Some would be studying mathematics with the hope of being sanctified thereby; others would be studying history; others fine arts, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">And are we to understand that the Bible contains everything that God knows ? By no means. According to its own testimony the Bible is but a light that shineth is a dark place until the day dawn and the day star arise (2 Peter 1:19); it is but a lamp unto our feet and a lantern to our pathway. (Psalm 119:105) But it is </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">truth</span><span class="font13">; and it is such an apportionment of truth as has accomplished and will accomplish its intended purpose : and it has not accomplished much else. Englishspeaking peoples have a childish idea (or had) that Christendom has been wonderfully influenced by God's Word. The truth is that Christendom has gone out of its way to disregard, yes. to disdain every precept that Christ ever gave.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">THE WORD AND THE TRUTH</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">It v ill be noted that the Master did not say that v e are to be sanctified by the Word, by the literary record of God’s doings and purposes, but that we are to be sanctified by the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">truth.</span><span class="font13"> There is a distinction between the Word and the truth, as made elsewhere by our Lord Jesus. On one occasion he said to those who already believed: “If ye abide in my Word, then are ye truly my disciples: and ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free”. (John 8: 31, 32) It is the truth which is the active agency in God’s Word; it is the truth which does the sanctifying, and it is the truth which sets ns free, free from error, free from superstition, free from fear, and if followed, free from death; for Jesus himself is the Truth (John 14: 6), Jehovah’s most perfect lesson on heavenly justice and love.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The record we have of Jesus’ doings and of Jehovah’s purposes in and through him conveys, naturally, the holy influence of both Jehovah, the Supervisor of the work, and of Jesus, the principal Cooperator in the work. It conveys such impressions only if we are in harmony with them, only if our hearts respond to God’s goodness as manifested through Christ Jesus his Son. It is like the personal influence of a friend which permeates his letters. Unknown to us he may go to a distant city, he may write us on a strange typewriter and not sign his name, but if wo </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">know</span><span class="font13"> him well we will easily know who the author is. That letter carries the stamp of our friend’s personality. It is permeated with his spirit; it lies between the lines and between the words, as much as in them, for it has a certain style, a certain manner of expression, a certain kind of subject matter which convey to us impressions not felt by even the most learned stranger or the most curious worldling.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">CERTAIN PRINCIPLES INVOLVED</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">It is even so with God’s Word. Many of the wisest of the earth have known it in a literary way; some have known it by rote from beginning to end; and they were not always sanctified by it. To be sanctified, or to be made more like him who is holy, one must see back of all the incidents related, back of all the prophecies recorded, back of all the historical accounts, here an indication of divine wisdom, there some instruction on divine justice, now some manifestation of divine love toward a destitute and unworthy race, and again some show of divine power.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Like a friend’s face behind a lattice, only parts of the visage being visible, so the Lord lets only fragmentary conceptions of his glory in upon our minds row: but if we love him we recognize him. How often does it happen that we do not recognize those we love, even in the night ? “Now we see through a mirror [God’s Word] obscurely, but then face to face.” (1 Corinthians 13:12) For this happy time we await the spirit birth, the first resurrection.—Revelation 20 : 4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Reviewing then, we find that “all people will walk every one in the name of his god” (Micah 4:5). and that those gods arc not Jehovah. Being Tools, they walk in darkness’. (Ecclesiastes 2:14) But some of &quot;the people who [once] walked in darkness have seen a great light”. (Isaiah 9:2) The first glint of that light «as the realization of the condition of the world and their own condition with it; the next shimmer of light was an appreciation of the fact that “blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly”. (Psalm 1:1) Another gleam of the same sacred lamination is a recognition of the principle that “ it is not in man that walketh to direct his steps” (Jeremiah 10: 23), but that the directing should be done by Jehovah and that the inquirer should “no longer walk as the Gentiles also walk”.—Ephesians 4: 17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">“WISDOM TO UNDERSTAND HIS WAY”</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">On behalf of such the promise is given: “The meek will he teach his way”. (Psalm 25: 9) It is “wisdom to understand his way” (Proverbs 14:8) and happiness to be able to say: “His way have I not declined” (Job 23: 11), having responded to the advice: “Delight thyself also in the Lord, and he will give thee thy heart’s desires; </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">commit thy way unto the Lord;</span><span class="font13"> trust also in him and he will bring it to pass” (Psalm. 37: 5), because “the ways of the Lord are right”.—Hosea 14: 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The three requirements to walking with God are distinctly mentioned by the Prophet: “What doth the Lord require of thee, but to </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">do justly,</span><span class="font13"> and to </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">love mercy,</span><span class="font13"> and to </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">humble thyself</span><span class="font13"> to walk with God”. (Micah 6 : 8) The least of justice we can do i« to recognize that the main tenor of the world’s course is not right, and to cease to approve it—to repent, to change our minds from the approval that we once had for the wmrld. The least love of mercy we can show is to separate our hearts from those things and conditions which have incurred divine wrath (Romans 1: 18)—to be converted from the world. We can humble ourselves only when we ‘trust in the Lord with all our heart and lean not upon our own understanding’: when we ‘in all our ways acknowledge him’, only then will he ‘direct out paths’.—Prov. 3: 5, 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">We cannot walk with God until we commit our way to him. Enoch walked with God; all the ancient worthies walked with God, though not all of them in as distinctive a manner as Enoch. But since God’s footsteps now lead through a little valley of sacrifice, therefore, all those who humble themselves to walk with him during this age are directed to the way of sacrifice, Jesus making their bodies acceptable as sacrifices. (Romans 12:1) There is no merit to cover defects of the heart; if the heart is not right in God’s sight the consecration is not accepted—and there an end.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">THE WAY OF THE LORD</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">And what does walking with God mean ? It means to proceed as he proceeds; to go when he goes, to stop when he stops, to wait when he waits. It means to have the fellowship of the invisible One; and for this reason the world, who cannot see the Lord, thinks we are walking foolishly alone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">When the Lord accepts our consecration and slays us in sacrifice he starts a new life in us, a new life in Christ Jesus, and informs us that “there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the spirit”. (Romans 8:1) They find that not only is a clean heart </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">created </span><span class="font13">in them, but also that the Lord has provided agencies for the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">renewing</span><span class="font13"> of right spirits within them. (Psalm 51:10) They can expectantly pray: “Quicken thou me in thy way” and “Establish my footsteps in thy Word”. (Psalm 119: 37, 133) Of such it can be said: “The Lord directeth his steps”.—Proverbs 16:9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Those who have started to walk with God and in the Master’s footsteps “ought also so to walk even as he walked” (1 John 2:6), and that was </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">faithfully.</span><span class="font13"> “If we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in the darkness, we lie, and do not the truth; but if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus his Son cleanseth us from all sin.” (1 John 1:6,7) Jesus promises: “He that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life”. (John 8:12) Being thus in the Lord’s family, we seek to “walk worthy of the Lord” (Colossians 1:10) and worthy of that salvation which is brought “through sanctification of the spirit, even belief of the truth”.—2 Thessalonians 2:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">FROM SEN TO GLORY</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The major steps from sin to glory, as presented in the holy Word, are therefore seen to be:</span></p>

<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">PICTURES OF FACTS</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Should we expect to find these New Testament facts pictured by God’s Tabernacle in the wilderness? That would be a very reasonable expectation, in view of the Apostle’s statement that these things were “for a testimony of those things which were afterward to be spoken”. (Hebrews 3:5) And do we find them so pictured? Yes, very plainly so. Attention has been called to this in a recent article in these columns but we mention some of the main points briefly again.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Outside of the camp of Israel were the great stretches of the wilderness, picturing heathendom, the world in general, which has been ‘made a wilderness’ by the influence of Satan. (Isaiah 14:17) Heathendom, whether in New York, in Jokjokarta, or in Soochow, is not expecting any benefit or any manifestation of divine favor as the result of the antitypical atonement sacrifices. Heathendom does not have divine favor and makes no» pretense of having it. When the Jews expelled some one from the camp it was a way of saying that they considered that person to be unworthy of and outside of God’s favor and blessing. This is clearly shown by the attitude which Judaism held toward Jesus and his followers, as it is written: “The bodies of those animals whose blood is brought into the holy places by the high priest are burned outside of the camp. Therefore Jesus also, that he might sanctify the people through his own blood, suffered without the gate. Let us, then, now go forth to him outside of the camp [i. e., beyond the pale of the camp’s esteem and commendation], bearing reproach on account of him”.—Hebrews 13:12,13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">THE CAMP PLATTED OFF</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">A part of the wilderness was platted off and was made into a camp, even as Christendom is charted off from heathendom. The camp considered itself in divine favor and had some basis for thinking so; it also hoped for blessings to be brought to it as a result of the sacrificial work of the atonement day. During this gospel age, and until 1881, Christendom was blessed and admonished and warned of God and had considerable basis for believing itself to be in divine favor, and it was still hoping for some special benefit to be derived from Christ’s sacrificial work. Since 1881 this idea has been less and less prominent. As one soldier remarked in the recent war: “If God is on our side he has left us to do all the fighting”. Christendom, even more than heathendom, is unsympathetic toward sacrifice and,like Job’s “friends” of old, considers unpopularity and suffering to be a mark of divine disapproval. Yet it vaguely desires and longs for the happiness which only atonement with God can bring.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">In the midst of Christendom for many centuries has been God’s church, the spirit-begotten ones, antitypical under-priests, doing a work under the direction of their great High Priest. (Hebrews 3:1) In the midst of the camp of Israel was the Tabernacle where high priests and under-priests ministered on the atonement day—• once each year. All the ground outside the court of the Tabernacle was common or unhallowed ground; all inside that “wall of spotless white” was holy, sacred. As faith became less and less of a factor in the Israelitish life, the Tabernacle came to be regarded as a sort of tumor on their body national. They did not know exactly what to do with it; and, after many vicissitudes, it was finally almost in disuse, until David restored it and its services.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Likewise Christendom has been at a loss to know what to do with the devout followers of Jesus; and as Christendom’s faith in God’s purposes for man has dwindled and dwindled, the church has come to be more and more conspicuously in the way. It is particularly inconvenient in time of war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">THE BULLOCK AND THE GOAT</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Looking at the typical atonement day sacrifices we find that there were two offerings, the bullock and the Lord’s goat. (Leviticus 16) In Hebrews 13 we have our Lord Jesus identified in antitype with the first of these sacrifices, which was the bullock; and those who follow in</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">the Master's. footsteps con^pimd to the second phase, namely, the antitypical goat. In the sacred account no mention is made of the bullock’s being taken from the congregation of the children of Israel, even as our Lord J esus was never among those who were in need of atonement. For Jesus was always </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">“holy,</span><span class="font13"> harmless, undefiled, and separate from sinners” (Hebrews 7:26) ; he was born in the antitypical court condition. He was always i ighteous; hence always had God’s favor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Rut mention is made of the Lord’s goat, that it was taken from “the congregation of the children of Israel&quot;. (Leviticus 16:5) Eren so the Lord's people of this gospel age lune been drawn (John 6:44) or attracted by the message of God’s goodness as contained in the gosjiel. (2 Corinthians 4:4) Their hearts have responded to it; the goodness of the Lord as it becomes know n to these seekers after God draws them to the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">point of committing</span><span class="font13"> themselves </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">to the Lord’s arrangements</span><span class="font13"> for the blessing not only of Christendom, but also of heathendom. 'The Tabernacle was God’s arrangement for blessing Israel, and that arrangement was entered by the goat only with a view to participation in the sacrificial phases of the atonement work. The goat entered those </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">arrangements</span><span class="font13"> by the gate—the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">only means</span><span class="font13"> of access into the court. So Jesus assures us that he is “the way” (John 14:6) and “the door” (John 10:7), or means of access into the privileges of blessing and sacrifice. The only way we can approach to God or enter into his service is by committing our case to Jesus, for “all things are by the Son”.—1 Corinthians 8: 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">PRESENTED TO GOD</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The goat was led into the court and presented before the Lord. the Ixud's presence being represented in the &lt;ourt by the pillar of cloud. The Scriptures do not inform us in just what part of the court the animal was slain, but since it is generally agreed that all animals for burnt, sin, ami trespass offerings were slain on the north side of the altar.* it is not unlikely that this pan icular beast was slain there too, and hence, previously pie--ented and accepted at or near that place.) Bui no matter, it was presented, accepted, and slain, ami m any ease it was led at least to the brazen or, moie ।&gt;r&lt;&gt;j&gt;&lt;&gt;riy. i upper altar.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The Lord’s goat represented certain of </span><span class="font10">the ex pm lem-o </span><span class="font13">of the church of Christ as a </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">whole,</span><span class="font13"> although it i- aLo a fair depiction of the experiences of faithful </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">nnhrohi&lt;il </span><span class="font13">believers. Thev are admitted into a condition of di vine favor, with a view to becoming participant.- </span><span class="font10">in </span><span class="font13">the antitypical sacrifices of this </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">gospel age. </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Being</span><span class="font10"> naturally </span><span class="font13">imperfect, they would not be acceptable </span><span class="font10">a.- saciilices in </span><span class="font13">their own righteousness, and for this </span><span class="font10">reason the merit </span><span class="font13">of Jesus’ sinless life (the life he ceased </span><span class="font10">to live or expe</span><span class="font13">rience at Calvary, but the right to which </span><span class="font10">he did not for</span><span class="font13">feit) is made use of in the divine arrangement to make</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">*So says the Miahna (jZe&amp;orAj </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">ch V) a sitereil. bur noii-ranomc.-il </span><span class="font10">Hebrew work. The north side is most probable, because the east -.ide was occupied by the ash refuse, the west uns not f.»r tmm the Javer, and the south (according to Josephus and the Mi-Jina) had the acclivity, or inclined approach to the altar</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">tThe place of presentation of sacrifices would )&gt;&lt;• sotiled beyond question by Levith^ 17:4,5,9, and several other passages, as being “at the do - uf the tent of meeting”, wer&lt;» it not for tho statement in V acus 17 : 6 which is given apparently with a view to explaining inat the phrase, “at the door of the tabernacle/’ signifies the general area in front of the Tabernacle, m which, ot course, the altar was located. This view admit-, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">the</span><span class="font10"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">the animals being presented, accepted and slam him b\ the ah,»i -which seems most probable. </span><span class="font13">the blemished bodies of would-be sacrifices acceptable to Jehovah for slaying and for consumption on the antitypical altar. The altar pictures Jesus’ perfection as a human being, as that perfection is related to sacrifice. It was only on the basis of his perfection as a human being </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">that Jesus' sacrifice was well</span><span class="font13"> pleasing to God; it is only on the basis of Jesus' human perfection that </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">our </span><span class="font13">sacrifices are acceptable to God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">JUSTIFICATION AND THE SACRIFICE</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The altar therefore shows the relation of justification to the sacrifice of </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">the</span><span class="font13"> goat. While the court teaches justification, it picture-- much more than that. It shows divine fax or as connected with sacrifice. Of the Gord Jesus it is said: &quot;He was full of grace and truth&quot; by nature. He alwavs had God's favor. But to us “grace and truth </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">came</span><span class="font13"> by Jesus Christ&quot;. (John 1:1-1.17) I'liless we are humble enough to pass the gate of consecration and to enter into the divine ai rangemeiit through Christ Jesus we cannot ha\e divine favor (1 Teter 5; 5) nor be “justified freely bv his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus’’.-- Romans 3: 21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">From the time of the slaying of the antitypical sacrifice the individual believer’s experiences, the experiences involved in the maintenance of his </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">life</span><span class="font13"> a&gt; a new creature, are pictured in the person and activities of the underpriest in the court. His membership in th.' . posite body of Christ, and the experiences involved in the maintenance of that position in the anointed liody are shown more particularly in the body of the High Trie J. whose principal activities on the atonement day were in the sanctuary, consisting of the two holies, which was entered by the door, or first vail, the door which, implying spirit-begetting, really marks the time, though not the act, of spirit-anointing—for the Tabernacle proper represents the Christ </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">company,</span><span class="font13"> prospective and m glory, rather than the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">indiridual</span><span class="font13"> new creature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Are we. then, to understand that the new creature is i epresented both in the court and in the holy? Yes, but with ceitain qualifications. The court represents the experiences of the new creature more particularly Iroin the standpoint of his justified flesh; while the holy represents Inui more particularly as a member of the Anmnted Oue, from the standpoint of his heavenly hopes and prospects. We say </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">more particuhirhi</span><span class="font13"> because the ■•anointed&quot; experiences of the new creature and those </span><span class="font10">ot his llesli </span><span class="font13">arc not absolutely dissociated in the picture, e\en as they arc not dissociated in fact. In the picture the under-priests were engaged m certain activities m I he court, ewn as certain activities of the new mind have io do with the body in the work of sacrifice. The flesh itself is i nil iieneed to a certain extent by the development of the now creature. There is a sparkle to the eve. a \i\acity to the step which was not there before the, </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">organism was dominated</span><span class="font13"> hi </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">the</span><span class="font13"> new mind. On the other hand, there were, in the type, the copper sockets, the lamp wicks, and the incense powder iu the holy, all of which are references to the llesh of the new creature, but onlv in its relationship to the work which the holy stands lor sanctification, which, beginning with the anointing, or designation </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">io office, includes all</span><span class="font13"> preparation necessary lor the glorified Christ station, the antitypical most holy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">DOORS OF OPPORTUNITY</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The general symbolical significance of a door is </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">opportunity.</span><span class="font13"> The outside gate represents opportunity for entrance into God's favor and for participation in sacrifice. The door, or first vail, pictures the opportunity of being made meet for the inheritance of the saints in light, for the light of truth now and for the light of glory then. It i- not by chance that the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">holy</span><span class="font13"> pictures AoZy-fication, or the process of sanctification. The antitypical holy is tli&lt;&gt; condition calculated to develop in us a homelike feeling toward holiness, .-o that ve shall not feel out of place when Ushered into the holiest of all, even heaven itself. ’The vail leading into the most holy represents the opportunity of realizing all the hopes set before us in the gospel, even “the grace which is to be brought unto us at the revelation of Jesus Christ”.- 1 Pet. 1: 13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The way over which the Lord is leading us as prospective members of the body of Christ is evidently directed with a view to acquainting us with the basic principles of his character, and to conforming our hearts thereto, since these are also the dominant principles ol' all the universe. He is showing us enough about wisdom, justice, love, and power to test our loyalty to them as principles; and if we are faithful now in practicing at them he will give us both the capacity and the opportunity for exercising them under conditions most blessed to ourselves and to others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">JEHOVAH’S FINISHING SCHOOL</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The School of Jehovah and Jesus offers us a curriculum, a course of studies, which is simple in comparison with many of the great universities of the world; yet nowhere is there instruction which is so comprehensive and so thorough. We are offered lessons in wisdom, in justice, in love, in power, as major studies, and all the fruits and graces of the spirit as daily routine applications of these principles. The better to instruct us the Lord has arranged not only for preparatory courses in repentance and conversion, but also for regular classes in consecration, justification, and sanctification. There is the transfer from the junior to the senior work in spirit-begetting; and there is the graduation exercise, spirit-birth. The campus and buildings, so to speak, of this school consist of the camp, the court, the holy, and the most holy. As the court is in the camp and the holy is in the court, so wisdom’s exercise does not cease when the court is entered, nor does justice cease to be learned when one enters the holies.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">DEFINITION OF TERMS__CONSECRATION</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The vord </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">consecrate</span><span class="font13"> comes from two Middle-Age lull in voids, </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">cum</span><span class="font13"> and </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">sacer,</span><span class="font13"> which together mean to </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">cause Io be sacred.</span><span class="font13"> This etymological definition of the word corresponds very nearly to some of its usages in the Old Testament. But since we have other words to represent the thought of dedicate, hallow, and set apart to sacred purposes, it seems more clear to employ this term in its modern usage as given by the New Century Dictionary: ‘‘Consecrate: to dedicate solemnly, as from emotions of gratitude or convictions of duty; devote, as, He consecrated his life to the cause”. This use of the word well describes what the individual believer does when he commits himself to the Lord and his purposes. The word consecrate occurs only twice in the Common Version New Testament, and in each instance is used for a different Greek word. In Hebrews 7 : 2S it is used to translate </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">telee-o-oh.</span><span class="font13"> which really means </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">to make perfect</span><span class="font13"> or complete; and is so used twenty-five other times in the New Testament, as for instance, in Hebrews 2: 10, ‘‘made perfect through suffering”. The other time, in Hebrews 10: 20, </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">consecrate</span><span class="font13"> is used to translate </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">egkineezo, </span><span class="font13">which really means to </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">inaugurate,</span><span class="font13"> and is so translated in Hebrews 9 : 1&lt;S by the word </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">dedicate.</span><span class="font13"> In the Common Version Old Testament the word is used rather frequently, but careful research shows that it could almost always be better rendered by other modern words. In Exodus 28: 3 the word really means </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">cleanse, hallow, purify.</span><span class="font13"> In Joshua 6: 19 it means </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">dedicate, hallow.</span><span class="font13"> In Numbers 6:12 it does mean </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">conse.erate</span><span class="font13"> or set apart to sacred purposes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The word </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">present</span><span class="font13"> has been sometimes used as describing the action of the believer at the antitypical court gate. This word is accurate enough; the only difficulty is that it has such a wide use in profane matters that it seems less fitting for things of religious import.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">THE MEANING OF JUSTIFY</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The word </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">justify</span><span class="font13"> means </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">to make right,</span><span class="font13"> to declare or to render righteous. It is so used in almost every text in the Bible where the word occurs at all. Psalm 143: 2 uses the Hebrew correspondent, and that same word is used everywhere in the Old Testament where the word justify is found in the English text. The Greek word </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">diki-o-oh</span><span class="font13"> is employed exclusively in the New Testament for this thought. Acts 13 : 39 says: “They that believe are justified [made right] from all things”. The word is used thirty-nine times in the New Testament; thirtyseven limes translated </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">justify,</span><span class="font13"> once </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">free,</span><span class="font13"> and once </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">be righteous.</span><span class="font13"> There seems to be no room for confusion to the meaning of this word—to make right, to render just or righteous.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Justification is the stamp of approval for sacrifice which Jehovah gives to the consecrated believer, and this, depends on two things: </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">faith,</span><span class="font13"> or heart harmony with God (Bomans 5:1), and the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">blood of Christ,</span><span class="font13"> or the (rower residing in Christ's sacrificed life to cover the defects of our bodies. (Bomans 5: 9) There is no provision made for covering blemishes of the heart, though there is provision made in the next age for softening and mellowing hearts now out of accord with God.— Jeremiah 31 : 33, 34; Ezekiel 11:19; 36 : 26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">If our hearts have now been broken and rendered contrite by the experiences of life God will not despise us any longer, in so far as our hearts are concerned (Psalm 51: 17), though we would still be judicial enemies through imperfect </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">works.</span><span class="font13"> (Colossians 1: 21) Before the sacrifice of our Lord Jesus was made and before he appeared in heaven on behalf of believers this heart harmony was the nearest approach which could be made to having God’s approval and fellowship. Jehovah could and did approve the heart; and when nothing further could be done, this faith in God brought the consecrated believer into a state of friendship with him. (Romans 4: 3) But full justification is in the nature of a receipt for a debt paid; and whatever friendly sentiments there may be between creditor and debtor the receipt cannot be issued until the settlement is actually made—though the account may be satisfied by a friend.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">JUSTIFICATION TO LIFE</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">There being no opportunity for official sacrifice prior to this age, there was no provision for carrying out the justification by covering the blemishes of the body. Hence for the ancient worthies the fullest heart devotion could bring only approval of their hearts, not life justification. But since the age of sacrifice began and no one is accepted or approved for any other purpose than sacrifice as part of the great sin-offering (there being no other calling) there has been no such thing as heart approval without life justification. Any heart really devoted to the Lord would be just the kind of heart to cooperate with him and with the great High Priest m sacrifice; so the blood of Christ is applied to make his </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">body</span><span class="font13"> acceptable, and thus both heart and organism receive the stamp of approval—justification unto life—not unlike an inspector marking certain cattle for slaughter, or certain meat for consumption.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">“With the heart man believeth unto righteousness [that much righteousness, heart righteousness: and the faith that is strong enough to bring approval for the heart is also strong enough to prompt its possessor to step out boldly before all the world and say: I believe in this arrangement that God has in our midst and I am going in for it ] ; and [thus) with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.”--Romans 10:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The word </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">sanctify,</span><span class="font13"> in its application to new creatures, has already been explained. </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Justify</span><span class="font13"> refers more specifically to legal standing, while </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">sanctify</span><span class="font13"> has more to do with the moral standing and development of new creatures.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11" style="font-variant:small-caps;">--August 15 — 2 Samuel 12: 9,10; 18 :1 -15--</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">ABSALOM’S SHAMEFUL DISLOYALTY—I'KIDE, INGRATITUDE. HYPOCRISY, REBELLION -- LOVE IN RETURN FOR TREACHERY — KINO</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">DAVID’S RIPENESS OF HEART AND OF CHARACTER ILLUSTRATED — LESSONS OF CONFIDENCE IN GOD.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“IVhatsocrcr a man soircth, that shall he also reap.&quot;—Galatians 6:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">S</span><span class="font11">OME very trying experiences marked the closing years of King David’s life. These, however, under the Lord’s providential care, worked out for the king a ripeness of heart and of character which are exhibited to us in the Psalms of his later writing. These disastrous experiences date from the time of his sin, and to a considerable extent they were used of the Lord as punishments for that sin. Although in the case of Absalom’s rebellion we may trace the evil which there culminated to circumstances which occurred long before David’s sin, we are also to remember that it was quite in the Lord's power to have shielded the king ho as to prevent the success of Absalom's machinations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Among these earlier influences may be mentioned David's marriage to Absalom’s mother, who was the daughter of a foreign king. The divine counsel is to the effect that God's people should not be unequally yoked together with unbelievers ; and this counsel applies to the spiritual Israelites of this gospel age. The disregard of the divine wisdom was sure to produce unfavorable results in some manner at some time. Children born to such a mismated marriage are sure to Inherit certain elements of character and disposition from the unbelieving parent which will eventually show themselves. In the story of Absalom we see an illustration of this fact. His vanity, insubordination, disloyalty, went hand in hand with an ambition which seemed to hesitate at nothing. It killed a half-brother who stood between himself and the throne, and later on stimulated a usurpation of his father’s throne and the seeking of his father’s life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Absalom’s murder of his half-brother under provocation led to his fleeing to his grandfather’s dominion, where he remained three years. Then through intrigues in official circles King David’s love for his son was prevailed upon to such an extent as to permit Absalom’s return to his home land, and eventually to all the privileges of the heir apparent to the throne. The young man, remarkable for his handsome appearance, introduced from his grandfather’s court a custom which still prevails in Egypt, namely, that a prince should have a special chariot and a bodyguard of fifty trained men. The people were pleased with the display of royalty in their prince, as for several years a great and sobering change had been coming over the king, who was advancing in years and who no longer showed himself among his people as much as formerly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The vain young prince was quick to see that his spectacular course pleased the people: and quite probably he had heard that his young brother Solomon was David's choice for his successor in the kingdom. Absalom concluded to make a bid for the royal honors of his father. His method was a crafty one: he would steal the hearts of the people from his father to himself. He had no filial affection ; only selfish ambition is manifested in his course. This conspiracy against his father may be considered as having begun immediately upon Absalom’s return from exile or as dating from his full acceptance back to fellowship with his father and to a princely position. In the latter case it was four years in progress, in the former six jears.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">THE CONSPIRACY A SUCCESS</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">When Absalom considered that matters were ripe for action, he asked permission to go to Hebron, there to offer a great sacrifice unto the Lord in harmony with a vow made years before. Thus the occasion was made so important that the taking with him of many of the chief men of the army and of the city would not be considered remarkable, but rather an honor to the king through his son. Meantime spies had been sent throughout the twelve tribes; and trumpeters were posted in various quarters, so that when Absalom should proclaim himself king at Hebron, the whole line of trumpeters would sound almost simultaneously and the spies in Absalom’s secret service would explain that now Absalom was king. The people would thus get the impression that the revolution of the kingdom was complete, that King David was thoroughly vanquished, and that their personal prosperity with the new king would depend upon their prompt manifestation of loyalty to his cause. The. plot worked remarkably well, and as a result practically the entire nation was turned to Absalom in a day. The conspiracy was successful to a degree that scarcely had been anticipated. Practically the whole nation gave allegiance to Absalom in so outward and marked a manner that after his death it was necessary for King David to be publicly requested to return to the head of the tribes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Utterly surprised and unprepared for Absalom’s unfllial -conduct was King David. When he learned of his son’s rebellion and realized its extensiveness, he at once perceived that no other course was open to him than that of flight. It was a time of peace; and he did not have a large retinue of soldiers at Jerusalem, but merely what might be termed a bodyguard. With these and the loyal officers of the court he fled across the Jordan, where he had time and opportunity to gather a few reinforcements, and where he might feel comparatively safe in the small but strongly fortified city of Mahanaim. Meantime Absalom displayed his contempt for his father and his household and thus, so to speak, showed the people that the rebellion was one in which no quarter or reconciliation was .to be expected. With a large army which had cast in their fortunes with the rebellious prince and expected under his patronage to reap large results of honor, Influence and power as successors to the officers of the kingdom, Absalom pursued King David In haste. There seems to have been no doubt whatever that he was bent on capping the climax of his disgraceful course by the murder of his father. His pursuit with a large army meant this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Although King David’s army was much the smaller of the two, they probably had the advantage in that many of the king’s guard were men of special ability and large experience as warriors. The king was persuaded not to go with the army, whereupon he divided it into three parts under three of his ablest adherents. These met Absalom’s army and attacked it from different quarters. The battle resulted in the slaughter of 20,000 of Absalom’s forces and the routing of the remainder, including Absalom himself, who, being caught by the head in the low branches of a tree, was unhorsed and left helpless, and was slain by Joab, the chief of King David’s generals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Near the watch tower of the wall of Mahanaim King David awaited news of .the battle, while the watchmen reported that he saw a messenger running and, later, another. When the first runner arrived, he announced in a general way the success of the king’s army. Then the king, in harmony with his parting words to the soldiers that in any event they should spare Absalom, inquired first of all: “Is the young man Absalom safe?” As we are shocked with the unfllial conduct of Absalom toward his father, so we are deeply impressed with the fatherly love of David for his erring son, who sought not only his throne, but his life. What was the difference between the two characters? Which was the more noble, the more honorable, the more admirable? There could be but one answer from any quarter on this subject; even David’s enemies could not read this record without an appreciation of his grandeur of soul. He was more anxious for Absalom than for his throne apparently, yea, than for his own life. The difference between the two characters can be accounted for in only one way, namely, that David was a man after God’s own heart, one who had passed through trying experiences and had learned profitable lessons, one in whom the spirit of love had been largely developed. Absalom, on the contrary, is an illustration of selfishness and of ambition which stooped to anything in order to accomplish its ends.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The second runner was probably one of the king’s household servants who had engaged in the battle. He quickly told the whole story. Upon hearing thus of the death of Absalom the king was moved to violent grief, and gave utterance to words which stand among the most patheitlc on the pages of history: “O my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! Would God I had died for thee. O Absalom, my son, my son!”</span></p>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">PROPHET — A HUMBLE AND A CONTBITE HEART — BLESSINGS FROM STUMBLINGS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“Wash </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">me thoroughly from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin.”—Psalm 51:2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">P</span><span class="font11">ROSPERITY did not work to King David’s personal advantage. After years of phenomenal success under the Lord’s blessing, when his kingdom was mighty and his name honorable, and the necessity for his personal participation in wars was passed, and his heart had begun to gravitate towards earthly pleasures and was less zealous for the Lord and the law than at first, the king fell into grievous sins, which appear UH the more black in contrast with the high moral character shown by him in his earlier life, when he was the man after God’s own heart. The story of ins sins, how he became enamored of Bathsheba and committed adultery with her, and subsequently, to shield himself, caused her husband Uriah to be placed In the forefront of the battle that he might be killed by the enemy, involving the loss of several other lives as well, is told in the Scriptures in a most straightforward manner, without the slightest effort to condone the king’s wrong-doing. No excuses are •offered in connection with the account; the full weight of these awful crimes is laid directly on the king’s head. Whatever excuses may be offered on his behalf must come from the reader of the account. We may suggest some thoughts along this line: In that day the kings of the world exercised a despotic authority, and it was a theory among the people that the king could do no wrong—that whatever he pleased to do was proper to him because of his high position as the head and ruler of the nation. We could in no sense of the word agree with such a thought. Nevertheless we can reasonably suppose that a sentiment so general would have more or less influence upon the mind of the king. He who respected Saul’s life because he was the Lord’s anointed may have to some extent fallen into the misconception that his own anointing by the Lord relieved him in some degree from the responsibilities resting upon others of his nation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">For about two years after these crimes were committed the king sought to stifle his conscience, and to consider that he was only using kingly liberties in what he had done. Nevertheless his conscience smote him, and he felt an alienation from God and a condemnation under his law such as tie would not have felt had he been of a different stamp ol character. God was not hasty in reproving him, either. He allowed him to have a full taste of heart bitterness—allowed liim to feel the darkness of soul, absence of joy, resulting from the cloud which had come between him and the Lord. It was at the appropriate time, after David had passed through secret mournings and travellings of the soul, that the Lord sent him a reproof through Nathan the Prophet to bring the whole matter clearly before his mind. Nathan, under the figure of a parable, excited the king’s sympathies and drew forth declaration of a very severe judgment—a dealli sentence—against the person offending, and then the Prophet brought home to him the lesson, saying, “Thou an the man!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">King David, we are to remember, did not belong to the spiiitual house of sons, and hence had a far less clear view of such matters than that which would properly belong to exery member of the house of sons, begotten of the spirit and “taught of God”. We are not. therefore, to expect to draw a lesson to ourselves along similar lines. Rather we of the spiritual house, under the clearer conceptions of the divine will, are to remember the interpretation of adultery and murder set forth in the New Testament: that whoever desires adultery, and is merely restrained from it by outward circumstances or fears, is really an adulterer in his heart (Matthew 5:28) : that lie that is angry with his brother, he who hates his brother, is a murderer—because the spirit of anger is that which, unrestrained, would lead to murder ( Matthew 5: 22) ; and that the person who covets the things of another is merely restrained from taking them for lack of opportunity or fear of consequence, Is at heart a thief. It these principles be applied by the new creation in the examination of their hearts, it is entirely probable that some of the “house of sons” today may find themselves very near the plane of King David as respects sin, and so viewing mailers they will exercise proportionately greater compassion in their judgment of the royal transgressor. Such, too, will find great consolation in the Lord's compassion, provided they are exercised in respect to tlieir offenses as David was concerning his.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">THE PSALM OF CONTRITION</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The Fifty-first Psalm is generally recognized as being the one in which the Psalmist expressed to God his contrition for his sins, and the fact that it is dedicated to the </span><span class="font2">Chief </span><span class="font11">Musician implies that it was the king's intention that it, in c ommon with other of the Psalms, should be chanted in the Tabernacle services, for which he had set apart a large number of singers. We thus perceive that if the sin was flagrant and gross, the atonement which the king endeavored to make was a most public one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Here again we see why David was described as a man after God's own heart. His sins were not pleasant to God quite the reverse; but the after-appreciation of the enormity of the sins and the hearty repentance therefor to the Lord, and the desire to be cleansed from every evil way, were pleasing to the Lord. Here we have an illustration of fmw all things may work together for good to those who love God. By reason of his heart-loyalty to the Lord and the principles of righteousness even these terrible sins resulted in bringing a great blessing to David’s own heart—humbling him—giving him an appreciation of his weakness and littleness. and of his need to abide close to the Lord, if he would have the Lord’s fellowship and compassion and be safe from the temptations of his own fallen flesh. So, too, with the new creation. How many of them have realized profitable lessons and blessings out of some of their stumblings—not that the stumblings were good nor of the Lord, but that the Lord was able to overrule such circumstances for good to those who are of the proper mind—rightly exercised by them to repentance and reformation</span></p>

Joab, for a long time the head of David’s army, must have been well-advanced In years, too, and probably was on the retired list, not merely on account of age but because he had deeply wounded King David's feelings In disregarding his instructions that Absalom's life should not be taken.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Adonijah thought the Hine ripe for him to proclaim himself king, and especially as he had succeeded in gaining the friendship of Joab, the long-time military leader, and the friendship, too, of one of the prominent priests. He made a feast, to which were invited, apparently, all of King David's sons except Solomon, who was known to be more or less a favorite with his father. The feast was hold not far from Jerusalem, and the arrangement was made that in the midst of the feast one of the company should salute Adonijah as king. The others of his company were expected to echo the sentiment; and thus the movement would seemingly Ik&gt; a popular one and not a rebellion. It carried out mm-h as planned thus far.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">However, in God’s providence, the matter was brought to the notice of King David, who promptly made the arrangement with the new general, Benaiah, with Nathan the Prophet, and with Zadok the priest, to have Solomon immediately placed upon the king’s white mule, as a sign that the king had approved him as his successor. Then he was anointed in the name of the Lord; and forthwith the military salute was given, and the people of the whole city of Jerusalem shouted their joy. “Long live King Solomon&quot;. Next in turn, by King David's direction, King Solomon was brought to the throne and publicly crowned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Adonijah, whose plans seemed to be working thoroughly, was astounded, and so were those with him, when they heard the clamor of the people, blowing of horns, etc., and later learned that it meant that Solomon had been crowned and enthroned. Adonijah feared for his life and fled; and his adherents melted aw'ay. Later, however, Solomon sent word to his brother Adonijah, assuring him of peace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Thus beautifully King David’s public career ended, not In an eclipse, but at his zenith, in his full maturity of old age, and in his perpetuation upon the throne in the person of his chosen son. Solomon's name has come to signify wisdom; but originally, primarily, it meant peaceful. It surely was a prophecy of his wonderful life, in which was no war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Solomon initiated his reign by making a feast to some of Iii» friends and the prominent people of his realm. It was during this feast, which probably lasted several days, that Solomon had the wonderful dream narrated in the latter part of our lesson. The dream was from the Lord. In it the Lord suggested the question to Solomon, and also a proper answer to the question. Then he expressed his pleasure at the suggested answer, and told how he would reward the spirit which it manifested. “And Solomon awoke, and behold it was a dream.” Yet in all the subsequent years of ins reign Solomon realized the blessings mentioned in that dream just as surely as if the suggested prayer had been actually his, and, indeed, we may assume that upon awakening Solomon endorsed the wise prayer of his dream, although his subsequent course as a king does not indicate that those noble sentiments always actuated him. God was using Solomon as a type, and his reign in some sense prefigured the glorious reign of Christ, “the Prince of Peace”.</span></p>

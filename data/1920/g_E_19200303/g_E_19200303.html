<p><span class="font13">O</span><span class="font8">CCASIONALLY an item from some alleged financial “authority” steers us for a time in the wrong direction, but not for long, we think; for we have a lot of sharp-eyed, friendly, interested readers, who no longer believe everything they see in print and will have nothing less than the truth on all subjects. The story that engineers and freight conductors were making high wages was widely published, and was manifestly unfair unless accompanied by the fact that it represented nearly two months’ work done in one month. We received no thanks from Wall Street for publishing their lies and now they will probably be sore at us for giving wide publicity to the truth. But we think our readers prefer to have us try to tell the truth at all times, rather than to follow a too common newspaper custom of telling lies and never correcting anything. The man who edits </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font8">magazine of this sort will inevitably make lots </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">of</span><span class="font8"> mistakes. Shall we cover up these mistakes or '’face the music”? Wliat do you say?</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">“We are considered as having one of the best</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19200303_files/g_E_19200303-4.png" alt="" style="width:18pt;height:18pt;">

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">contracts in the country in the way of working conditions.. and I presume you know the rates of pay are about Uniform throughout the country in the same classes of service; I know of but one man on the Mobile Division of the Mobile and Ohio Railroad who makes the amount stated in your article, and this man has been in the service since 1874.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">‘Tor more than eleven years I have served in the capacity of local or war freight conductor, and during that time my increase in wages has by no means kept . pace with the .ever-climbing cost .of living. I have had an increase of $1.32 per day since 1914; or, to be exact, for a month of twenty-six working days of eight hours each I receive $15L32. Do you think that an excessive amount for a man who tries to be honest and who has a wife, three children and a widowed aunt to support?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">“I have used the same winter suit for three winters, buying a new one this Fall only from dire necessity, and I owe the tailor a balance of $20 on it My wife made over a dress she had in 1917, and waited until the season was more than half gone before she bought her hat and cloak; in other words she waited for the ‘sale prices'. We have not had an egg on our table since we had visitors, just three months ago, by actual count We own our own home; and I do not know how those get along who pay rent and have large families to support</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">“Are you going to call men robbers and highwaymen because they want enough to maintain their loved ones in some degree of comfort and see that they get proper food ? It may be true that the heads of the four brotherhoods did hold Congress up at the point of a gun, in a manner; but they were forced to do this by the men in the ranks. All were ready to bring the wheels of transportation to a standstill if demands were not granted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">“I have given the best part of my life to this work; I don’t know anything else; and I suspect I would have a harder time making a living at some other trade than-railroading, and there are thousands upon thousands in the same boat. But do you think it just and right that these men, who are necessary to our national well being, should be denied the right to a living wage because some few among them wear silk shirts? I have been in the service seventeen years, and during all that time I have never had a silk shirt</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">“You spoke of some of these men as making almost as much money as the governors of some of our states. Well, why shouldn’t they? The governors of all the states might form a conspiracy with that wonderful law-</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">making</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> body in Washington and all quit; but somehow the country would rock along and people would not miss them very much except at tax-paying time. But you let the transportation men cease to function and see how long it would be until things would be in an uproar.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">“Did you ever stand behind an engineer and watch </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> as he bored his way through the blackness of the night at a rate of sixty miles per hour or more, and note with what keen interest he watches everything? He knows that one mistake on his part or the failure of some fellow employe to bring up his end of the rope properly means death, not only to himself, but to lives entrusted to his care. This is a great strain which no man can endure for long without a telling effect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">“Or did you ever watch the ‘fire boy’ as he climbs to his post in the engine deck and, with scoop and sometimes with a dirty tank of coal, fights that roaring furnace from one end of the road to the other? He is eager that proper steam pressure be maintained and his train reach destination on time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">“Possibly you have never been an eyewitness to these things, but no doubt you have lain comfortably asleep in the Pullman while all kinds of hardships were being endured by the men in charge of this train; and you felt perfectly safe, for you knew the company required men who had to measure up to a high standard.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">• “These men are not criminals; but taken as a whole they are honest, hard working and charitable. They welcome publicity and would be only too glad if you would obtain the real facts and give them to your readers. I know of no class of men who will welcome the oncoming Golden Age with more real joy than the rank and file of railroad men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">“Very few people know or realize what a hard and trying life these men are forced to lead. Called out at all hours of the day and night, and exposed to all kinds of weather, is it any wonder that such a life does not appeal to the class of men who seek the governorship of our states ? Then why deny these men a living wage ?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A passenger conductor in Iowa writes:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;You say that freight and passenger conductors now receive $300 per month, when the fact is that the salary of all passenger conductors is $180 per month. We grant that in very </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">man</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">y cases conductors do receive as much as $200 per month, and that some do even receive as much as $300, but these are few in number; for in order to </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">make</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> extra wages one must have a long run and work long hours.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;Passenger conductors get only 75 cents per hour for overtime and that is only on straight time and not time and a half, as is figured in the case of men in the alow freight service and in the shops. The shop men get all the way from 75 cents to 87 cents per hour and are not compelled to be away from home a greater part of their time, as are the train and engine men; therefore their expenses are far less, and when the truth is known there is not so much difference in the net pay received each month by the two classes. Yard men, as well as track men and laborers, all get time and a half for all over eight hours. It costs the road man anywhere from $40 to $55 for board and bed away from home each month.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A Massachusetts conductor says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;I find you are misinformed as to the wages of a conductor. You say they receive $300 per month. The fact is they receive $180, and work every day in the month including Sundays, ten hours a day, to receive that guaranteed sum. This is the actual wage scale here in Massachusetts. If there are any exceptional cases receiving $300 it must be for overtime. Many of the conductors, myself included, have had to be away from home the last ten months at an added expense of $10 per week for room and board in order to hold my job and rating.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sub>;</sub></span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A conductor in Maryland writes:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;Freight conductors here are making $167.40, and ■ passenger conductors $186, for a thirty-one-day month. By losing a lot of sleep and making lots of overtime we can sometimes make near $200. The freight conductors were receiving $4.10 per day in 1912 and today they receive $5.40. Figure the cost of living in 1912 by the side of the cost of living today and see if you think we have made a Jesse James hold-up. If we made as big a mistake in a train order as you made in your statement I think we would lose our jobs and have io go to digging potatoes or some other business.. If we could earn $250 per month we would </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">think</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> we were making big wages.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Engineers* Wages</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">A</span><span class="font8">N -ENGINEER in the state of Washington</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">» writes the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">“Myself and crew made twenty-five days from January 1st to 15th, 1920: the conductor's wages, at $5.40 per day, equals $135 for two weeks’ work. Each trip I was at home eight hours and away thirty-six to fortyeight hours. Had I worked eight hours per day for the thirteen working days in the first half of January I would have made $73.20. How many editors, governors and other professional men have got the nerve to work ten days overtime out of fifteen? It looks good on paper; but come out and gallop with us for—a_few months.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A subscriber writes of an Alabama engineer:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;He maintains that four or five years ago he received $5.00 per hundred miles in his grade of service, and that now he receives only $5.60 for the same service: and on the other hand the members of the unskilled unions, ‘car toads’, as he called them, were then getting 22 cents to 30 cents per hour and are now receiving 82 cents per hour; and, furthermore, that an engineer who is called out to do three hours’ work gets pay for three hours only, while in the case of the lowest classes of labor they get a full day’s pay for a like three hours of actual work.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The same subscriber writes of an engineer’s wife:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">“She says that the highest her husband ever knew a freight engineer to get was less than $300 per month. She also says that her husband’s expense on the road</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">is more than his home expense, for the reason that he has to have a room at two different places, and those who rent rooms charge railroad men more than they do • others; and in addition to this disadvantage, she savs, the local merchants charge members of the four big brotherhoods about five cents a pound more for the things the}- buy than they do others. She cited her own home as an evidence that the engineers were not living like lords, nor their wives enjoying the articles of luxury mentioned. Her rooms were small and p</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">lainl</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">y fur. nished. There was no appearance of wealth in either of these engineers’ homes.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">An engineer in Wyoming writes:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;I am a locomotive engineer on the highest rate of pay engines in the country in freight service. Employes in road sendee are not paid a monthly salary, but for actual service rendered; i. e., miles run or hours put in in actual service. The rate of pay is the same for Sundays and holidays as it is for weekdays; it is the same for the midnight hours as for the sunny hours in the day. This highest rate for locomotive m-</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">nnin</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">g in the freight service is $8 per 100 miles or eight hours of work Now, holding railroad men down to the hours of work of other mortals six days a week would be $48, or $200 per month, which I venture to suggest is about the average for locomotive freight engineers in regular service.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A railroad telegrapher in New York-state writes:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">“The statement that freight and passenger conductors now receive over $300 per month and freight engineers receive 8392 per month I believe is quite misleading and does these men an injury; for there arc, to the best of . niy knowledge, only a few of such positions, and with present rates no engineer nor conductor can make this ' amount unless he works every day, including Sundays, and also nearly sixteen hours per day, which is equal to nearly two months’ work in one month, from the popular standpoint of an eight-hour day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">“I am reliably informed that the only position drawing anywhere near your figure is one held by the oldest engineer on the road, and he has made as high as $326 in a month; but this man works twelve and one-half hours per day, thirty-one days a month, to earn this, but </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">ennu</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">nt always do this because it is too steady and rest is needed. Therefore, he must needs lay off occasionally.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;At twelve and one-half hours per day this man is working four and one-half hours each day in excess of a day’s work of eight hours; and if we figure this on an eight-hour basis, with time and a half for overtime, he is earning less than 75 cents per hour for one of the most responsible positions in the country, from the standpoint of the human lives depending upon him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;As to the average freight engineer, I am reliably informed that he rarely exceeds $225 for a thirty-one-day month. In fact, unless he makes overtime he positively cannot exceed $225, and there are many who make kji than $175 for a thirty-one-day month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">“The average freight conductors pay on this road, will not exceed $200 per month, and he must work thirty-one days per month to earn this. The only instances where the figures as given herein are exceeded i-? where a goodly amount of overtime is made.'’</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark7"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark8"></a>Shopmen's Wages</span></h4>
<p><span class="font13">I</span><span class="font8">T IS claimed that at the time the railroad shopmen, last summer, put in their request to have their wages of 57 cents, 63 cents and 68 cents per hour raised to 85 cents per hour their average individual wages amounted to $1722 per year; but at forty-eight hours per week this amount would give 69 cents per hour, so it must have included some overtime. The wages of gang foremen before the last raise were said to be $2461 per year, and the wages of helpers, $1263. An increase of $250,000,600 was divided among the shopmen in 1918, and a further increase of $45,000,000 in 1919, the latter increase to put the shopmen on the same basis of a day’s pay for eight hours’ work previously granted to other railway employes.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark10"></a>Prodigious Plunderers</span></h4>
<p><span class="font13">T</span><span class="font8">HE principal cause for undue profits on food and other stuffs has even been stated .</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">to be the fact that the people are willing for those profits to be made. This is only a part truth; for the average person is not possessed of the time and means necessary to conduct investigations and prosecutions. To secure any land of satisfaction would take as much money standing as the profiteers have; and if the aver- — age person had the financial and social standing which the profiteers enjoy, or are supposed to enjoy, that person would not be an average person any more, but would be a profiteer himself and interested in furthering and protecting the profiteers' interests.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Accordingly, as a thorougldy reputable American document has stated it, “experience hath shown that mankind are more disposed to suffer while faults are sufferable, than to right thcie by abolishing the forms to which they are ac- ’ customed”. Can it be that instead of memory clinging tenderly to the little red school-house, the little grey home, the old swimmin’ hole, we are to become so accustomed to the dear profitshark that we are unwilling to sec him go ? At all events he is still here, and is able to keep up prices; yes, to boost them higher and higher by his ability to limit the market.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Health Commissioner Robertson, of Chicago, vouches for the correctness of these figures:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">During the year 1918 there were two </span><span class="font8" style="text-decoration:underline;">mill</span><span class="font8">ion pounds of foodstuffs shipped to Chicago which were necessarily destroyed, because they were spoiled and had to be condemned for the sake of the public health. There were 312,068 pounds of meat, presumably beef, pork, and mutton; 148,969 pounds of fish, 63,233 pounds of poultry, 240,553 pounds of fresh vegetables, 102,272 pounds of canned figs, 369,912 pounds of other cairned fruits, 527,943 pounds of canned vegetables, and 19,572 pounds of eggs. It will be remembered that this prodigious wastage occurred while millions of people were obliged to go on short rations, because they had not the money to buy at the high prices. If the market had been open, the prices would have fallen to make room for the disposal of these vast stocks before they spoiled. But why worry about spoiling stocks when you can make it all up by raising the prices on what you have left?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">No one knows yet how great the waste was in 1919, but some idea can be gained from the fact that surplus stocks in Chicago were much greater in 1919 than in 1918. It is a safe assumption that stocks are proportionate in other cities. At the end of June there were 211,956,-577 pounds of foodstuffs in warehouses of Chicago, as compared with 155,248,487 pounds at the same time last year. Crated eggs are not counted in these figures.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark12"></a>Working for Profit</span></h4>
<p><span class="font13">W</span><span class="font8">HEN a man works for clients in a professional way he receives a fee, when he works in a white collar he receives a salary, when he works in a colored shirt he receives wages. What wages ought a man to receive for his work? He ought to receive enough compensation so that he can maintain a comfortable home, feed, clothe and educate himself, his wife and his children, with enough profit so that he can anticipate and provide for old age or other periods when he is unable to work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Wages that will just keep, the man himself housed, fed, clothed and contented are not sufficient. Wages that will just renew and support life are not sufficient: wages that provide for support only during the producing years are not sufficient; it costs a lot of money to transform a six-pound baby into a six-foot man. Mothers are more important than machines; without mothers there would be no machines. The baby and the mother must be cared for, and the man must receive enough compensation to care for them, and to care for himself when he can no longer work. The pay which the man gets for the work he does in the shop must pay for the work done by both his wife and himself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Wages today are usually the formal terms of an armistice in a battle that never really comes to an end. Employer and employe have diametrically opposite viewpoints and interests to serve; and the place where they come to agreement is the place where, for the time, it is more to the interests of both to have peace than to continue the fight.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The war has made tremendous changes in wages. It has made tremendous profits for employers and has witnessed a strenuous effort on the part of employes to retain the percentage of profit which has heretofore been theirs. With the end of the war came an earnest desire on the part of labor to retain all the advantages gained during the war, and an equally determined desire on the part of the employer to nullify these desires by boosting prices to a place where the net result to labor in the way of wages would be as little or less than that paid before the war came.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Foreigners who come to America manage to live and save fortunes on wages upon which Americans save nothing. The difference is in the standard of living. The desire for an improved standard of living for wife and children has much to do with the American’s clamor for more and ever more wages. The more he makes the more he spends, and the more he spends the more he boosts the price of life’s necessities for himself and everybody else.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark17"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark18"></a>Hundreds of Millions for Roads</span></h4>
<p><span class="font13">T</span><span class="font8">HE high point in road building was reached in 1916. but that was only a fifth of what is planned for 1920. The nation is waking up. Good-roads associations, trail associations, highway councils, and so on, have urged communities, states and the nation to construct better highways at a cost of millions to billions of dollars, and through the free spirit of spending engendered by the World War have converted the country. Almost as one man the people are demanding instantly the most modem and comprehensive system of roads in the world, and arc ready to pay the price.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">■According to the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Koginccring News - Record </span><span class="font8">American road-building presents demands for the building in five years of a mileage of roads greater than the 40,000-mile five-year record of railways in 1879.to 18S3. The railway mileage cost about $20,000 a mile, or a total of $800,000,000; the expectation is that the next five years are to see 100,000 miles of first-class roads built at an average cost of $30,000 a mile. The $3,01X1,000,000 that tins will cost does not affect anything but the imagination of a people accustomed to the raising of three to five billion at a time for purposes of destruction. The 1920 program alone calls for $633,000,000, obtainable by millions as follows: $1G5 unfinished work, $273 from county, state and Federal governments, $45 unexpended balances, $50 from old bond issues, and $100 from new bond issues.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">No better roads have ever been constructed than some of those in project. Not even the ancient Roman roads equaled them. The world-famous French roads are not in the same class. These roads are not to he speedways or pleasure roads, but ways of the most substantial construction, fit to bear the brunt of the ever heavier impact of ever more powerful trucks and the coming trains of trucks, which are destined to appear in fleets on the American highways, and in large measure to supplant the railways as freight carriers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The history of road-building in this country is typical of the progress from poverty to plenty. The original roads were forest or prairie trails. Then came the earth road maintained by the personal labor of the tartpayers. Hard-surfaced roads could not even be suggested by the progressive, but permanent culverts and bridges were built. Here and there first-class roads were built by the state for object lessons, and finally the voters were ready for the huge highway-construction projects of today.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The roads required are of four classes. Roads are needed for agricultural purposes. This includes traffic from town to farm and from farm to town, a rapidly growing type of transportation wherever cities have been made centers of road systems on which are carried the crops and foodstuffs from regions remote from rail transportation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The second type of roads is recreational, for local and tourist traffic. The tourist traffic is large and important, us tens of thousands of sightseers travel from state to state over the entire country. But it is only incidental to the immense amount of mileage—about 90% —for pleasure and health near the homes of automobile owners.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The third, type of roads is commercial, to accommodate the traffic between large industrial centers, and is rapidly shaping up into an efficient transportation system for freight and express by truck which calls for a substantial type of road.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The fourth type is the military road, a variety of road not much in evidence in the United States, but wherever found it is of the most substantial character, intended to stand the rough<sup></sup>work of heavy trucks and guns. Other high-class roads will answer this purpose nearly everywhere, but short stretches' of distinctly military roads will be built here and there, as connecting links to the entire system.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">There are country roads in the United States so muddy that it is said a baby carriage would be stuck on a 5% down grade. The mud assumes the consistency of sticky taffy and holds tight in its embrace anything that sets foot or wheel therein. In some Southern States the roads are practically impassable in certain months, and families that fail to stock up with coal and provisions for the mud siege go cold and hungry because stores and coal piles are inaccessible. It is no</span><span class="font8" style="text-decoration:underline;">thin</span><span class="font8">g uncommon in many sections of the country for the fields to be better to ride over than the alleged roads. In such regions civilization is an impossibility, and prosperity must languish for lack of a market.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The grade of even a good road affects its usefulness. The worst grade on an entire highway, even though over only a little hill, represents the efficiency of the entire road. A horse that can pull 2000 pounds on a level earth road can pull 1000 up a 5% grade and only 750 up a 10% grade. Grades are relatively worse on good roads than on ordinary earth roads. The percentage of efficiency loss is greater on the grades. On a level, improved road the same horse may draw 5000 pounds but on a 5% grade he can move only 1600 and up a 10% grade but 960—only a little more than that up the same grade on an earth road. The total waste chargeable to poor roads and to excessive grades on even good roads, thought of in terms of inefficient use of equipment, loss of marketing ability, reduction of productivity of farms, higher cost of farm products’, and lower values of country properties, is simply too immense to be calculated. Some day it will be eliminated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">There is no question before the people, the solving of which would benefit them more than would the solution of the good-roads question. As famine impinges upon whole nations in the Old World and the signs of approaching distress are not wanting in America, the country does well to make provision for better methods of distributing food products with the minimum cost and the minimum number of middle-men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The experience of one farmer is typical of that of tens of thousands. Writing to the New York </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Times,</span><span class="font8"> he says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">“Owning 240 acres I cultivated only about twenty-five, while .it. least 150 arc cultivable. A neighbor of mine owning 360 acres docs not cultivate his land at all. A very small part of the cultivable land in my district is tilled, and the question arises, Why? The answer is, Bad roads. My farm is four miles from the railroad; the country road by which we have to travel there is so bad that it is impossible, for me to get in due time all the materials needed for the proper cultivation of all my land. As a direct result of the roads most farmers in my neighborhood are forced to sell out their stock and leave their farms. There are ten farms along the road leading from the railroad to my house, and out of these onlv two are inhabited by their owners. The other eight have been vacated.’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In the World War in France the condition of the roads became a question of national importance. It has been truly said that France has been saved by her roads. Even at that the French roads were of such light construction that they broke down under the heavy traffic of the conflict. France had not looked far enough ahead to build roads that would stand the terrific pounding of artillery and of trains of heavy trucks driven at breakneck speed. There is only one objection raised to good roads, and that is by some of the church people, who complain that the roads tempt the people away from the services and out into the good fresh air and sunlight and into good health, to the damage, it is alleged, of the souls of the autoists and of ecclesiastical revenues. It was perhaps irreverently suggested in one country church that if the people were travelling to “hell” via the good roads, it was fortunate for any that went in Fords, for the Ford always “brings you back”. That, however, is not an economic question, and for purposes of discussion is outside the scope of this article.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In the primitive era of road building the ownership of a pick and shovel or a team of horses constituted one a competent road architect; but, after much patient effort by civil engineers, the work has been reduced to the science of highway engineering, and roads are first designed and then built for economy, efficiency’ and permanency. At the best a road is a mechanism that lasts only a certain number of years before it is worn out; and it should be replaced.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The factors that enter into good road building are many and important. The principal one is that of obtaining trained engineering help to make surveys, plans, preliminary investigations and the inspection of work in progress. There is a distinct shortage of young engineers which cannot be very well overcome except through the slow process of techni' al education, for modern road work cannot be “picked up”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The salaries paid to men in various engineering positions are: chief engineer in charge of all work, $8,000 to $15,000; engineer of construction, and engineer of maintenance, $6,000 to $10,000 each; engineer of bridges, $5,000 to $8,000; office engineer, $5,000 to $8,000; engineer of tests, $4,000 to $7,000; district engineer, $5,000 to $8,000; advisory engineer to the chief engineer, $5,000 to $10,000; first assistant engineers, $3,600 to $5,000; assistant engineers, $2,400 to $4,000; chief chemist, $3,500 to $5,000;</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">1</span><span class="font8"> assistant chemists, $2,000 to $4,000. The inspection service calls for technically educated men earning $2,400 to $4,000; and there are many junior engineers and assistants getting $1,800 to $2,400. This schedule gives some idea of the number of trained men in a large road project. With the scarcity of such men the sal-; cues paid are likely to rise above these figures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">■ Another factor in the problem is that of obtaining the materials of construction. To F date there has been a hit-or-miss way of getting materials, which is bound to cause a scarcity during 1920, and hamper the carrying out of j the ambitious project for the year. Rumors are current of combinations of material-men to corner all available sup; iies and to carve out as large a slice as possible of the $633,000,000 appropriation. ‘‘The profiteer ye have always with you.&quot; Among the supplies is an enormous quantity of cement, on which the public has to pay hundreds of dollars per mile to dealers who under a manufacturer's agreement never handle or even see the cement used on the roads built.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It would be a visionary theorist that would imagine that the 1920 program could be carried out in.entirety with the present inefficient and inadequate car service. Where materials are to be carried a long distance by rail, they should be gathered in huge amounts at numerous supply depots; for when the busy season begins, railroad cars have to be diverted from such materials as those for road building. This difficulty alone has caused the highways for years back to bo strewn &quot;with the financial wrecks of contracting concerns that could not get supplies, were held up in their work while expenses ran on, and were finally forced into bankruptcy, on account of lack of transportation facilities for their materials. The comment of President A. R. Hirst of the American Association of State Highway Officials, is, “We must interest ourselves in this railroad problem, because we can never build our roads, unless this American ‘sleeping beauty’, our railroad system, is given an injection of dynamite, and made to live.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">But, for the highway engineer, the labor problem never sleeps. Men are scarce, when there is an estimated shortage of 2,000,000 common laborers. If different road projects or different states bid against .one another, up goes the wage of the laborer, and no more roads are built than before, for there are only so many workers for all the roads.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">An important feature in modern road construction is the re-location of roads. The tendency has been to build along old roads; but now, when the roads are to be permanently located, they are being laid out with a view to the most efficient sendee both of today and of posterity. Sometimes the following of an old line over a hill preserves a grade that destroys the value of a section of miles of road. In road making the old order is passing and the new is already here. Roads are now built for the Golden Age.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The staggering cost of $20,000 to $30,000 a mile on roads that wear out in ten years or so unless properly maintained, has given pause to many that see roads financed with bonds running longer than the ten to twenty years’ life of the mechanism. Road bonds have been issued to run as long as 50 years, but the present sensible tendency is to have them run not over 15 years, and not saddle the cost of a dead horse upon two generations to come after the roads have worn out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">When our fathers were boys it was considered dishonest to contract debts, private or public, beyond ability to pay in reasonable time. Again there is a tendency to limit debts, but only because of the results of public extravagance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The movement now in full tide will begin </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font8">system of transportation by truck that in time </span><span class="font8" style="text-decoration:underline;">shall</span><span class="font8"> gridiron the world. The Good Book, too, speaks of a system of highways that shall be of benefit to every one, and constitute an integral part of the work of the Golden Age. “And an— highway shall be there, and a way, and it shall be called, The way of holiness; the unclean [morally] shall not pass [all the way] over it; but it shall be [built] for those [made for the unclean, that they may progress up to goodness, when they shall be no longer unclean]; the wayfaring men [anyone going over the road] though fools [thoughtless persons] shall not err therein.” This is explained in plain words as follows: “The highway of the righteous is to depart from evil”. (Proverbs 16:17) Continuing, the Good Book adds. “No lion [the devil tempting men to err] shall be there; it shall not be found there; but the redeemed [Christ redeemed all men] shall walk there; and the ransomed [Christ gave himself &quot;a ransom for all”] of the Lord shall return [from sin aiid death], and come to Zion [to the true, heartfc-lr worship of God], with songs and everlasting joy upon their heads; they shall obtain joy and gladness, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away [forever]”. (Isaiah 35:8-10) Thus shall humanity depart from evil and come to God during the Golden Ago.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">RECENT examples of the serving of alcoholic substitutes is evidence of evil as well as good in present efforts to banish hard drink from the earth. Prohibition has its dark side as well as its bright side. Its reactions are such as follow extreme positions on any subject.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">We remember the arguments of certain sects who refuse to eat pork and other meats. They argue that Christ sent all the devils into the swine and hence that act puts a ban on pigs to the last ditch. They forget, that the Lord partook of lamb, fish and possibly other forms of flesh upon occasion, and that the Apostle counseled other Christians to eat what is set before them asking no questions for consciences’ sake, but to be thankful.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Now comes upon the scene a new class of reformers that has gone from hogs to pie crust, lard and other fats which generally enter a modern kitchen, and that denounces the brewing of harmless effervescent beverages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">By way of description of the “nip” of these effervesced waters let me tell a story I heard the other day. Sambo and Rastus were looking in at a drug store window exhibiting an array of sprudcl waters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Ever taste that, Sambo?” asked Rastus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Yaas, indeed!” responded Sambo.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Bow’d it done feel?” inquired Rastus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“I can’t ’zackly ’splain, but hits about like when yer foot’s asleep,” was the laconic reply.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Even common coffee is on the carpet now as an enemy of man, and some would wish its service curtailed by license, notwithstanding the fact that, certain poisons are requisite to offset other poisonscompound'vl in naturc’slaboratory. In these extreme positions we can see the need of reason and sense coming to the front, otherwise insanity may be enthroned as an angel of light. Such inconsistencies of an intemperate prohibition would make the cure worse Ilian was the disease.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">That great logician, St. Paul, argues to the effect that we are to ‘•let no man therefore judge [rule] you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of an holy day, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath days”. (Colossians 2:16) Moreover, he counseled young Timothy, “Drink no longer water, but use a little wine for thy stomach’s sake and thine often infirmities”.—1 Tim. 5: 23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The same principle is observable in the Master’s reproof of the Pharisees:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites ! for ye pay tithe of mint, anise and cummin, and have omitted the weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy and faith: these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the others undone.- Ye blind guides, which strain at a gnat and swallow a camel. Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye make clean the outside of the cup and of the platter, but within they are full of extortion and of excess. Thou blind Pharisee, cleanse first that which is within the cup and platter, that the outside of them may be clean also. Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are like unto whited sepulchres, which indeed appear beautiful outward, but are within full of dead men’s bones, and of all uncleanness. Even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men, but within ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity. Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because ye build the tombs of the prophets, and garnish the sepulchres of the righteous, and say, If we had been in the days of our fathers, we would not have been per-takers with them in the blood of the prophets. Wherefore ye be witnesses unto yourselves, that ye are the children of them which killed the prophets. Fill ye up then the measure of your fathers. Ye serpents, ye generation of vipers.” —Matthew 23:23-33.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In view of the foregoing we must concede that climatic conditions have to do with fermentation and that the old saying “One man’s meat is another man’s poison” is true. We must also agree that moderation serves as the best equilibrant in all questions of public interest. “Words” and not “eats” or &quot;drinks” will be the criterion of character in the age to come (Luke 6:45), the age when “the desert shall rejoice and blossom as the rose” and when “the fields shall yield their increase”.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark21"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark22"></a>Power Prospects</span></h4>
<p><span class="font13">T</span><span class="font8">HE present status of the power situation throughout die world is that outside of man and beast power there are four primary sources of power—water, coal, oil, and gas. The application of the power obtained is made through the agency of steam, or electricity, or directly; for example, power from coal is usable only by heating water into steam which in turn moves machinery or rotates electrical machinery from which electricity turns motors to operate machinery. There are no other sources of power of commercial importance, though some of these are used to a very small extent. In the pursuit of new sources many keen minds are reaching out and heard of occasionally through the press.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The chief source of power is coal. The earth contains a fixed amount of coal and careful estimates have been made of how long the output of the black diamond can be relied upon. • Power is the index of civilization, and wherever power is to be had thither will the march of empire trend. Regions where coal has‘been abundant and in which great cities, teeming with industry, have sprung up, are destined to decay as power becomes dearer; for new industries are located in them, and old ones migrate to cheap-power places.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Ignoring the power situation in the rest of the world, that in the United States begins to present the phenomena attendant upon the local exhaustion of temporary sources of power. As the great Pennsylvania beds of coal are mined out and the price of coal in the E'ast doubles and trebles, manufacturing is bound to leave the East and locate in the midst of the larger and more lasting coal fields of the South and Middle West Even if there should be “a revolution in the use of coal”, the migration of industry would only be postponed; ultimately the remnants of Eastern coal would be reserved for the public utilities, such as gas, electric light, and electric railways. This signifies the final passing of industrial supremacy from such states as Pennsylvania, New York, Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island, which are destined to sink economically to the plane ot states like Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont, except in water-power localities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">According to the State Geologist of Pennsylvania, in the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Electrical World,</span><span class="font8"> the future of manufacturing, being determined by the price of power, the coming locations of industry are indicated by the Government prices of coal as follows, all of which are lower than Pennsylvania prices: Ohio, $2 to $3.75; Kentucky, $1.95 to $3.55; Illinois, $1.95 to $2.65. Wherever the cheap coals are, expressed in terms of power obtainable per dollar’s worth of coal, industry will go. and population will build up about the mills and factories.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The United States has about three and one-half trillion tons of coal, of which two trillions are inferior because of the presence of an excessive amount of water. Of the one and one-half trillions remaining a great proportion represents inferior coals, the better portion having been already dug. Industry is using half a billion a year. At this rate the coal would seem to be likely to last some 3000 years. But the rate of use of bituminous has jumped many fold in recent decades. If it should yet increase ten times, the available good coals would last some 300 years, but with the almost unimaginable population of the Golden Age it might multiply five times more, in which event the exhaustion of the better coals would be a matter of less than a century after the consumption had reached the ultimate figure. The Pennsylvania soft coals, with no increase in rate of use, are expected to see exhaustion in thirty-five years. The fine coals of the Pocahontas fields of Virginia and West Virginia are good for ninety years. Some of the anthracite beds are destined to be worked out in ten to twenty years, after which localities and cities now prosperous will begin to be abandoned. It will, of course, be a gradual process, for as the limits are approached, the cost of production will rise and cheaper coals be used. But the end of prosperity for certain regions is unavoidable, so far as coal is concerned. How fast the country’s coal is going is seen by the ton production:</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">The streams of the United States in their v.-aterialls and rapids possess a latent water power of 320,000.000 horse power, an amount vastly greater than the 30.000,000 horse power of all the country’s stationary steam, steam and gas engines and water power plants; but most of this could not he utilized economically, and the net available horse power from water is estimated at nine times that of all the power plants in use—steam, water and gas. It is estimated that about 270,000,000 is the available horse power from the streams.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is urged that this ’'white coal” be developed rapidly, but its advocates forget that this would only bring a re-location of industry the sooner, for only a third of the water power is in the industrial section. They also forget that per unit of power, the construction of a water-power plant calls for a much larger investment than that of a steam plant, partly because no plant is economical unless it is pn a very large scale. The Central states have little water power, but that of the South totals 4.000,000 horsepower, the Far West 16,000,000 and the Pacific Coast 23,000,000. On a waterpower basis the natural re-location of industry would be in the states now having the least population; but this question of population would correct itself as power was made available, for the inevitable flow of industry is toward the regions having the most and the cheapest power, a condition that speaks volumes </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">for</span><span class="font8"> the coming density of the population of states now but sparsely inhabited.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is when speaking of electric power </span><span class="font8" style="text-decoration:underline;">tha</span><span class="font8">t the imagination of the people begins to soar. But electricity is not in itself a source of power, hut a product of one of the primary sources, and its coming use depends upon coal and water, without which there can be little electricity. for there is now no commercial method of obtaining it otherwise. There is, however, an ambitious plan for the mobilizing of the electric resources of the country into a national system composed of great groups of power-producing regions. The proposed districts are, New England, Eastern Pennsylvania, New Jersey, &quot;Western Pennsylvania, Eastern Ohio, and the Southern States. The plan is to favor the large plants—financed by Wall Street, of course —eliruinate the smaller plants, connect all parts ot a region with long-distance transmission lines of 110,000 to ] 32,000 voltage, and interconnect the groups in the same manner, as far a&lt; practicable. &quot;it is of vital importance&quot;, says the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Electrical World, ‘Tor</span><span class="font8"> conservation of resources, for economy of production and for general industrial efficiency that the bulk of the power used should be made by central systems as against isolated plants; therefore let us try to get our lawmakers and public executives, national, state, and municipal, to take the Government point of view; in other words, to </span><span class="font8" style="text-decoration:underline;">think</span><span class="font8"> in terms of war, which are also terms of peace from a Governmental standpoint, and uniformly and ratio</span><span class="font8" style="text-decoration:underline;">na</span><span class="font8">lly to encourage central power development, provide for a just return to capital in electric power business and grant monopolies under regulations that will foster coordination and interstate operations”. In plain words, “No more little electrical enterprises”, but a Government monopoly for the big ones now-existing and a gradual but sure extermination of the little fish by the big ones. Thus is the electrical tr</span><span class="font8" style="text-decoration:underline;">ansmis</span><span class="font8">sion of power to be managed for the best interests of the people, if it is for their interest to have power at a slightly lower rate on condition of it being in the hands of what will amount to a Government-favored monopoly of </span><span class="font8" style="text-decoration:underline;">this</span><span class="font8"> important power.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Of the other sources of power the most used is oil, in the form of crude oil, kerosene, or gasoline. Oil fields are of temporary productiveness, are quickly </span><span class="font8" style="text-decoration:underline;">exhau</span><span class="font8">sted, and must be replaced by the discovery of new fields. It is questionable, in a long view of the power situation, how much dependence can be placed on oil. The </span><span class="font8" style="text-decoration:underline;">Am</span><span class="font8">p-ri erm fields are already drained nearly dry or showing signs of early exhaustion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Alcohol appears to be destined to an increasing use as a source of power, but its cost keeps it out of the field until gasoline rises to a point to a</span><span class="font8" style="text-decoration:underline;">dmi</span><span class="font8">t of competition. A new method of ge</span><span class="font8" style="text-decoration:underline;">ttin</span><span class="font8">g power from coal is to pump live steam and air down to a seam of coal, with the expectation that the combination will produce a combustible gas which can be utilized.

BarMorn </span><span class="font8">NEVER m the history of the human race have we been borne along on such a tide as now. A focal concentration of events, changes, and consummations is projecting us at an amazing speed in a current that cannot be accounted for by any theory of evolution cr development. It is a psychological phenomenon —a stupendous climax.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The events and results of the-war, the destruction of a large part of the social, Wulitical, religious, financial and economic world, in addition to the great loss of human life, diverted our attention for the time from other events and results of equal significance, if not of equal importance. Une of these problems is the economic revolution in transportation that was in process of solution when the war commenced; and it continues with even greater impetus to hold the attention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is only seventy-five years since the six-horse team was the largest unit in land transportation, and the locomotive was then at the same stage of development that the flying machine is now; in fact the latter has far greater possibilities than the former ever had, because no grading or road-bed is needed. The initial cost of the machine is not a tenth of that of the locomotive or coach. The flying machine is not confined to any fixed course or road or altitude; it covers both land and water without transshipment of load; its friction is reduced to a minimum, and its attainable speed is fourfold that of the locomotive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">According to the New York </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Sim</span><span class="font8"> Major Reed Landis, second American ace, holds that aerial passengers can be carried from New York to Chicago in eight hours for $37.52, at a profit of 50C3 for the carrier. The eight-hour schedule is ten hours less than any paying passenger ever bridged the distance before. Major Landis makes his calculations of profit on the basis of $18.76 as the actual cost of the trip. The type of planes Major Landis recommends for the service would carry twenty-five passengers and make one trip a day. If there is an error in his figures, the Major says, it is in overestimation of the cost</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">As soon as steam transportation on land by steam power became general and stabilized, its economic value began to be threatened by the electric trolley; and as soon as the use of the trolley car became general and stabilized, its economic value began to bo threatened by the explosive motor, the auto car and auto truck; and now the flying macliine threatens the economic value of them all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Is it not inevitable that a large part of the millions of freight and passenger cars and locomotives, besides the rails, will be valued only as old junk, and the largest part of the stations be used for other purposes than designed by the builders?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Already the stocks and bonds of most of the railroads and trolley lines have ceased to pay dividends and interest. May not the holders of large blocks of them be preparing to unload on the inexperienced public or to unload the junk on the Government? May we .not see them favoring Government ownership ere long?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">If fares or freights are raised to produce more income, it will only speed up auto bus, truck and flying machine construction, and result in fewer passengers and less freight except for long hauls.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Still another feature in the economic revolution threatens to add many billions to the loss of hundreds of billions by war and by the scrapping of the railroads. It is only a relatively few years since the wires of the telegraph systems were first strung like a net over the earth and under the ocean, at the cost of billions. Soon the telephone began to threaten the economic value of the telegraph and the latter ceased to pay dividends, and now the latest discoveries in the wireless system threatens to send all the wires of both the telegraph and the telephone companies to the scrap heap, as the cost of the new system is negligible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The foregoing is an illustration of the fundamental changes going on in every department of human life and activity; there is not a single exception; it is an astounding phenomenon. Only six years ago the great Russian, German and Austrian governments towered with mighty power, as firm apparently as the Rocky Mountains: now they have entirely disappeared from the political landscape; they are leveled to the plain. The great religious systems are no exception. The Methodist church reports the greatest loss of membership in 150 years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">All this, however, can be accounted for by the fact, which every one admits, that the h</span><span class="font8" style="text-decoration:underline;">uman </span><span class="font8">race has been living under a social, political, religious and economic system that was defective. We must submit to the compelling proof that the over-ruling divine power is now </span><span class="font8" style="text-decoration:underline;">fairin</span><span class="font8">g direct control of human affairs and gradually substituting for the old defective system a better one—that of the Golden Age.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">England’* New Advantage</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">World War, few Americans will begrudge her the great advantage which she now enjoys in the markets of the world because of the carnival of high prices in the United States, and the high rates of exchange. Few countries can afford to import anything from the United States, at present prevailing prices, but they can afford to import from Britain, because the British prices for things are away down below the American level. Britain cannot afford to buy from America in large quantities when she ean get but $3.34 for her pound that is normally worth $4.86G|, but she can afford to buy in large quantities from the poverty-stricken countries about her and they are glad to sell to her.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">As the situation stands, it is greatly to the benefit of Britain to buy from other countries and to sell to the United States; and there is no doubt that in the near future immense quantities of European goods, bought by Britain at low prices, will bo flooding the American markets. And when that happens prices here will come down with a bang, and those that have saved nothing out of their war profits will be caught in the pinch.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">There are many truly patriotic men who believe that it would be best at this juncture to raise interest rates to 10% so as to compel the people to save something. But if that is done the thousands who have invested their savings in high-grade railroad 4% to 44% bonds will naturally feel that their investment in those bonds was a poor bargain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The financial condition of the world reminds us of the words of the Psalmist, “All the foundations of the earth are out of course'<sup>-</sup> In the same connection he gives some very excellent advice to earth's rulers at the present time. It should be remembered in reading the psalm in question that the word “gods&quot; means “mighty ones” and is used in the Scriptures not only respecting Jehovah but also respecting the mighty ones of earth. See Psalm 82:1 - 5.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">T</span><span class="font8">HE influence of liberty in America has been a potent factor in breaking the shackles of serfdom throughout the world. The practical illustration of people governing themselves so successfully, so prosperously, excited the admiration and envy of their relatives and friends in every part of Europe, and led to the concession of greater liberties everywhere. Still better times for this country and for all the world are ahead, in the better day, the Golden Age, foretold by the mouth of all the holy prophets since the world began. “In his days [Christ’s days] s</span><span class="font8" style="text-decoration:underline;">ha.ll</span><span class="font8"> the righteous flourish; and abundance of peace so long as the moon endureth.”—Psalm 72:7; Isaiah 9:7.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">Here and there some one appears with claims to have developed, or to be on the track of, revolutionary ideas pertaining to the development of power. These cl</span><span class="font8" style="text-decoration:underline;">aims</span><span class="font8"> seldom amount to anything, but a recital of them is useful as an index of the extent to which inventive minds are reaching out for the better and as yet unknown sources of power of the future, which some one is bound to discover in due time; for the Golden Age will be characterized by agencies and methods beside which those of today will appear like the crudities of ancient history. That such </span><span class="font8" style="text-decoration:underline;">thin</span><span class="font8">gs are coming and are in the mind of the good Father is evident, and that he has a due time for suggesting the ideas to the minds of men appears from the fact that some important inventions of the past were foreknown and even the </span><span class="font8" style="text-decoration:underline;">tim</span><span class="font8">e of their appearance indicated.

<h4><a name="bookmark29"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark30"></a>Justice and Ute Pool</span></h4>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Fiieedom and equality of justice—Freedom and equality of justice are twin fundamental conceptions of American jurisprudence. Together they form the basic principle on which our entire plan for the administration of justice is built. They are so deep-rooted in the body and spirit of our laws that the very meaning which we ascribe to the word justice embraces them. A system which created class distinctions, having one law for the rich and another for the poor, which was a respecter of persons, granting its protection to one citizen and denying it to his fellow, we would unhesitatingly condemn as unjust, as devoid of those essentials without which there can be no justice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">From the dawn of Anglo-Saxon legal history, Illis idea has been manifest. The earliest laws continually directed that justice be done alike to rich and poor. The equal right to law was asserted in the Charter of Liberties of Henry IL The idea received its classic embodiment and statement in the fortieth paragraph of Magna Charta, wherein was inscribed, “We will sell to no one, deny to no one, or make a difference in, either right or justice”. This did not signify, or inaugurate, an era of absolute freedom of justice, but it was a first stop in that direction. Its supreme importance, however, lies in the tradition which gradually attached to it, and which glorified the idea into an ideal— an ideal which steadily persisted in men's minds throughout five centuries, and which was brought by the colonists to the New World.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">I11 the constitutional conventions which followed the </span><span class="font8" style="text-decoration:underline;">Am</span><span class="font8">erican Revolution the ideal was given concrete expression in the various State Bills and Declarations of Rights. The Massachusetts Constitution, adopted in 1780, declared: “Every subject of the Commonwealth ought to find a certain remedy, by having recourse to the laws, for all injuries or wrongs which he may receive in Ids person, property, or character. He ought to obtain right and justice freely, and without being obliged to purchase it; completely, and without any denial; promptly, and without delay; conformably to the laws.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">As state after state has been added to the Union, its people, in constitutional assembly, have written the same declaration into their fundamental law. In New York the declaration is contained in a statute, but this is exceptional. Today, the constitution of nearly every state, by express provision of the Bill of Rights, guarantees the freedom and equality of justice. The Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of (he United States adds to the state guaranty the authority of the supreme law of the land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">As a matter of law, the right stands inviolable. It is recognized and established by the highest possible authority. But that is not all. Its incorporation into the Bills </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font8">Rights transformed the principle from merely a legal or juristic conception to a political consideration of supreme importance. Not only was the right to freedom and equality </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">of justice set </span><span class="font8">apart with those other cardinal rights of liberty and of conscience which were deemed </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">sacred </span><span class="font8">and inalienable, but it was made the most important of all because on it all the other rights, even the rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, were made to depend. In a word, it became the cornerstone of the Republic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Ours was designed to be and is a government of laws and not of men. Under a government so constituted the right of the individual to life, to freedom of motion, of thought, of conscience, to his children, to his home, and the social interest in securing these things to human beings—all depend, in the last resort, entirely and absolutely on Jaw. This is recognized by our constitutions, and has been repeatedly emphasized by decisions of courts, in the speeches of statesmen, and in treatises on government. The New Hampshire constitution, which is typical, thus expresses it: “It is essential to the preservation of the rights of every individual, his life, liberty, property, and character, that there be an impartial interpretation of the laws and administration of justice”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">To secure impartial laws and an equal administration of justice, and thereby to make possible the enjoyment of the rights and opportunities contemplated by a democracy, the state itself exists. The best welfare and the greatest</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font8">possible happiness of the men, women and children of the nation is the ultimate goal. The state is their servant and its government the </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">I</span><span class="font8"> means by which the end can best be obtained.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">, Concerning these fundamentals there is no : ‘ dispute, at least within </span><span class="font8" style="text-decoration:underline;">Am</span><span class="font8">erica. Their extended statement here would be superfluous but for the fact that, although the dependency of every right and interest on law is recognized, the consequences which inevitably flow from such a form of government seem not to be generally appreciated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These consequences, summarily stated, are:—</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">j First, there can be no political, social, or economic equality, no democracy, unless the substantive law by fair and equitable rules gives * reality to equality by making it a living thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Second, the substantive law, however fair and equitable itself, is impotent to provide the nec-f .essary safeguards unless the administration of ? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;justice, which alone gives effect and force to</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;substantive law, is in the highest sense impar-</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">* tial. It must lie possible for the humblest to invoke the protection of the law, through prope r proceedings in the courts for any invasion of his rights by whosoever attempted, or free-dom and equality vanish into nothingness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">I</span><span class="font8"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To withold the equal protection of the laws,</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">£ or to fail to carry out their intent by reason J of inadequate machinery, is to undermine the entire structure, and threaten it with collapse. For the state to erect an uneven, partial administration of justice is to abnegate the very responsibility for which it exists, and is to accomplish by indirection an abridgement of the fundamental rights which the state is directly forbidden to infringe. To deny law or justice ' to any persons is, in actual effect, to outlaw them by stripping them of their only protection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is for such reasons that freedom and equality of justice are essential to a democracy and that denial of justice is the short cut to anarchy.</span></p>

If the</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font8">nations which became Christian in name had really been so in deed, would they have been in the condition they are today?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">For instance, suppose Napoleon, instead of overrunning Southern Europe and trying to conquer Russia, had said, &quot;My people need more room; you have large tracts you are not occupying; let us develop some of it&quot;; and Russia had replied, &quot;Very well, as we are one great family we will appoint a co</span><span class="font8" style="text-decoration:underline;">mmi</span><span class="font8">ssion to consider how much you need and how much we can spare.’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It may be said that this is impractical and eould not be done. It has been done once, and once only, to my knowledge, in the history of the world. It w’as done in our own land of the sheltering wings, where so many of the persecuted of the earth fled for refuge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The noble work was done so quietly, and the world at present is so prone to think that great deeds must be accompanied by great noise and flourish, that the name of the statesman who did the deed is not often mentioned among the great men of our country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Though high in station, like Moses, he &quot;chose rather to suffer affliction with the people of God than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season”. Using his influence with the king, he obtained a grant of land in the new world, that he might lead his people where they could worship God unmolested.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In a primitive country, among savages, he founded a state without bloodshed. He said to the Indians, &quot;We are all one flesh and blood. Being brethren, no advantage shall be taken on either side. When disputes arise we will_gettle them in council Between us there shall be nothing but openness and love.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The chiefs replied, ‘'While the rivers run and the sun shines we will live in peace with the children of William Penn”, and according to the historian, &quot;the treaty was sacredly kept”. While the other colonies were in constant fear of Indian raids, Pennsylvania had peace throughout her borders.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The historian adds, “The colonial history of the state founded by Penn is one of special -interest and pleasure. It is a narration of the victories of peace and the triumph of peaceful principles over violence and wrong.”</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark33"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark34"></a>The Great American Hen</span></h4>
<p><span class="font13">T</span><span class="font8">HE American hen is not an American;</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">she came from Asia in the first place, but she does not now look much as she did in the forests of India and China where, hens still run wild. She is several times as large and produces several times as many eggs in the course of a year as does her Asiatic sister.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The egg-laying powers of a lien are transmitted from father to daughter and not from mother to daughter, and they are transmitted from father to son, not from mother to son. In the pedigree of a hen it is all important to know that she comes of a long line of male ancestors of good egg producers. It is the rooster, not the hen, that determines whether the next generation shall be great egg producers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">When the dainty female chick steps out of her shell she has in her little body the whole number of eggs, about 650, that she will ever lay. Born in April the young hen begins laying in the Autumn and does all she will do for the world within the next two years, at the end of which time she constitutes the piece de resistance for a Sunday dinner.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The average hen produces 120 eggs per year, the extra good hen 200 eggs per year, and instances are on record where more than 300 per year have been produced. The average egg production is slowly improving. It has improved more rapidly since it was discovered that the egg-laying powers are transmitted through the males instead of the females.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The hen is a subject of perpetual study and experiment, to see how she can be made to produce the largest possible results for the amount that it costs to feed and care for her. It has been found that hens can be forced in growth and productivity by electrical baths, produced by charging the wire about their cages for a certain number of minutes in each hour. Hens thus electrically charged require less food, grow faster and produce more eggs than those which are not thus electrified.</span></p>

It is found that this also aids productivity, although sometimes the shell of the forced eggs are too thin to ship well</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">As a result of the efforts of breeders we are promised that in the near future we shall have chickens as large as turkeys and that they will lay eggs in proportion to their size, and in large numbers.

Now the Easterners are beginning to get their eyes opened to .the advantage of this method.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is now getting pretty generally noised around among Eastern farmers that any poor piece of land can be turned into a fertile and profitable area in a very short time by the inexpensive and practical method of sowing it to inoculated legumes such as hairy vetch or soy beans. The preparations for inoculating the seeds can be obtained at any seed warehouse, and cost but the merest trifle. The hairy vetch can be sown with rye. The soy beans make a valuable crop of hay aside from the worth of the seed beans obtained.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Following a stand of vetch and rye, clover will do excellently where before it would hardly grow at all, and wheat will follow soy beans with a crop that would have been impossible but for the previous planting of soy beans. The planting of legumes cannot be made a success without the inoculation.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">T</span><span class="font8">HERE is no prospect that this year will have no summer, but there was such a year a century ago.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In 1816 sunspots were at a maximum, a condition which is liable to reduce the earth's average temperature a degree or two, and it was a very cold year—one of a cluster of cool years —including the dates 1812 to 1816.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The year started with a mild January and February. March turned cool, April began warm, but toward the end saw the northern states hard with ice and snow. May had ice an inch thick, and plantings of seeds were repeatedly destroyed by the cold. June supplied ice on streams and ponds, and snow running to ten inches in Vermont, killing nearly every green thing. The month saw little rain, and a few warm days, but most of the time had “a fiercely cold wind from the north”. Farmers wore overcoats and mittens. One farmer built roaring fires around his corn field and saved the crop. Fears were entertained that the sun was cooling off. “Picnics were strictly prohibited.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">July gave America frost and ice and killed all the corn except the little planted in ven' protected places. In August brooks and ponds began to be covered with ice, and seed corn ran up to $5 a bushel. September had a fortnight of the year's pleasantest weather, but experienced ice an inch thick. Very cold weather ruled in October and November. December was described as “comfortable,&quot; and the winter was mild. Europe suffered from cold throughout the year, and in 1817 England saw bread riots on account of the crop failure of “the year without a summer,” for all through that twelve months “the suns rays seemed to be destitute of heat; all nature was clad in sable hue, and men exhibited no little anxiety concerning the future of this life.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Sunspots were unusually plentiful and large in 1919, but that is no indication that 1920 will have them and be a cold year. If the “year without a summer&quot; should come again, and the total crop failure of 1 SIG with S,000,000 population be repeated, the condition of the country would be indescribable with a population of over a hundred million! Whether it is to come through a cold season or through short acreage of planting by discouraged farmers, the Bible indicates tiiat just before the inauguration of the Golden Age, “Great earthquakes shall be in divers [various] places, and famines [like those in Europe. Russia and India], and pestilences” [like the typhus in the War districts and the world-wide influenza]. (Luke 21:11) The same things are referred to in Revelation where mention is made of the coming downfall of a great and oppressive system prophetically termed “Babylon”-“Therefore shall her [this system’s] plagues [punishments] come in one day [probably one year], death, and mourning [for the dead] and famine.”—Revelation 18:8.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Rotary Gas Engine </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">s<sub>v</sub> j. l. Martin </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">rp </span><span class="font8">HOUS AND S of inventive geniuses have </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font8">sought to solve successfully the problem of applying compressed steam and exploding gases directly to power shaft; and millions of dollars have been spent without practical results. </span><span class="font8" style="text-decoration:underline;">A </span><span class="font8">practical rotary engine means simplicity, constant torque, lightness of weight, compactness of space, and economy of fuel and lubrication; also the minimum of trouble and repairs. Two types of steam engines built on the rotary principle are in successful use; the well-known turbine for high-speed revolutions only, and the Augustine for all speeds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In response to the demand for a satisfactory rotary gas-oil engine, Mr. B. F. Augustine of Buffalo, N. Y., has invented and successfully developed such a motor; and it seems there is nothing further left to be desired. It is the marvel of the engineers who have seen it This motor revolves with the power shaft, while the bearing shaft of the pistons remains stationary. This shaft is set eccentric to the power shaft; which causes the pistons (arranged radially) alternately to approach to and to recede from the cylindrical walls of the motor casing, which is perforated and provided with piston cylinders which protrude outwardly for air cooling.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The piston rods have three joints, corresponding to the wrist, elbow, and shoulder joints of the human arm. The exploding charge of gas forces the relaxed piston outwardly in line with centrifugal force, thus straightening out the sections of the piston rod; and by this action, leverage, or a rotary impulse is imparted to the cylinder and therefore to the motor. The fulcrum for leverage is based upon the stationary bearing shaft</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The pistons are double- acting. On the return stroke the fuel oil is pumped into the vaporizing chamber, which, being surrounded by the exhaust gases in the exhaust chamber, absorbs the waste heat in vaporising the oil. An ingenious chambered disc having suitable cut-offs transfers the oil without valves. Fuel oil enters through the hollow bearing shaft, thus cooling all bearings; and the lubricating oil pipe enters the same way discharging centrally, and being distributed by centrifugal force, thoroughly lubricates all bearing surfaces.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">This motor involves the principle of superinduction; that is, there is alwa'ys a 50% overcharge of unexploded gas left for instant delivery. This is important in starting the motor; and in aeroplane service will enable pilots to ascend to greater altitudes than with other motors of equal power; for all motors lose efficiency in proportion to height owing to decreasing air pressure on fuel oil which drives it into the vacuum created by the pumps.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Motorists experience trouble by an accumulation of carbon in the combustion chamber, owing to imperfect scavenging. From 30% to 50% of burnt gases and smoke remain and to that extent dilute the inflowing fresh gas and dilute the efficiency of the charge. In the Augustine motor all the waste products of combustion are expelled and the scavenging is 100%, leaving a clean spark plug.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">All vehicles carrying gas motors are built very strong, to endure the constant vibration imparted by the reciprocating type of motors. In the rotary type there is no vibration; this -will permit the use of lighter vehicles and add to the comfort of motorists.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">This motor is economical with oil. A run of 137 miles has been made with an automobile with the consumption of but one quart of oil Both gasoline and kerosene are used at &quot;will. Practically no heat is wasted. The exhaust, outlet is never hot Other motors heat when cooling by water.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Augustine motor can be built with from one-half to one-fourth of the amount of material entering into the construction of reciprocating motors of equal horse power. It can be built with four to twelve cylinders, with only one ignition wire per set of cylinders. One type is being made so that two charges of gas are exploded simultaneously on opposite sides, thus balancing the strain. Since engine trouble has caused the death of many aeroplane pilots, it is expected that this wonderfully simple and efficient motor will prove to be a means of safety.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Other advantages are: weight, three pounds per horse power; less than one-fourth the parts</span></p>

One is that no one „ takes the trouble to check up the answers and that any string of figures is enough to satisfy the hearers. Perhaps some readers may wish to cheek up the answers and see if they arc correct. Another explanation is that such prodigies do these wonders, not by the power of their own minds, but that they are possessed by an evil spirit that has the higher powers of the spirit plane and can give the prodigy a vision of the answer at once.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">OT a bug made of iron, but one that makes iron. For the latest scientific statement is that iron ore beds are accumulated by bacteria having the power of extracting iron from their environment and leaving it in masses after their demise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Iron is an essential constituent of many if not all living creatures. It is indispensable in h</span><span class="font8" style="text-decoration:underline;">uma</span><span class="font8">n blood, and in that of all red-blooded animals.

It is necessary’ in certain processes in the life of plants; for without it plants could have none of their characteristic green color.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is not strange, then, that it should be found that deposits of iron trace their origin to bacteria. Millions of the “iron bugs” lived and died to make one little piece of ore, and uncounted billions existed to produce the great ore beds. This was part of the provision that our Father made in preparing the earth so that it might be a good place for people to live on. “My God </span><span class="font8" style="text-decoration:underline;">shnJLsp</span><span class="font8">pply all your need” (Philippians 4:19), may truthfully be said of the arrangements made for all humanity, whether it be iron, or the other things that man requires.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">I</span><span class="font8">F THREE primary colors are combined in equal strengths the result is a neutral gray. But ii one color predominates and the other two are about equally subservient, a grayed value 01 the strongest color will be produced.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">When yellow is dominant, and red and blue about equal to each other, we have sage or, more lucidly speaking, gray yellow. If red is the strongest, and blue and yellow subordinate, the product is plum, or gray red. Blue in strongest value, and yellow and red each weaker, will give gray blue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">These grayed, or complex colors, with their almost endless ramifications, due to varying proportions, give us the most lasting pleasures of anything which the eye can sense. All greens in nature </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">have red in </span><span class="font8">them, all red's have some measure of green, all </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">blues are </span><span class="font8">grayed with some orange, and practically all vio-lets have just a tinge of yellow, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>£</sup></span></p>

The more gray a color becomes, the more complex the nervous effort to sense it: the more, therefore, it appeals to the intellect, to reason and the powers of comparison.

<p><span class="font8">Perhaps no more happy example of tertiary coloring could be cited than .Munkacsy's ‘ The Blind Milton Dictating Paradise Lost to His Daughters”, a large canvas which bangs in the galleries of the Lenox Library in New York. Not a single primary and not a pure secondary occur anywhere in the painting. All is in most felicitous keeping with the sublime character of the subject. One can almost feel the grand strophes and the &quot;no mean heights&quot; of that exalted work of poetry just, by looking a t tho painter’s work. There is also anotlvr small canvas in the same gallery, picturinsr a Venetian scene, in which a single touch of orange Is the nearest approach to elementary color.</span></p>

Behind these circles, in a good state of preservation, are the finest specimens of art ever produced in glass, mosaic, etc., by Byzantine artists.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">These hidden mosaics are formed of small pieces of glass of various colors kept in place with cement.

Whole walls and vaults are covered wdth these mosaics; and when they are lit up writh the light of the sun or of hundreds of lamps, the effect is one of indescribable beauty.

<p><span class="font8">The wretchedness and poverty of these—shall ■ we say human beings—was indescribable; and their poor, naked, starved, disease-racked bod-, ies were far removed from those of the plump, well-fed, richly attired sight-seers, permitted to approach within a few feet of their village.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">They were unable to work at a gainful occupation, because no one would touch a thing which had been touched by them. They refused to accept money, as they could not spend it for food. Only something they could use would be accepted. The local custom permitted them to visit the city each Friday afternoon to beg for food; and even here they must stay in the roadway of the streets, that no one might be contaminated. Their cry still rings in our ears; that cry for food, which was never wholly satisfied.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Bible tells of many persons afflicted with this dreadful, loathsome disease, which well represents sin, and which may never be cured until the Golden Age brings its blessings, destroying suffering of all kinds. The curing of the sin-leprosy of humanity is illustrated in the experiences of the heathen general Naaman (2 Kings 5:1-14) of whom it is recorded that he was a leper, but was cleansed by obedience to the Word of God—dipping </span><span class="font8" style="text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font8">self seven times in the river- Jordan.</span></p>

Halmci </span><span class="font8">ANYTHING that will safeguard the health ■ from, the ravages of disease should be “ sought and used with all diligence. Health and strength is a precious possession that all should । desire and seek to obtain, and having obtained . it, they should use the spirit of a sound mind and so apply the laws of health in their daily living as to improve and increase their strength - and vigor; for by so doing their efficiency is <sup>;</sup> greater, no matter what their occupations may be. Any knowledge we may obtain on the sub-</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">I ject should be used to that end.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The world is full of prematurely aged people, broken down, worn out, suffering from inalnu-, trition, the result of the denaturing and emasculating of the foods which a wise Creator provides for the human family to live on. In the ' excessive use of refined foods men break down nature’s defence against those great enemies of the human body, diabetes, tuberculosis, anaemia, / pneumonia, and heart disease. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>;</sup> The great Creator designed that the diet of . man and beast should contain not only the so-callod essentials of protein, fat and carbohydrates, but also the salts and solubles, sometimes designated as vitamines, as well as the succulents and roughage, without all of which the ' glands do not function normally, the internal , secretions lose their natural alkalinity, immu-’ nity to disease is destroyed, vitality is ini-paired, and resistance is lowered. “Deficiency disease” is a phrase used to describe many dis' orders due to an inadequate diet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Take the case of a prospective mother: deficiency of diet undermines her state of health at । a time when she is called upon to function more vitally than ever before, not only for herself but for her unborn child. Deficiency disease not ' . only attacks the unborn child of the poorly nourished mother, but it attacks the mother herself. She is robbed of the ability to bring forth a healthy disease-resisting child, and is also * robbed of her ability to keep her own tissues and her own internal secretions in a healthy condition. She attempts to perform two duties 1 with but half the quantity and quality of material or food neccssaj-y to do one, the growthpromoting and growth-controlling attributes of the young are lost, and the mother bears her child under very unfavorable conditions. She enters the period of lactation wholly unable to comply with nature’s provision for the child. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A wise Creator has provided a diet for the human race that will furnish the material for the regeneration of tissue, with all the bio-chemic substances indispensable to the profoundly complex but'perfectly normal processes of assimilation and elimination.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In whole grains, such as wheat, corn, rye, unpolished or brown rice, the elements necessary for nourishing and maintaining a healthy condition of the body are found, especially in the wheat berry, in which there are sixteen elements identical with the elements of which the human body is composed. Pure milk contains the same elements. In skim milk all elements remain but the fat</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In the process of refining white flour eight of those elements are removed, robbing it of just half of the nourishing quality. Each element before refining is in the right proportion to work together in harmony with the others, but in the refining process some elements are concentrated and some are entirely lacking. The whole thing is a disarrangement from the condition provided by nature. The most vital parts of the grain are taken from the flour and used to feed animals, and the abnormal starch content is put on the market to feed the people. -</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Few people know that the phosphorus found in wheat, com, rice, barley and oats, which is removed from the various grains in refining them, is essential to the very life and health of the human body. In refining flour all the phosphorus compounds, iron compounds, calcium compounds, potassium compounds, and all the other mineral salts which the human system requires to carry on the chemical processes of health-building are taken away.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Today, as never before, people are asked to live on impoverished foods; impoverished grain products, impoverished breakfast foods, impoverished table syrups, impoverished fat and milk substitutes, impoverished egg substitutes, impoverished sugar, corn starch, corn oil, corn</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• syrup, potato oil, cottonseed oil, rice starch,</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">Next to tuberculosis, the most common complaint caused by refined foods is heart disease. £ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Malnutrition is a direct cause of heart disease</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">f &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are numerous records proving that</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">ment of disease is delayed accordingly. The ? significance of these records is still further em; phasized when it is considered that malnutrition is on the increase in the United States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus as we grow in knowledge concerning the</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">■ laws of nutrition, we are forced to conclude not ■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as a theory, but as a fact, that the kind, quality,</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">&lt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and quantity of food consumed by man does</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">affect his health for good or evil and does affect every member of the human family. These facts demonstrate conclusively the folly of using foods ' which do not supply the needs of the body. The facts also demonstrate the necessity of accepting from the hands of a beneficent Providence the foods just as he has provided them for man's needs, and refusing to use those which have been manipulated for commercial purposes. If we are going to have food at all, let us, if possible, have it as a wise Creator designed and provided it. .We need all the natural elements in food.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The reason why the millers go in for white flour is because they have a virtual monopoly .'j of die white Hour machinery and because white . flour will keep indefinitely. They know that <sup>1 : </sup>when the]<sup>-</sup> take out the germ all chance of .■ the flonr becoming rancid is gone, but they also -know that the removal of the germ makes the » ' flour about as nutritious as so much plaster of paris.

<h4><a name="bookmark70"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark71"></a>J« </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">It for the Benefit of the Jews?</span></h4>
<p><span class="font13">W</span><span class="font8">HEN history is written there are many things that would be a surprise to the deceased makers of history, if they should arise from their graves and read the record. For history is written, not from the viewpoint of the day when it is made nor from the viewpoint of the makers, but from the viewpoint of the age and of the progressive thinkers of the time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Before the League of Nations was even thought of, there had been other leagues of nations and leagues of kings, some of them so long ago and so buried in obscurity as to be forgotten. All of these leagues started with glowing promise of benefits for some one for some time, but after a few years operation all of them failed. Some of them left no tangible afterresults ; for they were motivated by fear or the other negative states of mind that impede allprogress in any direction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is said to be possible that the most lasting good of the League of Nations may be for the benefit of a people who are scarcely mentioned in its provisions. If at all, the Jews figure merely as one of tlie “subject” peoples, whom it is the privilege of the great nations to uplift.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">History may fully record that the League was an instrument used to permit that most ancient of all the nations, Israel, to occupy once more their native soil; to become a national entity again; to begin the visible progress toward the inheritance which will, when history is written, have become the Jews'. This ancient race is about to come into its own—a very great prospect: for when the low are made high and the high brought low, the most abased nation in the world is destined to rise to an eminence that will far more than repay them for their age-long bondage to unfavorable environments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Be that as it may, the Jews through their Zionist organizations are planning for the reoccupation of Palestine, and are going right ahead with the execution of their plans. Regardless of delay in the final determination of the status of their country, the Zionists assume that out of the womb of the League will be born the Jewish Republic. This nationality is expected to continue under the wing of the League, with quite complete autonomy and with absolute freedom from the intolerable restrictions from Turks and Europeans, which the Palestine </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Jews have </span><span class="font8">suffered for centuries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">That the tide is rising there is no doubt, and it is said that no less than a million Jews will soon go from America and Europe to live in the fatherland. By hundreds of thousands the Jews are familiarizing themselves with the climate, soil, and business environment of Palestine, so as to be ready to go to their home. So much larger is this host than the </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">existing Palestine </span><span class="font8">population—mostly Turks </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">and Arabs of a low </span><span class="font8">order of education and ability—</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">that its prepon</span><span class="font8">derance of numbers will automatically settle the social and political questions of the land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Once in a while throughout history whole peoples have suddenly been seized </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">with the </span><span class="font8">desire to move on to other lands. </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">This was illustrated </span><span class="font8">in the hordes of Goths, Vandals and </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">other Tar</span><span class="font8">tar peoples which </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">from </span><span class="font8">time </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">to time appeared </span><span class="font8">from their obscure homes and </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">swept over large </span><span class="font8">portions of Europe. Today the </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Jews are “on </span><span class="font8">the move’’. The hegira of the </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Hebrews from </span><span class="font8">Europe is about to take place, for “it </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">is a </span><span class="font8">literal fact that at the present moment </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">a large part </span><span class="font8">of the Jewish people is possessed with an irresistible impulse to strike its tents </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">and move. A </span><span class="font8">million strong, everywhere, impatient, with tense eagerness, the Jews are getting </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">ready </span><span class="font8">to sell their all. turn it into money, </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">and proceed </span><span class="font8">to abide for the rest of their lives in the homeland. They only wait the mandate of the— League of Nations, to fix their political status for such a time as may be found necessary for the Jews to firmly establish themselves.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Dr. Saalkind, of the Jewish National Council for the Ukraine, tells how the emigration fervor has struck Russia: “Many have liquidated their property and made themselves ready to go. The Zionist offices at Kiev [Russia] are thronged with hundreds inquiring as to the possibility of early migration. Committees have arrived from various communities demanding facilities for at once sending their people to Palestine. They are prepared to go en masse. There is no risk of exaggeration in assuming that several hundred thousand, perhaps a million, people are yh-VuiBigto leave T-u^sia upon first opportunity.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It if only natural that when the news arrived in Russia of (la- pr&lt;'i?pect that a Jewish state won’.I be creel in sacred old Judea, there should have ansr-n a boundless agitation for resettlement in the historic land of the Jews. At any rate, according: to Dr. Goldberg, chairman of the Zionist organization of Greater Russia, whole Jewish towns and communities have begun to make themselves ready to move as soon as communications should be opened.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">There is no inducement to remain where they are. The great war was bad enough in the trials brought upon the Jews; but under the economic pressure cf the revolution and counter-revolution, the very existence of the Jews in Russia has been undermined. Even bread to eat, to say nothing of comforts or luxuries, is endangered for three-quarters of the population of the Russian pale, by the presence of the revolution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Preparations are being made to receive the home-coming host. The Zionist organizations of the world are making preparations to furnish the necessary administrators, engineers, specialist and other experts whose great and pleasant task wiii be to make Palestine ready for the wholesale migration about to take place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">That these things should happen now surprises no one familiar with the past and the predicted future of the Jews. This nation, which has been at the bottom so far as human rights have been concerned, is destined to rise to the very top. It is confidently predicted that not merely a Jewish nationality is to be the outcome of the present trend of Judaism, but that far greater things are in store for this devoted race, who have clung loyally to their nationality, their language, and their religion under circumstances that would have crushed the spirit of any other people. Their destiny is expected to be no less than the headship of the ultimate league of nations and peoples embracing the entire world, which the Bible and Jewish tradition say will endure forever.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark72"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark73"></a>Open Doors to Spiritism</span></h4>
<p><span class="font13">T</span><span class="font8">HAT some authors, painters and composers achieve beautiful or powerful results under the influence of spi ritism is well know. There has come from the mystical Orient a world of occult lore which is inspired by evil spirits. Books based on these ideas and magazine articles with- . out number are flooding the country. Some of *. the books are among the most widely read of the past five decades. They are of a type that gives an impression of something wonderful, </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">i </span><span class="font8">or something beautiful, but vague, not clear-cut. Readers of works of this kind close the books with a sense of perplexity. The authors write as men in a fog.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">One of the first American authors of this type was Emerson. With his interesting, mentally stimulating, but vague writings, he was the fore- <sup>4 </sup>runner of many writers of works on mental science, the art of success, will power, personality, character building, self-help, psychology r of a certain type, and of the power to control and manage others. Such works often produce a flush of mental exhilaration; but this passes <sub>E </sub>away if the reader or student fails to submit his will and mind, without resistance, or criticism, to the will of the author.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">One refusing to let his mind be as putty in the writer’s hands, to give himself up to the alleged “flow of great spiritual currents”, finds it impossible to obtain the worldly benefit prom- * ised in such books. Those that make this selfsurrender may quickly find themselves in the state of a wealthy and “successful” man who says, “Any time I can lean back in my office chair, close my eyes, and see beautiful sights ' and hear entrancing music”. Such works demand of the would-be seeker for success the abject surrender of the citadel of the will; and the success that may follow is largely owing to th-' . cooperation of demons, who may at any time abandon him, and leave him to the abyss of Ids-of self-respect, of true religion, and of the ba? . presented by the demons—the good things of earth. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">On the 1920 visit of the famous Belgian poet, Maurice Maeterlinck, to America light was . thrown on the character of his writings. In a -lecture given in New York the author said, “Dur- ' ing the new year I shall write a new book. It shall be a volume dedicated to a study of the occult. I shall strive to rid spiritualism, mystic- <sub>( </sub>ism, of the charlatanism that has discredited it so long”. In other words, spiritism is to be . made attractive to the host of refined and cultured readers, whose minds have been robbed of <sup>; </sup>some measure of clear-cut discernment and judgment and prepared to receive out-and-out spiritualism by such charming but characteris- j</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19200303_files/g_E_19200303-13.png" alt="" style="width:16pt;height:260pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font8">tically vague, obscure works as “The Bluebird&quot;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In connection with Mr. Maeterlinck’s New York lecture he made it quite clear where he stood as regards the occult: “The lecturer told of the ‘odic effluvia’, ‘discovered’ by Reichenbach, the eminent Austrian scientist—‘a </span><span class="font8" style="text-decoration:underline;">ma</span><span class="font8">g-netic or vital fluid which emanates from the body even’ second, and which can be seen by hypnotic subjects in the dark, appearing bluish on the right side and yellowish red on the left, and varying in intensity with the state of the emotions in the person from whom they emanate'. This vital force, Mr. Maeterlinck held, </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">was </span><span class="font8">responsible for the phenomenon of 'table turning^ He described it as indestructible and susceptible of being infused into inanimate objects. This vital fluid, so independent of the body and impossible to destroy even by fire, might well be the spiritual principle which does not perish with us and points to immortal life.&quot; It is well for readers of the many works of this type to know surely that however beautiful such writings are, they are allied with or a part of the vast literature of the occult and the spiritualistic, and are an open door to demonism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Every five-cent </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">store</span><span class="font8"> sells booklets with the familiar question, “What Month Were You Bom In!” These belong to the dark age occult “science” of astrology, as do the &quot;horoscopes&quot; published in some newspapers, and the zodiacal signs, the data on “birth stones&quot; and other like matter in almanacs. We view all of these mat-’ ters with suspicion. The telling of character by the month of one’s birth found its origin in the worship of demons under the guise of the worship of various stars, planets and constellations named for the demon gods and goddesses of heathen religions of early history. The 360 degrees of the heavens were divided into twelve parts of thirty degrees, each containing some constellation which was worshipped as a demon deity. A person’s character was imagined to be determined by the powers of the deity of the section of the heavens rising above the horizon at the moment of birth, and to be variously influenced by the relative positions of the planets —believed to be gods—at that moment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is asserted that data has been compiled to show some truth in the claims of astrology; but an even greater mass of fact disproves the claims. There is some truth also in the claims of spiritism, but that docs not warrant the surrender of the will to evil spirits. Closely associated with this method of alleged characterdetermination is the prediction of the future by the stars, by palmistry, by cards, and by tea leaves and coffee grounds. Predictions of these kinds are nothing more than shrewd guesses, unless the prophet is a spirit medium, in which case they are the guesses of demons speaking or acting through the person of the medium^— who may even be an agreeable young society woman, unwittingly possessed of occult &quot;gifts”. The safe way is to determine upon a course of resolute resistance to every door to demonism, no matter how charming the outlook through the door; for any door to demonism is a door to destruction.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">HE great adversary hovering above the earth was joined by kindred spirits, who were seeking him and who greeted him boisterously, crying, “Hail, Lucifer, Son of the Morning!” He checked them with an angry gesture and frown. “Call me not by that name, reminding me, as it does, of ages past when I led a pure and happy existence.” Surprised at this reply from their arrogant, self-confident chief, they looked at each other in dismay, whispering, “Something must have happened to disturb his majesty&quot;, and waited in silence further enlightenment. This they presently received.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Sullenly, as if talking to himself, he began: &quot;On a little strip of land extending out into one of the great lakes have just met in convention those people whom Jehovah seems to favor; and as the waves sweep up on that shore so the mes-___ sages of truth constantly spoken by their leaders swept over their minds until at last he whom they call their President stood before them.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Satan now roused </span><span class="font8" style="text-decoration:underline;">hims</span><span class="font8">elf, and turning to his companions spoke with more energy. “You remember when the Laodicean Messenger died, and his followers quivered under the blow like a flock of frightened, sheep, we thought it would be an easy matter to overcome them. Then they chose this man as their leader. Then we succeeded in having him and his helpers thrown into prison, and since their release we have tried to thwart them in every possible way. Well, this man has conceived a plan by which he can throw broadcast among the people of the world these truths which we have tried so hard to suppress. As he stood there, outlining his plan and asking their help, those 7000 people as one man with uplifted hands and shouts of approval pledged their support; and we know to our cost how they can work.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“But, Prince”, ventured to argue one of the bolder spirits, “suppose they do scatter the truth, think how much in our favor are conditions on the earth today; how much of strife and sorrow and suffering there is, and how much more power we have than ever before.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“I am thinking”, was the reply, “I am looking back down the centuries; I see another time when conditions were favorable to us; I see another man stand as tliis one has, before a generation who laugh and sneer as he tells of the judgments of the Lord which are coming upon the earth. Did Noah’s prophecy come true*” A groan from his hearers was his only answer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">One of the quieter spirits now addressed him. “Prince, you have spoken of a happier life which of course we all shared and remember. We know that some of these truths relate to us as well as to mankind, and the hope held out to them is also offered to us if like them we will repent We are all tired of tliis existence and, as you hint, may receive some worse punishment. Why not accept the chance to' get back into harmony with Jehovah?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The majority of the spirits answered with a howl of anger, though some few of them looked thoughtful and moved toward the speaker. Satan, now in a towering rage, turned on him with fierce denunciation, ending his tirade with these words: “I know that you have already tried to aid these people, and now you and those that think as you do must leave our company forever. We purpose to think of some scheme by which we may he able to check this project of theirs, and if possible annihilate them. At any rate, know that we will never again yield allegiance to the King of heaven.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Ah,.well!” said the leader of the minority as they turned away, “The forces of good and evil are lining up for the last battle, in the closing days of this age, as they did in the last days of that other one when we were so much involved. We were on the wrong side then; let us try to be on the right side this time.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">And we of the earth family who are on the right side, what a privilege is ours! Let us. dear fellow soldiers, look to our great Captain</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark76"><span class="font8">for courage and help and. girding on the whole -</span></a></p>

<p><span class="font8">“Courage to tell the truth, the tactless truth, if need be, but the whole truth, in full propor- ‘ tion, is society’s greatest present need. Half- * knowledge and active prejudice abound; but it ; is the clear, comprehensive and uncolored truth &lt;&nbsp;that will save our time from blunders and , 5 delays. Fearless outspokenness is an apostolic quality that is needed more today than wisdom ‘ or wealth or winsomeness.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">“Thinking to find the street-preachers cowed by a night in the prison, the Sanhedrin gathered the next morning, in full and solemn session, and set the fishermen in the midst to make answer concerning their credentials: *By what power, or in what name, have you done this!’</span></p>

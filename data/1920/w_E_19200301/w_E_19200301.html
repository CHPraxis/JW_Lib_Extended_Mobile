<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">THIS JOURNAL AND ITS SACRED MISSION</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">T</span><span class="font4">HIS journal is one of the prime factors or instruments in the system of Bible instruction, or “Seminary Extension’’, now being presented in all parts of the civilized world by the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, chartered A. D. 1884, “For the Promotion of Christian Knowledge”. It not only serves as a class room where Bible students may meet in the study of the divine Word but also as a channel of communication through which they may be reached with announcements of the Society’s conventions and of the doming of its traveling representatives, styled “Pilgrims”, and refreshed with reports of its conventions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Our “Berean Lessons” are topical rehearsals or reviews of our Society’s published Studies most entertainingly arranged, and very helpful to all who would merit the only honorary degree which the Society accords, viz., </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Vcibi Dei Minister</span><span class="font4"> (V. I). M.), which translated into English is </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Minister</span><span class="font4"> 0/ </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Cod's Word.</span><span class="font4"> Our treatment of the International Sunday School Lessons is specially for the older Bible students and teachers. By some this feature is considered indispensable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This journal stands firmly for the defense of the only true foundation of the Christian’s hope now being so generally repudiated - &gt;&nbsp;edemption through the precious blood of “the man Christ Jesus, who gave himself a </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">ransom</span><span class="font4"> [a corresponding price, a substitute] for .•ill&quot;. &lt;1 Peter 1:19; 1 Timothy 2:G) Building up on this sure foundation the gold, silver and precious stones (1 Corinthians 3: 11-I5- 2 Peter 1 : 5-11) of the Word of God, its further mission is to “make all see what is the fellowship of the mystery which. . .has i»e. 1. in.] in God, ... to the intent that now might be made known by the church the manifold wisdom of God”—“which in other ages M.ts not made known unto the sons of men as it is now revealed”.—Ephesians 3:5-9,10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It stands free from all parties, sects and creeds of men. while it seeks more and more to bring its every utterance into fullest •subjection to the will of God in Christ, as expressed in the Iwly Scriptures. It is thus free to declare boldly whatsoever the Lord hath spoken—according to the divine wisdom granted unto us to understand his utterances. Its attitude is not dogmatic, but confident; for we know whereof we affirm, trending with implicit faith upon the sure promises of God. It is held as a trust, to be used only in his service: hence our decisions relative to what may and what may not appear in its columns must be according to our judgment of his good'pleasure, the teaching of his Word, for the upbuilding of his people in grace and knowledge. And we not only invite hut urge our readers to prove all its utterances by the infallible Word to which reference is constantly made to facilitate such testing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">TO US THE SCRIPTURES CLEARLY TEACH</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">That the church is “the temple of the living God&quot;, peculiarly “his workmanship”; that its construction has been in progress throughout the gospel age—ever since Christ became 1he world’s Redeemer and the Chief Corner Stone of his temple, through which, when finished, God’s blessing shall come “to all people&quot;, and they find access to him.- 1 Corinthians 3:1G, 17; Ephesians 2:20-22; Genesis 28 : 14 ; Galatians 3 : 29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">That meantime the chiseling, shaping, and polishing of consecrated believers in Christ’s atonement for sin, progresses; and when the last of these “living stones”, “elect and precious,” shall have been made ready, the great Master Workman will bring all together in the first resurrection; and the temple shall be filled with his glory, and be the meeting place between God and men throughout the Millennium.—Revelation 15:5-8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">That the basis of hope, for the church and the world, lies in the fact that “Jesus Christ, by the grace of-God, tasted death for </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">every </span><span class="font4">man,” “a ransom for all,” and will be &quot;the true light which lighteth </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">ever.y man that cometh into the world”,</span><span class="font4"> “in due time”.— Hebrews 2:9; John 1:9; 1 Timothy 2 : 5, (».</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">That the hope of the church is that she may be like her Lord, “see him as he is,” be “partakers of the divine nature’,’ and share his glory as his joint-heir.—1 John 3 :2 ; John 17 : 24 ; Romans 8 :17 ; 2 Peter 1 : 4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">That the present mission of the church is the perfecting of the saints for the future work of service: to develop in herself every grace ; to be God’s witness to the world ; and to prepare to be kings and priests in the next age.—Ephesians 4:12: Matthew 24 ; 14 ; Revelation 1: G ; 20 : G.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">That the hope for the world lies in the blessings of knowledge and opportunity to be brought to </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font4"> by Christ’s Millennial kingdom, the restitution of all that was lost in Adam, to all the willing and obedient, at the hands of their Redeemer and his glorified church, when all the wilfully wicked will be </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">destroyed.—</span><span class="font4">Acts 3:19-23; Isaiah 35.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font8"><a name="bookmark3"></a>VIEWS FROM THE WATCH TOWER</span></h3>
<p><span class="font14">I</span><span class="font6">F THE church members eared much for their ministers, they would pay such salaries that preacher.-, would not need to go around with hands out fol charity. If a I’arim r eared as much for his minister as he does foi his |in&gt; stock, ho would set' that the minister was hi pt m .i~ good condition as the herds. The Bible authoiizes the minist'-r who semes the people in religious things to have his livelihood supplied bv those he serves. (1 Corinthians 11:13) Mendicancy among the clergy doubtless sprang up in the dark ages, when it was considered a virtue for a man to become a monk and spend his time carrying the basket around the charitably inclined neighborhood. The incessant begging •of the clergy is one of the chief factors in lowering the respect in which they are held.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the days of primitive Christianity the ministers did not insist upon the Seri pt u rally ordained arrangement for support bv the faithlul. Such a thing as a modern clergyman was unknown; but the local elders, or presbyters, as thev were quite commonly called, usually worked at some ociupation the same other people and were sulhcientlv devoted to the service of Cod to bo willing gladly to give as much of then time as possible to the preaching of the gospel and to pastoral work among Christian people. Even the traveling ministers like the apostles and T'imotby and Silas were wont to eke out a living at ‘'tent-making&quot;. In pursuance of this independence-creating custom the genuine modern Bible student does not expect Io 'live off the altar’ but takes care of his own living expenses, except in the' case ■of those that devote all their time to the work, and they receive a mere subsistence. It would be far better for the clergy to earn their own living than to be placed in a position of dependence upon, and of control by, the very wealthy, as when millions of dollars are devoted by a Baptist bil 1 lonaire to the care of indigent Baptist ministers. The world is noticing matters of this kind and does not hesitate to comment upon them. We quote from the Cleveland </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">News:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">CLERGYMEN’S FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">&quot;You wonder why men who are preaching Christianity have to depend upon charity Over in New Jersey one minister reported to Ins conference that nil lie got for expounding the gospel for twelve months was $200.00. That would be about a dollar apiece for the regular services he conducted and nothing extra for funerals. It is stated, with a basis of authority, that the average ministerial income throughout the country is little above $500.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">&quot;Now the preacher’s dollar is no larger than any other dollar. The fact that he earned it in a calling followed in answer to divine command has no superhuman effect on the purchase power of his salary Nor is the minister in a posilion to mail; up the price of his services. Thore are too many people who insist on Ilie free feature of salvation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">&quot;There seems io be hut one conclusion: that the average man Ims ceased to interested in religion sutliciently to pay anythin;: to hear it expounded or discussed. Who is to lilame for this condition? Is it the man himself or is it the church? It is a notable fact that comparatively few men go to church. They indorse tlie attendance of tlie feminine portion of the family ami think it a good idea for the children, hut as for themselves- they have ‘important business' elsewhere</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">&quot;If l he present tendency coni Innes, what is to become of the churches and Ilie preachers? Will the world become essentially heathen and what will happen when that comes about? The charitable support of ministers from the ample pocket of JIr. Rockefeller does not hit at the basis of the dillicitlty. If the church is a desirable institution, anil no one will deny Hint it is. something belter than charity will have to hi<sup>1</sup> devised for iIs revival in interest. What shall it be?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">CATHOLIC CHURCH TAKES UP THE TRUMPET</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In advaming its political interests the Catholic church has been making ever increasing me of the public press, and lias controlled the press by having the positions of editor--, and esp&quot;&lt;-ia 11 v citv editors, and the management of the press agencies held by Jesuits or other zealous Itoman Catholics. In line with the pronouncements of the American hierarchy, the church has thrown oft' the vail of secrecy and is openly taking up the publicity trumpet. As a statement of the bolder front of the church, we quote from an article by John B. Kennedy in the Scranton (Pa.) </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Tinies</span><span class="font6"> of February 2, entitled “Catholic Church ’lakes up the Trumpet’’. One interesting item in this statement is that the “good name of the church as a social force” would have been lost but for the fortunate (for the church) circumstances of the war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">NATION WIDE PRESS BUREAU</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">&quot;Tlie must ancient of tlie Christian clmrcbes—the Catholic eliurch--vvith characteristic application of the grand maxim, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">•Tcmpora mutantur ct non miitaniur in Ulis’</span><span class="font4"> [times change and we change in them], has taken up the tried and true tool culled publicity as a means of accomplishing its work in the world. The pioneers in largely organized Catholic publicity are the Knights of Columbus. They have been the pioneers in practically till modern American Catholic movements. They raised the first great fund to promote Catholic higher education: they were the first to recognize the necessity of providing homes and clubs for their co-religionists att&lt; ruling state universities. And everybody knows that they stepped into the breach when there was a crying need for organized effort in Catholic war relief, although everybody does not know that it is an opinion generally expressed among the Catholic hierarchy that the Knights of Columbus saved the good name of the church as a social force when they plunged into war work</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">&quot;Joseph C. Pelletier, of Boston, supreme advocate of the Knights of Columbus, had the inspiration for a nation-wide press bureau—the first of its kind under Catholic auspices. This was In the summer of 1918, when the war was at its height. The Knights of Columbus war news service was formed, and the operations of this bureau have demonstrated two things—that the editors of the country were glad to receive authentic information from a Catholic source (a fact which thousands of well-informed Catholics had doubted), and that this information could be disseminated by the most approved modern methods at a cost singularly small when compared with the costs of operation of other organizations.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Among the statements that follow in this article is the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“In conducting propaganda the Catholics have not in mind the ‘conversion’ of America, or the forceful imposition of specifically Catholic ideas on the non-Catholic public.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But this statement may be compared with the following quotation from </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Catholic World:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“The Roman Catholic is to wield his vote for the purpose of securing Catholic ascendency in this country. All legislation must be governed by the will of God unerringly indicated by the pope. Education must be controlled by the Catholic authority, and under education the opinions of the individuals and the utterances of the press are included. Many opinions are to be forbidden by the secular arm, under the authority of the church, even to war and bloodshed.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">FREEDOM FROM PERSECUTION IN CANADA</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">One of the vital traditions of the Anglo-Saxon is adherence to the principle of liberty of person, property, speech, press, and the exercise of religion. Every American and Canadian looks back with thankfulness to Magna Charta, when the first great start was made in the world-famed Anglo-Saxon freedom. When war is on and there is a life-and-death struggle for a nation, the people willingly forego some of their liberties, but they are jealous of them and insist upon their prompt return as soon as the crisis is over and actual hostilities cease. For centuries this has been true.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In Canada, when the country returned to a peace basis at New Year’s, many of the common people had become indignant at the continuance of arrests under war measures after the armistice, and especially so at the interference with the free exercise of religion. During the war many interests took advantage of war laws to work out private grudges; and one class that did this was the Canadian clergy, who incited the persecution of Bible students both during the war and long after the armistice. This has been noted by liberty-loving Canadians and, according to the following from the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Grain Growers’ Guide,</span><span class="font6"> as reported in the Edmonton </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin </span><span class="font6">of January 24, the persons who incited the persecutions and other outrages may be called to account:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“The people of Canada will not be true to their instincts, their traditions,and their just rights as a free,self-governing people, if they do not demand, and insist upon getting, an explanation from Ottawa in regard to the arbitrary proceedings that have taken place recently, months after the cessation of hostilities, in the invasion of private houses, colleges and libraries, under the provisions of an order-In-council framed explicitly for wartime conditions, the seizure </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font6">books and papers, and the sentencing of individuals to terms of imprisonment for having in their possession literature under the wartime ban of censorship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">&quot;In Alberta and in Ontario these searches, arrests, confiscations, and punishments have been carried out in </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">manner which would have been more in keeping with the old methods of the old autocratic regime in Russia than with the Institutions of government in this free country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“It is a fundamental maxim of democracy and freedom that the citizen who is truly loyal to his responsibilities </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font6">citizenship will not consent to arbitrary measures. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The </span><span class="font6">price of liberty and of justice is unceasing vigilance. It </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">is </span><span class="font6">the duty of the elected representatives of the people in parliament to bring this matter up for full and free discussion, and to compel the government to declare itself plainly and without equivocation. Such bureaucratic methods of absolutism can have no right place on Canadian soil. The whole situation is one that must be cleared up at </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font6">earliest possible moment.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Many hundreds of delegates from some twenty-eight Protestant denominations met only recently in Atlantic City and laid plans for home and foreign mission work by which they hope to effect the evangelization of the world. The task is expected to require five hundred million dollars. The Atlantic City </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Press, of</span><span class="font6"> January 8, reports as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“More than a thousand delegates and others directly interested, leaders in twenty-eight Protestant denominations, here this afternoon formally launched the great Survey Conference of the Interchurch Movement of North America from which the churches represented expect to project the most far-reaching soul-saving drive the world has ever witnessed. The budget called for is $500,000,000. The initial session, held on the Steel I’ier and presided over by John R. Mott, general secretary of the Y. M. C. A., who took the place of Robert Lansing, Secretary of State, as chairman of the Executive Committee, was given over to the presentation of facts based upon the survey of the world religious and social needs.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A somewhat larger sum was mentioned as being necessary for the work of the next five years, according to the Baltimore </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">American,</span><span class="font6"> of January 10:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“The budget of the Interchurch World Movement to be used in coordinating the energies of the Protestant denominations for the evangelization of the world, was approved today at the conference of 1400 church leaders here. The budget calls for the expenditure of $1,330,000,000 in the next five years. It provides for evangelistic work in America and the foreign field, proper financing of hospitals and 1/imes, liberal awards to struggling colleges, for the fighting of social and industrial unrest, and better wages to both ministers and missionaries. It is specified that no part </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font6">the budget shall be changed by a board of review to be appointed with equal representation of all denominations, without the consent of the denominational board directly affected.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">STARTLING INCREASE OF CRIME</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Pathfinder</span><span class="font6"> gives us the following data on crime in the United States, claiming that this country leads the world in criminal acts :</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Crime statistics show that in thirty years crime has increased 500 percent in the United States, four times the increase in population. There were as many murders </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">In </span><span class="font6">Omaha last year as in London, with its five million people. Kansas City, with a 300,000 population, had more murders than the English capital. Murders in Kansas average one every other day. Authorities often fail to get the crimlnaHs, and many are acquitted even when witnesses of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">crime </span><span class="font6">are found.”</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font8"><a name="bookmark5"></a>VICTORY THROUGH FAITH</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">This is the victory that overcometh the tcorld, even our faith.&quot;—1 John '&gt;. }</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">E</span><span class="font6">VEN the word victory has an inspiring ring to the ear. As used in the world it conveys the picture of the victorious army returning from war and greeted with the huzzahs of an admiring multitude. But such victories as this are not the portion of the Lord’s people now. When the Apostle says that faith is the \ ictory, we are not to understand him to mean that nothing else remains to be done, after we have merely believed. Rather the thought must be that faith is the conquering power with which we are able to push aside the things which are seen, and to direct our course in life in harmony with things which are not seen, but which none the less are realities to us, because we can lay hold upon them with our minds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Columbus was a man of faith when he believed, and acted upon the belief, that a western route could be taken for eastern ports. He had never gone far west and to the average mind the western waters were merely the lair of the hobgoblin and ogre. Every view previously held on the subject, everything, in fact, seemed to be against his theory of finding India by a western passage, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">except</span><span class="font6"> his own faith in the project. Now his faith, be it noted, was not a mere arbitrary decision on the subject apart from all known facts, but it was a rational conclusion arrived at after thoughtful consideration of other points already known. So the Christian's faith is not a conclusion reached out of the abundance of his imagination, but it is a conviction arrived at after the consideration of competent evidence from an authoritative or reliable source.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">FAITH OF BASIC IMPORTANCE</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Christian’s voyage has never been experienced by him before. The devil, as the great hobgoblin, seeks to discourage him from undertaking the journey, telling him that he had better remain where he is safe, on firm and known ground. He is confronted with the alluring suggestion that the way of the world must be the proper one, because every one has been going that way. Who would think of gaining anything worth while by selfdenial ; is self-denial not sailing directly away from success and happiness? Self-assertion is the only road to success, the world tells us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">True, Columbus might have made erroneous deductions with his imperfect human brain. And so might we if we were not helped. This contingency is provided for in that definite basic promises are made in God’s Word as to what the reward of a life of faith shall be. It is important then to see that our faith is a correct faith; for if the faith be built on erroneous theories, inspiring false and delusive hopes, it will eventuate for its victim in shipwreck on the rocks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is because of this importance of faith, either for good or for evil, that the Apostle Paul was so solicitous for the continuance, of the brethren in the proper faith (Colossians 1: 23) “the faith once delivered unto the saints”. (Jude 3) He urged all to examine and to prove themselves to make sure they were in the faith, grounded and settled and not moved away from the hope of the gospel, but rooted and built up in Christ and established in him. (Colossians 2:7) He was also deeply concerned that the faith of the church should not stand in the wisdom of men but in the power of God. (1 Corinthians 2: 5) He knew how vital a thing the matter of faith is, for it had been long time written: “The just shall </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">live</span><span class="font6"> by his faith”. (Habakkuk 2 : 4) The sentiment of this text had been voiced by Moses of old in almost the last words of that venerable patriarch when, reviewing the faith of Israel, he said: “It is not a vam thing for you, because it is your life&quot;. (Deuteronomy 32:47) Yes, our lives, our eternal destinies, have been made dependent upon our loyalty in respect to the walk of faith which we have voluntarily emernd upon as footstep followers of the Master.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is well to see that we have the faith of Christ, the faith well founded in the Word of God, a faith examined and proved, deeply rooted in the heart as well as in the head, and, therefore, established as the conquering power of life. Faith to be a conquering power in us must go deeper than the head: it must go into the heart and permeate and energize the whole being, bringing not only the outward conduct but every thought into subjection to Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Faith,” the Apostle tells us, “cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God.” That is, the Word of God contains certain information respecting, first, our natural state of imperfection, then, further information as to what would be our proper relationship to him. The truthfulness of such information convinces us when once we have examined the facts given. The first step in faith, then, is a satisfied reason. That, however, of which we are convinced we cannot help having confidence in. The disposition of mental satisfaction passes, unless impeded by selfish and temporal interests, into a heart satisfaction, or trust. If we have confidence in the truth of God’s good promises of blessing, we w<sup>r</sup>ill </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">expect</span><span class="font6"> those promises to be fulfilled; and since God’s promises augur only good for the righteous of heart, good infinitely greater than anything we have ever known, how can we help </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">desiring</span><span class="font6"> the fulfillment of those promises? What we expect and desire we are hoping for. And hope gives the color to our Christian lives.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Hope lifts the mind and heart and enables us to appreciate and measurably to enjoy perfections yet actually unexperienced. (Hebrews 6 : 19, 20) It helps to inspire love, and love, in turn, inspires more faith (Galatians 5:6); and so the three are mutually inspiring and interdependent and develop together.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">BLENDINGS AND MIXTURES OF GRACES</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Faith, hope, and love, like the three primary colors in nature, may be combined in varying proportions to produce any other desired hue or tone of character. The color between blue and yellow, for instance, is green. Green has a restful effect on the system and has been designed by a beneficent Providence for that purpose. Likewise, the effect produced upon the life by the presence of faith and hope is </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">peace.</span><span class="font6"> When we are justified bv faith we have peace with God. (Romans 5: 1) Our doubts, fears and misgivings have given place to tranquillity of mind and heart on those' points about which we have received information through the Bible, God’s Word. The hope engendered by confidence in the fulfillment of those promises takes the keenness from our </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">09</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Buffering, because we see that our suffering is not in vain and that there is to be a cessation of pain and tears.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Yellow and red combine to form orange, the warmest of colors. It is suggestive of a state of development and ripeness; the vivid autumn foliage, the golden grain, the luscious fruit all tell that nature has done her best. So too, when hope and love are strongly present in the heart, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">joy</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> is the fruitage. We rejoice preeminently in hope. Romans 12:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Red and blue make violet, the \arying tones of which add glory to the sunset and beauty to the modest flower. Likewise, when faith and love work together a noble, rare, and royal likeness of the Lord ensues. Love without faith di predates into independable sentimentality.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Man's power to lune faith lies in that he, made originally in the image of God, was given the ability to perceive the* evidences of the invisible God. Some of that power of discernment remains in imperfect man. But faith includes the thought of dependence upon the veracity of God, confidence in his integrity. Thus trust is a part of faith, because it relies upon the truth of a promise: and one is said to &quot;keep faith” with another when he performs a promise which that other relies on. Accordingly, faith in God is a firm assent of the mind to the things told us through divine revelation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“FAITH WORKETH BY LOVE”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">There is a primary degree of faith which is seldom passed by the majority of those who learn about the message of the Gospel. It is a speculative knowledge of and a bare assent to the truths revealed in the sacred Scriptures. Of this kind of faith the Apostle James speaks: “Faith, if it have not works, is dead”. “Ye see, then, how that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only.” (James 2:17,24) That is to say, a successful faith does not consist merely of a profession of faith, or a bare assent to the truth, without good works proceeding from faith, showing it to be of the right kind. This mere intellectual belief the devils themselves have. “Thou bdievest that there is one God;... the devils also believe and tremble.” (James 2:19) They are fully persuaded that there is a God, and that Christ is the Son of God, and shall be their Judge, as they acknowledged.—Matthew 8: 29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Effective, faith, however, receives Jesus as he is revealed in the Gospel. To such a one the life, words, works, suffering, death, and resurrection of Christ mean not merely an array of historical facts, but much more: they mean so much to the true believer that they inspire trust in and reliance upon Christ Jesus and his righteousness alone for justification as the basis for our salvation. Such a faith begets a sincere obedience in the life and conversation. It is not. therefore, an idle, unactive and inoperative grace, but shows itself by producing in us love for God and for our neighbor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Let faith compare to the drive wheel of a locomotive; let love be the steam, or motive power, and hope the power of sight on the part of the engineer, looking ever forward toward the goal. As the drive wheel is really worked by the steam, so love ia really behind faith. Were it not for the love of God and for righteousness which was first planted in Adam, and which has not entirely died out, there would be no hope of appealing to any heart by the message of the Gospel. There would be no attractive power, because God’s Word draws only toward the good. But while the steam gives the first impetus to the drive wheel, the machinery of the engine in turn controls the flow of steam so that it makes possible a continued motion. More than this the steam is exhausted into the draft flues and thus fans the flame that generates more steam, more force against the drive wheel, more motion, more progress and incidentally more heat, more steam, etc. So u ith love: the more love we have, the more the holy new Mill directs its power to the inspiring of our faith, and the more the sacred flame is fanned that energizes the water of the truth m us, converting it into r-till more of the motive power of love. As steam and water are different manifestations of the s-ame thing so love and truth are similar in essence. God is love (L John *1:8). and Christ is truth.--John 11: G.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">In certain types of engine there is danger of a “dead” or absolute* center. That is. there is a certain position of the drive wheel in which it cannot be started merely by the power of steam. It requires the application of an outside force to give the wheel a start. Something like this is the trouble vv ith the poor world now. They arc dead; and centered in self; their faculties are deadened so that when the power of love, divine love, disinterested love is brought to bear on them through the message of the Gospel, it docs not move them. It finds little or no responsive chord in their hearts, or at all events not a sufficient response to become a </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">motive</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> power in their lives. Bad, indeed, is it for us, who have once started on the way, if love fails to move us. At very least we would fail to make progress, and in time we would rust and be of no value whatever. As for the world, outside force will be brought to bear on them in the instructions and regulations of the Millennial kingdom, which will give them a start in the right direction and, if a love for righteousness is developed, they too will be able to make progress up the highway of holiness, the new road to life which will then be opened up.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The drive wheel is the immediate means of helping the engine to got over the ground; so faith is the direct agency which enables us to overcome and to leave behind scenes of former failures, ever pressing along the line toward the heavenly station, the Union Station of rest and perfect fellowship with God and with those w’ho have gone before.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">FAITH MUST REST ON THE WORD</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">To be efficacious the drive wheel must be in its proper position on the track. If the wheel leaves the track, extremely serious difficulty ensues, if indeed not a total wreck. And if our faith depart from the pure Word of God, and from the promises which point us to progress in the straight and narrow way, we </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">may</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> by stupendous effort get back, or wc may abandon the Word so completely as to suffer wreck. There will be nothing to keep us from being conformed to the world; we shall of our own weight sink down into the earth, into the world and its ways.—Romans 12: 2,3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">If the track is in good condition we can make fairly good progress, even though the way be up-hill, but if the joints are loose or the rails spread it would be unsafe to go with much speed. The doctrinal features of God’s </span><span class="font6">Word, being faith's most tangible object and support, are the track along which we may proceed. So these doctrines, the only really accurate source of information respecting Jehovah and his character which we have in our present imperfect state, must be firmly established and properly adjusted or we can go but very slowly, if indeed at all.---? Timothy 2; 15, 111.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We must light against that spirit of hauteur and worldly wisdom which spurns a careful inspection of the trails, of the doctrines of God's Word, which alone can show v.hither we are going, and how. and why. The engineer lllint keep one eye ever on the track : the fa-tei one is going, the more can fid -liould the watch be. To be .-nrc. he may i-alch a casual glimpse of the beautful hill.- lie pas-.es; a gorgioii- -un.-ot may attract, but mu-t not hold his vi-ion. No, the\ are not for him. He has a wink to do. a goal to icach and. nature-lover though lie be, he cannot now </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">halt,</span><span class="font6"> to di ink them b-&gt;autuin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Another thing is needI'ul to an eiiyin.' on a 'tei p grade, </span><span class="font5">and that is sand Without it Ihe w heel. may spin around </span><span class="font6">and still not make progress; the -pinning will merely wear both track and wheels. The sand is no part of the wheel and no pait of the tuiek, Ind it constitutes a medium whereby the contact between those objects is maintained at the highest possible pitch. Such a medium to us is prayer. Without it, owing to the steepness of the road, we are not safe. Our faith, though intact m our understanding, will not work effectively without this help. Even though love may be prompting us with a desire to gain the prize, if our faith is in poor contact with the promises and with the conditions on which the prize may be obtained we will not go ahead. Prayer, possibly importunate prayer, is the need. Without it faith will be going around in the same old grind, and we shall be getting nowhere and accomplishing nothing except to wear out our own confidence. Add persistent, earnest prayer and see if we do not begin making progress from that very hour. Erstwhile dry and uninteresting things will take on a new meaning and a forward impetus is experienced</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">On a steep grade a locomotive may even slip back wards without sand. So we too. without prayer, may slip entirely back to wreck and rum. The steam phis the drive wheel plus vision will not lake the engine on without proper contact. Love of righteousness, plus faith, plus hope, without praver, if we could imagine such a condition, would still place us in a pi'cca riou-position. Braver enables u&lt; to make progress</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">FAITH THE CONQUERING POWER</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Eaith is (he conquering power that overcomes the world. Overcoming is suggestive of warfare, of conflict ; and we should have clearly in mind for whom we are fighting and also </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">ai/ainxt</span><span class="font6"> whom we are to direct our efforts.- John 1 (i: 33.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We are fighting for ourselves m the sense of striving for our own eternal welfare. God needs not our punv efforts, but he allows us to enlist on his side. Jehovah, however, is fighting for us in the sense that he is assisting and encouraging us to fight the good fight of faith on our own behalf. Some seem to have the idea that they are almost doing God a favor by enlisting on his side and thus lending the weight (?) of their influence to what might otherwise be a losing cause. But it is our lives which are at stake, not God’s. He has nothing to lose and little, if anything, to gain; we have cvervthing to gain, anil we are to benefit in the victory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Our text implies that the conquering power of faith is to be directed against the world- not against the inhabitants thereof, not against fellow creatures, but against the spirit of this present evil order of things, its disposition, the mind &lt;d the world, the motive.- which actuate the v.oild. fbe pride ol life and (lie deceit! illness &lt;d riches; m spoil, against sin and. mdirec.tlv. against Satan, whom &gt;w aie to rcs|,L steadfast m the faith.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Satan'- triple alliance (him.-ell. the world, and the flesh of the new creature) i- ai rayed against faith, hope and love. On the -ide of the new creature faith niar--hillls file force-; hence it is tailed the fight ol faith. On Satan’s side the world is the most manifest ami mo.-t easily recognized of the three; it stands in the vanguard. -o to speak, of the hosts of evil; hence it is quite properlv -poken of a- a fight of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">faith</span><span class="font6"> against the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">it'Orld.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ENEMY HIDDEN IN AMBUSH</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Now the spirit of the world manifests itself in many litth mannerisms and practices which may not at first be recognized by the new creature, so cleverly are they hidden in ambush. Pride, vain-glory, self-preferment, are some of the mo-t commonly encountered manifestations of the spirit of the world. The world within us, the tlesh, loves these things and uses every means to justify itself in seeking them. But faith, here too. is the conquering power to gain the victory. Just such a victory has already been gained when by faith we agreed to lose our lives to find them. When we considered the Ma-tvr'- call; “If any man will come after me. let him deny lumselt, and take up hi- cross, and follow me&quot;’ (Matthew 16: 2 1). our faith trusted in the truthfulness of God's piomi-e that such a course would not spell final loss to us, but would really work gain. Like Columbus, we started traveling over a way we had never gone before, Imt were convinced that its end would be glorious.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When we made our consecration war was declared on self. It now remains to be seen whether the matter will be carried out or whether faith will capitulate before the overture- of pride and self-advancement. A tost of our faith comes when we find that through ignorance or weakness we have been unjust to another. Self-pride would not acknowledge it; first, because it hurts, and secondly because, we argue, it will do no good. But we look to the instructions of the Master: “Confess thy fault” (Matthew' 5: 23,24) ; and our confidence, in the integrity of his character prompts us to humiliate ourselves, believing that he would give no command that would not be for our best. No matter if the offended one does not appreciate our conduct and our spirit in the matter (and he often will not) : it is all the better for us that he does not. If we were sure to be always appreciated in such efforts, we might go with a measure of sham, partly to secure the commendation, mental or oral, of the offended. If one’s apology is not appreciated, one is humiliated all the more and will next time be doubly careful. The thought should not be merely to reinstate one’s self in the favor of the offended, but, by virtue of faith in God’s commands, to gain the victory over the worldly pride residing in our flesh. If every day we are thus a victor, we shall unquestionably be a victor in the end.—2 Timothy 4:6-8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">SELF NOT ALWAYS UNGRACIOUS</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Our selfish preferences may not always have an ungracious tinge. Sometimes they are very genteel. Sometimes the flesh has a desire for the maintenance of a peaceful, serene, and respectable life, when service for the Lord would call us more directly into the current of annoying duties. The flesh would be very willing to serve the Lord if it could do so respectably and in comfort. It yearns:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Lord, let me tread the quiet paths. Through woodland, dale and hill:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Yea, let me rove on heath and fen ;</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Or</span><span class="font6"> by the bick’ring rill To dream of thee.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">I’ll build my shrine in storinless vale.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">So tranquil, not a sigh Shall mar my incense-laden lay Of love to thee. Aye, There let me be.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But if we follow the Lord faithfully we are very likely to find ourselves in the city’s grime and noise, where some of the Lord’s work is in need of being done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Sometimes, the flesh argues, it would be easier to maintain a spirit of devotion if we had more quiet and time for meditation. Yet, faith answers, if duty calls to toil, amid commotion, is not that duty a voice telling us that perhaps something else is more necessary to be learned just at that time than meditation in quietness; or telling us that devotion must be put to the test to see how well it will last when the circumstances are anything but favorable? Victory over self in this connection often means for us to be associated with those whom we would not choose by nature, and not to be associated with those whom we would naturally select.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Even in the service of the Lord the flesh has the desire to be able to talk with ease or to prepare and deliver discourses which would stir their hearers to the very depths. But thoughts which stir are wrought only on the anvil of experience, and an idea expressed yet never experienced lacks that force which would make it a source of help to others. Faith thus tells us that, even if our present desires to help remain unfulfilled, we, by our puny efforts, are being prepared for a work of noblest future ministry, in which our every experience will doubtless be of use.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Faith thus overcomes the tendencies which the world has wrought in us; and while not condemning all of them as evil, it counsels us merely to disregard or push aside those which we cannot use in the narrow way. Worldly pride on the other hand bids us keep everything which would put self forward and advises us not to be too sure of the things which we cannot see. If such hints are hearkened to, doubt is bred and indifference ensues; discouragement, despondency and despair follow in its wake. We must remember: “Greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world”.—1 John 4: 4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There is another attack from the flesh against our faith which is more subtle than almost any other: it is the suggestion that the Lord’s work in the world is in special need of our advice or knowledge or experience. It is one of the most difficult things to believe, not merely that God is good and that he has benevolent intentions and designs toward us, but to believe that work undertaken in the name of the Lord and in harmony with his Word will have his guidance, his approval, and his blessing. Indeed, some of the hottest battles in the bivouac of faith are fought on this very point, and, sad to say, the battles are not always won by faith.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">FAITH VS. THE PARTISAN SPIRIT</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There is another spirit of the world which faith can, must, and will overcome, and that is the partisan spirit, the disposition to be more loyal to persons than to principles. This party feeling, closely akin to tribal affection, is an affinity which holds one to those with whom he happens to be associated, often irrespective of their virtues or worthlessness. It may or may not be used for good. At any rate faith bids us to have our closest association with the Lord so that everything else will be subservient; we would not love people merely because we happen to be associated with them but rather from principle, because of certain lovable qualities or possibilities in them. We are helped in this direction, in the case of the Lord’s people, because they have the Father’s stamp of approval in the shape of his begetting spirit. Frequently our preference for family or for a circle of friends or acquaintances arises merely from the fact that they are tolerant of our weaknesses and failures, because they have the same or similar ones to ours. Our proper pride and modesty alike should forbid the encouragement of such attachments as tend toward failure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The party spirit may easily merge into pride or glory in the “movement” with which we happen to be connected. We should remember that the very same influences are at work against us as have been against all other upward religious movements in the past. Certainly none would claim for a moment that we as individuals are better than they. Who can say that if we were to continue here for twenty-five years more, we, or those following us, would not be as thoroughly dyed-in-the-wool sectarianists as ever trod the globe ? Who can boast? We, just as well as others, have to fight against these things; fight, not with fists, but with faith, faith that God will perform his own purposes, sometimes with and sometimes irrespective of our cooperation. Are we of Paul, or of Apollos, or of Cephas—or of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Christ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The spirit of the world comes out, too, in the spirit of criticism, or of unkind and often unjust censure of the conduct of others. Habitual criticism of men and things is a sign not of superior faculties and finer sensibilities, as the flesh suggests to us, but of actual moral and spiritual decrepitude, which, while seeking to justify itself by the thought of opposing the evil, really gloats over the unlovely traits thus held before the mind. ‘Tove”, on the contrary, “rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth with the truth,” with the spirit of righteousness, which abhors the thoughts of evil and does not even consider them, when possible to escape. Faith in God’s word that “none [is] righteous, no, not one,” should teach us not to expect perfection in any, nor even consistency of conduct, since that would imply perfection. It takes great faith to start out on a mental hunt for commendable points in a person whom we have been in the habit of looking on as the embodiment of undesirable traits.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">LOVE IN SPITE OF FAULTS</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Perhaps a brother seems harsh or unkind in his manner or utterances, uncouth or crude in his ways; perhaps he docs not appeal to us. Faith would still tell us that there must be some lesson for us to learn there. Perhaps this is only the Lord’s way of calling our attention to unloveliness in ourselves. But what about that brother? Never mind too much about that brother. The Lord will attend to him in his own way. Perhaps that brother does not need exactly the same lessons that we need; or maybe he will get them later; or maybe he has had them in the past and is carrying the scars from a •field where we would have been vanquished.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is true we could not admire any one </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">because of</span><span class="font6"> Ins imperfections, but we can admire him </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">in spite of</span><span class="font6"> his imperfections, that is, for other qualities which he doubtless has. Thus faith, believing that God will deal with others in a righteous and suitable way without our attempting to hand out punishment, and believing that he will also teach us aright, gives us contentment even under galling circumstances—not contentment with imperfect qualities, in either ourselves or others, but contentment with the Lord’s general providences which permit us to be in contact with others as imperfect as ourselves. Those who command our admiration in every particular appeal only to the gentler side of our character, and if our experiences were wholly with such we might not develop enough fibie and sinew. Then too, we often discover that our poor selves grate on others in much the same way that they do on us. It is no test of love when we admire a person or his doings. Wait until almost his every action seems perverse, or inconsistent, or even wrong, then see how much love is left.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The tendency to criticism on the part of our flesh may extend even to the manner used in preaching the Gospel. ■Of course, no one should think that he may not form mental opinions respecting the desirability or undesirability of a thing or act. That we, as rational creatures, are bound to do. But to criticise merely as a habit is what does us harm, if it does harm to none other. The </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">sound</span><span class="font6"> of the gospel may or may not be pleasing to the flesh, depending on the language in which it is couched. It may be delivered in a rambling way and pain our sense of rhetoric or logic. Our fleshly judgment suggests the thought that such an exposition of the truth could never do any one any good. But wonder of wonders! some heart gives evidence of being comforted and helped. The Lord is not now teaching us logic and philosophy in the pure form, but is teaching us </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">faith,</span><span class="font6"> and is seeking to inspire and to feed a </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">devotional</span><span class="font6"> spirit in us that will draw us closer and closer to him and away from the spirit of the world. Whoever is rich in love toward God and toward the brethren is rich indeed and if he be faithful unto death he will have Christ, “in whom are hid </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font6"> the treasures of wisdom and knowledge”.— Colossians 2:3; Revelation 2 : 10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">How subtle is the mind of the flesh! It seeks to judge and to decide everything according to the natural observation. When the natural observation suggests a thought which is contrary to love, love, if active, will repel that thought and faith will come forward and say: I believe there is some sterling quality in that brother, whether I can see it or not: I believe God made no mistake when he set his love there. “Faith” thus “worketh by love”. (Galatians 5: 6) Love prompts faith to gain the victory against injustice and unkindness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">FAITH AND OUR GREAT CHANGE</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Should it be deemed a wonderful thing to believe in a change of nature, when the nature of our very temporal existence is problematic? Look, under the highest power microscope, at human flesh and instead of being solid matter, it is really composed of little particles which do not even touch each other but are, in proportion to their size, widely separate. If even our present life is </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font6"> mystery and a miracle should we think it a strange thing to believe in the veracity of Jehovah when he says that he will give us a new life? If wc </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">really believe</span><span class="font6"> that he will give us the things promised, we will certainly conform ourselves to the conditions; there can be no question about that. The things promised are so wonderful and so grand that, if we truly believe, we must desire them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Even man, with merely high earthly ambitions, has been able to accomplish wonders in a short space of time by applying himself fully to the subject in hand. It is told of the world-famed naturalist, Audubon, that when he was twenty-four years old, he observed a small fleck of blood on his handkerchief and knew he had but a few years to live. He determined to make the best of them and to do something that would be of public good. Accordingly he set about it and in the brief space of six years he accomplished the colossal task of classifying all the birds of the world. That was a great work and he did it single-handed; but we have all the power in the universe that is necessary to help us accomplish the great work before us. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">According to our faith</span><span class="font6"> is the only rule measuring the amount of power on which we can draw. Let us give ourselves wholly to it!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We need not be entirely discouraged if unlovable and unlovely qualities show themselves under stress. The refining work does this. The intended effect of the fire is to do this very thing — to show up the dross that it may be skimmed off as rapidly as seen. Our faithfulness is marked by the assiduity with which we submit ourselves to the refining and not merely by the outward graciousness of our conduct, desirable though that be.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Father promises to give us of his heavenly wisdom, if we ask in faith, never wavering. (James 1:6) Heavenly wisdom in sufficient measure would certainly enable us to direct all our affairs to the Lord’s glory and thus to be faithful ambassadors. Also he gives us the holy spirit on the same condition. Who can doubt that the holy spirit in rich measure will work out such fruits of the spirit as will guarantee us an abundant entrance into the kingdom of our Txvrd and Savior Jesus Christ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The wisdom then is sufficient for all the exigencies of our present trial time and the holy spirit prepares us for the future. What more could be done for us ? And all securable in proportion to our faith!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">FIGHT THE GOOD FIGHT</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We are in the rear guard of a noble train of victors -Jesus, Paul, Peter, John, and many, many others. If God’s Word was mighty to spur them on to victory; if it, and nothing else, was able to inspire in them a victorious faith, why may it not be so with us? The Lord will do his part. Will we do ours? The Lord’s people should he ashamed to catch themselves at anything small or commonplace in thought. “What manner of persons ought we to be in all holy conversation and godliness!’’ (3 Peter 3:11) The disposition to show ourselves worthy ambassadors is the germ of victory; victory over smallness, victory over self, victory over the world in our ilesh; and it can be sustained only by faith.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Unanswered yet! Faith cannot be unanswered;</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Iler feet are firmly planted on the rock:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Amid the wildest storms she stands undaunted, Nor quails before the loudest thunder-shock.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">She knows Omnipotence hath heard her prayer, And cries, It shall be done, sometime, somewhere.”</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font8"><a name="bookmark7"></a>STRENGTH VS. WEAKNESS</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">‘When I am weak, then I am strong.”—2 Corinthians 12:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">W</span><span class="font6">E AKE not to understand the Apostle to mean that the Lord will give physical strength to his people, in some remarkable way, because they belong to him; for if he did, his people would be the most powerful people in the world; and we know that this is not the case. The strength which the Lord gives is a strength of mind, a mental and moral courage which more than makes up for any lack of physical strength. Some of the Lord’s children have very little bodily strength; and yet they have a courage, a strength of heart, far superior to that of many who possess much greater physical vigor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Apostle Paul exultingly exclaims: “When I am weak, then am I strong!” So by the exercise of proper faith and trust in the Lord we who belong to him may be far stronger than we could be under any other circumstances and conditions. We may, however, feel sure that the Lord will give special physical strength to his people if otherwise they would be unable to accomplish whatever he wishes them to do. We have seen this demonstrated. We have known Christians who were not naturally strong to be granted a very special strength at times when there was a particular and important work to be done for God. Perceiving their confidence and faith, the Lord is pleased to grant them special strength, so that they may endure what others who were physically stronger might not be able to bear up under.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">PEACE BORN OF FAITH</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“The Lord will bless his people with peace.” This is not true in an outward sense. It was not true thus of our Master; and his special associates, the apostles, were buffeted and afflicted as all of the Lord’s followers have been throughout the gospel age. The adversary does everything in his power to make our lives unpleasant and unhappy. We must contend with fightings without and fightings within. It is not all peace </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">without</span><span class="font6"> and all calmness </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">within.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We must battle with our own flesh; for there is where we are to gain an important part of the victory. We are to “fight a good fight,” a </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">conquering</span><span class="font6"> fight. We are to put forth earnest effort in fighting against the world, against our own fallen nature, and against the adversary and all the things that he would put into our mind and heart. We are to get the better of these things. The Lord blesses his people with strength to overcome these adverse influences and difficulties, and gives them peace of heart even in the midst of their difficulties.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We are not to be at peace with the flesh, but always at war with it. There is a peace in the Lord, however, that is born of faith and of implicit trust in his promises. He has promised us grace sufficient for every time of need. He has promised tha* we shall not be overcome in any trials or difficulties, if we remain faithful to our covenant. We are assured that we shall have the victory, trusting in his strength. This gives us rest, peace and confidence. So we for very joy can sing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We are resting in the Lord’s precious promises- the promises which he has given to none save his very own. We are resting in his strength and his ability to make good his promises. We know that he who has called us is able to perform all his good word, and will </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">surely do it. </span><span class="font6">(Joshua 23:14) This peace and rest is the special blessing of the holy spirit. Only in proportion as we receive the holy spirit, the holy mind, the holy disposition, of God, can we have his promises fulfilled in us. It is a matter of simple proportion. As we grow in grace and in the knowledge of the Lord, in the knowledge of his truth, we shall have additional comfort and strength. We shall thus grow up into Christ from day to day and shall ever abide in his love.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Lord desires that our characters shall become both beautiful and strong. In nature there are some substances which are beautiful in appearance, but which have neither firmness nor durability. The ruby is a precious stone of both beauty and hardness; and we have an article of food, a ruby-tinted gelatine, which much resembles the ruby in outward appearance, but which is lacking in firmness. .Some people have characters of this kind. These will be dealt with during the next age. But those whom the Ixird is choosing to [dace in his diadem of beauty and glory must have a character which not only has the element of beauty, but possesses also firmness of texture and quality—a character able through divine grace to endure the severest pressure that will be brought to bear upon it, and much cutting and polishing. Thus shall we become jewels of rarest value, the admiration of every beholder, fitted to show forth forever the glory of Jehovah.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“God is our refuge and strength, a very</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">T</span><span class="font4">OI LAY’S study tells us of the death of Joshua, who became the leader of the Israelites at the death of Moses. Joshua was a worthy example of faithfulness to God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Under divine direction he divided the land of Palestine among the tribes of Israel, giving each his portion with the understanding that the portion was the gift of God, and that the more faith they possessed the more quickl) would each tribe enter into its inheritance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Through an angel especially sent as God’s representative Ilie Israelites were enioined by the Lord to take possession of the land speedily, driving out their enemies, destroying their idols and altars of worship, and thus conquering Ilie entire country for themselves as God’s people and ridding botli themselves and their children of all Idolatrous temptation. But instead of doing this, they made leagues witli the various heathen peoples inhabiting the land, and brought themselves into more or less of a friendly relationship. This disobedience proved to be a serious snare.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In studying the history of the nation of Israel, we are to remember that Ilie Apostle Paul tells us that all those things which happened to them were allegorical. (1 Corinthians 10:11) They were true, they were real occurrences: but from God's standpoint their chief object and purpose was to illustrate certain great truths for spiritual Israel, coming afterwards and known as the gospel church. Thus, for instance, when the Christian enters upon his new life as a result of his consecration to God, it corresponds to the crossing of Jordan—dying to old Interests and entering upon the new inheritance. Under the leadership of Jesus, our Joshua, we enter into new life full of faith. Victories result.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">SPIRITUAL ISRAEL’S ENEMIES</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Then vve learn that the new creature is to conquer the perverted appetites of his own flesh, which correspond to the idolatrous peoples who resided in Canaan. It is the duty of the new creature to drive out these earthly hopes, ambitions, weaknesses, perversions, and oppositions to the Lord and his righteousness. If the work of exterminating is carried on thoroughly, the result would be a ripened character, strong in the Lord, full of faith, obedience, and blessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">However, like the Israelites of old, in too many cases the Lord’s people make a truce with their own fleshly weaknesses. They fail to drive these out, fail to overthrow the altars of passion, avarice, etc. These weaknesses and depravities of the old nature cower for a time before the new creature, entreating mercy, patience, and a measure of gratification. But as surely as these implorlngs are granted, the passions and weaknesses become stronger and stronger: and in the battle the new creature is worsted until he must cry to the Lord for deliverance, lest he perish before the onslaught of his own passions and desires. Thus the lives of many Christian people are a succession of battlings and defeats, captivities. The decisive battle should have been fought out at first. The will should have been firmly fixed on the side of righteousness, truth, and obedience to God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is difficult to determine how much all of the Lord’s people suffer as a result of not being firm enough, rigorous enough, in their dealings with their own flesh, especially at the beginning of their Christian experience. The only-remedy is to cry unto the Lord, as did tne Israelites when they found themselves hard pressed. As the Lord delivered his ancient people, so he is willing to deliver all spiritual Israelites. However, it is certainly a shame for Christians that their defeats are so numerous, even as it was a shame to the Israelites that during the period of the Judges they were eighteen times oppressed by their neighbors, were slaves where they should have been masters. The one great lesson of all these experiences to the natural Israelites and to the spiritual Israelites is the lesson of God’s mercy. The Lord is very gracious, willing to forgive our trespasses and to assist us when we realize our wrong condition and make AND THEIR ANTITYPES — NATURAL POSSESSED BY ABRAHAM AND HIS SEED UNDER ENDED —MESSIAH S KINGDOM BEGUN.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">present help in trouble.”—Psalm 46:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">an appeal for help. To all such the divine promise is: “I will heal their backsliding; I will love them freely&quot;.--Hosea 14:4; Ephesians 2:4-9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">JOSHUA'S WISE EXHORTATION</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The book ol Joshua closes with the account of the death of that great leader, and the hook of Judges begins with incidents covering the same period. When Joshua realized that his work was done and that he was about to be gathered Io his fathers. Io sleep with Ids fathers in death, he called the Israelites together. When the tribes had assembled at Sliechem, Joshua reminded them of the Lord’s mercies and manifest layers toward iliem in bringing them thus far and in finally giving to each tribe the allotment of its inheritance in the promised land of Canaan. Then he warned them respecting the dangers of Hie situation, th€ necessity for being separate from the people of the land, the Gentiles; otherwise the li-mlem-v might be toward idolatry. He urged upon till a lull settlement of the mind, the will, on the side of the Lord and against all the heathen religions. It was then that he took his stand and announced: ‘‘Choose ye this day whom ye will serve; but as for me and my house, we will serve the Lord” The people joined with him in the same resolve.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Our lesson today tells us that during all the days of Joshua and of the others of the judges who outlived their great leader, things went well with the Israelites. They had the Lord’s blessing and were prosperous. These leaders had lu mind the Lord’s wonderful dealings with his people, and therefore they realized the importance of being on the Lord’s side If they would have his blessing. The idolatries that came In were subsequent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The true God has always prohibited idols, image worship; while the false gods have usually been represented by these. According to human reasoning the idols would appear to be an excellent way of keeping religion before the mind ; but it is not God’s way and hence is not advantageous. As the Israelites noted the idolatrous worship of their neighbors, they doubtless felt that the latter were the more religious, because of this outward demonstration. Moreover, in connection with the heathen forms of worship were various licentious practices, which to some extent would attract through curiosity and, because of the weaknesses of the flesh, would appeal to the Israelites. The true God had on the contrary instituted in their midst a system of worship which was pure in itself, in every way condemning sin, pointing out the necessity for its cancellation and the need for drawing near to God in the way of divine appointment. In a word, the true religion appealed to the highest and noblest sentiments; while the false religions of the Canaanites appealed to the baser passions, combining a form of godliness with gratification of the flesh in dancings and various saturnalia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Some Christians are prone to condemn the Israelite very severely for wandering off, time and again, into the Idolatries of his heathen neighbors and requiring to be punished of the Lord In order that he might turn again and seek Jehovah in the right way. But let all such Christians remember the antitype—how forms of godliness are inclined to take the place of true heart-worship, reverence; and how the weaknesses of the flesh are inclined to assert themselves, to justify themselves and, if possible, to make themselves appear to be in accordance with the divine will. Let them remember that today many worship the golden calf more than they worship God, requiring chastisements time and again to correct them, to awaken them to their true condition. Let them remember, too, that the Christians have made themselves idols equally as hideous as any made by the heathen—not idols of stone or wood or bronze, but more hideous misrepresentations of the divine character—the printed creeds.—1 John 5:21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Verse seventeen and its connections seem to indicate that the record of our lesson covers a long period of centuries of Israel’s experiences, under many judges. When the people repented, the Lord raised up judges or, as we would say, deliverers, through whom their adversities would be turned aside. Yet even these repeated experiences did not deeply enough Impress the great lesson, so that they needed to learn It over and over. When the judge would recover them from their adversities, and they would have rest during the remainder of his lifetime, it was merely to fall away after his death. Nevertheless, the Lord’s covenant was with the nation ; and the centuries since have shown the persistency of God’s mercy.—Romans 10:21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">DIVINE FAVOR RETURNING TO ISRAEL</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As we have previously pointed out, the Bible indicates very clearly that Israel’s last great lesson of oppression under the Gentiles closed in 1914. The long period of chastisement, twenty-five hundred and twenty years, began when the crown was taken away from King Zedeklah, in B. C. 606. (Ezekiel 21:25-27) During all this time Israel was not an independent nation. As the Lord had declared through his prophets, Zedeklah was the last of the line of David who should rule until Messiah’s kingdom should be established. The end of the Gentile times in 1914, then, marks the beginning of Messiah’s kingdom. Everywhere are to be seen manifestations that he as the great Judge is taking over the affairs of the world, and that Israel’s final deliverance has begun at last.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Before that deliverance can be fully accomplished, however, spiritual Israel must first experience the glorious change of the first resurrection. Thus the spiritual empire must be established first. Following that great event and the incidental time of trouble will come the exaltation of representatives of natural Israel to be the earthly exponents of the heavenly Messianic kingdom. These will be the ancient worthies of the Hebrew people—Abraham, Isaac. Jacob and all the prophets, brought back from the tomb Others of the Hebrew people, delivered from the Gentile domination, will nevertheless get their blessing through their acceptance of the kingdom arrangements. This includes the thought that their eyes of understanding will open and that they will recognize the great King. Thus it is written that those who pierced him will look upon him and mourn because of a realization that they crucified the Prince of life Nevertheless they will have a great blessing, in proportion as they have been seeking conscientiously to serve God and the principles of his righteousness. Then the Ixird will pour upon them the spirit of grace and supplication, in connection with which they will have so much blessing. (Zechariah 12:10) And this blessing of the Lord, coming upon Israel first, means also the blessing of all mankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">All who realize the fulfillment of the times of the Gentiles should be looking for and cooperating with the further steps of the divine plan. One of these Is Israel’s repossession of the control of Palestine, the inheritance of Abraham and ids family. The time is ripe. It now remains for those Jews who by God’s favor have the wealth to use that wealth in the furtherance of the hope of Israel. But a failure on man’s part to appreciate and use opportunities will not Interfere with the divine plan. The hour of blessing Is at hand. Through divine Instrumentality Palestine is nowpassing Into the hands of the Jews.</span></p>

These judges evidently were not elected to their position, but were raised up to It providentially. But as these judges had no power or authority, collected no revenues and held no office which they could entail upon others, It follows that any power or Influence they possessed was a personal one, and to give it weight or force implied a proper acknowledgement of them as divinely appointed or raised up. This arrangement led the people continually to look to God for their helpers and leaders rather than to engage In an ordinary claptrap of politics in which personal ambition and desire for spoils would predominate. God did the nominating ; and the people in proportion as they would come into harmony with him took cognizance of his choice and practically endorsed it or voted for it by their acceptance of the judge. In some instances there may have been a more methodical procedure, as is intimated in Judges 2: 7, where the elders of Israel, who had witnessed God’s miraculous interposition on their behalf, and who had outlived Joshua, «eem to have constituted the judges in the different tribes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This arrangement by which God gave Israel their judges is in considerable harmony with his dealings with spiritual Israel during this gospel age, raising up for them from time to time special counselors, deliverers, ministers. Similarly spiritual Israelites are not to caucus, wire-pull and decide for themselves who shall be their spiritual leaders, but are to regard the Lord as the great Chief Captain, and are to look to him to raise up from time to time such spiritual chieftains as he may please. The acceptance of the leadings of these as God’s appointees does not necessarily mean theii </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">selection </span><span class="font6">by ballot, but may be indicated merely by giving ear to their teachings In harmony with the Word of the Lord. The lead of such spiritual lieutenants of divine appointment will always be marked by spiritual victories and by the bringing of the Lord’s people Into closer heart relationship with him. Any leadership which does not produce such fruits Is evidently not of the Lord; for the spirit of the Lord leads not to bondage, ignorance or strife, but to love, Joy, peace of heart, liberty of conscience.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">ISRAEL’S FORM OF GOVERNMENT</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The nation of Israel needed no congress or legislature; for it had one Lawgiver, the Lord, and the law given at Mount Sinai was to be perpetually the guide to the nation. Under the law the priests and the Levites were the appointed helpers of the people In things pertaining to God, to Instruct them in the law and to represent them In the typical sacrificing, atonement work, etc. In each tribe, also, the elders had charge of the civil affairs of the tribe according to their capacity. As for soldiers and a war department, Israel had none. The divine law was to separate them from all other nations: and If they would remain faithful to the Ixird he was to be their protector against all antagonists.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Similarly spiritual Zion in every congregation is to look out from among themselves fit men for the services needed. God’s law is to keep them separate from the schemes, warfares and entanglements of the world. They are to be his peculiar people, and his pledge to them is that all things shall work together for their good as long as they abide faithful to him. Therefore they need no armies provided with carnal weapons, although they are all soldiers of the cross, pledged to fight against sin, especially each within himself, and to lay down their lives for each other, “the brethren”.—1 John 3:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">If the book of Judges be read as a fully complete history of Israel for those four and one-half centuries, it would be a discouraging account, and to some extent would give the inference that they were continually In sin and idolatry, and suffering punishment therefor. But this would be an unfair view' to take. On the contrary tlie record passes by the happy period of Israel’s prosperity, and specially points out their deflections from obedience to God, their punishments for such transgressions and their deliverances from tlieir troubles through the judges or deliverers whom God raised up for them. That this period was in many respects a favorable time for the Israelites is implied in the Lord’s promise, “I will restore thy judges as at the first, and thy counselors as at the beginning”.—Isaiah 1 : 26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Incidentally the story of Ruth and that of Samuel's parents give us little glimpses of the other side of the matter, glimpses of the God-fearing piety prevalent among man) of the people, glimpses of the happiness and contentment enjoyed. If in our own day we were to judge of the world’s affairs wholly by the daily history and details in the newspapers, we might get the impression that crimes, strikes, accidents, and imprisonments constituted the whole life in our land; for the great mass of the people attending to the ordinary affairs of life are scarcely mentioned. In accordance with this thought are the following lines from the poet Whittier in which lie rejoices in this land of liberty and blessing, notwithstanding the unfavorable reports thereof which go out to the world daily through the press •</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">&quot;Whnte'er of folly, shame or crime</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Within thy mighty bounds transpires, With speed defying space or time t’oinfs to us on the accusing wires; While all thy wealth of noble deeds, Thy homes of peace, thy votes unsold. Thv love that pleads for human needs,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The wrongs redressed, but half i.s told ! ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">THE FIRST RECORDED ARMAGEDDON BATTLE</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Heretofore we have pointed out that the great battle of Armageddon, the antitypical one, is near, that it will quickly follow the world war. Today’s study relates to the first of the great battles in the valley of Megiddo, noted for its many slaughters, and therefore made the basis of the divine prediction respecting the “time of trouble such as was not since there was a nation”, and which will precede and prepare the way for Messiah’s glorious rule of a thousand years.—1 Corinthians 15:24-26; Revelation 20:6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Israelites had been guilty of idolatry, and according to God’s covenant with them had been chastened by the permitting of tlieir enemies to vanquish them. They had come to great straits. Their enemies had waxed strong and high-handed. General Sisera, of the Canaanites, had humbled the Israelites of North Palestine for years, and now was coming southward with a large army intent upon victories. Tlie strength of his army is shown in tlie statement that it contained nine hundred iron chariots. By tlie time he had gotten as far southward as the valley of Megiddo, messengers readied him, informing him tlint Barak, a leader among tlie Israelites, bad improved (lie opportunity afforded by his absence and was coming southward with an army of ten thousand Israelites. Under divine guidance Barak made Mount Tabor Ins army base, the place which in Jesus’ day became known to liis followers as the Mount of Transfiguration, where the coming kingdom of Messiali was represented in a vision. Thus wo have another remarkable feature of the picture of the future, tlie association of the vision of tlie kingdom in proximity witli tlie Armageddon field of disaster picturing the changes due at this important period of transition to Messiah’s rule.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Disdaining tlie poorly armed Israelites General Sisera advanced toward Mount Tabor with his army on both sides of the river Kishon. Then it was that tlie word of tlie Lord came afresh to General Barak, directing him to advance against the army of the Canaanites. As related in our lesson, tlie slaughter was a great one. Sisera’s army was so discomfited that it scattered. A great storm and cloudburst swelled the river, making quagmires of tlie lower valleys and rendering useless the chariots of Sisera. His soldiers, fleeing for their lives, were cut down by the Israelites, while other thousands were swept by the freshets down the river into the sea. This interference of God on behalf of his people Israel is in figurative language styled the fighting of “the stars of heaven” against Sisera’s army. Similarly in the great Armageddon near at hand it will not be human might that will prevail, but the disconcerted hosts will effect the complete disruption of the present order of things; for “every man’s hand shall be against his brother and against his neighbor”. (Ezekiel 38 : 21; Zechariah 8:10; 14:13) It is the cloudburst of truth and the rising waters of knowledge which are bringing to pass this great human catastrophe, which tlie Lord will overrule for man’s blessing</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">THE POWER OF A FAITHFUL WOMAN</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Although the Lord has been pleased usually to select men in connection with his work, not only as typical characters but also as evangels of the gospel, nevertheless the Scriptures give us pictures of noble women who, because of the delinquency of men, have been almost forced into publie service by God’s providence. Notable among the instances of such in tlie Bible is the case of tlie prophetess Deborah She perceived that neglect of the divine law had borne fruit in tlie subjugation of her people, that this was spreading throughout tlie land, and that what was needed was a guide to point tlie people back to the right way—hack to God. Tlie Canaanites whom they had not conquered had conquered them.—Deuteronomy 7:1-5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This conquest was permitted of God. It had its incipient stage when the Israelites neglected the divine direction tliat they should live separate from all other people. Instead, they had begun to intermarry witli the Canaanites. These in turn had enticed tlieir husbands and their children to tlie worship of heathen gods. Apparently many of Israel who had not gone over to idolatry had nearly lost their knowledge and appreciation of the true God. This same condition is a difficulty today in this land and everywhere. Tlie revulsion of Christian people from tlie monstrous creeda) errors of the past has alienated many from the Bible, under Ilie belief that the Bible and the creeds teach the same doctrines. This is the explanation of empty pews and a distaste for religion. What tlie people need is correct information respecting tlie true God of love and his real plan, as outlined in tlie Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the dark hour of Israel’s oppression, tlie princes of tlie tribes seemed to be lacking in patriotism as well as in faith in God. Each tribe was a separate state and there was no cohesion between them, the divinely intended bond of union, the true religion, having relaxed. It was about this time that the Lord, seeking a channel through which to be gracious to his people, found tli.-.t channel in a woman —Deborah. She realized tlie situatiop more keenly than did others, probably because more deeply consecrated to God and liis service. She moved from her home in tlie northern part of the country to a central place in tlie highlands of Ephraim. From there she sent encouraging, stimulating messages to the chief men of the various tribes. She was respected : her counsel was appreciated ; her advice was sought In tins sense she judged, admonished Israel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">FULL DEVOTION OF HEART ESSENTIAL</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Deborah is styled a prophetess. This might mean a public teacher, or it might mean one through whom tlie Lord sent special messages. Some things connected witli the story indicate the latter thought. Surely tlie Lord used her, and that because she was a willing and consecrated servant of his cause, his people. What a lesson is here for all of God's people, the lesson that in order to be used in tlie Lord's service and to accomplish things for him and liis a full devotion of heart is necessary!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At an opportune time, when Sisera’s army with nine hundred chariots had proceeded southward to Megiddo, Deborah sent word to Barak, a leader in her tribe, Naphtali. She admonished that now was the time to &lt;lo something for the deliverance of the people of God, and that he should immediately march to battle with ten thousand Israelites. Barak refused to do so unless she would cooperate. She agreed to do so, forewarning him, however, that the honor of the matter would thus be divided with herself, and that he would miss a part of his blessing by reason of his lack of courage. Thus it was that when Barak’s army moved to Mount Tabor, the force was under General Barak’s command, but a woman was the real mouthpiece or agent of God, in directing the allairs of the battle which brought such signal victory to the people of Israel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">WAS SISERA’S MURDER JUSTIFIABLE?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">General Sisera’s chariots snick in the mire. Uis annj deteated. he fled afoot with others, only Io be overtaken by the victors. Entering a supposedly hospitable tent, lie hid himself and fell asleep. His hostess improved the opportunity and drove a tent-pin through his temple. By some the net Ims been denounced as a breach of hospitality, but by others it has been defended on the grounds that the custom still among tlie Arabs of Palestine is that any man w Iio Intrudes into a woman’s tent is worthy of death. At any rate let us remember that Joel was not a Christian woman, not begotten of the holy spirit, not taught in the school of Christ and that, therefore, w Indexer may be said of her would have no bearing whatever in respect to Christians, who are under the law of Ilie spirit of love.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Incidentally, let us remember that not oven one of the •lews stood in the same relationship to God and his divine purposes that true Christians occupy. Their warfare in the flesh typifies our warfare as new creatures against the weaknesses and appetites of our flesh. Let us also remember that the death of Sisera and his army did not precipitate them into a hell of torture, hut merely was the passage way by which they were “gathered to their fathers”, “slept with their fathers”. They have known nothing since, and will know nothing in the future until the time of their awakening ; and that awakening God lias graciously timed so that it will be after Messiah shall have taken possession of the world, and by the establishment of his kingdom shall have overthrown the kingdom of Satan, sin and death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In due time Sisera ami his army will come forth, like the remainder of mankind, as a result of the redemptive work of Aesus. finished gt Calx ary. They xx ill come forth in order that the grace of God may be testified to them; and that they may have an opportunity, by obedience to the laws of the kingdom, to prepare themselves to enter into everlasting life on the plane of human perfection in an earthly paradise. AVith this thought before us. it makes little difference ■whether death comes upon us through war, pestilence or disease. Only those are on trial at the present time who have board of Christ, xxho have accepted him and who have been begotten of the holy spirit as new creatures. The trial of all the remainder of the world is future; for knowledge is nn essential testing for life eternal or death eternal</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font8"><a name="bookmark11"></a>REPORT OF THE AUSTRALASIAN BRANCH</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brethren •</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Once again it is my great privilege to submit the annual report of the operations of the Australasian branch of our beloved Society in Australia and New Zealand. The year that has gone lias been a year of rejuvenation for us in these far-ilung parts of the tieUI Nmeb’en hundred and eighteen brought us anxiety bill not despair-- ami conditions that called for a large exeicise of faith Ils successo’’ Ims seen that faith justified anil paliem-e rewarded, and the Lord's work more tirmlx established here tli.in oxer liefore. For all of tins we are deeply grateful to the Giver of all good, by whose kind taxor we are permuted Io cooperate xvillt tlie Lord in the work now being accomplished.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At the time of writing I am on a pilgrim tour in the Dominion of New Zealand, and am separated by miles of blue water from the Melbourne office and the xvork. This I know, however. the past year, whatever Hie tabulated results may be, has been one of strenuous activity in nearly’ every department of the service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The high cost of living lias borne hardly upon the dear colporteurs. Not only- has it made the public slow’ about Investing in books, but it has materially swelled the colporteurs’ living expenses; and some of these dear ones have been forced temporarily to quit tlie service. We are pl.inning, however, to come to the rescue of these dear self-sae-rlflclng workers and to insure greater permanency in the colporteur service: and our grateful appreciation is specially due to those of them who in lean years and plenty have courageously stuck to the xvork. Such a splendid example Is worthy of emulation, and I am glad to report several recent accessions to that noble band.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Realizing the value of personal intercourse with tlie dear brethren I have travelled, during the past year, throughout the whole length and breadth of tlie Australian continent from Brisbane to Melbourne and from Sidney to Perth; and now T am engaging in a similar service in New Zealand. It has been very encouraging to note the zeal for service and the spiritual growth of the dear brethren everywhere. A public witness lias also been given throughout tlie land under various titles, such as, •‘’The World Has Ended”, “Bolshevism and tlie Bible”, “Christ Has Returned”. With no uncertain sound we have declared the approaching destruction of Great Babylon and the establishment of Christ’s kingdom on her ruins. There is room for much Pilgrim work in this \ .ist cont i iieu t ; and with your approval I intend to push this department of serine slid more vigorously in the coming year &lt;&nbsp;ticasiomd Pilgrim xisiis bate been made also by othi r dear Ineili’cn xx ho li.ne been niiirli used of the Lord in both a pl i' nlc ami a public c.ipacity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Tim xeir iiir.x ended lias been an unfortunate one for con-xentious, at least two id these splendid gatherings having been vetoed by tlie influenza ipmrantine regulations. In ■lanimry hist. Imwexer. there were no fewer than three such lielfiful conventions. one at Melbourne, and one at Perth, Australia, and one nt Wellington. New Zealand. Tlie Master holiday also furnished opportunity for gatherings at Adelaide, Melbourne. Perth and Brisbane, Australia, and at</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Christchurch. New Zealand. All of these happy gatherings were greatly blessed of rhe Lord and proved most lielfiful Io I hose present.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I am sure that all the dear brethren throughout Australia will join with me in appreciation of tlie generosity of the Society in canceling the debt of this branch. While not having any opportunity to enter such doors of service as tlie Lord may ofien liefore us, we shall strive, nevertheless, to work with a due sense of responsibility for the Lord’s money and with such economy as efficiency and the divine wisdom will permit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In closing let me again reiterate tlie strong desire of the dear brethren in every part of Australasia that they might see Hie face of our dear Brother Rutherford and some of tha other dear ones whose names and faces have gone throughout the earth as martyrs for the message of truth. While it is not at all our thought to attempt to force the heads of tlie Society, we trust you will regard our constant reiteration as an evidence of our great love for them and the intensity of our desire to see them in the flesh. It may be that tlie dear Lord will ofien up the way’ for that desire to Is- granted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Praying for you tlie Lord’s guidance and blessing always, and assuring you of our loving and loyal cooperation in tlie Lord’s work, I am</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Your brother and colnborer,</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">A REMARKABLE EXPERIENCE</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Fhiexds :</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I am sending you .$2.50 for The Watch Tihieb ami The Gol'ien Auh. 1 am very thankful that I have come in touch with “truth people&quot;. I like Pastor Russell’s interpretations better than those of any other person who has ever tried to teach tlie Scriptures. His explanation of the evil spirits is certainly true. Just before getting his last volume, 'The Finished Mystery,&quot; I unwittingly had become a spirit medium. Hut after the demons had blinded me by telling me lies and putting my mind in a haze so that the truths stated in tlie Bible were not understood or were forgotten 1 was linally able to throw oft ilieir wicked power. My heavenly father brought me out of their clulclms as I talked with them and read Scriptures to them telling about lhi‘ second death, etc f'iimlly they came out boldly mid said they were devils</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The ouija boards arc growing more ami more in popular Invor. 1 was talking lo a I’iespy lei mu minister about them and asked Inai to preach against them, but he would not. He knows nothing about tlie Table's leachings concerning spirits and would not warn I.is people against them. But when I mentioned Pastor Russell he became very indignant and said many things against </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">hun</span><span class="font4"> Afterward, he made an attack on Pastor Russell from the pulpit, but nearly everything lie said was, of course, false. He knows nothing concerning Pastor Russell’s beliefs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I have unit the ciiurclics, as I consider Pastor Russell's books together with Tim Waich Tower to he more Scriptural and Christ-like than are the churches.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">1 am very thankful that my heavenly father sent the .young man to me with &quot;The finished Mystery&quot;. Since then 1 have bought t he other books of (lit' series.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Belov i.i&gt; BimrtiKEN •</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As 1 am now on vacation and revisiting some ol ihe places &lt;d' precious memories in .bunaica, I take tlie opportunity to express my fervent love lor yon and all 1 tic dear &lt;'olaboro&gt; s w 11h you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I wish you to know tliai I ,im greatly blessed by the v'1-.ils ol I'm: W.vkii Tow i.n lor i he past three years, that I heartily endiuse I he several special articles which seem to leaeli a glorious climax in 'Blessed are the fearless&quot; and “Glority mg tied&quot;. 1 have special pleasure in Hie calm and gentle lone ol all the articles which have come from your pen; so courageous, so powerful, and yet so full of love and kindness toward opposers. Surely those of our brelliren who are deceived by (lie dazzle and llourish of &quot;perverse things” should be wonderfully helped to see the deception of the adversary and be delivered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Twelve years ago, 1 named the last volume of the series ■“The finished Mystery”, expressing to a class of the Lord's people the belief that it would indeed be “the handwriting on the wall&quot;, and that it would do a mighty work of testing among the people of God. But little did I imagine I myself would be involved to the extent that I should doubt the truth of its jiresentations: yel I had a little trouble with it, ho that after tlie first reading, I was unwilling to circulate it for a time, I had a little experience, however, which made me quickly remember that it was intended of the laird to be a test to the professed house of Israel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Immediately after the death of our beloved Brother Russell, 1 began the study of Ezekiel and came to a fair under standing of his prophesies. I remember my findings on Ezekiel 28 and hovv the comments in Volume 7 seemed at first to be so much at variance with what I had concluded, by diligent comparison of Scripture, lo be a correct understanding. But hovv astonished I was to Ibid, on </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">xecond </span><span class="font4">reading, that nearly all of its presentations on that chapter are precisely as 1 had proven I’orrect eighteen months before! 1 saw the poinl ; 1 passed the test ; and 1 truly affirm that from Ihe spring of 1918 until now, when 1 am reading ihe book for the fifth time, my &quot;joy in the Lord&quot; has been twofold greater than that of my previous twenty-one years in the narrow way</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">1 shall welcome a new edition in the Lord's providence, with its &quot;many like words&quot; of similar import. But I love it in its original form, before Jehoiakim used his knife on it ; lor it offers a large opportunity for tlie holy spirit lo manliest itself in A</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">non leiliic,</span><span class="font4"> in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">nieik</span><span class="font4">iie.xw, ami in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">lore of the In i thri n—the</span><span class="font4"> final test of sonship.

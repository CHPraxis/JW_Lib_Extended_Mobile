<h3><a name="bookmark7"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark8"></a>Real Prison Reform</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">FEW persons are interested in prison reform, some of them on humanitarian and others on political grounds. The very few who are really interested on humanitarian grounds are usually woefully lacking in knowledge of actual prison conditions. Under the leadership F </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">of</span><span class="font10"> an affable and entertaining guide, picked from the guards with a view to making a favorable impression on visitors, they have been swished deftly around the more public parts of the prison and often have the idea that it is a very nice place. True, even to those who know the inside life of a prison, it is possible to imagine worse conditions; but that is beside the question of real reform.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Of those who are periodically interested in prisons on political grounds there is much occasion for questioning their entire sincerity; for they deliberately overlook the most truthful and most accurate source of information—the prisoners themselves. There are some difficulties in • the way of securing complete information from V- men while they are actually under sentence, but there is no great difficulty involved in gathering it from men who have served sentences and are out. Of what earthly use is it to ask Judge So-and-So or Senator This-and-That his views on prison reform, when he has no idea of what a prison is like?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">There would be minor differences of opinion even among prisoners and ex-prisoners as to what could-^be most advantageously introduced in the shape oPreforms; but most of them, we believe,wouTd agree on these, named in the order of their importance:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10">(1) Judges should be obliged by law to spend thirty days in all jails to which they are likely to have to sentence men (or at least in one of the jails) and sixty days in the penitentiary to which they expect to commit prisoners. This should be as necessary to qualification for a judge’s commission as a diploma from a law school. For obvious reasons it is not likely that such a reform as this will ever be suggested by the judiciary itself, but we believe that the better-minded of them would agree to its reasonableness and would submit to its requirements. The idea has the approval of God Almighty; for he sent his Son, an entirely innocent person, into the world and allowed him to suffer almost unthinkable indignities “that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God”. (Hebrews 2:17) Such judges would have to serve under a </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">bona fide</span><span class="font10"> sentence, unknown to the prison officials. Sfkty days would not injure them, and it would actually pay; for they would increase in “wisdom never learned at schools”. It is a serious matter for one human being to deprive another human being of his liberty for long periods of time.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10">(2) Separate absolutely and entirely all prisons from state or federal departments of justice. Why should a prison be under the control of the very department which was instrumental in having the prisoner indicted and sentenced? Has not that department done enough when it has turned him over to the prison officials? Is there any adequate reason why prisons should not be managed by prison commissions, only one member of which could be of the legal or judicial professions?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10">(3) Establish a parole board that paroles— one that has some regard for the evident intent of the parole laws. This board should be absolutely separate from the departments of justice -and from judges and district attorneys, who usually are employes of such departments. Why not have such a board composed of civilians, not professional politicians? Under present parole arrangements it frequently occurs that a prisoner will secure a recommendation from the officials of the prison, but fail to get ratification from the judge or district attorney who had to do with sentencing him to prison.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">' Take this actual example: An Italian was convicted of complicity in. a counterfeiting scheme and sentenced by a judge to three years’ imprisonment. The man was guilty and the sentence was probably not excessive, as such sentences go. But note now what happens. The man knew not over a dozen words of English and in disappointment he employed four of them, saying, &quot;Aw, go to h----The judge</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">promptly added five more years to his sentence, making, eight, ostensibly to impress the man with the dignity and majesty of the law. But was it the dignity of the law or his own dignity of which he was more conscious ? Surely the law was not magnified by such an outburst. If six months had been added, the majesty of the law would really have been revealed. What chance would that man have for a parole, even if he were a model prisoner* What chance did he have! None, while that judge lived or was in office. The man served his time, barring a few weeks cut off by presidential commutation. *</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10">(4) Abolition of limited outgoing mail. There is no-earthly or heavenly reason why a man should-not be allowed to write all he wants to. The limits have been removed on incoming mail in most prisons. Removing the limitations on outgoing mail would not materially increase the burdens of the prison postoffice. There would be an increase for the first few weeks,, then it would drop back to something near normal. Among one thousand prisoners there would probably be not over fifty who would write more than of^e letter a week. There is no real reason why either incoming or outgoing mail should be read, though almost no prisoner will object to having the envelope opened so that the management could be sure no harmful narcotics or saws, etc.,\ came in. If a prisoner’s outgoing mail rose above a certain number per month, let him pay'the postage.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">(0) Absolute and unequivocal abolition of compulsory attendance at religious services. To force attendance at religious service of any kind is uu-Christian, un-American, unconstitutional, and inhuman. It works hardship to Christians, to the irreligious, and to Jews, and could do no good to any one. Have the religious services if desired, make them as attractive as possible, but let the men go on their own volition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">(6) Select the major officials from ex-prison^* ers—surely there are enough in all walks of life and in all the varying degrees of capacity. By the most hardened and disinterested prison official it will Ixi admitted that a certain percentage of the prisoners are innocent. Those who have the best opportunity of knowing aver that these innocent run somewhat near ten per cent of the whole number. If the courts are nine-tenths efficient, that is not a bad average for imperfect and often biased human beings, even though it is hard on the tenth-tenth. Among those who are guilty there is probably a good forty per cent who have sentences out of all proportion to the crime committed. Even if some of these men became wardens or deputy wardens they could not mitigate the sentences, but they could approach the problems of the men with sympathetic hearts and understanding minds—a thing which few outsiders, even though well-intentioned, can do. The men do not want to be coddled or toadied to; many of them played the game and lost and they are willing to take their medicine in a manly way; but they^do want and are entitled to talk to officers ashman to man and not as caged beasts to man. '</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark10"></a>Stripes and Stripes</span></h3>
<p><span class="font15">S</span><span class="font10">TRIPES for prisoners’ clothing have been abolished in the better-ordered prisons of this country, but the stripes which attach to the man’s reputation are as difficult to eradicate as though they were actual stripes in his skin. The old idea, which was generally accepted in Jean Vai jean’s day, ‘•‘once a convict always a convict”, has no foundation in reason, justice, or fact. There are a few professional flirters with prison cells; these take their chances, give no quarter and ask none. But these do not make up the bulk of prison inmates.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The most of them are men who have either (1) violated the law in some purely technical &gt;ense, unacquainted with the multitudinous statutes on the law books, or (2) succumbed to various kinds of allurements under heavy stress,</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">and (3) a few others who have set out to beat the state or government in some manner that does not involve the lives or happiness of other citizens but merely property, and (4) political prisoners—those who have committed some statutory offense against the state as such, as distinguished from offenses against life or </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">I property</span><span class="font10"> of the state’s citizens.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Added to these is a small fifth class of innocent men, and a sixth class, also of minor proportions, who are guilty in both intent and fact. But whatever the occasion for their incarceration, it is surely an incontrovertible proposition that, when a man has been convicted by self or by jury, been sentenced by an authorized judge, and has served his sentence, he has paid all that the law demanded of him as a penalty for his misdeed. It not infrequently happens that with his discharge the one-time prisoners greatest difficulties begin. If he is a man of affluence he may not need to worry; but if he was well cleaned up financially by the expense of his de-? fense fight and by his expense while in prison, he may experience grave difficulty. His position is somewhat recognized by the law when it requires the prison officials to provide him with an outfit of clothing and a ticket back to the point from wliieh he was sentenced. But this docs not get him a job.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It must be admitted that there are certain philanthropic agencies which help in securing wage jobs for men that are not experienced in clerical, professional, or executive positions. It is seldom that such agencies have anything to offer for professional men. The lawyer cannot return to his profession. His own fellows bar him. The doctor can seldom return to his prac-, lice: no opportunity is given him to profit from <sup>0</sup> his lesson. Occasionally a former employer will take a man back for sake of the man’s family.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">But why should there be any charity, why any patronizing at all? If the penally has been paid, why make the man continue to pay it for the rest of&quot;his life? Why is he barred from civil service positions, though his services may be most expert? Is it not because of the old idea, such aa voiced by Emmanuel Kant, that the state is aVny^ie being with a soul and that this soul has had its dignity offended? All right, suppose that were true. The state by its properly constituted agents has prescribed what is assumed to be a just retribution for such offense. Does the government profess to be satisfied in the matter and at the same time dissatisfied? If the ex-prisoner happens to be </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">a man </span><span class="font10">of means the government will gladly let him invest his money in bonds or other government securities. Fine, perfectly proper. But why discriminate against the man who has only time, skill and experience to invest in government activities ? There are no statistics to show thht a man is less reliable as an employe after he has been a prisoner than before.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Furthermore, why should there be no recourse against the state for one who has suffered false imprisonment ? Do we still believe that the king can do no wrong T Government agents with almost unlimited legal machinery and means at their disposal can, if they wish, make a very sorry time for a man of meager pecuniary backing. He may not be able to stand the expense of a fight long enough to prove himself innocent. He is put into prison for one, three, five years, until his case worries around to where he is shown to be not guilty. The man, if in middle age, is financially ruined for life. His family has suffered great hardship; yet there is no practical means of redress. He cannot sue the government for the mistakes of its agents, though in every other kind of business it is a well-established rule of action that principals are responsible for the acts of their agents. I# the judge and prosecuting attorney responsible for his incarceration are still alive, he might proceed against them individually or under </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font10">conspiracy charge, if there seemed to be any element of conspiracy. But what prosecuting attorney would show zeal in presenting such a case to the grand jury and in carrying it through the courts? What judge could be found who would be willing to pronounce sentence against a fellow judge? Then possibly </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">there </span><span class="font10">was no evil design whatever on the part of the officials, but the unjust imprisonment </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">was sim</span><span class="font10">ply due to human imperfection and frailty. What then ? Even if an ex-prisoner had pecuniary means with which to carry on litigation he has no statutory grounds for so doing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It has been left for heathen Japan to take the lead in improvement in some of these matters. There, if a man is discriminated against in the social or commercial world simply because he has served a sentence in prison, the person who discr</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">imin</span><span class="font10">ates against him is subject to fine </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">and </span><span class="font10">imprisonment; and the law is enforced. Furthermore, a man falsely or wrongly imprisoned can get full financial redress, not from individuals but from the government. The people by its representatives made the mistake; the people should pay for its mistakes, just as any individual is required to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Persia and the World War</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19200121_files/g_E_19200121-6.png" alt="" style="width:14pt;height:16pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font10">IKE the nations, of South America, and all other nations that were able to keep out of the conflict, Persia was benefited in some ways by the world war. Its capital and trade have doubled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The country is a high plateau, 2,000 to 6,000 feet high, with no railways, few roads, only one navigable river, and is cut off from easy communication with the rest of the world by mountain chains on the north and south.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The rains of ages have washed the soil from the hillsides, seaming them with gullies, and making travel difficult and expensive. It may be said that virtually the whole trade of Persia is carried on the back of beasts of burden such as traversed the country twenty-five hundred or more years ago.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">These conditions have largely cut Persia off from the rest of the world, although the culture of its inhabitants has not greatly suffered because of this; and it is known as the most enlightened of the Mohammedan nations, the Persian being styled the Frenchman of the east.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The first noteworthy appearance of Persia on the pages of history is as a part of the Medo-Persian empire, established by Cyrus the Great, the second empire in history that bore sway over the whole civilized earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">When the third world empire made its appearance, Alexander the Great invaded Persia and traversed it with his conquering hosts from one end to the other, going on through Afghanistan and the Khyber Pass into India, and returning to Babylon by Baluchistan and the-shore route along the Persian Gulf.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The priests of Persia teach the boys and men to disregard and despise everything said to them by the women, and as a consequence the Persian has no home life worthy of the name. Insolence frpm her twelve-year-old son is expected by the Persian mother as inevitable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">When the Shah of Persia visited Paris some years ago he shocked the hotel patrons by throwing his chop bones under the table after he had finished his meal. He probably thought there was no reason why he should not feel ■ at home and act accordingly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Before the war the finances of Persia were under the control of an American, Morgan Schuster. He managed these so efficiently, and protected the Shah so effectively from the jm- a positions of the financiers of more highly; civil- &quot;&nbsp;ized nations, that Schuster was compelled to resign his position. The diplomatic pressure i became too strong. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The pearl fisheries of the Persian Gulf have an annual output of about $1,000,000 per year. , Roses flourish so profusely that they are cul- <sub>( </sub>tivated in fields for the purpose of manufacture into perfumes. The population is estimated at about 9,500,000. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It is certain that the kingdom of Persia is the second part, the breast and arms of silver, of the great image which Nebuchadnezzar saw । in his dreams, and which the Prophet Daniel explained to him; and it is equally certain that , the kingdom which is to replace the Persian ' kingdom, and all the other kingdoms seen in &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font10">that vision, is the kingdom of the Lord, Mes- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;’</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark14"></a>Thrift Supremely Needed</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">ALL the nations of the world are today like ** the prodigal son. They have borrowed their future inheritances; and after a drunken debauch lasting from August 1,1914, to November 11, 1918, they are now engaged in feeding the hogs—the profiteers—in a way that was never before true.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The average working man is limited in education and has no knowledge whatever of political economy. With the outbreak of the war many of these men suddenly discovered as munition workers or ship riveters that they could get three times as much money as they had ever earned before in their lives. Myriads of these men knew so little of economics that it would be folly even to try to tell them that all the wages paid to them during the war had to come out of somebody's savings. And having flirted for a time with wages of $10 to $20 per day, lots of them have concluded that the world has changed; and that instead of having to work hard for a living hereafter, and to be careful of the dimes, nickels and pennies, they can safely spend every cent they earn, without any reckoning day ever arriving.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">No heresy could be worse. If there was need for these men to save during the war so that they could participate in the various loans, it is still more necessary now; for the interest on all the loans must he paid, and the running expenses of the governments must be paid, and there is no way in which these expenses can be met except by the savings of the people. Whether these savings of the people are obtained indirectly by loans or directly by taxation, it is certain that these obligations must be met, and it is self-evident that the governments cannot borrow from him who has saved nothing.</span></p>

<p><span class="font15">A</span><span class="font10">N INDUSTRIAL conference was recently assembled in Canada, attended by one-third employes, orih-third employers and one-third representatives of the public. Resolutions were adopted looking toward legislation on unemployment, sickness, old-age insurance, minimum wage laws, better pay for school teachers, better housing conditions, compulsory education up to fourteen years of age, liberty of press, freedom of speech, eight-hour days, and union recognition and collective bargaining. The conference* ■ was divided on several points, but put the questions up to the federal and provincial prime ministers for consideration and action.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The commission said in part:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“The commission believes that the day has passed when an employer should deny his employes the right to organize—a right claimed by employers themselves and not denied by the workers. Employers gain nothing by opposition; for the employes organize anyway, and refusal only leaves in their minds a rankling sense of injustice. The prudent employer will recognized such organization and deal with its duly accredited representatives?*</span></p>

A woman in New York city lived on seventy-five cents per day so that she might leave a fortune of $250,000 unimpaired, to be divided between her two sons. One of her sons, a doctor, she appointed executor. The doctor paid a lawyer $35,000 to settle the estate, and then divided what was left between himself and his brother.

<h3><a name="bookmark21"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark22"></a>The Six-Hour Heresy</span></h3>
<p><span class="font15">F</span><span class="font10">TENRY FORD startled the industrial world</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">A when he announced his policy of a minimum wage of $5.00 a day and he has recently raised that to $8.00. It could not be done, was the Durden of the press that represents the reactionary sector of the manufacturing front; it would disturb relations between employer and labor in an ever-widening circle. But it was done; for Ford profited by attracting the cream of the workers; and other concerns still paid what they chose. Ford produced ‘‘Fords&quot; better and cheaper because the men were more content to work under conditions prevailing in his great shops than in the establishments of others less democratic than himself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Time was when the twelve-hour day was impossible; yet it worked out all right. Then in succession the industrial impossibilities were the ten-hour, the nine-hour and the eight-hour day; but no concern that was up to date in its methods ever Jost anything by the better working conditions spelled by the shorter work-day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Now the impossible thing is the six-hour day. Not merely impossible, but absolutely, to the nth degree, impossible, unthinkable, unbelievable, visionary, absurd, insane, is this latest industrial heresv!</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Why? '</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Because it hath not been so received from the fathers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">But Baron Leverhulme. than whom no one in the world, at least in the British world, knows better how to make money out of soap, comes and says that the six-hour work-day is perfectly feasible. The baron says that it is easy in a business where the overhead expenses, including interest on capital, salaries of partners and managers, repairs and renewals, depreciation, rent and ordinary taxes, are together equal the pay-roll cost.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Here are his figures: Number of articles produced under the eight-hour day and forty-eight-hour “week, 1000; pay-roll. $5000; overhead expenses, $5000; production cost per article or unit produced, $10.00. The raw material cost would be the same per unit unless reduced by a loss co^t fdj a larger quantity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">If the^working hours were reduced to a six-hour day and a thirty-six-hour week, and two shifts worked in the plant, the baron figures the cost as follows, the same wage being paid for the six as for the eight-hour day: Articles produced, 1500: pay-roll $10,000; overhead, $5060; total, $15,000: unit cost, $10.00. In other words, the impossible has been done—the men work six instead of eight hours, and the goods cost no more to produce apiece. Work is given to two men, where it had been available for but one!</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">To this the objection is raised that before the war the pay-roll in billions of dollars in American factories was 4.5 billions, and overhead only 2.5 billions. On this basis a factory producing say 1000 articles would cost $4500 pay-roll and $2500 overhead; total $7000, with unit cost of $7.00 per article. The baron did not allow for any increase in overhead, but more salary must be paid managers for longer hours; aud allowing for an increase also in overhead, the figures would be: Articles produced, 1500: pay-roll, $9000; overhead $3500; total cost, $12,500; unit cost, $8.33. It looks as though it couldn't be done, and get the goods out as cheaply as before. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The factor that will produce goods as inexpensively as before and yet permit the six-hour <sup>1 </sup>day is the attitude of the worker. He will feel better about his work and work a little faster if he is to have a 25 per cent shorter workingday. Suppose the worker works one-fifth or 20 per cent faster than he did under the eight-hour day; that this is readily possible may be seen from the rate of work of the average worker, who feels that any increased speed on his part may result in his having to meet that speed at all times. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">With production one-fifth, or 20 per cent, faster than in an eight-hour day the figures would be: Pay-roll, $9000; overhead. $3500: total $12,500; articles produced 1800; unit cost, $6.94 per article. The miracle is quite feasible, but it takes the cordial cooperation of the worker to accomplish it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It is certain, however, that in the Golden Age, when the motto of trades unionism, &quot;One for all, and all for one*’, becomes a living reality with every one, including both employer and employe, the possibilities of the worker drawing on his untouched latent powers will cause industry’’ and production to jump forward. When for the principle of self-interest is substituted that of real love of man for man, the incentive to do everything reasonably possible for one another vk-ill actuate men and result in great benefits for the whole people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;’</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark25"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark26"></a>A Language Museum</span></h3>
<p><span class="font15">I</span><span class="font10">NSTITUTE of Phonetics is the official title of the new language museum which the British Government is about to start in London, ' so that it can furnish its traders with better means of dealing with natives than have hitherto existed. Some idea of the need for such an Institute may be gathered from the fact that in many portions of Southeastern Asia a different language prevails in every 500 square miles of territory: in other words one can not go twenty-five miles in any direction without running into a new language.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Methods for making records of all languages are approaching precision. By means of the X-ray, photographs are obtained of the exact position of the vocal organs necessary to produce any sounds, and the sounds themselves are photographed or transcribed by a needle into / phonetic curves on smoked paper. Studying these records the linguists are able to convert any language into English sounds and thus to reduce it to writing. By means of this Institute it is hoped that the traders will hereafter be able to do business with the natives without the aid of interpreters. Arrangements are also under way for the preservation of current dialects and an attempt will be made to restore the languages spoken in Chaucer’s and Shakespeare’s times. Similar institutes have long existed in France and Germany.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Recalling the scattering of humankind and the confusion of their tongues at the Tower of Babel (Genesis 11:1-9), we are impressed with the thought that the means now being taken to , preserve records of all languages indicates that they have served their purpose and that now, in the dawn of the Golden Age, we are approaching a time when there will be but one language in general use, as was the case at first.</span></p>

<p><span class="font15">C</span><span class="font10">HRISTIAN citizenship in the United States is said to be in a bad way. Instead of the “unparalleled moral and spiritual uplift” expected by unpractical decu-inairws from the war, the same theorists report that opportunities are multiplying rapidly for sexual temptation ard license; marriage is being deferred until middle life; divorce is increasing; abortions are on the increase; the sex appeal is universal, everywhere, in the newspapers, at the theater, the movie, the street carnival, the dance, the fair; society reeks with it, the home is steepe&lt;b in it, schools condone and often encourage*'it, professional life wallows in it and the Government is often influenced by it—so says President B. S. Steadwell of the National Purity Federation. At the rate the people are traveling, it is feared that America will strike bottom on the level of the ancient pagan orgies of the worship of licentiousness. One of the greatest agencies for moral decline is said to be the automobile, which supplies opportunities for secret association and puts the country road house practically at the city limits.</span></p>

<p><span class="font15">A</span><span class="font10">MERICANS have a well-earned reputation</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">• as good spenders. An unprecedented demand exists for every kind of luxury at any price. On the twenty-seven kinds of luxuries listed by the Government the 1919 import tax exceeds that for 1918 by 12o%. Imports of necessities show no particular increase; but in such articles for women as feathers, furs, jewels and perfumery the value in 1919 is about six times that in 1918. Now that the saloon has gone, fair woman is getting more of her share of the money and is showing herself a spender of the first order. Money is better spent than hoarded, but better still invested where it may produce more wealth. The present prosperity is not likely to continue indefinitely; and when it ends, the spenders will wish they had saved or invested what they have been so lavishly wasting. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">High living is fun—until the bills pour iir. Habits of luxury demand continuance, and destroy all tendency to the traits that succeed. Not merely will the spenders be forced to economy and thrift, but they are liable to swell the hosts of discontent.</span></p>

<p><span class="font15">M</span><span class="font10">R. JOHN D. ROCKEFELLER, Sr., is long</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">. since out 01 business. He has just added $100,000,000 to his vast gifts for education and philanthropy. At present he is devoting his time and much of his money to the question of the preservation of health and the prevention of disease.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">We do not know how much Air. Rockefeller is worth, and it does not seem to be our business to moke him tell, but he is said to be worth about $1,000,000,000. Supposing that he is worth that amount; and that it was all invested in freight ears at the old price of $500 each. We got to figuring on that and found out something. Such a fortune -would buy a string of 2,000,000 standard cars.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">And how long a train would that make? Suppose the train was made up in Jersey City, and the cars were each forty feet long and added one by one as the train progressed on its way. Before the caboose left the yards at Jersey City the engine would have traversed the route indicated by the following cities, and in the order named:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Newark, Ti’enton, Philadelphia, Wilmington (Del.), Baltimore, Washington, Richmond, Norfolk, Wilmington (N.

<p><span class="font10">The train would he 15.152 miles long, sufficient to cross the continent five times, or to reach in a straight line three-filths of the way around the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Mr. Rockefeller made some of his money in the. oil business. and there is still some money in ltie oil business apparently, for we notice that Mr. F.figor, the new President of the Standard</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Oil Company, not long ago paid $100,000 for one little book seven inches long, five and a quarter inches wide and half an inch thick, published in London in 1619; the only known copy of the first edition of Shakespeare’s works.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">O Charity, What Sins!</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">O</span><span class="font10"> CHARITY, what sins have been committed in thy name! In the Army and Navy Bazaai^ hi the autumn of 1917 a net sum of $645 was raised for &quot;relief*’ at a cost of aver $71,000. At most, charity is a plaster which covers up a sore that had better be exposed to the sunlight and the air.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">We do not see anything very charitable in the founding of an orphan asylum by’ a man who has made his money by the use of child labor, of* the founding of an old folks’ home </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">by</span><span class="font10"> a man who has overworked and underpaid men and women until they have broken down before their time. He is trying to discharge a just debt in a poor way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">We do not see anything very charitable in a gift of old clothes to the poor on the part of those who have such large incomes that they do not know what to do with the surplus revenues continually pouring in upon them. A real charity was that of a landlord in Wakefield, Mass., who recently made to a tenant the gift of a house in which he had lived for twenty-six years and had paid rent continually and faithfully during all that time. The man who did this is worthy of a statue in the ^public square of lus city. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The indiscriminate giving to beggars puts a premium upon beggary. Not long ago a onelegged beggar refused a permanent job at $18 per week because, he said, he could make $40 ■ per week at begging. Another one-legged man sits in his old clothes on the sidewalk during '&quot;working hours’’, but on Sundays and holidays nuts on an artificial leg and a Sunday suit and moves about with as much ease as anybody.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">So-called “organized charity” is for the most part a disorganized and inefficient way of trying to patch up a situation which makes it possible that in the same city there should be some people worth hundreds of millions of dollars, and others equally honest, and perhaps even more industrious, who cannot earn enough to keep their children properly fed and clothed. Three of Philadelphia's recent charity drives were failures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In two European countries, one of which nobody dares to name, it has been recognized for a generation that a citizen who has produced things for his fellows for thirty or forty years has earned the right to live; and he is given an old-age pension.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">A form of charity has been started in Toledo which gives promise of doing real good. Ihc Social Service Federation is trying to improve the furniture in the homes of the poor, and has invited and received gifts of almost everything uhbe found in any home, ranging all the way from rocking-horses to violoncellos. The Federation is trying to give the touch of personal interest without which charity is a detestable thing. It makes a point of having a visiting housekeeper prepare and serve a meal on a dining table in the way in which a meal should he prepared and served, thus to elevate the home ideals. We wish this effort well. If continued in the spirit in which it is being started, it can hardly fail to be a real blessing to both its founders and its beneficiaries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">/ Not a few people are interested in charities after the manner of Gehazi, the servant of Elisha. The Lord, at Elisha’s request, had just healed Naaman, the Syrian general, of his leprosy, but refused to accept anything at his hands. Gehazi coveted the gifts which Naaman had exhibited and ran after him with a great &quot;drive” for money for the theologians, &quot;the sous of the prophets”. He got the money, about $2000, and valuable gifts of clothing. Upon his return to Elisha, the prophet asked him where he had been. Gehazi denied having been anywhere; whereupon Elisha rebuked him for appropriating to himself gifts asked in the name of religion and said, &quot;The leprosy of Naaman shall cleave unto thee, and unto thy seed tori' ever. And he went out from his presence a leper as white as snow”.—2 Kings 5: 27.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark33"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark34"></a>Prohibition at Work</span></h3>
<p><span class="font15">O</span><span class="font10">NE of the effects of prohibition came to fight the other day when $25,000 was offered for a $100 share of the stock of Huyler's, whose $15,000 capital stock is worth $3,750,000. Lowney’s stock has advanced from $75 a share to $185.^ Page &amp;&nbsp;Shaw stock goes at $200. Continental Candy started at about $7 and now is $14. Loft’s was $12.50, but now sells for $26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Back of the boom in candy is national prohibition. The prediction has come true that millions accustomed to liquor would turn to candy. The coffee industry, too, is having a big boom on account of the demand for a good beverage in lieu of the defunct alcoholics. The establishment o- -toffee houses is not far off, to take the place of saloons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">But the backers of the great reform realize that their work is not finished; for they say that then* is &quot;tern business ahead. The obtaining df national prohibition is chiefly the work of the Protestant clergy; and as the Protestant churches enroll only 25,000,000 of the population, or 23 per cent, of whom fully 5,000,000 do not actively favor prohibition, there are but 20,000,000 Protestants behind the militant reformers, or 19 per cent of the population. Thu clerical leaders of the movement, who have gone to great lengths politically and wielded their lobby with such telling effect in the state legislatures to bring about the prohibition miracle, are concerned over what confronts them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">One of the former leaders of the political Anti - Saloon League of Virginia, Methodist Bishop James Cannon of Texas, expresses his apprehension: &quot;Although the liquor traffic has been outlawed in this country, it is still alive, not asleep, nor dead, but alive and openly defiant. During the next year you may look for some progress by the liquor people; and this will continue until the people are aroused to the realization that this traffic is really an outlaw, which needs chaining, and until it is chained permanently, it will endeavo$ to institute an era of lawlessness and murder. * There is danger aheadI”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">&quot;The liquor traffic,” continues Bishop Cannon, “will defy the law, and will shoot down men who go out to enforce your law. This has already been done in Virginia. You should not allow your state to be honeycombed with such outlaws, to continue without punishment, any more than you would allow thieves and other lawbreakers to go without their just deserts”. Bishop Cannon appreciates how difficult will be for a minority to enforce their will upon an indifferent majority, in the face of an active, unscrupulous and thoroughly organized body such as the saloonmen will have in the field.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">To intimidate violators of the FederalAmend-nient many laws of great stringency have been proposed, on the theory that the more terrible the legal penalties, the less will offenders be inclined to break the law. As a matter of fact the only effectual preventive of crime is the absolute certainty of immediate punishment even under rather mild penalties; and with a large body of the people indifferent or hostile to prohibition, the sureness of punishment is very doubtful in far the greater portion of the violations of the law. This is evidenced by the great increase in drunkenness as an offense in most of the cities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The new reform by Christian America has elicited the warm approval of the head of the Moslem Church. Abraham Effendi, spiritual head of the Mohammedans, was greatly pleased when the news came to him of how America had turned over a leaf. He said: “It is with pride that we observe America's adoption of proliibi-tion after trying drunkenness. Our law regards drink as the worst evil, because it breeds other evils, whereas other habits may hot do this. Sobriety was the secret of Islam's success as the builder of empires. But drinking brought ruin. It came from contact with Christian Europe, whose other bad habits we acquired, at least in nur cities, for the country is still sober. Our women do not drink. If ever Islam recovers, it will be because prohibition is restored to make men strong, clean and intellectual. I am delighted to observe that America is realizing God's command as spoken to our prophet&quot;. Christian Boston has just sent a shipload of its outlawed rum to Constantinople in the hope that the benighted total abstainers of Moslem heathendom will turn the rum into funds for the spread of the gospel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Some of the saloonkeepers are turning their plants into intellectual centers. One of them hoisted the slogan. “While you can't get booze, drink of the Pierian Spring', and he is doing a rushing business in books, with the sign, “Good books, 25 cents each. Improve your time’’. The reason was given by the bartender: “I noticed all the men who were in the habit of getting drunk at night sitting around having nothing to dm They were quite lost for a means of spending their time. The riling was a success as soon as the crowds got used io the strange-looking things across the bar. Here they feel at home, and not embarassed while they look for the book they w|sb. . Philosophy and sociology are most desired. V£ry little fiction is wanted; they leave that for the women&quot;. Not a few saloons are turned into restaurants, and furnish the best meals for the money to be had in town.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It is the argument of the liquor men that most of the people want at least a little to drink, and that the best interests of the community are served by permitting the serving of intoxicating beverages through a system of orderly and “respectable&quot; saloons; otherwise the people will make their drink at home, the total of drunkenness will be increased, and the liquor dritfik will be of the worst description. This contention seems to be borne out by the alleged doubling of arrests for disorderly conduct due to intoxication, since war-time prohibition went into effect; but we doubt the truth of the statement. The difficulty has been that in the past the respectable saloons were far outnumbered by the drinking places of a low type where drunkenness, drugs and women were the vogue; and this condition was attributable to the commercializing of the trade by the great breweries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Every effort at reform is commendable; but reformers must not forget that they are opposing insuperable odds in the fallen condition of humanity, on account of which every good work has to be incessantly fought for against powers of evil that at any instant may bring about the destruction of the achievement of decades. The builders of the prohibition structure must not feel too bitterly disappointed if the next few years, in the prevailing spirit of unrest, should behold a partial failure of their well-meant plans. It is too soon to expect Millennial conditions through any reform that may yet be undertaken; but the reforms are cpming soon, under the auspices of the approaching Golden Age, when such efforts will not be in vain, but will have back of them not merely a majority sentiment but a power for good which nothing can successfully withstand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">For the world is yet in the night time. The Golden Age will be the day time, the era of light, and the people then will become children of light. Now ‘'they that sleep, sleep in the night; and they that be drunken are drunken in the night&quot;. Then the sentiment will be: ‘To are the children of light, and the children of the day, not of the night nor of darkness; therefore, let us uot sleep; but let ns watch and be sober. Let us who are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love; and for an helmet, the hope [in the mind] of salvation&quot;. And world-wide the hope will grow into certainty that &quot;God hath not appointed us ro wrath, but to obtain salvation'*.—1 Thess. 5: 5-9.</span></p>

The <sup>/</sup>T'HE supply of sulphur for the world formerstreams run as full as ever they did; and * ly came from Sicily, and was obtained with difficulty, not only because about fifty per cent of the sulphur mined was wasted, but because the noxious fumes generated in its purification, or smelting were extremely destructive of plant and animal life for mileS around</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark37"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark38"></a>Hie White Coal Pile </span><span class="font10">millions of horse power that would do the work of the nation, and possibly of the world, are running to waste every day in the United States </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">as </span><span class="font10">they have done for centuries.</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">Most of these white coal piles are in the far West, many of them on Government land, although there are many in the eastern states.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Water power is expensive to develop, because the whole plant must be completed before there is any return. Hence large capital is required; and as the Government is not engaged in the business of selling power or lights, it must entrust this development to others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The coal shortage is making lots of people think about these water powers, and what a lot of good could be done by the current that could be generated ii we had our streams all harnessed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Congress has the matter up now and is endeavoring to find some way to attract capital to these fields, and save the nation's coal and oil, develop new industries, build up new communities, provide employment for labor, and increased markets for agricultural products.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It is not as easy a task as could be desired. Many of the common people are fearful of seeing these great heritages of the nation fall into the maw of the combinations of capital that now control so many of the necessities and accessories of life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It seems to us that if the Government could build water powers by employing soldiers for the task, it could rent the completed plants to operating companies, municipalities, cooperative societies or other entities that could oper-ateiliem advantageously for all concerned, without bringing aux* great groups of capital into the problem.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">We are sure that the development of these water powers is one of the blessings that await mankind in^the Golden Age, and perhaps it is just as &quot;Well that the development has been deferred so that the people will be the ones to receive the benefits instead of the few who just bow are easting longing looks in that direction.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark39"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark40"></a>Ihe Mining of Sulphur</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">Within the past quarter century, the </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">sulphur </span><span class="font10">supply has come almost entirely from the </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">vast </span><span class="font10">beds of it which lie far down under the subsoil of Louisiana, covered with an impenetrable bed of quicksand. Fortunes were expended in various plans to find a way through this oil-saturated quicksand, and finally a method was perfected. The sulphur is now obtained by melting it with hot water forced down one pipe, transforming it into a yeast by forcing compressed air through another pipe, and letting it boil up to the surface out of a third pipe. It comes out pure and, after being cooled and solidified, is blasted into small pieces which can be loaded on cars. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Besides being used in the manufacture of powder and the vulcanizing of rubber, sulphur is largely used in germicides. It is the most efficient constituent of many of the sprays used for killing parasites on treed and vines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In the Valley of Hinnom, or Valley of Gehenna, or Valley of Tophet, as it was variously termed,which lay on the southwestern edge of Jerusalem, the Jews were accustomed to burn the garbage of the city, using sulphur (or brimstone as it is sometimes called) to complete the work of destruction. To a person standing upon the edge of this valley at night, and looking out over its dull fires, glowing here and there, it had the appearance of a “lake of fire and brimstone”, and was a fit representation of complete destruction. Its fires represented the complete destruction in the Golden Age of everything that is unclean, impure or in any manner injurious to life and happiness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Among things that will be destroyed are the perverted thirst that creates the brewery and distillery, and the selfishness that, makes the high financier and the thief; for these and other evils will be ended by making men better.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark41"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark42"></a>Silver Up</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">HIN</span><span class="font10">A wants silver; and in response to the law of supply and demand the price is climbing. Up to May 6,1919, the export of silver had been prohibited since the s</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">umm</span><span class="font10">er of 1918, and the normal demand for silver for China simply could not be met. Since May the greatest silverconsuming country of the world—China—has had nearly twenty million dollars worth of silver. Still the Chinese demand is not satisfied, and the Chinese merchants and authorities are outbidding the rest of the world for all the silver that is obtainable. The Oriental republic wants more silver and yet more, and is expected to ask for it at the rate of $120,000,000 a year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">France and England have had to prohibit the export of the white metal. Silver has gone so high that it pays to melt the coin and sell it as bullion for the Chinese market. In the United States the silver dollar is worth about a cent or two over the gold dollar, but not enough to tempt much turning of coin into bullion; but if the unrestricted export of silver were permitted, the price might rise to a height where the demand for silver bullion would cause much of the silver coin of the country to be melted and the country be stripped of its small change. Fortunately, however, the value of the s</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">mall</span><span class="font10">er coins is so much lower than their face value that it would require a rise that is entirely unlikely, to deprive us of our small coins. Most of the silver dollars are worn and their light weight renders them unprofitable as bullion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Mexico is profiting by the situation; for the peso has gone from 50 cents to 99 cents, and the peon can get about the same wage as before in Mexican money and is enabled to keep up with the cost of living without a raise in wages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">An interesting feature of the existing condition is that hundreds are taking their silver heirlooms to the melting-pot. Old knives, forks, spoons, silver plate, jewelry and silver ornaments are daily coming out of their hiding plabe^. All such articles are paid for only after they have been assayed to ascertain the proportion of silver, and a small charge of about a half per cent, is deducted for the operation of melting into bars.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Chink’s appetite for silver is reported to have almost'paralyzed the retail trade of Paris. Hundreds of thousands of five-franc, two-franc, one-franc and half-franc pieces have gone to the pot, and there is not enough coin to do business with. For days at a time department stores could do little business, because there was not enough coin. Waiters are in desperation; for there are no tips. Barbers, chauffeurs, and attendants in public buildings are suffering a “short” period. One of the big stores made its own money out of cardboard circles stamped as good for certain amounts in trade at the store, and the oth^r stores followed suit, and then arranged to exchange the new “money”. Now many are issuing and using cardboard coin. The situation is aggravated by the fact that everybody is hoarding silver coin, which takes still more out of circulation. The prospect of getting enough silver is not improved by the circumstance that 60 per cent of the Mexican silver mines are shut down because of revolutionary conditions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The world has stuck its hand down into its pocket and found that it is short of change.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Besides the phenomenal demand in India and China, one reason for the limited supply of silver is the falling off in production. In 1911 the ■world production of silver was 226,192,000 fine ounces; in 1916 this had fallen to 156,626,000 fine ounces. Mexico produces about one-third of the silver of the world; in 1913 its production was 70,000,000 ounces; in 1916 it was only 22,000,000 ounces, but it is estimated that it was 45,000,000 ounces in 1919. As a result of the great demand, old silver mines are being worked over and new districts opened up in the countries on both sides of the Rio (rrande.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">This illustrates what a delicately balanced fabric civilzation is. Who would think that so slight a circumstance as a somewhat increased demand from a remote country for a metal would tend to upset the trade of whole cities and put the retail trade of the world in jeopardy! And how carefully ought the men in charge of the affairs of nations to have stepped in the matter of plunging the woz-ld into a strife whose evil effects seem only begun! If a little matter, like a little fire, starts appreciable troubles, how great are the world difficulties that may be looked for from so tremendous an act of violence as the World War! It would be far better that imperial ambitions had never begun the great cataclysm, were it not that it was foreknown by the Creator and evidently was permitted in order to work out better and greater things, leading eventually to the greatest possible blessings—those of the Golden Age.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark45"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark46"></a>After the Public’s Money</span></h3>
<p><span class="font15">S</span><span class="font10">OME color is given to the report that in some recent conferences the electric railways determined on new ways and means for getting more money out of the public. Unprecedented methods are being resorted to by these public “servants” to bulldoze the people into compliance with their demands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In Toledo the electric railway company was ousted from the streets on account of a variety of complaints, including an exorbitant fare for the privilege of riding on the street cars. Instead of waiting to be put out in conventional fashion, the street railway company quit the city by quietly removing its cars at midnight without warning to the city officials, partly because the company expected the city to seize and run the street cars.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The Toledo mayor charged the company with breach of faith, with doing an act typical of the hour selected for its performance, with bad treatment of the carmen, who consider themselves innocent victims of a condition that has forced them out of work, and with a variety of other offences. The street railway company said that they could not afford to run the cars at a loss, that they would not permit the interurban cars to run in over their tracks, that they might pull down the wires and tear up the tracks, that they might put the cars on sale, that they could not possibly meet the unreasonable exactions of the city management, that they could waive their position under the ouster ordinance, that ‘'Toledo would have to beg hard to get her cars back<sup>15</sup>, and that ‘’the cars would be for sale unless they could make Toledo see our point”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The Toledo public, for whose benefit supposedly the street cars were originally permitted.^ upon the streets, resented the company's attitude by voting six to one against repeal of the ouster, negotiated with other street car companies for cars to run on the tracks, looked for other means of lighting the city than the electricity supplied by the company, paid 10 to 50 cents to ride in all kinds of vehicles, arranged free motor truck transportation for employes and for people coming in on the interurban lines, sacrificed comfort, time and money rather than give in to the autocratic attitude of the company, and displayed u genuinely American spirit against the alleged Bourbonism of the street-car officials.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The attitude of the press in other cities ranged from a friendly interest in the problem the common people had to meet to that of papers committed to corporation interests no matter what corporations may </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">do. The heart</span><span class="font10">less comment of one such publication </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">was in </span><span class="font10">part as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“As the people of Toledo had for their street-car company the enthusiastic lack </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">of</span><span class="font7"> affection which it seems to be the fate of such corporations everywhere to excite, there was no difficulty in getting the inhabitants of the city to vote their company's cars off its streets until it stopped charging six cents fare and two cents for transfers. That vote, however, was cast on an understanding, by the voters, not that the company would remove its ears from the streets, but that it would return to a straight five-cent fare. Instead, with truly malignant docility and between two days, it deported all its cars into the State of Michigan; and the Toledans found themselves the winners of a most inconvenient victory against the hated foe. They were confronted with a painful alternative—that of riding in automobiles at a cost considerably greater than the rates they held intolerable, or of walking. The warning to be found in Toledo’s attempt at compulsion by exclusion should be heeded in other cities where the desire to ride at what the street-car companies declare to be less than cost might lead to action of like unwisdom.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">During the war many corporations made and laid away immense reserve sums; and this expression of a corporation mouthpiece is concrete evidence of the arrogance with which the corporations generally “feel their oats”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The politicians of Toledo doubtless are no different from those of other cities having wealthy public utility companies, and doubtless did their share to “milk” the street railway company, held it up with graft ordinance, and for private profit did the many other things well known to politicians as useful for extracting coin or concession from corporations, while seeming to act in the interests of the people. They waxed loud in vote-getting denunciations of the heartless street railway; but it was always possible that after the proper amount of “oil” had been applied by the corporation interests the politicians talk would again he smooth as butter, because, forsooth, had not the “milk” pipe-line been re-established between corporations and politicians?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">One of the good political statements for making the people feel right and help get the milk-line in -operation was that the politicians *would not repeal the ouster nor give the street railway company a franchise”. It was quite possible, of course, that “judicious concession” would cause enough politicians to “find a suitable solution” to bring the cars back on terms mutually satisfactory to corporation and politicians. It is a great political game, not letting the left hand know what the right hand does.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Everybody lost through the brawl. The company claimed a daily loss in fares of $7800. The 1400 employes lost their wages, perhaps totalling between $4000 and $5000 a day. The merchants reported business very dull. Manufactories were unable to keep their pay rolls full. The common people paid double or more for transportation, representing perhaps $6000 a day loss, besides the loss of wages. As it was a strike by a company, no troops were called to keep the striking officials in order, lock them up in bull-pens or enjoin them from interfering with a commodity of first rank as a necessity. Nothing that took place was calculated to allay unrest or to make the people feel that in some way the arrogant power of corporations ought to be curbed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">But better times are coining. “A better day is coming, a morning promised long, when truth and right with holy might shall overthrow the wrong; when Christ the Lord will listen to every plaintive sigh, and stretch his hand o'er sea and land, with justice, by and by. The boast of haughty tyrants no more shall fill the air. but age and youtn shall love the truth and speed it everywhere. No more from want and sorrow shall eojne the hopeless cry, but war shall cease, and perfect peace will flourish by and by. The tidal wave is coming, the year of jubilee: with shout and song it sweeps along, like billows of the sea.. The jubilee of nations shall ring through ^arth and sky; the dawn of grace draws ou apace-!-‘tis coming by and by.’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It does one good to realize that when perplexity fills many minds, the truth is that the best days ever known are at hand-</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark47"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark48"></a>Around the World by Rail</span></h3>
<p><span class="font15">I</span><span class="font10">NTEREST in the Dover-Calais tube has been renewed, with fair prospects of work being started in the Spring. Lord Fisher now comes out with the proposal that Europe’s principal port of entry be made at the great Blacksod Bay, on the west coast of Ireland, and that regular train service be inaugurated between that point and Japan, via tube under the North* Channel to Scotland, across England through ' the Dover-Calais tube, across Europe, through the Bosporus tube, thence via the Bagdad railway around the Persian Gulf, across India, China and Korea, and through another tube under the Korea Strait to Japan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Might as well make a good job of it, while he is at it, and go on up the coast of Asia to Behring Strait, under that by another tube, and then across Alaska and the Yukon District to Edmonton, and so on to New York. 1'hen we would have to have three big switches to complete the job. One would be the Pan-American line down through Central and South America to Buenos Ayres, another would be the Cape to Cairo line through Africa and the third is our own invention. This line starts at Singapore, and by a succession of connecting tubes traverses Sumatra, Minitok Banka, Billiton, Cari-mata, Borneo, Celebes, Peling Cay, Xulla, Xulla Bessey, Buro, Ceram, New Guinea, Australia and Tasmania.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Personally we could not reconunend a railroad trip from Tasmania or. South Africa to South America, as we think the*passenger would stand far more chance of reaching his destination alive if he went direct by ocean carrier. But such a trip would be possible, and it is quite possible that in the Golden Age such a highway as we have described might be built, even to the one connecting Australia with the mainland. The longest tunnel would be only about one hundred miles in length. Such a line could be made a standard four-line railway for much less than the cost of the World War.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark49"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark50"></a>Finland</span></h3>
<p><span class="font15">W</span><span class="font10">HERE is it? is a question some of us might have to ask. Yet Finland was saved from famine by American money. The country is not backward. There are few illiterates. There was a university there before Plymouth Rock was heard of. Men and women vote in a republican government.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark51"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark52"></a>Germany’s New Trade System</span></h3>
<p><span class="font15">O</span><span class="font10">NE.of the greatest internal dangers faced by European nations is depreciation of currency by the sending of coin out of the country. This has taken place in Austria: and France is grappling with the problem. England has forbidden the export of silver. Every country faces this grave condition. The United States has not come up to it, because nothing except the Chinese demand for silver has tended thither; for thus far this is the most fortunate nation in the world, respecting evil effects from the World War.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In foreign trade, if imports exceed exports, the balance, called the balance of trade, has to be settled eventually with currency, or with bonds, which serve to defer the evil day when the currency must be paid. A large excess of imports drains the money out of a country, </span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">an</span><span class="font10">d no nation seems to have devised a successful system for keeping the currency at home and averting the disastrous effects of an unfavorable trade balance so well as Germany has done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">For the Teutons simply refuse to let go their currency or their gold. They propose to accomplish this by not allowing an unfavorable trade balance to come into existence. A foreign merchant, for example, who wishes to import into Germany a million dollars worth of cotton, cannot take his pay in coin, but must take it in the shape of a million dollars worth of manufactured cotton goods, or of some other manufactured goods, of a kind that the country is willing to export. The matter is closely regulated by the government. The effect is that there cannot arise an excess of imports over exports, to be settled in the u&gt;ual manner with gold.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">A further effect of this new policy is that every million dollars worth of goods brought into the country brings a million dollars worth of work to the workers, or at least that portion of the million that goes as wages to labor. It is proposed that labor shall not suffer enforced idleness on account of the country's becoming flooded with: imports that would drive home-manufactured goods out of the domestic markets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The need of the hour everywhere is w-o-r-k. The country that works the most, keeps its people the bu^iestt gives them the most pay and has the most jjoods to distribute among the workers, is, other things being equal, the least likely to suffer from popular unrest and its train of evils. Th^r<sup>A</sup> ar * yU-r^y of ot-h^r worirrr in Germany to bring trouble to the people, very serious trouble,chief of them the poverty caused by the War; but, if reports are to be trusted, it will not be from not working that the German people will get their worst trouble. AU the people have gone to work, it is said, and their principal stock in trade is work, not money, nor bonds to be floated elsewhere and bring trouble in the future. It is considered a real peril to the • rest of the world that Germany has adopted’a policy tending to put herself relatively, and increasingly as time goes on, in an advantageous position for recouping the economic disasters of the War. Other peoples, especially this country, should not lose a moment in getting down to work, for 'Tie becometh. poor that dealeth with a slack hand, but the hand of the diligent maketh rich”.—Proverbs 10:4.</span></p>

Barton Hepburn, chairman of the Advisory</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19200121_files/g_E_19200121-8.png" alt="" style="width:15pt;height:16pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font10">Board of the Chase National Bank of New York, one of the country's most reliable authorities on business conditions, says that we are headed for a curtailment of business.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The average business man or banker in publie expression takes the role of a booster, in order not to disturb the common people with the truth, no matter what his real ideas may be; but Mr. Hepburn frankly admits that business cannot continue at its present rate. He^says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">&quot;We cannot continue to reduce the hours of labor and still supply the quantity of goods Which the world demands. We cannot continue to increase the cost of production, and still be able to compete with other nations in the markets of the world. These causes will operate to curtail business. Men will not make goods that they cannot sell at a profit. That there will’ be in the not distant future a curtailment of business and a recession in cost and prices is inevitable.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Concerning the business condition of Europe Mr. Hepburn speaks advisedly and frankly:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">&quot;There are individual enterprises in all European countries worthy of confidence and credit. These will he singled out, then usual credit tests applied, and their wants supplied; and in this way Europe will be financed to the extent that it ought to be.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>u</sup>The debt of Great Britain is still increasing. Their current taxation does not equal present expenditures, The same is true in an emphasized degree of France and of Italy; and all sorts of financial schemes, ranging from a capital tax to repudiation, will fill the air and make the holders of certain foreign government securi-1-^: ur.r:: :y for -ome time to come.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">‘'The only possible policy for the restoration of Europe to normal condition* is economy and thrift. That should be the slogan there and the slogan here.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Hundreds, thousands, of men of the utmost ability are working on the stupendous problem of restoring conditions to what they were before the World War. We certainly wish all right-minded men well in their honest endeavors to bring peace and prosperity to the people, but it is </span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">diffi</span><span class="font10">cult to join in the prediction that their efforts will ne crowned with the success they seek; for their practical rejection of Christianity during the last few years has started conditions that the Scriptures say it will be impossible to mend. We fear that they must finally re</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">aliz</span><span class="font10">e that their position will ultimately be like those thousands or years ago that said: “We would have healed Babylon, but she is not healed&quot;. (Jeremiah 51: 9) But there is coming <sup>4</sup>'an afterward of peace&quot;; and all well meaning men will see in the Golden Age that it was better for it to have been thus. God is at the wheel and He will bring humanity' safely and prosperously to the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">desired</span><span class="font10"> haven of rest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The proposed loaning of vast sums to Europe to be spent in the United States may postpone the depression; but if the loans prove uncollect-ahle, the present threatening aspect will become that much worse.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark53"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark54"></a>Ford's Gasoline Street-Car</span></h3>
<p><span class="font15">I</span><span class="font10">S IT the sunset of the day of the electric street-car ? Other inventions have had their run, served the people well, and passed out of existence, because supplanted by new inventions. The cdectrie railway displaced the horse-drawn street-car, to the ruin of the investment in the older business. Steam railroads ousted canals, and destroyed the value of the investments therein. The steamship caused whole fleets of gallant sailing vessels to rot at 'wharves or to pound to pieces on rocks and shoals without being replaced, to the utter loss of investments in shipping. No industry’ can complain, if science and invention devise some better way of (foing the work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The basis of the new Ford street-car is a gasoline motor of a new type. It combines a motor, an air compressor, an electric generator and a heating an0 lighting plant; for all operations for the control of the car are centered in the one motor. Tt does away with all overhead equipment, with huge power stations, with all the costly electrical equipment, and with half the weight of the car. The car is heated with the hot exhaust from the motor, carried through pipes and emitted under the car. The power plant weighs but 1150 pounds, and the car itself about seven tons, for a thirty-seven-foot car, a sharp contrast with the twelve and fourteen-ton cars now on the streets. Each car seats forty-two passengers, and has plenty of excess energy * in the ninety horse-power of the motor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Just how soon the “Ford&quot; will be on the market is not definitely stated, for the first cars are demonstration cars to be exhibited on the tracks of various cities, and on steam railroads, where they are expected to develop a speed of seventy miles an hour.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Just how people will get around when the Golden Age is well advanced no one can definitely predict; for under those more favorable auspices there will be thousands of Fords and Edisons of abilities not approached today whose inventive minds will produce new mechanisms for the good of the people. It is safe to say that, whatever may be foreseen now the aetuali- \ ties will be better than that. “For since the beginning of the world men have not heard, nor perceived by the ear, neither hath the eye seen, O God, beside thee, what he hath prepared for him that waiteth for him&quot;. And in the Golden Age all men of right hearts will wait upon God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">New Jersey Tries Again</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">W</span><span class="font10">HEN the electric railwjJys were first financed most of the possible credit was spoiled by “high” finance. New Jersey railways are no exception, and now that they have a real financial problem to meet they have no resources, for they need more money’ badly. First they tried to get it by a zone fare scheme which doubled or tripled the passenger’s outlay, but the people took to the jitneys, and one system lost $12,000 a day.

<h3><a name="bookmark57"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark58"></a>The Value of Hybrids</span></h3>
<p><span class="font15">W</span><span class="font10">E ARE not sure as to the value of hybrids. They may be of great value, or they may not; but the experiments now being made in the development of giant hybrids are well worth carrying forward to a completion, and we understand there is some prospect of the Government's establishing an experimental station at Kentland, California, with a view of ascertaining the facts about the giant plants which are produced there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">There was a time upon this planet when a hybridization was started which threatened to destroy the race. The Scriptures describe the incidents preceding the Flood in these words:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born unto them, that the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose. . . . There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare clrildren to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of renown.”— Genesis 6:1,</span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">2,</span><span class="font10">4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">There is no doubt that these sons of God are those referred to by the Apostle as the “angels which kept not their estate, but left their own habitation, going after strange flesh” (Jude 6, 7) who became “disobedient, when once the long-suffering of God waited in the days of Noah”. (1 Peter 3:20) These angels sinned against the law of their being in taking human form for the purpose of rearing human families. Their children were the giants, the traditions of whom are to be found in the mythology of all peoples. Had not the Flood been sent in mercy to destroy these hybrids, the human family would have been reduced to slavery and destruction. That was the end of “the world that was”.— 2 Peter 3: G.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">A somewhat analogous situation confronts us in the present passing away of “this present evil world” and the dawning of the new day, the inauguration of “the world to come [not the world to go to] wherein dwelleth righteousness”. We have giant trusts and giant labor unions,</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">the powers of both of which we should dread but for the coming establishment of the kingdom of justice and peace and truth for which all classes of humanity yearn. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;..</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark59"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark60"></a>Insect Leaks</span></h3>
<p><span class="font15">T</span><span class="font10">HREE insects, though insignificant little things which a baby's finger can crush, cost the country a billion dollars a year. One is the cotton boll-weevil. This little giant has put some former cotton states out of the business, - destroyed the industry of raising sea-island cotton, since 1892 has ruined 11,000,000 bales of cotton—nearly a whole year's production for the country—and costs annually some $200,000,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Another of the Lilliputian giants of inseetdom is the tiny cattle tick. But for it, 50-cent steak would be unheard-of, $18 and $20 shoes would not exist and the whole South would excel in cattle raising. It takes from the country in direct loss some $100,000,000 and an untold amount indirectly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The third of this trio of giants too great for man yet to conquer is the fever-mosquito. It makes its R</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">umm</span><span class="font10">er home in 75,000,000 acres of swamp land which, because of it, are uninhabitable, except for people willing to drag out a life qf sickness ending in a prematttre death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">All told, these insect leaks are estimated to cost the country a billion and a quarter a year. Some day they will be eliminated, in the Golden Age when humanity finds itself able to execute the divine commission to “subdue the earth” (Genesis 1:28); for the subduing of the earth implies the conquest of all the enemies of man.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Pineapple</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">IRST discovered in Brazil, early in the sixteenth century, the pineapple has become one of the most widely cultivated fruits of the tropical and semi-tropical regions. In 1894, 4,000,000 pineapples, valued at $750,000, were marketed from Florida alone. That was twenty-five yearn ago- and the spread of pineapple fields in Florida and Hawaii since that time has been prodigious.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Pineapple plants are set three feet apart, with occasionally double spaces between the rows. Buds which develop beneath the ground are principally relied upon for settings, although various other parts of the plant can be used for the purpose. The plant thrives best where the temperature averages seventy-five degrees, and where the air is dry. It bears for about ten years before it must be replaced.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The plant grows about three feet high, and produces fruits of varying sizes and colors besides the size and color with which we are most familiar in the markets. The fruit grows to twenty or more pounds in weight, but the average is about eight pounds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Pineapples are largely grown in the West Indies, Northern Africa, Queensland and .the Azores Islands, besides Florida and Hawaii. In the Philippines and in Southeastern Asia they grow in great quantities, and are sold so cheaply that at times they are fed to elephants. The canning of the fruit in these countries is largely in the hands of the Chinese. The leaves of one of the varieties grown in the Philippines provides a fibre from which is made a fabric much appreciated by the Filipinos.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The best varieties of pineapples are protected from excesses of heat and cold by great sheds, built at an expense of $500 per acre. The care that is found necessary to bring this luscious fruit to perfection is a part of the blessing, not curse, that was originally imposed upon our firs’b'-parents. Adam was ''put into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keen it&quot; (Genesis 2: 15); and when earth’s paradise is restored and the Golden Age is a fact, and no longer a prophecy, the perfection. of the fruits with which it aboiinds,h and which constitute man’s most natural-find most healthful and enjoyable food, will be the pursuit and delight of the perfect men that will then find their eternal home in this favored spot.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Pineapples aid digestion. The juice of a ripe pineapple is an almost invaluable remedy for diphtheria, the acid seeming to dissolve the growth in the throat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Cooperative Farm Selling</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">P</span><span class="font10">ROFITEERING by middlemen in farm products discourages the farmer, lessens his interest in the farm, decreases production, and raises prices. Last spring the farmers of the Southwest had to pay $70 a ton for sorghum for sale by middlemen, but in the fall they could get only $10 for what they had to sell. The way the profit is worked against them, &quot;coming and going’', makes them discontented with their occupation, and causes some to give up their farms—and the more farmers quit farming, the nearer food rationing the rest of the people are.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Cooperative buying and selling, organized by states, through the state departments of agriculture, is being worked as a remedy for the profiteering situation, so -far as the farmer is concerned. A Kansas farmer wanted a carload of carrots, and wired his want to the Kansas Department of Agriculture, which referred it to the Texas department, who informed a Texas farmer who had a carload of carrots to sell; the transaction was completed during the morning, and the carrots were on their way as soon as a freight car could be furnished by the railroad. The seller got 25 per cent more than he could have obtained from a middleman, and the buyer paid 25 per cent less’.*’. Both parties are satisfied that interstate cooperation is good for the farmer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">If such cooperation is all right for farmers, why would it not he good for the other people that feel the pressure of the cost of living? To a considerable extent prices are high because of so many middlemen, each of whom has to make a living on what passes through his hands. The less middlemen the better, and what amounts to a state cooperative exchange possesses attractive features lor all—except the middlemen. Evidently what was said thousands of years ago applies to the profiteer today: &quot;He that is greedy of gain troubleth his own house&quot;.— Proverbs 15:27. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">However, it is not too late for the people, by combined cooperative action to minimize many of the dlliicultics that confront them. Such a course would be in the public interest.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark65"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark66"></a>Astronomersup in the Air</span></h3>
<p><span class="font15">N</span><span class="font10">O! We do not mean that the astronomers are going up in dirigibles (either 50,000 miles or 50,000 feet) to try to get a better look at the heavens. They have wonderful telescopes for doing that, telescopes which could not possibly be handled in any dirigible that could be built. The newest one, in position in California, has a lens 100 inches in diameter; and when it was pointed at the heavens, instead of revealing 125,000,000 suns, it disclosed 375,000,000. So sensitive are these wonderful instruments that they take into consideration the trembling of the hilltops upon which they are mounted, due to the impact of horses'* hoofs and even the feet of playing children.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The tiling that has disturbed the astronomers is the discovery that none of the stars are where they were supposed to be, and nobody knows for sure where any of them are. This all came about in a very simple way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">A certain man by the name of Einstein waited until there was an eclipse of the sun, a total eclipse caused by the moon coming between, it and the earth. Then he took a number of photographs of the ring of stars nearest to the edge of the eclipsed sun. He waited six months until those same stars were again visible in the night sky. He photographed them again, and instead of being the same distance apart as they were six months previously they were nearer together. The stars had not changed their relative position during that period. They are so remote that no possible changes in their location with respect to each other could be revealed in six months* time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">What had happened? Why were they not in the same places as when first photographed? The^ astonishing answer is that our sun had pushed those rays of light outward as they came near his majesty; and instead of moving in a straight lino, as we have always supposed, it is now apparent That light wobbles and wriggles and bVist^its way Through the universe, and that thare is no possible way of knowing exactly where any visible part of the universe is located.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">With what reverence ought we to approach the contemplation of the wonders of the visible universe! Jehovah has been pleased to roveal some of its secrets to earnest and honest inquirers, but there are heights and depths of wisdom in the creation and movement of flio heavenly bodies that can be but faintly guessed at by the wisest of earth's philosophers. Some of these wonders will never be known to humankind, but it is entirely right for us to try to ascertain as much as may be possible. We can learn nothing that Jehovah is not pleased to reveal to us. “The secret things belong unto the Lord our God: but those things which are revealed belong unto us and to our children for ever.”—Deuteronomy 29:29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">During the Golden Age, and all the ages to follow, it will be the privilege of men to know more and more of the wonders of Jehovah's universe, but there will always be heights which they can never hope to reach.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark73"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark74"></a>Saving Mother and Babe</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">HE state is wasting the lives of mothers and babies. Every year some sixteen thousand mothers die in childbirth and nearly a quarter of a million babies die under one year of age. Other countries show markedly lower death rates than this. But Federal aid is now being given in a small way through the Children's Bureau of the Department of Labor for the protection of infancy and maternity. The neglect </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font10">maternity and infancy leads not only to thousands of preventable deaths, but to lowered vitality and permanent impairment of health and efficiency for those women and children who </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">are </span><span class="font10">so fortunate as to survive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Lack of means to secure adequate prenatal care, or even care at the time of childbirth, is given as the most frequent cause of loss of life. This is just what we would expect in a world where possessions have been long considered as of greater value than life and happiness. Laws are much more frequently framed for the protection of property than for the protection </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">or </span><span class="font10">encouragement of happiness. The word happiness means much, and it would not be possible to legislate happiness onto any one or into any one. But there are certain foundations of happiness which have been too much overlooked, and one of these is the right to be as well born as the combined efforts of individuals and states can provide. At best, there will be a red and comparatively vigorous line of life in some, and </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font10">thinner, grayer line in others. This condition will prevail until the Life-giver begins his great work of the Golden Age—his work which will heal not only the bodies of all the willing and obedient, but also their minds and hearts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Remarkable progress has been made in legislation providing mothers' pensions since the fiigt Mothers' Pension Laws were passed in 1911 by Missouri and Illinois. According to a bulletin entitled' “Laws Relating to Mothers' Pensions&quot;, just issued by the Children’s Bureau of the United States Department of Labor, thirty states^ Alpska and Hawaii now have some publioAproviflion for mothers left with young children to support, and in at least five of the remaining states mothers’ pension laws have been under consideration. Canada, Denmark, and New Zealand also have passed legislation providing aid for mothers. This rapid spread of legislation in so brief a period is indicative, says the Children’s Bureau </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin,</span><span class="font10"> of the </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">wide</span><span class="font10">spread, deep-rooted conviction that ntf child should be deprived of home life and a mother’s care because of poverty alone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Generally speaking, all mothers’ pension laws provide for the payment of a stated weekly or monthly sum for every child under a certain age to mothers who are dependent upon their own efforts to support their children and who are morally and physically fit persons to bring up their children. There is considerable variation in the laws in force in the different states. Some states provide pensions for widowed mothers only. Others include women who are divorced or who may have been deserted by their husbands, or those whose husbands are in prisons, in state asylums, or who are otherwise incapacitated. In three states prospective mothers may receive mothers’ pensions, and in a number of instances mothers of children born out of wedlock come within the scope of the law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The age up to which an allowance may be made for a child varies from thirteen to seventeen years. Only one state hqs a thirteen-year maximum, but this state allows an extension to sixteen years if the child &amp;&nbsp;ill or incapacitated for work. Sixteen years is the maximum in the greatest number of states. One state and Alaska give seventeen as a maximum, and one other state with a sixteen-year limit for boys makes seventeen the maximum for girls.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font10">The way the milk is made is by forcing liquid milk through extremely small holes into a muslin-lined chamber through which currents of hot dry air are constantly passing. The dry air coining in contact with the milky mist straightway absorbs the moisture it contains and the milk settles in powdery white drifts. Nothing has touched it but air. Nothing has been removed but water. Nothing is changed. The powdered milk cannot sour on account of the almost total absence of moisture, and for the same reason no growth of bacteria can take place. The powder can be instantly transformed into fresh, sweet milk. It comes in cans; it can be kept anywhere, and in many climates is the only good milk obtainable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The rising cost of liquid milk is now making it profitable to use this dried milk. It retails at a price equivalent to 14 cents per quart for sweet milk or S cents per quart for skimmed milk. It is much appreciated in the tropics and also on ocean liners.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The dried eggs are obtained presumably by the same method. Anyway, it is a fact that the best of omelettes can be made from combined powdered milk and powdered eggs; for we have eaten them many times and never knew, until our attention was culled to the matter, that the eggs did not come freshly from the shells and the milk from the dairy. We believe that these dried foods have a great future before them, and are a valuable part of the preparation of mankind for the enjoyment of all kinds of food products in the New Age.</span></p>

<p><span class="font15">A</span><span class="font10"> SHORTAGE of a substance brings out a substitute. The shortage of sugar has brought saccharin to the front as a '‘harmless'*' substitute for sugar. Many housewives are buying this sweetest of substances and finding it convenient for use in foods, coffee, tea and cocoa,</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">But in employing saccharin they are playing with a drug which is not entirely harmless. The Department of Agriculture condemns the use of saccharin in food. &quot;It is,” says the United »Slates Bureau of Chemistry, &quot;a menace to health. The attempt to exploit the shortage of sugar and create a demand for saccharin for use in place of sugar endeavors to capitalize the public's lack of knowledge of the properties of tills substance. A majority of the states have statutes or regulations prohibiting the use of saccharin in food. The Bureau of Chemistry feels called upon to reiterate the warnings which it has repeatedly given. Food to which saccharic has been added is adulterated, since a substance has been added to it which may render it deleterious to health”. The Department of Agriculture regards the use of saccharin as so harmful that it is preparing pros-</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">ecution against concerns that use it contrary Io the law regulating the adulteration of food.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">According to the doctors saccharin has the following effects upon the system: Taken internally it is rapidly absorbed and eliminated unchanged through the kidneys. It is almost free from general physiological activities. It may be taken without appreciable effect. On the other hand it has a slight local irritant action, and doses 01 more than thirteen' grains a day are liable to impair digestion. The statement sometimes made that it is irritant to the kidneys seems to lack positive confirmation. Its use in medicine is purely as a sweetening agent in those diseases such as diabetes and obesity, where sugar should not be taken.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">As a sweetener saccharin is quite expensive at the current retail price of thirty-five cents for 100 tablets, each equal to a lump of sugar in sweetening power. Users of the drug find that its sweetness has a sickish quality, and that it leaves a slightly unpleasant, uneasy feeling throughout the entire body, which gradually subsides as it is eliminated from the system.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark85"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark86"></a>The Wave of Spiritist Literature</span></h3>
<p><span class="font15">T</span><span class="font10">HAT the Avorld is undergoing a subtle preparation for an inundation of spiritism is manifest from the advancing wave of literature on the subject of psychical phenomena.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">World movements advance, not by a steady progression, but by waves. The beginning of the modern spiritist movement was about the middle of the eighteenth century, in France and England. It spread to America through Shak-erism and other cults, and received a strong impetus about 1800 in a tidal wave of religious revivals evidencing spiritist phenomena. During the nineteenth century it was revived with marked demonstrations of rappings, levitations, voices and visions, but was submerged in the practical industrialism which characterized the latter part of that century.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Some forty or fifty years ago the evidences of a new revival of spiritism appeared in a systematic research into the occult, which assumed organized form in the nineties in societies for psychical research. These societies weighed testimony and systematically published to the practical-minded British and American people convincing evidence of the reality of psychic phenomena. Men of science finally became interested; and such scientists as Sir Oliver Lodge applied rigid scientific tests, became satisfied of the genuineness of the things seen, heard and felt and, by their own great influence and high standing, gave the occult the broad foundation of public confidence from which it is now operating. Spiritist happenings, once sneered at, are now received seriously by the public, and spiritualistic literature is being fed to a deluded populace ad libitum and ad nauseam. For spiritism is plainly demonism, and its advance presages th* possibility of the blinding of the minds of millions with delusions and of their obsession to th* sweep of crowd-madness to a degree net witnessed since the gi-eat waves of the psvchic in th* past.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The extent of the present sweep of spiritist literature is suggested by an article in </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Life</span><span class="font10"> on “The Spiritist Intrusion”:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">'There arc r.ow i’-vu croups of periodicals; those that pander to the growing appetite for spiritist literature, and those that have not yet come to it. Not 'pander’ but ‘minister’ is the word that people would use who are interested in the spiritist literature and who like to keep the run of it. A little more every month they ar^ftiin* istered to just now. both in the periodicals and by books. The At/antic </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Monthly</span><span class="font7"> did not feed them much of anything until the current number; but that has an interesting story by Dr. L. P. Jacks, Oxford professor and editor of the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Hibbert Journal,</span><span class="font7"> about experiences of his own incurred in making personal investigations. The </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Hibbert Journal,</span><span class="font7"> a quarterly devoted to </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">theology,</span><span class="font7"> philosophy. religion, psychology and such matters, has been hospitable to reports and discussions of psychical phenomena since there were any that were worth talking about. Dr. Jacks, its present editor, is also at present the president of the Psychical Research Society in England. Mr. Henry Holt’s </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Unpopular Review</span><span class="font7"> (now </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Unpartisan Review)</span><span class="font7"> has cultivated the psychical research field without apology ever since it started. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Harper's</span><span class="font7"> Magazine is game for inquiry in the same field, and lias lately had several articles about curious exploits of mediums and notable instances of automatic writings. The Cosmopolitan Magazine is running a scries of disclosures by Basil King, the novelist; Conan Doyle preaches his New Revelation in </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Hearst's</span><span class="font7"> and in the newspapers; and the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Metropolitan,</span><span class="font7"> which has shown sympathy for two years past with the spiritist activities and has had pieces about them by Booth Tarkington and Conan Doyle, has now in progress a narrative, by Ralph £clams Cram, of the Glastonbury Abbey experiments in inducing the Fast to give up information for the^uidancc of the Present.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“There must be many other magazines implicated in attention to these psychical and spiritist proceedings lately held in so much disapproval by cautious persons who valued their reputation for common sense. Reputable characters and publications are gradually being drawn into contemplation of them, puzzled and incredulous as yet, but inquisitive. Th* literature of the subject increases so fast and is so much read that it begins to be impolitic for folks who claim to be awake to ignore it. The New York Public Library reports its readers as 'turning from books on the war to those on South </span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">Am</span><span class="font7">erica. the export trade, Spain and the Spanish language, religion, spiritualism, psychic phenomena, applied psychology and technical subjects’. The librarian in charge of the Central Circulation Branch reports that readers arc demanding books on all phases of religion, are eager to know hnw great a part religion is to play in our reconstructed world, and are ‘intensely interested in spiritual subjects of all kinds, and are turning with new eagerness to the writings of Sir Oliver Lodge and his investigations and speculations into the spirit world’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">&quot;This is scandalous, of course, to people who insist on keeping their feet on the actual earth, hut the prospect is that we shall have more of it before we have lesa. One hears there is much more in England than here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">&quot;For people who don’t know anything at all about these burgeoning interest's it may be suitable to explain that the foundation for them seems to have been laid by the studies and reports of the psychical research societies, extending over forty or fifty years; that the interest in all such matters has been immensely stimulated by the war and its attending bereavements and by the present parlous state of society, and that the most popular disclosures that attend this movement are those that come in the form of so-called 'automatic writings', which have been cropping up of late like mushrooms in all parts of the country. They purport to be records, by sensitives or mediums, of informations communicated through them but not derived </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">from their</span><span class="font7"> own </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">minds, </span><span class="font7">nor from any mundane source that they know of. That there is a lot of these communications is unquestionable. That the persons through whom they come axe honest as a rule, and not consciously deceitful, is little doubted. That some of the communications are extremely curious will be admitted by most people who read them (vide Dr. Jacks in the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Atlantic)</span><span class="font7">: but how or whence they come, whether from the subconscious minds of mediums or by telepathic communication from minds of other living persons, or out of the minds of the questioners who receive them, or from the spirits of the dead, is all still matter of discussion, investigation and dispute.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">&quot;No one need to be dismayed at wanting to know more about contemporary spiritism and the automatic writings. They are mighty queer; and in any but the flounder type of mind that likes to lie still on the bottom and look like mud, they are bound, if known, to excite curiosity. But very many people still know nothing about them. Presently some conclusion about them will be reached, but it will be based not on prejudice but on knowledge, and the knowledge it mu&amp;t rest on seems to be accummulating very fast/’</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Xot every one believes in what is said in the Bible; but to those that do have confidence in the Bible, as the Word of God, the teaching is positive that modern psychic phenomena are of the same class as the obsessions by devils of Christ's time and before. Then, if these things are manifestations of demons, the demons are enemies of God, and their influence can only proceed increasingly toward worse evils. The divine pronouncements against spiritism evidence disapproval of it as true today as ever before. For-example, the Bible Prophet Isaiah shows the duty of turning to God rather than to spirit mediums: &quot;When they [spiritists] shall ^ay unto you, Seek unto them [spirit medi</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">ums</span><span class="font10">] that have familiar [friendly] spirits [devils pretending to be the spirits of dead persons], and unto wizards [male mediums] that peep [whisper confidentially] and that mutter [unintelligible utterances]; should not a people [as the Christian people of America] seek [in prayer] unto their God?&quot;—Isaiah 8:19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The same God that Christians worship today voices his disapproval of spiritism in these; unmistakable words: &quot;There shall not be found among you one that useth divination, [a form of spiritism] or an observer of times [an astrol-ogist], or an enchanter, or a witch [female medium], or a charmer, or a consulter [as thousands of women, business men and clergy are today] with familiar spirits [demons] or a wizard [male medium] or a necromancer; for all [as much today as in Moses' day] that do these things are an abomination unto the Lord/’ (Deuteronomy 18:10-12) How serious an offense spiritism is in God's estimation may be inferred from the fact that the divinely directed penalty for it among the Jews was death. The safe and only course for a Christian today as of old is resolutely and absolutely to avoid and resist it, the wisdom of which course will become increasingly evident as the rising wave of spiritism may within the next few years grow into a tidal onrush.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Suiciding a New Way</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">I</span><span class="font10">F IMPROPER eating, according-4o medical authority, amounts to digging one's grave with one's teeth, it will not sound' so strange to state that the Protestant clergy are digging the grave of Protestanism with their mouths.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Even Roman Catholics are paying attention to some of the utterances of &quot;modem&quot; Protestant preachers, according to the recent comments of one of the Papal &quot;Most Reverends&quot;. Protestants generally esteem themselves and their religion the best going, but their Roman Catholic friends are noting the hard time Protestant preachers are having to hold and to please their people. Protestants seem to be quite indifferent to Protestantism proper, if one is to judge by the constantly increasing demand for other novelties in the Protestant churches.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">For example, one Protestant preacher regularly attends the theaters in a neighboring town in order to entertain his people with summaries uf the plays and movies, while the audience shouts out rag-time songs, and the organ keeps the congregation awake with jazz music.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Another prominent exponent of Protestantism tells his flock that they are liable to find him in the dance hall, the club room, the pool room or the back alley, getting the raw materials for up-to-date “sermons” suited to his modem Protestant congregation. If he had his way he would turn the churches into dance halls, recreation rooms, gymnasiums and billiard rooms. (But God still lives!)</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">How this looks to Roman Catholic eyes, accustomed to the solemnities of the Papal ritual, would shock many a Protestant: “It is well to see the preachers throwing off masks and showing up Protestantism as it really is—a manmade, shifting, compromising religious travesty”. How are the mighty fallen!</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Romanism may be digging its grave in its own peculiar way; but the Protestant clergy are very assiduous in removing the solid ground from beneath the imposing structure of Protestantism. This is really sad.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark87"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark88"></a>From West’s History</span></h3>
<p><span class="font15">P</span><span class="font10">ROFESSOR Willis Mason West is author of a history entitled “The Ancient World”, published in 1904, and much used in school and college. We quote from it:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">(Page 519) “The Church and the Barbarians.— The barbarian converts to Christianity understood its teachings of love, purity, and gentleness very imperfectly, and adopted them still less fully. The church suffered a lowering of religious spirit—although the superstitions of the ignorant age gave it, perhaps, increased power. Christianity raised the new nations, but in the effort was dragged down part way to their level. More emphasis was placed on ceremonies and forms. The clergy, especially the higher clergy, became often merely ambitious and worldly lords, preachers of a coarse and superficial religion, men who allied themselves to the schemes of wicked rulers, lived vicious lives, and were unable to understand the services they mumbled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">(Page 451) “Causes of Persecutions.— (1) The populate hated the Christians as they did not hate the adherents of other strange religions, and pressed the government to persecute them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“'(2) The best ruler?, though deploring bloodshed, thought it proper and right to punish the Christians with death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“These Tacts'* can be partly explained, (a) Rome tolerated and supported all religions, hut she expected all her populations also to tolerate and support, the -Ute religion. The Christians alone not only refused to do so. hut declared war n </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>r</sup>-m</span><span class="font7"> it </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">a-</span><span class="font7"> 'infill and idolatrous. To the populace this seemed to challenge the wrath of the gods; and to enlightened men it seemed to indicate at least a dangerously stubborn and treasonable temper.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“(b) Secret societies were feared and forbidden by. the Empire, on political grounds. The church was a vast, highly organized, widely diffused secret society, and ‘as such was not only distinctly illegal, but in the highest degree was calculated to excite the apprehensions of the government<sup>1</sup> (George Burton Adams). &quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“(c) The attitude of the Christians toward society added to their unpopularity. Many of them refused on religious grounds to join the legions, or to fight, if drafted. This seemed treason, inasmuch as a prime duty of the Roman world was to repel barbarism. Moreover, the Christians were unsocial: they abstained from most public amusements, as immoral, and they refused to illuminate their houses or garland their portals in honor of national triumphs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Thus we have religious and social motives with the people, and a political motive with statesmen. It follows that the periods of persecution often came under those emperors who had the highest conception of duty.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">Answer: The word gospel means good news or glad tidings. There is only one gospel; that is the gospel of the kingdom. The four accounts of the gospel given by Matthew, Mark, Luke and John arc four statements covering the same general facts. They contain an account of Jesus, the Messiah, his work and teachings, and testify concerning his resurrection.—Matthew 4 : 23; Mark 16:15; Luke 1:19; 2:10; 8:1; John 1: 1-14; Acts 13:32: 20:24; Romans 10:15; 1 Corinthians 15:1-5.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">20. Who would induce any one to destroy ' the Bible?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">Answer: Evidently Satan, in order that he might oppose the development of the church. He has always been the enemy of men who have tried to do right.—Genesis 3:14-16; John 8: 44; 2 Corinthians 4:3, 4.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">13. Why did Jesus say, &quot;Then shall the end come&quot;, in Matthew 21:14? What did he mean?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">Answer: The word world there used means age, and not the earth. It means the age or dispensation of time during which a certain order would prevail.—Matthew 13:39; 24:3; Ecclesiastes 1:4.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">Answer: Yes, With the death of the apostles .</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">the canon of Scriptures closed, because God . there had given a complete revelation of his ? purpose and program concerning man. The Bible is not fully understood by every one, but will be in due time.—1 Timothy 2:3-6; 2 Timothy 3:15-17.</span></p>

There are coal, gold, platinum, nitrates, phosphates, and other minerals, besides—in the nitrate and phosphate regions— &quot;dandelion leaves four feet long, ferns eight feet high”, and other plants in proportion provided, of course, the backwoods whisky does not make the Northern hermits see double or triple. Potash beds have been discovered which are reported &quot;richer than any in Germany and enough 1o pay off the Canadian war debt”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Whatever may be the truth about the alleged new resources of Canada, the riches laid up in the earth for man have only just begun to be uncovered. The Golden Age is coming, and in that day better and bigger tilings for humanity will come forth than have ever been seen. Mankind has a Father who has looked out for his children abundantly, and will bring out his treasures when they are needed, and when they will be appreciated and not cornered for the benefit of the rich, but used for the good of all.</span></p>

<p><span class="font15">A</span><span class="font10">GAIN the plan is brought up of wanning up - the eastern coast of the country by turning aside the cold arctic currents that bathe Newfoundland, Nova Scotia and New England. The proposition is to build a dam across the Strait of Belle Isle, and divert the cold current from the Gulf of St. Lawrence. Newfoundland will be particularly helped, as it is now chilled the year round by the often ice-cold waters. Though as far south as France, it can raise only potatoes, oats, peas and turnips. The enterprise is prodigious, and may have to wait for the greater engineering operations of the Golden Age, when such great works will be common. <sub>t</sub></span></p>

Generally speaking, full liberty on a pre-war basis is now enjoyed by the Canadian nation, including freedom to enjoy rights like those guaranteed in the American Constitution regarding freedom of speech, the press, and the exercise of religion. The press censorship is gone, with the other Orders. Objection was raised, however, by the Canadian clergy, who put themselves on record by a resolution opposing the restoration of freedom of speech and the press.

<p><span class="font15">O</span><span class="font10">NE of the quite delusive publications of today is a school or college catalogue. The reader of one of these pamphlets sees, for example, the prominence given, to athletics, and imagines that if his Bov goes to that institution he will get plenty of healthful exercise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">As a matter of fact the average college student is more likely to get pneumonia from the college athletics than good health. The cob lege boy is connected with the college athletics principally in the function of standing around on the wet ground with his hands in his pockets on Thanksgiving Day, and watching a dozen or two students who need no athletics at all doing the publicity’ athletics for the institution. College athletics are as likely to put young men on sick beds as to benefit them physically.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The new idea at Harvard is to get all of the students into athletics. To that end they are going to generate a lot of enthusiasm which possibly may yet be the principal part of the athletics. As long as the team idea is in vogue whereby one football team or one baseball nine represents a whole college population, the average student is not likely to be particularly benefited by college athletics. If Harvard can develop a system whereby the average of forty per cent physically unfit young men can materially reduce, the institution will have conferred a benefit, at least upon those favored youths who find their way into college halls.</span></p>

There is not complete religious liberty where any one sect is favored by the state and given an advantage by law over other sect.?. Whatever establishes a’<sup>k</sup>distinction against one class or sect is, to the extent to-w’nich the distinction operates unfavorably, a persecution.

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">The Calf Path</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">One day through the primeval wood A calf walked home, as good calves should, And made a trail all bent askew, A crooked trail, as all calves do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The trail was taken up next day By a lone dog that passed that way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">And then a wise b«ll-wetiier sheep Pursued the trail o'er vale and steep,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">And drew the flock behind him too, As good bell-wethers always do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">And from that day o'er hill and </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">glade </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Through these old woods a path was made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">And many men wound In and out, And dodged and turned and bent about;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">And uttered word of righteous wrath, Because ’twas such a crooked path.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">This forest path became a lane.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">And bent and turned and turned again; This crooked lane became a road. Where many a horso bore heavy load.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Tolling beneath the burning sun.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">They travelled some three miles in one; And thus a century nnd a half</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">They trod the footsteps of that calf.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The yean passed on tn swiftness fleet: That road became a village street;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">And this, before men were aware, A city's crowded thoroughfare;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">And soon the central street was this, Of a renowned metropolis;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">And men two centuries and a half Trod in the footsteps of that calf.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Each day a hundred thousand rout Followed the signag path about;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">And o’er this crooked Journey went. The traffic of a continent;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">A hundred thousand men were led By one calf near three centuries dead;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">They followed still bis crooked way, And lost a hundred years a day!</span></p>

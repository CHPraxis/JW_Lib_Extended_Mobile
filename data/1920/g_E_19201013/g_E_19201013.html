<p><span class="font10">“We exact full religious toleration and the complete separation of church and state.”— Theodore Roosevelt, Twenty-sixth President of the United States, 1900.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“They have now crowned their evil work by the promulgation of a vicious and pernicious decree for the separation of Church and State. . . .

<p><span class="font8">“The Church sometimes tolerates schools in which r ’igion i&lt; not taught, and permits Catholic children to a*t;'i'.d them, when the circumstances are such as to l-ave no alternative, and when due precautions are taken to supply by other means the religious training which such schools do not give. She reserves the right to judge whether this be the case, and, if her judgment is unfavorable. claims the right to forbid attendance.”— Gregory XVI. January 16, 1831.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“It is consoling and encouraging to realize that <sub>:</sub> . . free schools . . . are more universally enjoyed today than ever before.”—William McKinley, Twenty-fifth President of the United States. 1897.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">&quot;Education outside the Catholic Church is damnable heresy. . . .

<p><span class="font10">“The very reason that makes us unqualified in our opposition to state-aided sectarian schools makes us equally bent that in the management of our public schools, the adherents of each creed shall be given exact and equal justice.”— Theodore Roosevelt, Twenty-sixth President of the United States, 1900.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“‘The Royal Government shall remunerate the catechism teachers in the state schools.

The children should stitdy these subjects together, Ijeeanse they will be thrown together in later life and will have common need </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">oi</span><span class="font10"> thi.s i»formation. The proper place to teach religion is in the home or, if so preferred, by religious teachers, in places appointed; and with that the state should have nothing to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The argument that a school is godless because - it does not teach religion is pure nonsense. The question of godliness does not ent&amp;r into spelling, composition, penmanship, reading, grammar, geography, arithmetic, history, civics, hygiene or industrial art, and the attempt to inject either Bible or beads into the matter is hypocritical and against the real interests of the state.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">When a child is made to believe that he cannot be taught the foregoing subjects because of somebody's religion or lack of religion, there is then and there raised in his mind the hateful thought that his religion is incompatible with the institutions upon which the republic must depend for its continued existence, i. e., the education of its citizens: and the natural result is the great disgrace witnessed during the World War where American soldiers, born in America, had to be sent to army schools to learn the language of their own country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The truth of the matter is that an autocratic and liberty-hating church bodes no good to a liberty-loving land. The two can not get along together. The one will surely destroy the other. Hence it is not strange that in Michigan we find the Wayne County Civic Association hoeing an uphill row in its effort to get this amendment before the people. The newspapers refuse even paid advertisements, so afraid are they of the dreaded boycott; and so the work of tearing down the American school system goes on apace at the same time that noble-minded men and women are trying to build it up.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Scant Difference Discernible</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">T</span><span class="font10">HE difference between the Democratic and Republican platforms ami parties in the coming election may be discerned—through a microscope. The candidate for President on the Republican ticket voted for all the measures that have made the thinking men and women of the Tinted States so dissatisfied with the Democratic administration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">His congressional record shows that he practically approved the Hog Island steal: that he voted for war and for the bill prohibiting freedom of conscience, sometimes known as the espionage bill; that he was a strong advocate of the compulsory draft law and for the return of the railroads, which he knew would result in increased freight rates and billions of dollars of extra expense to the rank and file consumer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">' He favored the new army bill, which passed the Senate April twentieth, calling for 300,000 men and $600,000,000 annually, empowering the whim of a president to mobilize the country and thus creating in a peaceful country a military machine exceeding in size the pre-war German military machine which was crushed at an expense that has ruined the world for a hundred years to come. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">He is in favor of the Paris “Peace” League of Nations which The Golden Age has described at length in its issue of July&quot;.the same League now bestowing its benevolent smile upon the thirty wars being waged in various parts of the earth. He is in favor of intervention in Mexico, which, if it takes place, will lie another crime against civilization, as abundantly proven in The Golden Age for August </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">4</span><span class="font10"> and August 18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">He has done nothing to indicate that he is in favor of the general amnesty which has been granted by all the other warring powers; and his connection with.the press, which has been responsible for the greatest flood of falsehoods and progaganda ever known, is enough to make every person wonder how anything could be gained by placing him in the great office to which he aspires, and for which the Wall Street interests have selected him. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">International Anarchy </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">By xcirton r. Hartuhori</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">the Roman Empire.’. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">We have had so-called international laws; but have they not. with the treaties, been mere &quot;scraps of paper”— &quot;gentlemen's agreements,” broken at willAre we not now drifting into rational as well as international world-wide anarchy.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">All of the great empires of the world— Assyrian. Persian. Macedonian and Roman— wvre political aggregations loosely bound together and dominating the world only in a military sense.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">For the first time in the history of the world, within the past 45 years, its many economic units have fused into one great unit, by spontaneous action and not by military force. This unity is unprecedented, and out of it has grown the ideal of internationalism, the forerunner of complete world union; and ambitious imperialists in Germany and England, seeing the great prize—world empire and world trade— prepared for the titanic struggle to win it And English imperialists think they won.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The unifying of finance also has been progressing until international bankers now dominate the financial world, the League of Nations Covenant being the instrument by which they ** expect to unify the world, forming the fifth world empire, based on the British Church and State System—the British Empire aiming to take in the whole world, unified in religion as well as politics and economics. For the first time in the history of the world, military and naval power, political, economic and religious power are completely- united under one head.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">This clearly is the purpose that animates millions of the most prominent and influential i, people of the world, who through the press and C the pulpit shape public opinion, though they declare their aim cautiously, in diplomatic language, gradually educating people up to their objective.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Their urgent appeal for the conservation of peace and civilization through the League of i. Nations Covenant, and other features of their L propaganda when examined, disclose their real </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">F</span><span class="font10"> object to be the formation of an empire com-:j pletely dominating the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">After the rebellion of the Southern slave-! holders in the United States had failed. English imperialists, who had expected that the American Union would be broken up and the states absorbed into the British Empire, began to conclude that the empire would be split up into several nations, like the United States. Gladstone favored this idea; but when he (iied, the old idea of British imperialists again became ascendant, and the propaganda to lay the foundation of a great federation, so-called, of the United States and the British Colonies with the * mother country began more definitely to shape. German imperialists were at the same time pushing their propaganda here to defeat the aims of the British.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">* As before stated, in economies and finance the world has become unified, and German opposition to the plan of British and American imperialists has become practically eliminated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">This explains why the unprecedentedly destruct tive terms of the peace treaty were imposed on Germany to force her to acquiesce. Those terms will be modified whenever Germany consents to become a part of the British Empire, and not before.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">All the spoils of the war have passed into the hands of England—vast colonies and the trade of the world. Here, then, we have the factors of world-wide revolution and anarchy unprecedented in extent and intensity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In comparison with the proposed world-wide British Empire, the Roman Empire was only a babe in swaddling clothes. But that world empire is not yet formed sufficiently to act in open self defense. The Senate of the United States has for the tune being halted the plans of the English and American imperialists. This leaves the international world in a state of inci-, pient anarchy. The League cannot function without the power, prestige and money of the United States. Europe is bankrupt and.starving. Russia is in-the hands of the proletariat, who is bitterly opposed to imperialism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The whole world is shot through, so to speak, with organizations radically opposed to each other. In England, the nucleus on which it is proposed to build this great world empire, 90 percent of the working people are unionized and are class conscious. Their interests are diametrically opposed to the aristocratic element which controls the British government; and the scheme of- the British imperialists to dominate the world is repugnant to the English working men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Their discontent is based on conditions that are fundamentally unjust; and while before the law technically they have.equality of rigU. in fact their rights are disregarded. Instead of the present agitation quieting down it Ifia.-t increase and intensify. The repugnance in England to the assumptions of title and privilege is increasing, and not only there but all over the world. The psychology of title is beginning to operate against, instead of in favor of the holder. While the war in the interest of imperialism was fought in the name of democracy and self-determination, democracy and self-determination propose to have some of the game as well as the name. The people are tired of political hypocrisy or any other kind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">England and the United States are the main powers in the proposed Empire. England, the</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">dominant power, is in both name and fact a i monarchy and an empire as well as an aristocracy: and those who speak of her as a democracy know that it is a lie—bald hypocrisy, spoken to deceive the thoughtless.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">■ The pressure to taxation resulting from the expenditure of more than one hundred billions of money and a score of millions of lives, directly and indirectly, in the criminal war between</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;English and German imperialists for world</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">i &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dominion and world trade—the pressure of this</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">i unprecedented burden of sorrow and taxation । . laid with autocratic assumption upon the hearts 1 and backs of the people, without consulting them, is yet to find expression in the resentment k &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of those people. We have an illustration of this</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">I &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in Russia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">’ Men are thinking as never before. “As ye sow, so shall ye reap.” The law of cause and effect is inexorable. “The mills of the gods grind slowly, but they grind exceeding fine.” j Year by year the crushing effect of this taxation will burn itself into the brain of the '( common people, however stupid and thoughtless they may be. On their backs will automatically be shifted the taxes that wealth ought to pay.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">•[ The necessities of the people will have to bear - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the tax. If hit hard enough in the stomach the</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">t</span><span class="font10"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;blow reaches the brain, as in the case of the</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">starving woman who started the French Revolu-</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">•, tion by beating a tin pan and crying, “Bread! bread!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Talk of stopping profiteering! All the business men and manufacturers in America and J Europe are thoroughly organized. All of the ? necessities of the people pass through their hands. The law of supply and demand no i longer operates: prices are fixed by these organizations which are stronger than the government. They take toll on the necessities for their own support, be it little or much, according to their extravagant living. They pay the producer of the raw material as little as he can be squeezed to accept and get from the consumer as much as they can squeeze out of him. The consumers, the common people (those belonging to those associations get discounts), must take . what is left and pay the price or go without.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The working people have organized their unions for defense. Only 15 per cent of them, . however, are organized in the United States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The crushing taxation shifted down,down,down until it lands on the backs of the unorganized masses, will drive them into the unions. &quot;Tlffi devil take the hindmost.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Is this not a state of anarchy? Show me any . cohesion in the world if you can; except the cohesion of antagonism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Besides these organizations there are some X fifty smaller ones, to say nothing of the two great political parties, ostensibly pitted against each other by shrewd politicians who. fog the issues and cancel the voting power of the people to prevent them from getting control or getting anywhere except into the camp of the profiteers or the imperialists. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•' - /</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">We have the Elks and the Moose, the Knights of Columbus, the Free Masons, and the Orange- ' men, etc., etc., all pulling at cross purposes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Then in the religious world we have scores of ; denominations all teaching diverse doctrines, spme of them antagonistic in spirit—Roman Catholics and Protestants, Anglicans and Lu- ; therans, all a jangle of confusion and anarchy—&gt; religious chaos.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The $100,000,000,000 and the vast labor worse than thrown away in the World War would have produced marvellous results for good if expended on improvements sadly needed by the * human race. But less than a score of men at the head, in their lust for world empire, plunged the nations into the maelstrom of hate and murder; and still almost the same few of the victors are planning another deal in their lust for empire, which cannot fail to drag what is left of the human race still deeper into a debacle of hate, murder, starvation and agony.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Do you say this picture is overdrawn—pessimistic? Possibly you may conclude later that in reality it is relatively optimistic. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Jesus no doubt referred to these times in His forecast (Matthew 24: 21. 22): “Fox- then shall be great tribulation such as was not since the beginning of the world [the present era of .~o-called civilization] to this time, no. nor ever shall be: and except those days should be shortened there should be no flesh be saved”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Jesus went on to say that those days would he shortened—evidently by the coming of the kingdom of heaven for which He taught His disciples to pray. This, instead of the British world empire, would be established and rule in all the earth, when peace, justice and love would </span><span class="font6">(Concluded on page 13)</span></p>

<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Age of Gold vs. Golden Age:</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font10">Tiyr Editor:—In view of your very interest-</span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">1V1 </span><span class="font10">ing article in a recent number of The Golden Age, entitled, “How to Profiteer,” I am sen</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">din</span><span class="font10">g reference to a few Scriptures recently ' called to my attention. The deplorable conditions caused by “profiteering” have brought much suffering to many; but these Scriptures f may bring a ray of comfort to some sad hearts, and’ inspire the hope that soon these conditions •will change, when the Lord takes control of jt earth's affairs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Some rich profiteers are referred to in a parable (Luke 12:16-20) as a “rich man”, i. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“And he said. Soul, thou hast much goods laid</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">I &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;un for many years: take thine ease, eat. drink,</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">5 and tie merry.” “But God said unto him, Thou fool, this night [during the dark night of the ? time of trouble] shall thy soul be required of 1 thee; </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">then</span><span class="font10"> whose shall those things be which thou hast provided</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lord does not tell us in this parable</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sub>r</sub> whose they shall be, and evidently the rich man did not know; for the Prophet David says . (Psalm 39:6): &quot;He heapeth up riches, and ? knnweth not who shall gather them”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Job also w?.s a nronhet of th<sup>zi</sup> Lord: and he tells us something about it. (Job 27:13-17) t 1 “This is the portion of a wicked man with God, ■ and the heritage of oppressors, which they shall receive of the Almighty .... Though he heap up silver as the dust, ami prepare raiment as <sub>f</sub> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the clay, he may </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">prepare</span><span class="font10"> it. but the y’n.-t shall</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">- put it on. and the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">innocent</span><span class="font10"> shall divide the $ silver.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Solomon, another prophet of the Lord, has a</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">*s , word to say concerning this same subject.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">(Proverbs 13: 22) &quot;The wealth &lt;&gt;f the-sinnor is laid up for the just.” Also Proverbs 28:8: “He </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">’f&quot;</span><span class="font10"> that by usury and unjust gain increaseth his substance, he shall gather it for him that wdl pity the poor.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">■ The Prophet Joel tells us who it is rhtit will <sup>1</sup> pity the poor. (Joel 2:18. I!)) &quot;Then will the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">* Lord</span><span class="font10"> be jealous for his land, and pity his people. Behold. I will send you corn ami wine , &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and oil, and ve shall be satisfied therewith: and</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">I will no more make- you a reproach among the <sup>A</sup> heathen.” The Apostle James tells ns (James 5:11): “Ye have heard of the patience of Job, and have seen the end of the Lord, that the Lord is very </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">pitiful</span><span class="font10"> and of tender mercy”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">By L. Smith &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">James also tells as of a class Iieing chosen of the Lord to assist in bringing these blessings, to the world. (James 2: 5) “Hearken, my beloved brethren. Hath not God chosen the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">poor</span><span class="font10"> of this world, rich in faith, heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised to them that love him?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">These are the saints, poor despised ones who, during this gospel age have walked in the footsteps of Jesus, the meek and lowly One, in the narrow way of self-sacrifice, and who will, with their Lord, as a merciful and faithful High Priest, have the privilege of assisting the world in walking up the highway of holiness in the Golden Age, mentioned by Isaiah in Chapter 35.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">So, seeing from the Lord's Word, that the masses of mankind are soon to reap the benefit of those riches which are now being piled up by the profiteers, let none envy- them, but wait with patience until the Lord shall take control of earth's affairs and rule for the blessing of all the willing and obedient. Let us observe also from the Lord's Word that proper principles of justice will operate in the dispensing of the kingdom blessings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The Psalmist says (Psalm 103:13): “Take as a father pitieth his children, so the Lord pitieth th m that </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">re eren.ee</span><span class="font10"> him.” Also Ecclesiastes 2.: 26: &quot;For God giveth to a man that is good in his sight, wisdom, and knowledge and joy: but to th? sinner he giveth travail, to gather and to h“i!j iu&gt;. that he inay give to him that is </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">good </span><span class="font10">h^fori' God.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">This is the “Age of Gold” for a few, but the next will be the “Golden Age” for all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">from pane 12i prevail instea I of war, confusion, starvation and hate. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The miracles of modern scientific attainment foreshadow, and the Word of God proclaims that when this old evil civilization (world) controlled by Satan perishes through its own inherent evil a new and really true civilization (world) will rise out of the ashes of the old not by supernatural, but by natural means, gradually developing into a paradise more glorious than man ever dreamed Heaven to be—a restored Eden, the earthly phase of the invisible, heavenly kingdom, ruled by Christ the invisible Ruler of all the new world instead of Satan, who now is the invisible ruler of this old evil civilization.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">f </span><span class="font10" style="font-variant:small-caps;">ITr. Editor! I would commend your honesty. </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">1VJ. </span><span class="font10">I could wish that your magazine might become a great journalistic mountain and fill the entire void or sphere of a lying, money-led press, doing flunky business to outworn interests derogatory to the good of mankind and doomed to pass away.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The articles dealing with the subjects—What is Anarchy, The Negro Race, and The League of Nations—are examples of honesty and truthfulness, seldom seen in any publication. Self-interest, .pride, fear, dishonesty, stain the management of them all with rare exceptions, as we ! perceive. The contrast is most unfavorable to 1 the “kept press”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Few journals are ready to point out that mob I &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;violence, wherein thousands are seized with a</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">I &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;desire to lynch a wrong-doer, is anarchy. Few</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">will admit that any violation of established law j is anarchy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Few</span><span class="font10"> are ready to accord the Negroes their</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">natural and legal rights or to concede that all nations are of one blood, made to dwell in peace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">[</span><span class="font10">The discussion of The League of Nations is along the same line of open facts, “openly</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> arrived at”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">I &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President’s position has always been</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">J untenable. His bold departure in leaving his office and assuming the entire world burden in disregard of the people’s law-makers; his visit to the Pope of Rome in disregard of Protestant * principles, to say nothing of respectable pride, has placed the President in an unenviable posi-‘ tion. How different his course at Rome from that </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">1 </span><span class="font10">of Mr. Roosevelt, who held his Protestant nose high above the Vatican, and preserved the Protestant principles and traditions of freedom , of speech and. action. No kissing of the Pope’s foot for him; though Mr. Wilson, out of respect for the Pope’s enmity to the King of Italy, obeyed “Benedict’s orders” to drive from the ’ king’s palace to &quot;the American embassy first, and then drive to the Vatican&quot;. The President's course not only brought upon him the combined opposition of the people, as shown in the election of a Republican Congress to cross Wilson’s way, but doubtless divine providence overruled in the entire matter. The nation that patronizes Rome is on troublous ground: and the man who courts Rome’s favor finds less and less of the favor of God. At every turn the President has met a bear, with troubles from coast to coast— troubles in his own party and outside of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The stormy career of the League and the \ President’s efforts to make peace suggest many Scriptures: “He taketh the wise in their own craftiness”. “He disappointeth the devices of the crafty, so that their hands cannot perform their bidding.”—Job 5:13, 12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It is lamentable, and a sure sign of decay, when for political prestige rulers ‘ pander to Rome and surrender a people’s liberties to the worst enemy of all liberty. No wonder-the Lord has confused and confounded the operators of such baseless procedure and set at naught their operations as the work of mice!</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Here in the Peace Conference were the leaders of the leading nations—“the big four” of the world. Here the great state churches of Europe were represented.</span></p>

In tendering this homage to the Great Author of every public and private good, I assure myself that it expresses your sentiments not less that my own. nor those of my fellow-citizens less than either. No people can be bound, to acknowledge and adore the invisible Hand which conducts the affairs of men more than the people of the United States. Every .tep by which they have advanced <sup>4 </sup>to the character of an independent nation seems to have been distinguished by -ome token of Providential agency, and in the system of their united government the tranquil deliberations and voluntary consent of so many distinct communities from which the event has resulted, cannot be compared with the means by which most governments have been established without some return</span></p>

I am very 7 much impressed with the effect of your efforts to connect the various happenings throughout the world with the change of the dispensation now at hand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">T am employed in a large railroad shop, ' w' ?ro gu’to a number of the workers are readers of T:ir. C'LrEN Age; and the me.’-age it brings ir. &quot;ire.&quot; them to look for better thing? just ak?r.fl. Keep up the good work! I ■wish the Golden Age Magazine had access to every home in the world. Absolutely all men ere looking for a change to come, and soon. If the &quot;idea” of the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font10"> can lie thoroughly impressed, it will go a long way toward preparation for the incoming blessings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">• Nowhere does the evidence that we are in the day of ■visitation” show quite so plainly to us as it does from the illumination of the hith-. erto dark sayings of our Lord and H's apostles, as well as the prophets. In the light shining from the pages of the Golden Age Magazine, many of those perplexing sayings recorded in the Bible are becoming reasonable, really believable! And if it is true, as the Good Book says, that the light is to shine more and more unto the &quot;perfect day”, then if light is flooding and illuminating the things that have never been understood, to my mind it is indisputable proof that we are entering the real Golden Age.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Then take those hitherto mysterious, unexplainable yet fascinating books—The Revelation, The Song of Songs and the prophecy of Ezekiel! They have liecoine so reasonable ami understandable from the golden glow of light radiating from the pages of an unpretentious book called &quot;The Finished Mystery”,' that nearly everybody can get inspiration and instruction as well as warning from those wondrous symbols, pictures and eode messages. And the publishers of this book announce a magazine edition of this untold wealth for twenty cents! ! Surely no profiteering here! It will be to the everlasting profit of everyone who reads this remarkable book. Its authors claim no special inspiration, but modestly say that the &quot;due time” having come, the seals are broken and the message unfolds: and that they but wrote what they saw and heard. I wish, Mr. Editor, you would recommend this wonderful Iwiok to your readers. It will help them to see that</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">The Golden Age is at the door!</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Open wide the gates, And kt the King of Glory in!</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">A knowledge of these things is evidently necessary in order that we may act intelligently. For instance, how could anyone cooperate in the treading of the &quot;winepress” of Revelation 16:18 unless he have a knowledge—fl </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">mental illitinina-tian,</span><span class="font10"> if you please—of the meaning of those symbols anti of the things they symbolize? ‘Seal not the sayings of the prophecy of those books’ —the time is at hand. Open the columns of The Golden Age so that it may really be “an angel standing in the sun”, pouring forth the golden light that will dispel the noxious vapors of selfishness now so completely enveloping the earth !</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark34"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark35"></a>Not Enough Gold</span></h3>
<p><span class="font15">T</span><span class="font12">HE problem of the reputed </span><span class="font10">scarcity of gold would be solved if the Dayton, Kentucky, doctor should take it into his head to make more gold than he has been making out of cheap metals. Doctor Rees says he can transmute other things into gold, if they are kept “het up” long enough; but no information has come out of the State as to how long the fires must be kept going, or how much coal is required at $15 per ton. But if a yellow deluge should overflow th6 boundaries of Kentucky, more problems would lie set up than the transmutation could solve.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">For one thing, the question of the maintenance of the gold stock of the United States would be answered once and forever. Xo longer would it disturb financial tranquility to see the gold reserve depleted in one year by $292,796,000; for the financiers’ dream would be of a better world where there would he enough less of the mammon of unrighteousness to enable the business world to keep afloat. For gold would not be worth the meagre $9 an ounce in purchasing power it is now, as against the $20.67 it is supposed to be worth to keep the dollar's worth at par; the difficulty would be to give the metal away, to find bins to keep it in, or reservoirs to hold the Kentucky deluge, or that other yellow flood which may yet come from the GO-mile ridge of gold near Kalgoorlie, in Western Australia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">From London come hints that gold is rising in value. This is probably based on the fact that the cost of producing it is going up, above the point at which a profit can be made by selling the product of the mines. In America gold mines are closing at what is termed an alarming rate. Many mines will never open because of the cost of pumping out the water and putting in new timbering; mining camps are dead; cities once dependent on the mines are depopulated; and skilled miners by tin? thousand are out of work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The manifest effect of the scarcity of an article is to raise its value in comparison with other articles: that is. it takes mor-- of th&quot; other articles to secure the same quantity, and conversely less of the first article to get the same amount of the others. Expressed in other term?—for gold is money—a rise in the price of gold would cause an increase in the value of the present 29-cent dollar, so that it might’become a</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">50-cent dollar, a 75-cent dollar, and ultimately a 100-cent dollar. The relation between the coming scarcity of the precious metal and the cost of living is obvious—that the cost, as measured in money, would decline until it became normal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">But a movement of any kind in the value of money is a problem-producer; for who would have the authority to command the rising gold dollar to stop going up* If the gold in the dollar reached a premium and became worth,' say, $1.10, every gold coin to be found would make its way to the melting pot to be sold for a profit, much as silver has done in France and England, and the silver dollar in this country. That the banks and the government have cornered the gold supply might then become more fortunate than it now appears; for there is so little gold in the possession of the common people that few could take a profit that way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Much of the gold produced goes into manufacture for people that like to wear gold-plated or solid decorations upon their clothes or persons. Last year the gold mined in the United States was worth $58,000,000, while what went into manufacturing was $21,848,800 more, or $79,-848,800. At that rate, it is only a question of time when all the gold in the country would be used up and none left for monetary purposes, if none were imported. With new nationalities rousing from dormancy all over the world, and calling for gold to back up their currency, to say nothing of the demand from Great Britain and Europe, the need for more gold was never more pressing. In the face of falling world production, it will need something like the Kentucky miracle, properly subjected to government control and supervision, to keep the gold river at the regular $20.67-an-ounce level.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The Federal Reserve managers state that at Xew Year's, 1919, they had 60 cents in gold for every dollar of Federal Reserve money; but by the next Xew Year's this had gone down to 50.3 cents. Once or twice in 1920 the gold reserve dipped Mow the 40-cent legal minimum—of cuur.-H. without getting any manager into jail—and if this should happen again too much, or too often, or too long, they fear for the confidence of the public in the currency issued under this plan. At any rate, nothing is more urgently needed than more gold from the mines or elsewhere; and the proposal has been for the Government to get hold of more gold, by putting a tax of 50 cents per pennyweight of fine gold in all articles sold after a certain date, from which fund $10 an ounce would be paid as a bonus to. the producer of new gold. Only in this way, declare the bankers, can the gold back of the currency be kept up to the 40-cent level; otherwise the financiers and economists think that some other monetary unit must be found than the legal 25.8 grains of gold to the dollar. In a future article The Golden Age may discuss some of the proposed bases, other than gold, for the money system of the country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">A monetary system is all right as long as the unit remains unchanged. But when the unit starts see-sawing up and down, as the value of gold has been doing, and still threatens to do, all kinds of troubles are engendered, from high cost of living to the perplexities of Federal Reserve managers. Something must be done soon; the problems of unrest that hang in some measure on the value of gold in comparison with other articles, will not wait for ponderous deliberations and snail-like action. Indeed, it is true that, considering the ponderosity and dignity of hankers, there is little hope that any one will make the necessary moves actually to remedy existing financial conditions. According to the Bible, they’will not; for the world is right now at the final end of the age during which such things have been possible. Fortunately, however, the Golden Age will immediately begin, with its infinitely better arrangements in every department of existence: and no doubt many a conscientious and tired banker will welcome the day when he can drop his often too-heavy burden of responsibility annd get out again into the free air that ho enjoyed when a boy, and into the liberty that will be common property in those days.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark36"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark37"></a>Protection Against Deadly Gases</span></h4>
<p><span class="font15">M</span><span class="font10">ANY a person has given up his life in the fumes of carbon monoxid*- ‘•’rom a house furnace or stove. Others have lost theirs from illuminating gas. a poisonous constituent of which is often carbon monoxide.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">A new means of discovering the presence of this deadly gas, which causes innumerable</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">deaths in mines, has been perfected by Professor C. R. Hoover, of Wesleyan University, Middletown, Connecticut. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">During the war the properties of carbon monoxide were extensively investigated with a view to its employment for slaughtering Germans and Austrians; but owing to the difficulties of.: condensing and transporting the gas, the project was abandoned. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Its presence in mines, emplacements and ■ shafts'has been detected by talcing into such , places a canary bird, as this little creature, being particularly susceptible to the gas, falls , at once into a faint when this gas is-present.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The new detector will reduce the market for canary birds: for it is a delicate scientific instrument which records, not merely the presence of the monoxide, but the quantity in the air. It consists of a small glass tube filled with a mixture of an iodine salt, pumice stone, and fuming sulphuric acid. When the contaminated air is admitted to the tube the contents turn green, the depth of the color indicating the “ presence and percentage of the poisonous gas. There is an indicator which records with scientific accuracy the exact proportion of the injur- <sub>: </sub>io us vapor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The new detector can be lowered by a string into shafts, and then withdrawn for examination, before any one is permitted to enter. It is I of special value in the iron and steel industries, in gas manufacture, for fire departments, and in mine rescue work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Professor Hoover’s contrivance can be used in conjunction with a new type of gas mask which counteracts the effects of carbon rnon-oxide, and is patterned after the army gas mask developed by the Chemical Warfare Service in the World War.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The coal miners will welcome such a device; for it will enhance the safety of the mines, and reduce the deaths of four men per million tons mined that have prevailed. t&lt;&gt; say nothing of the distressing a&lt;-ci&lt;lents not resulting in death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">By such means man is gradually carrying out the divine command to •■subdue th&lt;&gt; earth”, (Genesis 1 :2S) and the other prophecy that in God’s holy kingdom, the Golden Age, no one shall be injured in accidents or otherwise.— Isaiah 65: 25.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark38"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark39"></a>Horse Sense:</span></h3>
<p><span class="font15">O</span><span class="font10">NE of the first requisites in training a horse is the ability to determine his natural disposition; i. e., his natural inclinations </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">or, in </span><span class="font10">short, how he is likely to act under differ</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">ent </span><span class="font10">circumstances. One unable to judge his , Horse’s disposition is apt to do the wrong thing, or the right thing at the wrong time. What would cause one horse to act a certain way [might cause another to act just the opposite, j &quot;However, the above mentioned requirement is not at all difficult to develop. Men who have j flong been in the business of horse training have I classified horses with reference to disposition 'under four general heads; and all horses come under one of these heads or under two of them combined. Thus it is comparatively easy for the mere amateur to classify his anftnal by j. observing the general outline of the head and then placing it in the particular class under i i which it comes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">i The first avenue of communication between man and horse is the sense of touch. For in____ stance, the stroke of the whip means to the horse, “Go on”. Later on the mere motion of the whip means the same thing and finally the i &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;voice, will cause the horse to move forward, as</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">[ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when we say, “Get up”. Punishment must he</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">administered in such a way that the impression j &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;left on the horse is that it was his disobedience</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">I &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that caused it. The more deeply it can be imp &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pressed upon his mind that disobedience brings</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">L &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;its own punishment, the greater will be our</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">[' &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;control over him. The secret of making any</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">horse do just what you want him to do is to punish him for doing the wrong thing and caress ; him for doing the right thing. This is the theory upon which successful horse-breaking and all the difficult trick feats are based.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">’ The mature colt which has not previously been handled is quite easy to train, since he has formed no bad habits( the result of improper « training) and is not conscious of his own mus-cuiar power. All we need to do is to make the proper impressions which by repetition Itecome , habits, and we have a properly trained animal that can be relied on at all times. Yet the outlaw requires more than mere training. He must first he subdued; for he has learned his strength.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">’ He must learn that man is his master, and this ’ can he done only by making the proper impres-</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">By H. E. Coffey</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">sions at the right time. The worst outlaw known can be made perfectly reliable by applying the general principles laid down in the foregoing paragraphs. A horse that will stop perfectly still at the command “Whoa!” and stand until the signal to start is given is the only safe animal to drive; and he can be made thus safe only by intelligent and proper training.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">As a typical outlaw we cite the ease of “Flash”. This Missouri man-eating stallion was an outlaw and killer with a reputation spreading over several states. He was a Kentucky thoroughbred, descending from a long list of maneaters, and stood almost sixteen hands. He was noted for his extreme viciousuess and his incurable desire to kill his keepers. His w*as thought to be a hopeless case until a trainer who used more brains than brawn bought him. After a few short lessons he was made perfectly reliable and is now doing useful work. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">By reason of the Adamic fall mankind has been greatly impaired, both mentally and physically. Ceasing, to a great extent, to continue to use his God-given power to reason man has in a great many instances resorted to brute force to accomplish his purposes; and this has resulted in many unhappy experiences. Men as well as innocent women and children have been the victims of many serious and fatal runaways, etc., all caused by a poorly trained horse.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Xow the light of truth is being shed more and more upon every phase of human activity, as the Scriptures foretold it would in the end of the aze. Ailarn was originally given perfect control over the animal creation. Yet the.power he possessed over them was not magnetic. but the re-_ suit of his superior brain power and his ability to reason. Driven from his perfect home he was compelled by the force of• circumstances to seek a livelihood in the imperfect earth. At first no doubt he lived on roots and herbs. Later, the tiesh of animals was used. This no doubt instilled into them a fear of man. Likewise, some of the animals finding insufficient nourishment in the undeveloped earth liegan to prey upon the grass-eating animals; and thus the struggle for life has continued down to this day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">However, God promises that shortly His foot stool (the earth) shall l&gt;e made glorious and that then nothing shall “'hurt or destroy”. This is the Golden Age about which the poets have sung and for which many noble hearts have longed. In that age of blessing, now at the door,’‘the cow and</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">jp As many as nine varieties of corn have been planted on a small field of ten acres. Such a mixture was not as salable as a pure strain, and the farmers had 110 good seed the next year.</span></p>

<p><span class="font15">I</span><span class="font10"> F THE increase in the number of inventions, or the rate at which they are issued yearly, indicates anything in regard to the opening up of the incoming new era, then there is an approximate method of finding the time of its beginning. All great changes have small beginnings, and take place more or less gradually at first. The period of invention and progress is no exception to the rule. However, it is but one phase of the mighty change which is taking place in all of the world, making every thing different from what we had ever dreamed, in preparation for the Golden Age.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Almost all of the present commercial machin. ery has been invented in the past 45 years. This ; startling fact is seen to be true, when one remembers that the Centennial Exposition at. Philadelphia in 1876 marks about the beginning of the inventive and commercial era. It was in ; this year that Bell invented the telephone and “ . exhibited it for the first time. Before that year, only a few far-reaching improvements had taken place: such as the printing press, steam engine, telegraph and a few other minor ones.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">If one looks around today and counts the big inventions which have been far-reaching in changing the conditions of the world, in prepar---“ ation for a new era of blessings for humanity, he will see that they have been invented since the Centennial Exposition in 1876. It is hardly necessary to enumerate them; for even the young people of today can remember when many of these big discoveries were made. The invention of the flying machine, wireless telephone and telegraph, moving - picture, automobile, electric train, electric light and’ electric machinery for home and factory, phonograph, typewriter. X-ray, etc., etc., are all within the memory of the present generation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">People have been inventing ever since history began: but there has been no sudden acceleration to the rate at which it took place, no tremendous increase in the output stream of inveii-tions, until recent years. It is possible to find about when this sudden change took place, when this inventive era began, by recourse to the Patent Office records.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The best way to visualize this concept or idea is to see it pictured in a plot. A plot of the data obtained from the Patent reports consists of a-curve, drawn </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">to</span><span class="font10"> scale, showing the number of patents issued up to any date as far as the records go. Years are marked off along a horizontal line, and the number of patents issued up to any year is marked off in a vertical direction. . The curve passes through the points thus indi- • cated, and thus </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">shows</span><span class="font10"> graphically how many patents were issued before any given date.</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19201013_files/g_E_19201013-5.png" alt="" style="width:133pt;height:121pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font10">The curve follows very closely along the horizontal, line until a sudden upward turn starts it on a steep up wan I trend. This bend shows the approximate time of the beginning of this era of invention and increase of mechanical achievement. This sudden upward turn is located about ten years before the Centennial Exposition of 1876: the bend is completed and the curve is started in its upward direction by 1872. four years before the Centennial Exposition and’ 6,000 years after the creation of Adam.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Another plot shows the same thing perhaps better than the one above mentioned. Instead of measuring off the total number of patents issued up to any year in a vertical direction, suppose only the raie at why h they are issued— namely, the number per year—is measured off in the vertical direction, and a curved line drawn through the points thus indicated. This curve, has a sharp bend in it, and is the steepest where the rate was suddenly accelerated: that is, where the speeding-up process began.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">This era of invention has introduced la’x&gt;r-saving machinery of all kinds. Man and beast have been doing the labor of humanity since Adam. For six millenniums, therefore, man ha» “eaten his bread by the sweat of his brow” according to the sentence pronounced upon Adam and the human rac\ The seventh Millennium, however, bids fair to have the sentence gradually removed by the wise application of labor-saving machinery when properly applied in the coming Gulden Age.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark42"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark43"></a>Lime as a Remedy</span></h3>
<p><span class="font15">T</span><span class="font10">HE human body is composed, it is stated, of about fourteen elementary substances. If these are present in the proper proportions, there is likely to be reasonably good health; if one or more of them are deficient, there may be ailments which stubbornly resist efforts to subdue them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">One of the more common lacks in the system is that of lime. The deficiency often causes distressing symptoms, which may be acute or chronic. The person may be in ill-health without being able to ascertain the cause, and may suffer in a variety of ways; for lime is a constituent of Irone, muscle and nerve, to say nothing of the various important glands of the body. A low percentage of lime lays the body open to infection, because the tissues are weak and lack their usual resisting power to the germs or bacteria which cause certain diseases. Without the right amount of lime, convalescence and recovery may prove slow or impossible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Cases of convulsions in children may be owing to deficiency in lime. Other troubles attributable in part at least to this cause are insomnia, acid excess, poor digestion, insanity, liver trouble, kidney affections, heart trouble, female disorders, nervous prostration, nervousness, indigestion, dyspepsia, neuritis, neurasthenia, and rheumatism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">According to the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Medical Record,</span><span class="font10"> many such cases improve markedly when treated with one or more of the salts of calcium (lime). The theory is stated thus: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Approximately, calcium constitutes 50% of the inorganic matter of bone', as compared with magnesium it is in the proportion of 1 part to 3 in muscular tissue, and 1 part to 10 in the central nervous system, and this is probably true of nerve structures throughout the body.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Now suppose the calcium content of the blood stream is diminished 40%. it follows that the tissues, including nerve tissue, are being drawn upon and unable to meet the demand. When the central nervous sv-tem or any part of its mechanism, the muscles, the bone structure, or the glandular appoml&lt;m-&gt;s. including the ductless glands, arc robbed of their esxmtial chemical constituent. their normal function is arrested or destroyed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">&quot;Calcium depletion of the tissues is brought about by chemical deviation, incident to disordered function, which gives rise to acid excess; and this harks back to dietary deficiency and </span><span class="font10">coincident or consecutive </span><span class="font8">impair- <sub>: </sub>ment of the digestive capacity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“To the layman, dietary deficiency simply means lack of food, but to the intelligent physician it has a far-reaching significance. For example, when the phyai-cians connected with an orphan asylum in New York . found scurvy making serious inroads on their patients, with orange juice unobtainable, they resorted to canned tomatoes, and it was demonstrated that tomato juice •&lt; answered every purpose. But the ohildren would not ■ have been susceptible to scurvy had their dietary been ; properly proportioned. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“It is not sufficient that a person has all the food he ’ wants; for we know that many such persons suffer from hunger. In other words the body tissues lack something, and it is this sense that gives them a constant 7 craving for something they know not what. The hunger sense has frequently been so pronounced in hospital patients that the medical attendants seriously considered sending them to an asylum, all because of the mistaken notion that starvation will cure disease— when the disordered mentality may be traced directly to dietary deficiency.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“It must be perfectly clear to the most superficial observer that urn.uitabie food, no matter how it is prepared or eaten, will eventually disturb the digestive apparatus, say the stomach or the intestinal tract. Thus ' we have decomposition of animal foods in the stomach and fermentation of the starchy foods in the intestine; <sup>1 </sup>and if the stomach is dilatory, or unable to perform its functions in digesting all the animal foods introduced, this partially digested and decomposing food is carri- d along to the lower bowel, where microbian dig-'-riou takes place. It is under such conditions that patuwti complain of fetid breath. In these circumstances, r! - . liver is called upon to perform extra work in destroying or oxidizing the poisons thus formed; but after-*-u hi 1&gt;&gt; this organ also complains, and unless it receives better treatment it rebels, in the form of inflammation or abcess. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“’When starchy foodstuffs are taken in abundance, with or without fats, the tendency is to create corpulency. But this is rather a disadvantage than a benefit, ami in time is bound to react, because the normal csinabi!itu-s for manipulating fat. sugar, and &gt;tarch are ov itavd and the artificial structure falls to the ground like a bouse of cards. Along comes influenza, typhoid fever, i-ry.-ipelas, a succession of boils, or a carbuncle, or oven a -light (!)-ailment like tonsilitis; ami it is like throwing a monkey wrench into the machinery.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">No special dietary on a starvation basis is I recommended for people’suffering from many such ailments; but one of plenty of food contain-</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">ing the proper amount of the minerals in their natural shape, as in whole wheat, vegetables not having the salts boiled out, good meats, fruits, and other foods permitted by the cook to retain their life-sustaining elements. In cases where the deficiency is marked, almost immediate relief is often obtained by taking calcium sulphide, iodide or carbonate in such amounts and proportions as a physician would prescribe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It is considered by many progressive people that the next great advance in the healing art may be in the direction of prevention and cure of disease and preservation of health by proper food. That this will be understood in the near future there can be little doubt. If the money now spent in studying and investigating the •effects of poisons were put into reliable research into the effects of food, progress might be made more rapidly—but the doctor is too often wedded to serums. In the Golden Age the prolongation of life and the general upbuilding of health will be due in large measure to the better knowledge of the feeding of foods and minerals that make for the proper balance of the elements composing a normal body.</span></p>

<p><span class="font15" style="font-variant:small-caps;">M</span><span class="font10" style="font-variant:small-caps;">rs. Virginia Neal, a Negro woman now living one-half mile out of Ashdown, Arkansas, is the mother of thirty children, of whom eleven are living. Married at seventeen years of age, she has given birth three times to quadruplets, twice to triplets, three times to twins and six times to individuals. The last child, who is how six years old, was born when she was thirty-nine years of age.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The mother of these children worked out, and still works out, to feed and clothe the kiddies that have come to her. Many women who have given birth to quadruplets or triplets have received presents from all parts of the country, and it can hardly be said that they did not need gifts-. But this poor woman was not of the right color and has had to fight her battle unaided, so our correspondent tells us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In Bible times they used to have some good-sized families; but the children were not all borne by one mother. Abijah had twenty-two sons, and sixteen daughters, but he had fourteen ■wives. Abdon had forty sons; number of wives not stated. Ihsan had thirty sons and thirty daughters; number of wives not stated. Gideon had seventy sons and &quot;many wives’'. Ahab had seventy sons: number of wives not stated. Rehoboam had twenty-eight sons and sixty daughters, but they were divided among seventy-eight mothers. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;____</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Mrs. Neal, so far as we know, has a world’s record for motherhood. If any of The Golden Age readers have heard of anything surpassing it. please send particulars, as it is a subject of human interest. Please do not think that we are advocating such lamilies. In these days of the high cost of living most parents find they have about all they can take care of if they have a very small brood. We expect to see families decrease in size until, toward the end of the Golden Age, births will cease altogether, as is implied in the hundred years trial of all, mentioned in Isaiah 65:20.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Color and the Elements</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">T</span><span class="font10">HE ancients recognized four basic elements in the cosmogony of things—air, earth, fire, and water. They also connected these with • basic elements of character, though it does not appear whether they carried the analogy further.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Air corresponds, without any violence done to the fitness of things, to yellow in color, light in life, wisdom in character, buoyancy in conduct, cheerfulness in disposition, and hope among the graces. It is the yellowness in the atmosphere that draws the crocuses from the ground in Spring; it is the same yellow air in Summer that ripens the grains and fruits, for the bluish gray days have no ripening power. The yellow, bright days are the cheerful ones, everytime.</span></p><img src="g_E_19201013_files/g_E_19201013-7.png" alt="" style="width:238pt;height:37pt;">
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">A tn &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WATER &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FIRE EARTH</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">. Water finds analogy in blue as to color, shadow in life, justice in character, stability or dignity in conduct, reticence in disposition, and faith among the graces. As justice is the great stabilizer, so is water the great stabilizing medium among human needs. It modifies a fever, tends to equalize the temperature of the globe, and its continued presence in the form of rain or dew has actually contributed to all the periods of brilliant human achievement and development which the world has known. It is used as a Scriptural figure of justice and Messing for the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Eire correlates with red in color, action in life, love in character, vivacity in conduct, affability in disposition, and charity among the graces. Fire is the moving element in the physical world as love is the motive principle in human experience—love, even though perverted into self-love, or else love for an improper object.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Earth parallels Mack in color, inertness in life, force in character, static in conduct, and taciturnity in disposition. The earth is the means by which, perhaps it were more accurate to say the agency without which the other elements could not operate in connection with</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark50"><span class="font10">human affairs. So power is not, strictly ••r - ■ :■ i ng, a characteristic, but is rather a cap?.--</span></a></p>

<p><span class="font10">The traveler that wishes* to leave nothing unseen in the world, should not overlook the quaint little taxless community about two hundred miles northwest of Stockholm. Once the peasants paid taxes like other common people; but now they have become uncommon people, bcause of the canniness of the generation just finishing its work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Orsa was a peasant village of no account in the midst of Swedish forests. The woods were . worthless to the people, until strangers came and offered small sums for the lumber. Then the woodland near the village was divided up ' among the people. Some sold theirs for a song, and squandered the money or put it into a nest egg; but some held their holdings and have them today. Meanwhile the dealers bid higher and <sub>t </sub>higher for the forests until the amounts ran into the millions. The back forests had never been divided up, being too far from the civilization of&quot; the village to be of use to any one; and great pressure was brought for their division; but the miles of far-off woodland are still common property.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The woods are standing on much of this village land, but much has been sold—so much that the money invested for the common good, makes Orsa the richest community per capita in the world. So much does the common holding earn that all taxes, to both state and village are paid out of this fund. The forest fund builds roads. It spans rivers with bridges. It erect<sup>: </sup>public buildings. It has created the fines' public school buildings in Sweden for a nire* community, and pays the wages of the best teachers to be had.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">THE American people of the Cherokee Nation indeed had the right idea of the Golden Age when, long ago they adopted as their national seal and tribal emblem a seven-pointed star partially surrounded by a wreath of oak leaves: looking forward to the time when the completed Christ (seven-pointed star—Numbers 24:17) would shine forth for their blessing and restitution—(the oak wreath).</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">: ’ As we k”-'w, the ancient Aunerican people, though termed “savages” by the &quot;Christianized” white people, did not believe in the mythical doctrines and creedal misconceptions brought to them across the seas on the Mayflower, by the worthy clergy of the “civilized&quot; world. They did not believe in the white man’s God who, they were told, was three persons in one person and yet only one person! Their &quot;savage” brain could not grasp such an intricate problem! To them three times one fox had always been three foxes; and they were not far enough advanced in mathematics to see any different results. The white clergy could teach and preach, and preach and teach; but all they could get out of the red man was a grunt of amusement. The heart of the “savage” held firmly to the belief that there was one great God, Creator and Father of all, “the Great Spirit”. (“The Lord our God is one Lord”—Deuteronomy 6:4; and &quot;There be gods many .... But to us there is but one God. the Father, of whom are all things.&quot;—1 Corinthians 8:5,6) They believed that He was &quot;all wise”, “all loving” and &quot;all powerful”: that everything lived and grew and had its being in Him. and they indeed commended their spirit into His care and keeping.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The red men did not believe in the gruesome ” tales the clergy told them of a very hot place somewhere called “hell” or “purgatory”, where “the Great Father” would torture and torment them if they did not believe the “Christian” (?)</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">did not believe in paying tribute money to the white clergy to tell such tales, and many a misled missionary suffered the penalty of the red man’s law: “No truth—no eat.” The red man’s “hell” was the Hebrew’s “hell” (•‘But this I confess unto thee, that after the way which' they call heresy, so worship I the God of my fathers, believing all things which are written in &quot;the law . and in the prophets; and have hope toward God, which they themselves also allow, that there shall be a resurrection of the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">dead</span><span class="font10"> both of the just and unjust.”—Acts 24:14, 15) the grave, the “hurying-ground”.

<h3><a name="bookmark55"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark56"></a>“Choose, Life That Ye May Live”</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">“T HAVE set before thee this day life and J- good, death and evil.<sup>-</sup>' &quot;I have set before thee life and death, blessing and cursing: therefore choose life, that both thou and thy seed may live.&quot;—Deuteronomy 30: 15, 19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">We come now to the consideration of other Scripture statements in harmony with the conclusions set forth in the preceding articles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The words here quoted are from Moses to - Israel. To appreciate them we must rememlier . that Israel as a people, and all their covenants, sacrifices, etc., had a typical significance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">God knew that they could not obtain life by ■ keeping the law, no matter how much they would choose to do so, because they, like all others of the fallen race, were weak, depraved through the effects of the &quot;sour grape&quot; of sin which Adam had eaten, and which his children had continued</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">•’ .to <sup>u</sup>at. (Jeremiah 31:29) Thus, as Paul declares, the law given to Israel could not give them life because of the weaknesses or depravity ’ of their fallen nature.—Rom. 8:3; Heb. 10:1-16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Nevertheless, God foresaw a benefit t&lt;» them from even an unsuccessful attempt to live perfectly; namely, that it would develop them, as s well as show them the need of the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">better</span><span class="font10"> sacrifice i (the ransom which our Lord Jesus gave) and a </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">&gt;&nbsp;greater</span><span class="font10"> deliverer than Moses. With all this their trial furnished a pattern or shadow of the individual trial insured to the whole world (which Israel typified) ami secured by the better sacrifices for sin. which were there prefigured, to be accomplished by the great prophet of whom Moses was but a type.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">• Thus seeing that the trial for life .or death presented to Israel was but typical of the individual trial of the whole world, and its issues of life and death (of eternal life or of the second death), may help some to see that the great thousand-year-day of trial, of which our Lord ' Jesus has been appointed the Judge, contains the two issues. lite and death. All will then be called upon to decide, under that most favorabb* opportunity, for righteousness and life or for . sin and death: and a choice must be made. Ami. although there will be rewards and &quot;stripes&quot; according to the deeds of the present life, as well as according to their conduct under that trial</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">• ( Tohn 3:19; Matt. 10: 42; Matt. 11: 20 - 24), the verdict in the end will be in harmony with the choice expressed by the conduct of each during t'.-.a: age of trial.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The second trial, its sentence and its result, are also shown in the words of Moses quoted by Peter. (Acts 3:22,23) This scripture shows tile conditions of eternal life to lie righteous obedience, and teaches that with the close of that, trial some will be judged worthy of that life, ami somu worthy of destruction—the second death.</span></p>

<p><span class="font15">W</span><span class="font10">iilLE the Scriptures teach that the present Gospel age is the church’s judgment day or , period of trial, and that the world's judgment day or time of trial will be the Millennial age, it is nevertheless a reasonable question to ask: To what extent will those who are not of the consecrated church be held responsible in the Millennial age for their misdeeds of cruelty, f dishonesty and immorality, of the present time? | . And to what extent will those of the same class then be rewarded for present efforts to live , moral and benevolent lives ?</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">'nil punishments for the deeds of the present' • fe. it is evident that just such a time of awakeu-<sub>r</sub> ing as God has promised during the Millennium is necessary—for re warding, and punishing, r.nd giving to all mankind the opportunity for menial life secured i»y Christ’s ransom-sacrifice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">While. &gt;t rietlv speaking, the world i&lt; not now &lt;•;; trial (that is. the present is not the time tor :-:s full and complete trial) yet men are not now, « nor have they ever been, entirely without light ’ and ability, for the use of which they are accountable. In the darkest days of the world’s . history, and in the deepest degradation of savage life, there has always been at least a measure of the light of conscience pointing more or less directly to righteousness and virtue. That the deeds of the present life have much to do with the future, Paul taught very clearly when, before Felix he reasoned of justice and self-government, in view of the judgment to come, so that Felix trembled.—Acts 24: 25.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">At the first advent of our Lord, an increased measure of light came to men, and to that extent increased their responsibility. As He said: ‘‘This is the condemnation, that light &quot;is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.” (John 3:.19) For those evil deeds committed against the light possessed, whether of conscience or of revelation, men will have to give an account, and will receive, in their day of judgment, a just recompense of reward. And, likewise, to the extent of their effort to live righteously, they will receive their reward in the day of trial.— Matthew 10:42.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">If men would consider what even reason discerns, that a time of reckoning, of judgment, is coming, that God will not forever permit evil to triumph, and that in some way He will punish evil-doers, it would undoubtedly save them many sorrows and chastisements in the age to come. Said the prophet: “Woe unto them that seek deep to hide their counsel from the Lord, and their works are in the dark, and they say. Who seeth us! and who knoweth us ?” (Isaiah 29: 15) Behold. &quot;The eyes of the Lord are in every place, beholding the evil and the good” (Proverbs 15:3): and &quot;God shall bring every work into judgment, with every secret thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil.” (Ecclesiastes 12:14) He &quot;will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts.”—1 Cor. 4:5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The age of Christ’s reign will be a time of just judirment: and though it will be an age of golden opportunities to all. it will be a time of s«&gt;vt re discipline, trial and punishment to many. That rite judgment will be fair and impartial, and with due consideration for the circumstances and the opportunities of each individual, is assured by the character of the Judge, the Christ (John 5:22; 1 Corinthians 6:2), by His perfect knowledge, by His unwavering</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">justice and goodness, by His divine power and by His great love as shown in His- sacrifice to redeem men from death, that they might enjoy the privilege of this favorable, individual trial.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The varied circumstances and opportunities of men, in this and past ages, indicate that a just judgment will recognize differences in the degree of individual responsibility, which will also necessitate differences in the Lord’s future ■dealings with them. Aud this reasonable deduction we find clearly confirmed by the Scriptures. The Judge has been, and still is, taking minute cognizance of men’s actions and words (Proverbs 5:21), although theyhave been entirely unaware of it; and He declares that “every idle [“pernicious,” injurious or malicious] word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment” (Matthew 12:36); and that even a cup of cold water, given to one of His little ones, because he is Christ’s, shall in nowise lose its reward. (Matthew 10:42) The context shows that the &quot;pernicious” words to which Jesus referred were words of willful and malicious opposition spoken against manifest light. (Matthew 12:24, 31, 32) He also affirmed that it would be more tolerable for Tyre, Sidon and Sodom in the day of judgment than, for Chorazin, Bethsaida and Capernaum, which had misimproved greater advantages of light and opportunity.—Matthew 11:20- 24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In the very nature of things, we can see that the punishments of that age will be in proportion to past guilt. Every sin indulged, and every propensity cultivated, hardens the heart and makes the way back to purity and virtue more difficult. Consequently, sins willfully indulged now, will require punishment and discipline in the age to come; and the more deeply the soul is dyed in willing sin, the more severe will be the measures required to correct it. As a wise parent would punish a wayward child, so Christ will punish , the wicked to their good.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">His punishments will always be administered in justice, tempered with mercy, and relieved by His approval and reward to those who are rightly exercised thereby. And it will only be when punishments, instructions and encouragements fail; in short, when love and mercy have done all that wisdom can approve (which is all that could be asked), that any will meet the final punishment his case demands—the second death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">None of the world will meet that penalty until they have first had all the blessed opportunities of the age to come. And while this is true of the world, the same principle applies now to the consecrated children of God in this our judgment (trial) day. We now receive God’s favors (through faith), while the world will receive them in the next age, viz., instruction, assistance, encouragement, discipline and punishment. “For what son is he whom the Father chasteneth not? But if ye be without chastisement, whereof all are partakers, then are ye bastards and not sous.” Therefore, when we receive grievous chastisement, w-e should accept it as from a loving Father for our correction, not forgetting “the exhortation which speaketh unto us as unto children. My son, despise not thou the chastening of the Lord, nor faint when thou are rebuked of him; for whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth.”—Hebrews 12:4-13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">How just and equal are God’s ways! Read carefully the rules of the coming age—Jeremiah 31: 29 - 34 and Ezekiel 18: 20 - 32. They prove to us, beyond • the possibility of a doubt, the sincerity and reality of all His professions of love to men: “As I live, saith the Lord God, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked; but that the wicked turn from his way and live: Turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways; for why will ye die ?”—Ezekiel 33:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">All who in this life repent of sin, and, as the term repentance implies, begin and continue the work of reformation to the best of their ability, will form character which will be a benefit to them in the age to come; when awakened in the resurrection age, they will be to that extent advanced towards perfection, and their progress will be more rapid and easy; while with others it will be more slow, tedious and difficult. This is implied in the words of onr Lord (John 5:28, 29. —Diaglott): “The hour is coming in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice, and shall come forth: they that have done good unto the resurrection of life [those whose trial is past, and who were judged worthy of life, will be raised perfect—the faithful of past ages to perfect human life, the overeomers of the gospel age to perfect life as divine beings],- and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of judgment.” These are awakened to judgment—to receive a course of discipline and correction—as the necessary means for their</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">r '</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">perfecting, or, otherwise, their condemnation to the second death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The man who, in this life, by fraud and injus- tice, accumulated and hoarded great wealth, which was scattered to the winds when he was laid in the dust, will doubtless awake to lament his loss and to bewail his poverty and his utter inability under the new order of things to repeat unlawful measures to accumulate a fortune. With many it will be a severe chastisement and a bitter experience to overcome the propensities to avarice, selfishness, pride, ambition and idleness, fostered and pampered for years- in the present life. Occasionally we see an illustration of this form of punishment now, when a man of • great wealth suddenly loses it, and the haughty spirit of himself and family must fall.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">We are told (Daniel 12:2) that some shall awake to shame and age-lasting contempt. And who can doubt that, when every secret thing is brought into judgment (Ecclesiastes 12:14), and the dark side of many a character that now stands measurably approved among men is then made known, many a face will blush and hide itself in confusion? When the man who steals is required to refund the stolen property to its rightful owner, with the addition of twenty percent interest, and the man who deceives, i falsely accuses or otherwise wrongs his neighbor, is required to acknowledge his crimes and so far as possible to repair damages, on peril of an eternal loss of life, will not this be retributive justice? Note the clear statement of this in God’s typical dealings with Israel, whom He made to represent the world.—1 Corinthians 10: 11; Leviticus 6:1-7. See also “Tabernacle Shadows&quot;, page 99.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">As we are thus permitted to look into the perfect plan of God, how forcibly we are reminded of His word through the prophet Isajah. “Judgment also will I lay to the line, ami right-■ eousness to the plummet&quot;. (Isaiah 28: 17) We also see the wholesome influence of such discipline. Parents, in disciplining their children, . realize the imperative necessity of making their punishments proportionate to the character of . the offencesso in God’s government: great punishments following great offences are not greater than is necessary to establish justice rud to effect great moral reforms.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Seeing that the Lord will thus equitably c. ’just human affairs in His own due time, we can afford to endure hardness for the present, and resist evil with good, even at the cost of present disadvantages. Therefore, “Recompense to no man evil for evil”. “Let this mind be tn you, which was also in Christ Jesus our Lord.” —Romans 12:17 -19; Philippians 2: 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The present order of things will not always continue: a time of reckoning is coming. The just Judge of all the earth says, “Vengeance is mine, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">I</span><span class="font10"> will repay&quot;; and the Apostle Peter adds, &quot;The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptation and to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished”. (2 Peter 2:9) And, as we have seen, those punishments will be adapted to the nature of the offences, and the benevolent object in view—man’s permanent establishment in righteousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Other Scriptures corroborative of this view of future rewards and punishments are as follows: 2 Samuel 3:39; Matthew 16:27; 1 Peter 3:12; Psalms 19:11; 91:8; Proverbs 11:18: Isaiah 40: 10; 49:4; Matthew 5:12; 10:41, 42; Luke 6:35: Revelation 22:12; Rom. 14:11, 12.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark58"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark59"></a>Forgivable and Unpardonable Sins</span></h4>
<p><span class="font15">I</span><span class="font10">N THE preceding pages we briefly show the extreme penalty, for willful sin. Adam's penalty, which involved his entire race, was of this sort; and only as the result of Christ’s death as our ransom from that penalty of that willful sin, is any forgiveness of it or subsequent sins possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Forgivable sins are those which result from weaknesses incurred through that one Adamic sin which Christ settles once fur all. They are such as are not willful, but’ are committed through ignorance or weaknesses of the flesh, God stands pledged to forgive all such sins upon our repentance, in the name and merit of Christ's sacrifice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Unpardonable sins, sins which cannot be forgiven. are such as are willfully done. As the penalty of the first willful sin was death— extinction of being—so death is the penalty of every willful sin against full knowledge and ability to choose and to do the riirht. This is called the second death, in distinction from the first or Adamic penalty, from which Christ'-s ransom sacrifice will release all mankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The &quot;sin unto [second] death”, for the for-, giveness of which the Apostle declares it is useless to pray (1 John 5:16), is not only a</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">willful sin but a sin against clear knowledge; a sin for which no adequate excuse can be found. Because it is a sin against clear knowledge, or enlightenment in holiness, it is called the “sin against the holy spirit'’ (Matthew 12:31, 32), for which there is no forgiveness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">But there are other partly willful sins, which are, therefore, partially unpardonable. In such the temptations within and without (all of which are directly or indirectly results of the fall) have a share—the will consenting under the pressure of the temptation or because of the weakness. The Lord alone knows how to properly estimate our responsibilities and guilt in such cases. But to the true child of God there is but one proper course to take—repentance and an appeal - for mercy in the name and merit of Christ, the great sacrifice for sin. The Lord will forgive such a penitent, in the sense of restoring him to divine favor: but he will lie made to suffer &quot;stripes&quot; (Luke 12:47, 48) for the sin. in proportion as God sees it to have been willfully committed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Not infrequently a conscientious person realizes that he has committed sin, and that it had some willfulness in it. He properly feels condemned. guilty before God; realizing his own guilt, and forgetting the fountain for sin and uncleanness, opened by God for our weak, fallen rave, he falls into a state of sadness, believing that he has committed the sin unto death. Such wander in deserts drear, until they find the cleansing fountain. Let such remember, however, that the very facts of their sorrow for sin and their desire to return to divine favor are proofs that they have not committed the sin unto death; for the Apostle declares that those who commit sin of this sort cannot be renewed unto repentance. (Hebrews 6:6) Penitents, then, may always feel confident that their sins were in part at least results of the fall, and hence not unto death, but requiring forgiveness and st ri pes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Such is the wonderful provision of God. through Christ, for the acceptance of every soul which, forsaking sin ami the love of it. seeks righteousness and life through Him who is the Way. as well as the Truth ami the Life. Thus all. whether naturally stronger or weaker, have an equal opportunity to gain everlasting life as well as to gain the great prize of joint-heirshin with Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Let Honesty and Truth Prevail &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;»</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Having demonstrated that neither the Bible ... nor reason offers the slightest support to the „ t doctrine that eternal torment is the penalty for sin, we note the fact that the various church creeds, confessions, hymn-books, and theological treatises are its only supports; and that under the increasing light of our day, and the conse- . quent emancipation of reason, belief in this horrible, fiendish doctrine of the dark ages is fast dying out. But alas! this is not because <sup>; </sup>Christian people generally are zealous for the ' truth of God’s Word and for His character, and willing to destroy their grim creed-idols. Ah no! they still lx&gt;w before their creed’s admitted falsities; they still pledge themselves to its . defense, and spend time and money for its support, though at heart ashamed of it. and privately denying it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The general influence of all this is to cause the honest-hearted of the world to despise Christianity and the Bible and to make hypocrites and semi-infidels of nominal Christians. Because the nominal church clings to this old bla. phemy, and falsely presents its own error as the teaching of the Bible, the Word of God, though still nominally reverenced, is being practically repudiated. Thus the Bible, the great anchor of truth and liberty, is being cut loose from, by the very ones who. if not deceived regarding its teachings, would be held and blessed by it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The general effect, not far distant, will be, first open infidelity, then anarchy. For very much of this, lukewarm Christians. <sup>!</sup>'oth in pulpits and pews, who know or ought to knov, better, are responsible. Many such are willing - . to compromise the truth., to slander God’sTIiar-acter, and to stultify and deceive themselves, for the sake of peace, or ease, or present advantage. ' If professed Christians would be honest with themselves and true to God. they would soon learn that &quot;their fear toward God is taught by the precepts of men&quot;. (Isaiah 29:If all would decide to let God be true, though it should prove every man a liar ( Romans 3: 4).and show all human creeds to be imperfect and misleading, there would be a groat creed-smashing work done very shortly. Then the Bible would !»•' studied and appreciated as never before; and its testimony that the wag's of sin is death, (extinction), would be re?'gr.ized as a “just recompense of reward”.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">THIS JOURNAL AND ITS SACRED MISSION</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">T</span><span class="font6">HIS journal is one .of prime m-his &lt;&gt;r iu&gt;t i urnenis in the system of Bible instruction, or “‘Seminary Kxtension”, now beinff presented in al) parts at the rhihzed world bj the Watch Tmn Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, chartered A. D. 1NN4, “For the Promotion of Chrisimn Kno\v ioiije”. Ir not (/hi. mtvps as .1 class room where Bible students may meet in the study of the divine Word but also as a channel of cotnmnun atmn ihroii' h which they nuiy be reached with announcements of the Society’s conventions and of the coining of its traveling representatives, staled “Pilgrims”, and refreshed with reports of its conventions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Our “Berean Lessons’’ are topical rehearsals or reviews of our Society’s published Studies most entertainingly arranged, and very helpful to all who would merit the onl.v hororar.v degree which the Society accords, viz., </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">V'-rbi J)ei Minister</span><span class="font6"> (V. I&gt;. M.), which translated into English is </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Minister at Cod's Word.</span><span class="font6"> &lt;nir Treatment of the International Sunday School Lessons is specially for the older Bible students and teachers. B,v .some this feature* is considered indispensable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This journal stands firmly for the defense of the only true foundation of the Christian's hope now being so generally repudiated — redemption through the precious blood of •'the man Christ Jesus, who gave himself a </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">ransom</span><span class="font6"> [a corresponding price, a substitute] for all’’. (1 Peter 1:19; 1 Timo th v 2:6) Building up on this sure foundation the gold, silver and precious stones (1 Corinthians 3:1115; 2 Peter 1 : 5-11) of the Word of Cod. its further mission is to “make all see what is the fellowship of the mystery which. . .has been hid in Cod, ... to the intent that now might bo made known by the church the manifold wisdom of God”—“which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men as it is now revealed”.— Ephesians 3:5-9,10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It stands free from all parties, sects and creed'' of men. while it seeks more and more to bring its every utterance into fullest subjection to the will of God in Christ, as expressed in the holy Scriptures. It is thus free to declare boldly whatsoever the Lord hath spoken—according to the divine wisdom granted unto us to understand his utterances. Its attitude is not dogmatic, but confident; for we know whereof we uflirni, treading with implicit faith upon the sure promises of God. It is held as a trust, to be used only in hi« service: lienee our decisions relative to what mav and what may not appear in its columns must be according to our judgment of his good pleasure, Ilie teaching ot his Word, for the upbuilding of his people in grace and knowledge. And we not only invite but urge our readers to prove all its utterances by the infallible Word to which reference is constantly made to facilitate such testing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">TO US THE SCRIPTURES CLEARLY TEACH</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">That the church is “the temple of the living God”, peculiarly “his workmanship” ; that its construction has been in progress throughout the gospel age—ever since Christ became the world’s Redeemer and the Chief Corner Stone of his temple, through which, when finished, God's blessing shall come “to all people”, and they find access to him.—1 Corinthians 3:16, 17; Ephesians 2:20-22; Genesis 2S : 14 ; Galatians 3 : 29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">That meantime the chiseling, shaping, and polishing of consecrated believers in Christ’s atonement for sin, progresses ; and when the last of these “living stones”, “elect and precious,” shall have been made ready, the great Master Workman will bring all together in the first resurrection : and the temple shall be filled with his glory, and be the meeting place between God and men throughout the Millennium.—Revelation 15:5 s.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">That the basis of hope, for the church and the world, lies in the fact that “Jesus Christ, by the grace of God, tasted death for </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">every </span><span class="font6">man,” “a ransom for all,’’ and will be “the true light which hghteth </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">every man that cometh into the world”,</span><span class="font6"> “in due time”.— Hebrews 2:9; John 1:9; 1 Timothy 2 : 5, G.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">That the hope of the church is that she may be like her Lord, “see him as lie is,” be “partakers of the divine nature’,’ and share his glory as his joint-heir.—1 John 3:2; John 17:24; Romans S : 17 ; 2 Peter 1:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">That the present mission of the church Js the perfecting of the saints for the future work of service; to develop in herself every grace; 1o be God’s witness to the world; and to prepare to be kings and priests in the next age.—Ephesians 4:12; Matthew' 21: 14 ; Revelation 1:6: 20.6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">That the hope for the woHd hes in Gm? blessings of knowledge and opportunity to be brought to </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font6"> by Christ’s Millennial kingdom, the restitution of all tli.it v\ lost in Adam, to all Ilie willing and obedient, at the hands of their Redeemer and his glorified church, when all the mindly wicked will be </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">destroyed.</span><span class="font6"> — Acts 3:19-23; Isaiah 35.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark1"></a>THE PROSECUTION ENDED</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">For two years past the following brethren have been either in prison or under bond: J. F. Rutherford, IV. E. Van Amburgh, R. J. Martin, F. H. Robison, G. H. Fisher, C. J. Woodworth, A. H. Mac-mtllan and G. DeCecca. The indictment was returned May 6, 1918. On May 5, 1920, on motion </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">ot</span><span class="font6"> the United States District Attorney tor Brooklyn, New York, a </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">nolle prosei/ui ot</span><span class="font6"> all the indictments against these brethren was entered and they were discharged.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Their trial on the indictment began the first week in June, 1918, and lasted for three weeks ; and on the 21st day of June of that year. Judge Harland B. Howe sentenced the seven first named to twenty years on four separate counts, or an aggregate of eighty years, in the United States I’enitentiary at Atlanta, Georgia. Brother De Cecca was sentenced for ten years on each of the counts. They applied for bail, pending appeal, which was denied. They were held in jail for nine months without bail.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Friends circulated a petition for their release, and 700,000 people signed that petition inside of two weeks, and a great many letters were written to the Department of Justice. They were released the latter part of March, 1919, on bail, and in May of the same year the Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the judgment of the District Court, announcing that a fair trial was not given to them. They were still held under the iginal Indictment to appear in the District Court Five times thereafter they were required to appear until the Sth of May, 1920, when the cases were dismissed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During the course of this trial Brother W. F. Hudglngu was committed to jail for contempt of court for being unable to answer a question in the manner that the trial Judge thought he should answer. At the same time the trial Judge ordered his Indictment for perjury for saying that he could not answer a certain question. After six months in jail the Supreme Court of the United States reversed the judgment of the trial court, discharging Brother Hudgings, but he was still held under the indictment for perjury. His case was also dismissed May 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During the past few months we are advised that there has been a strenuous effort on the part of our enemies to have the case retried; while a large number of people throughout the United States, many of whom make no pretense of being interested in the Bible with us, asked that the case be dismissed. To all of our friends who have thus manifested an interest in our behj.lf we express the deepest gratitude and appreciation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The trial was unfair and illegal. Imprisonment for nine months was illegal, as the Appellate Court decided. Dismissal of tin case on motion of District Attorney is an exoneration of the brethren.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Since the prosecution is ended, we hope to proceed with the Lord’s work with renewed zeal and energy, looking always for opportunities to do good, even to those who are our persecutors.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>DEATH OF BROTHER W. HOPE HAY</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">Word has reached us of the demise of former Pilgrim Brother W. Hope Hay, well known to many of the older friends in the truth as an earnest and zealous worker on the mystic walls of Zion. Brother Hay came to a knowledge of Bible truth as we see it in 1894 while residing in Manitoba, Canada, and very, quickly became active in witnessing to others within his reach.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In 1896 his affairs were so shaped that he found it possible to give all of his time to the service of the truth, and accordingly entered the Pilgrim work, in which he continued until 1906, at which time he became very ill with nervous and mental disorders and was placed in a hospital in Hamilton, Ontario, where he continued to be until his death April 26. Brother Hay was born and reared in England; his earlier religious training was Episcopal.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>CAUTION RE. TELEGRAPHIC MESSAGES</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">Class secretaries or other friends who find it necessary to send us night letter telegrams often add their addresses after the signature, even though the fifty words allowed by the minimum are not used up. An address so written costs, often, as much extra as the message itself cost. If It is your usual address, it is not necessary to add It to message; but If you must send address, it is usually possible to be Included before signature at no extra cost.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font11"><a name="bookmark9"></a>VIEWS FROM THE WATCH TOWER</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">GUILDS, SOCIETIES, REFORMERS</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">R</span><span class="font9">OMAN Catholic newspaper writers have formed a guild, according to a report in the New York </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">American:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Five hundred Catholic writers connected with the newspaper and periodical press in New York and vicinity have been invited to a meeting in the Hotel Biltmore this evening to form a Catholic Writers’ Guild of New York.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“It is understood that the meeting is called at the instance of Archbishop Hayes, who has consented to accept the honorary presidency of the organization, and that the guild (s intended to be an important unit in the reconstruction work of the Catholic Church in this country.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Another society is organized to fight the Catholics, as we are informed by an item in the New York </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Times: </span><span class="font7">“Speaking before the Sons and Daughters of Washington, a recently formed ‘militant, fighting organization for Protestantism.' at the Pennsylvania Hotel yesterday afternoon, J. W. Forrest, a lawyer of Albany and a descendant of Colonel Thomas Forest of the Revolutionary War, made a ■bitter arraignment of the Catholic Church and of those of that faith. The Catholic Church is a wheel, the hub of which is the Pope, the rim is political control and the spokes are the Knights of Columbus and the various other Catholic societies and organizations, he said. More than 300 persons attended the meeting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“He declared that 75 percent of the people in the government service were Catholics, from Joseph Tumulty, Secretary to President Wilson, down to the man who delivers the mail, although there are in the United States, according to the Catholic Directory, only 17,000,000 Catholics, while there are 80,000.000 Protestants. In New York State, he said, 00 percent of the officials and employes are Catholics, headed by Governor Alfred E. Smith, while the remaining 10 percent are distributed among the other religious beliefs.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The New York Civic League has been trying to legislate Christianity onto an unappreciative public. Tt finds the task very difficult and discouraging, according to a recent number of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Reform Bulletin:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“These are anxious times here at Albany and also in many other legislatures. Everything seems to be going against us. Wo fear many bad bills are going to be passed and no import ant good bills will be enacted. Perhaps we have all trusted loo much in human efforts and in human organization and failed to ‘look unto the hills from whence comoth our help. Our help cometh from the Lord.’ We should never forgot that fact. ‘Except the Lord keep the city, the watchman waketh but in vain.’”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">They are particularly downcast over the Dickstein Bill, which is a bill to legalize Jewish business on Sunday. The bill has already passed the House and gives some evidence of passing the Senate. As long as the erroneous idea prevails in these good peoples’ minds that this or any other country is a Christian land, there is nothing but discouragement ahead for them. The Constitution of this country specifically says: “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion'’: and the New Testament, the constitution </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font9">the church, just as specifically says that the followers of Christ shall ‘do their own business’, and not try to meddle in earthly politics and reform the world </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">ahead of </span><span class="font9">God’s time for real and lasting, not reform but, renovation and restitution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">PALESTINE REHABILITATION FUND</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Seeing the general tendency among religious bodies to make drives for financial objectives, the Jews are falling in line and arc having a campaign for funds for the restoration of Palestine. The sum aimed at is modest in contrast with some of the other great sums—it </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">is </span><span class="font9">onlv ten million dollars. Upon this “drive” we </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">can </span><span class="font9">surely ask God’s blessing. The Appleton (Wis.) </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">PostCrescent</span><span class="font9"> has this to say regarding the local quota:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Appleton is to do its full share in helping to raise the $10,000,000 fund for the restoration of Palestine. Monday, the executive committee of the Appleton District of the American Zionist movement, headed by I. Kiss, chairman, will meet to formulate plans for raising $3,000, which is the allotment for this city.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Mr. Kiss states that many Wisconsin cities are already at work raising funds, and mentions especially Green Bay, where the total sum of $10,000 is to be collected. The Jewish people themselves have pledged $5,000, and the bankers of the lower valley city have set out to raise the balance, among the non-Jewish people.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“It is pointed out by experts that the climate and soil of Palestine greatly resemble that of California. Due to Turkish misrule the country has been devastated, but with proper drainage and reforestation it can once more be made ‘a land of milk and honey'. The money now being collected is to be used to make the land fertile and to eradicate malaria and other diseases which are now prevalent.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Another similar item we take from the Washington </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Times:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Inaugurating the campaign for Washington’s quota of $80,000 of the. proposed $10,000,000 Palestine resto'-.ilion fund, leading Hebrews of the city at a meeting held hi the Eighth Street Temple last evening raised over $42,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Work of securing subscriptions to complete the quota will bo continued daily and it is expected that the sum desired will be secured before the scheduled campaign of three weeks has been expended.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“One subscription amounting to $21,000 it is announced has been made by a man prominent in Washington official life, while Mr. Berliner gave $10,000.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The moving picture is about to be used for Zionistic purposes, according to a clipping from the Oklahoma </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">News:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Two directors of the Cosmo Film corporation, John Ezra and Joseph J. Calder, have sailed for Palestine and Egypt, where important scenes in some new movies will be located.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“They are working on an eight-reel feature, visualizing the age-old dream, of Israel, the redemption of Palestine from servitude and her creation as an independent state and power among nations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“American players of the Jewish race will join directors in New York to make up the cast of the play, which will probably be called ‘Judarael’, and the mass scenes will be taken in the Holy Land, composed of types chosen from the natives.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Elaine Sonia, who played star parts in foreign films before the war, will join the company in Erance.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">PALESTINE BOUNDARY LINE</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Another test of faith is before the Zionists; for the Versailles treaty has disclosed as the latest example of diplomatic ineptitude an arrangement for an arbitrary line to separate the French sphere of influence in Syria from the British in Palestine. This boundary, stipulated by representatives of the powers involved, is so drawn as to deprive Palestine of the control of the head waters of the Jordan and Litani Rivers. This involves the jeopardizing of Palestine’s economic future; for these waters are a potential source of engineering power.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">But these difficulties cannot interfere with the Lord’s purposes, that we may be sure. If necessary the Sykes-Picot Line, with all of its attendant arrangements, may, like the hosts of Sennacherib, be smitten on the very eve of victory. There it transpired that</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">. . . “the might of the Gentile, unsmote by the sword, Huth melted like snow in the glance of the Lord.” </span><span class="font9">A bit of news in the New York </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">American</span><span class="font9"> shows that some Jews, otherwise unable to get to the Holy Land, have marched thither on foot:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“After a 1500-mile journey on foot a group of Jewish mountaineers have just reached Jerusalem from Persia, according to n report received yesterday by the Zionist Organization of America. A group of 120 Jews from Casablanca, intent upon making the Holy City their future home, are marching in that direction.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">PESTILENCE AND PABULUM</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Some of the highly favored sections of this country are being threatened with serious loss, according to an Associated Press dispatch of recent date:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Millions of army worms, reported traveling toward the green fields of Imperial Valley from the desert west of Dixie Land, . . . were met and fought by ranchers who were prepared today to place poison on the bridges across the irrigation ditches and prevent the entry of the worms.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Where the worms came from is not known. The desert is reported covered witli them over an area of several square miles. They are moving in what those who have seen them declare seems a never ending migration to the growing crops of the valley.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Where the worms have crossed paved highways automobiles skid as on a greasy pavement.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">There is nothing new in the following item. It has been known as a matter of course that poorly nourished people, either old or young, are less happy, if not directly troublesome. But the state of Pennsylvania is trying experiments in this connection which are interesting, as reported by the Chicago </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Daily News:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“ ‘Bad children,' according to the theory of the Henry Phipps Institute in Philadelphia, ‘may be only underfed children or improperly fed children. Maybe young Adam isn’t stupid and mischievous at all. Perhaps he is only hungry.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“It looks as though the theory were proving true on trial. The state of Pennsylvania is paying the cost of upholstering a group of small children and the Henry Phipps Institute is contributing the know-how. It is possible that the plan may be enlarged to take in the entire state. It has been suggested that the worst little boy in Philadelphia can be-converted into one of the best little boys by a proper course of feeding.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“It would be a shame to give the names of youngsters who have been fattened into good behavior at Phipps. Those interested can go direct to the record. But the books show that many fifty pounders have been made over into fifty-three and four pounders in a little more than a week. At fifty pounds the child was a peril to the community and a net loss in school. Four pounds added made it quiet and happy and well behaved. It became a good scholar instead of a bad one.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">WAGES AND LIVING COSTS</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">But economic conditions do not encourage the thought that all the world will be made happy at once by proper feeding. The Chicago </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Daily News</span><span class="font9"> has another bit of information on the relation of wages to living costs:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Chicago men who have been working under the direction of E. O. Griffenhagen, of Arthur Y’oung &amp;&nbsp;Co., in the reclassi lication of salaries of government employes in the District of Columbia have concluded their work and their report i&lt; now in the hands of the congressional joint committee on reclassification.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Their work, which has consumed a year's time, is similar to that undertaken for Canada--namely, to investigate the rates of compensation paid to civilian employes of the government and the various executive departments other than the navy yard and postal service.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“They discovered that while the payroll had grown from some 14,000 in 1893 to more than 100,000 in 1919, the averagewage increase was only 40 percent while the cost of living had increased 159 percent during the same period.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Added to this burden are the rapidly increasing taxon and the seeming need for more. The Greensboro (N. ) </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Daily News</span><span class="font9"> devotes some space to the condition as summed up by Senator Freylinghausen:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Senator Freylinghausen declares that whereas the estimates of government expenditures from June 30, next, to June 30, 1921, are a little over *9.000,000.000, the highest estimate of government income for the same period is a trifle over $6,000,000,000. In other words, the United States is proposing to spend 50 percent more than it can possibly receive,</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“It is enough to appall the least observant to reflect that the government is proposing to spend $9.000,000,000, not in time of war, but in the second year of peace. Outside loans to the allies, the two years of war witli Germany Increased our national debt less than $15.KJ,000.000. Five years of such peace expenditures as the government is proposing would plunge us more deeply into debt than our greatest war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“The United States is enormously rich, but it cannot stand that drain. It can stand it the less in view of the fact that an enormous percentage of this , dossal sum is pure waste. We have no budget, we have no purchasing department, we have no national system of accounting. We keep no books worthy of the name. For years unavailing efforts hate been made to get a law through Congress requiring the construction of a budget to cover the government’s expenditures through the year, but political considerations have hitherto always succeeded in defeating the measure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“But now the time is at hand when we must act, or go bankrupt. The people, who have the enormous taxes to pay must take a hand. The politicians, left to themselves, will never work out any better system. The people must compel’ them to do something. The orgy of spending will go on unchecked until the moment when the taxpayers rise in. wrath and demand that it be stopped.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The Carnegie Endowment has spent considerable time and money in getting out facts relative to the total cost of the great world war. They place the total outlay at I:’.', billions of dollars. The economic loss from death &lt;&gt;l own is very high, and the value of land property destroyed comes next. The New York </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font9"> has published a statement which reads in part as follows:</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">GENERAL INCREASE IN CRIME</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Dre of the New York papers recently carried a contribution by Mr. Harry V. Dougherty, Chief of the Now York City Detective Agency, regarding the increase &lt;&gt;f crime in Europe. We quote a few of his remarks:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">‘‘Crime is on the increase. There is no doubt of that. There is a wave of lawlessness sweeping over the world which at present we seem powerless to combat. It seems universal. I have been in the principal cities of the western world during the past year and the record is the same.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“At \arious times in a decade some alarmist looms up and tells us that a wave of erime is passing over the city or country, whichever it may be. Sometimes these calamity howlers are right ; again, it is a sort of hysterical cry of the chronic kicker. However, considering the numerous serious crimes that 1 have seen described in the London papers since my visit here [London |. it appears that violent crime is spreading rapidly.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">This country has nothing to boast of in this connection; for the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Pathfinder</span><span class="font9"> gives us the following data on crime in the United States, claiming that this country leads the world in criminal acts:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Crime statistics show that in thirty years crime has increased 50(1 percent in the United States, four times the increase in population. There were as many murders in Omaha last year as m London, with its five million people. Kansas City, with a 300,000 population, had more murders than the English capital. Murders in Kansas average one every other day. Authorities often fail to get the criminals, and many are acquitted even when witnesses of the crime are found.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The Albany </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Journal</span><span class="font9"> thinks that if the world is to be made' better the Almighty will have to do it, although between the lines its comments seem to imply that the present world suits its purpose fairly well. It says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“V&gt;o those who are declaiming about the creation of a ‘new order of the world’ by human agency never stop to think that if there were Io be a new order the Supreme Power which created the old world would bring it into being?”</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font11"><a name="bookmark11"></a>THE COURT: TYPE AND ANTITYPE</span></h3>
<p><span class="font17">Q</span><span class="font9">UESTION: On the typical day of atonement what did the court of the Tabernacle and its furnishings represent, or picture?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In answering this question -ome statements herein may apparently be at variance with ‘‘Tabernacle Shadows’’, but are in fact in full harmony with the main leachings of that book and The Watch Tower. God has promised that the pathway of the righteous shall shine brighter and brighter as we come near to the day of perfection. (Proverbs 4: 18) We are daily drawing nearer to that time. While we fully recognize and appreciate the fact that at the end of the age the Lord was pleased through his wise and faithful servant to grant the church a clearer vision of his plan, yet we find that even that wise and faithful servant progressed and made some changes in what he had to say with reference </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font9">the divine program ; and therefore, instead of our argument being in contradiction of anything he has written, rather the purpose is to amplify and harmonize (and we hope these statements will so do) some of his teachings in the progressing light of the new day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">CONDITION TYPED BY COURT</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">At one time we were taught that justification must precede consecration. Now we find that exactly the icvorse is the order. This clearer light on justification am! consecration ha-, made it necessary to reexamine and harmonize mine of the statements relating to this question as set forth in &quot;Tabernacle Shadows”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">We are not to use a type or shadow at any time, for the purpose of establishing a doctrine; but rather, </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">we </span><span class="font9">should use definitely settled and determined doctrines </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font9">show the harmonious beauty between type and antitype. With this general observation, then, let us proceed </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font9">the question at issue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Reasoning from antitype back to type sometimes </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">gives </span><span class="font9">us a clearer vision of a picture and its meaning. </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">In </span><span class="font9">considering what the court pictures, we cannot </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">overlook </span><span class="font9">the fact that inside the enclosure was the </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Tabernacle </span><span class="font9">proper—the Holy and Most Holy. This at once </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">sug</span><span class="font9">gests the thought that the enclosure forming the </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">court </span><span class="font9">must represent a condition of righteousness. The </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Most </span><span class="font9">Holy pictures heaven itself, the condition of the </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">glorified </span><span class="font9">Christ; and of this we are not left in doubt, </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">for St. </span><span class="font9">Paul states: ‘‘Christ is not entered into the holy </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">places </span><span class="font9">made with hands, which are the figures of the true; </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">but </span><span class="font9">into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">God </span><span class="font9">for us&quot;. (Hebrews 9:24) Neither is there doubt </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">as </span><span class="font9">to what the Holy pictured; viz., the condition experienced by our Lord as a new creature, after his consecration and until Calvary, during which period the divine creature was bmng perfected. The member- of bi- bodv - -new creature- in Christ Jesus art' identified with Jesus in that condition, being I here made to “sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus”, as St. Paul sets forth in Ephesians 2: 6. The Holy is described as a place where sanctification is in progress, “For both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">[Greek, </span><span class="font9">those being sanctified] are all from one: for which cause he [the Lord] is not ashamed to call them brethren”. (Hebrews 2:11) It is a condition in which the followers of Jesus are being transformed, or made meet for the inheritance of the saints in light.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">We define, then, the Holy and Most Holy in order to get a clearer understanding of what the court must represent. Clearly these places represented conditions of divine favor, the Most Holy particularly the condition of divine </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">approval.</span><span class="font9"> The court is so vitally connected with the Holy and the Most Holy that it must picture </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font9">condition of divine favor leading to divine approval. God enters into relationship with no one except the righteous—either in the inherent or in the reckoned sense. If God, then, is in relationship with those in the court on the antitypical day of atonement, it must mean that the court in the type pictured that which is perfect from some viewpoint.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">THE ANTITYPICAL CAMP</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The court, as we remember, was a place wherein the animals for the sin-offering were sacrificed, picturing the sacrifice of Jesus and his body members; and since God accepts nothing short of a perfect sacrifice, the court of necessity must represent a condition of perfection or righteousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Justification means </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">to be made</span><span class="font9"> right. The Scriptural meaning of that term relating to man means “made right with God”. Jesus was always right with God. At the age of thirty he is pictured as standing in the court; and he immediately went forward to the door of the Holy, surrendering himself, and was by the Father accepted as a perfect sacrifice for the purpose of taking away the sin of the world. For three and one-half years his humanity remained on the altar in the court, there being consumed in sacrifice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The Law Covenant made at Mt. Sinai was broken immediately after being made, for the reason that the house of Israel (one of the contracting parties) was unable to keep and perform it. God provided that once each year this covenant relationship should be reestablished'. The sacrifices on the typical atonement day were for that purpose and for the greater purpose of establishing a picture foreshadowing the great sin-offering to be made on behalf of all mankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The nation of Israel, encamped around the Tabernacle, really desired to be in harmony with God--feeling after God. if haply they might find him and come again into relationship with him, as they had been at the institution of the Law Covenant. Therefore the camp would more particularly represent in antitype nominal church-ianitv, having the spirit of the world and yet a form of godliiness, and expecting, in some measure at least, to come into harmony with God. Outside the camp of Israel were the Gentiles, and all who were wholly without God and without hope in the world; and these would picture, we believe, those who have no present desire to come into harmony with God, or at least those who do not expect benefit from Christ’s work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">STEPS TO JUSTIFICATION</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Let us, then, trace the course one would take from, the time of leaving the world until he reaches the condition of holiness, taking the antitypical side of the question (and this will illuminate, we believe, the type andi definitely settle the proposition as to what the type pictured); and for convenience we designate the one-pursuing this course as Honest Heart.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The first essential God requires before he can deal with one is an honest heart. Surrounded by sin and its baneful influence, weary and sick of the world, Honest Heart hungers and thirsts for righteousness. Conscious that he is a sinner and out of harmony with God, he begins to seek the Lord and to feel after him, if haply he might find him. (Acts 17:27) He hears of Jesus and would like to know him. Of such Jesus said: “No man can come to me, except the Father which hath sent me draw him”. (John 6:44) God then draws Honest Heart to Jesus; and how ? He draws him by giving him some knowledge of his great love, of what he has done for him. Honest Heart now begins to draw nigh to God and God draws nigh to him. (James 4: 8) As he journeys on, Honest Heart is heavy and sighs for relief from his burden. Then he hears the sweet and consoling words of Jes_.3, “Come unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest”. (Matthew 11: 28) Then Honest Heart comes to Jesus, desiring to be in harmony with God; and to him Jesus says: “1 am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father but by me”. (John 14: 6) In other words-Jesus states to him, I am the way of entrance; there is no other.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A gate is a way of entrance and in this instance the-gate of the court pictures the Lord Jesus, the gateway that leads to life and back to harmony with Jehovah. Jesus says in substance, if not in terms: 'Honest Heart, I was never out in the camp where you are. I began here (in the court) and I trod the path alone and opened the way for those who will follow and who will ultimately come into full harmony with God, according to his purpose. If any one would be my disciple he must deny himself and take up his cross and follow me.’ (Matthew 16: 24)—thereby meaning, of course, that Honest Heart must make a consecration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">IMPUTATION OF CHRIST’S MERIT</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Learning something of the sacrificial life of the man Christ Jesus, and believing the words he hears Honest Heart in substance responds: T have </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">faith</span><span class="font9"> in Jesus, and I gladly surrender my will to the will of God’. This, then, is his consecration. He here takes the step through the gate. He cannot be accepted on his own merit, but some one must stand sponsor for him. Then Jesus, as the antitypical high priest, receives Honest Heart and-presents him to God. which presentation is pictured by the goat’s being presented at the door of the Tabernacle. In substance Jesus says to Jehovah: 'I impute my merit to this one because of his faith in my sacrificial work, that he may be made holy’. Before that God could not accept Honest Heart at all, but now he may accept him by reason of the imputed merit of Christ Jesus; and redoing, justifies him. He is thus made right with Jehovah, justified and accepted as a part of the sacrifice of Jesus, to be made a part of the sin-offering in behalf of mankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Aaron’s work on the typical atonement day exactly agrees with this, as we read in Leviticus 16:7-9: “And he shall take the two goats, and present them before the Lord at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. And Aaron shall cast lots upon the two goats [thus indicating that the Ix&gt;rd has made no arbitrary choice as to which shall sacrifice, but all are called in one hope of their calling—every one now presented and accepted is justified and made an acceptable sacrifice, but casting the lots indicates a class that will make a voluntary sacrifice]. . . . And Aaron shall bring the goat upon which the Lord’s lot fell, and offer him for a sin offering.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">PROGRESS OF NEW CREATURE</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Since all sacrifices must be holy, no sacrifice being acceptable save that which is holy, right with God; and since the animals for the sacrifice were slain in the court, this is further proof that the court represented perfect humanity—actual or counted so— resulting from the imputed merit of Christ Jesus, actual in the case of Jesus himself, and subsequently counted so to others by virtue of his merit imputed to all of his joint-sacrificers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The Lord's goat was killed and the blood taken into the Holy, thus picturing that, from the time of acceptance as a member of the body of Christ, Honest Heart is from God's viewpoint a new creature, the humanity, first perfected by the imputed merit, now being counted dead. The Holy pictured the new creature, or spirit-begotten, condition. “Xow are we the sons of God.” (1 John 3:2) “Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature.&quot;—2 Corinthians 5: 17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">These are the steps, in the order named, taken by one who seeks the Lord and progresses to sonship, being begotten to that place. And he proceeds from there to divine approval, at which time he is born to sonship. Scripturally, it is definitely settled that consecration precedes or goes before justification, the order being thus: (1) seeking harmony with God; (2) being drawn to Jesus; (3) consecration; (4) imputation of the merit of Christ and the presentation by the high priest to Jehovah, pictured at the door of the Tabernacle: (5) acceptance and justification by Jehovah ; (6) spirit-begetting to sonship; (7) spirit-birth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The consecration of Honest Heart, therefore, in this illustration is pictured at the gate* of the court; presentation and justification, at Ilie door of the Tabernacle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The antitype being thus clearly shown l&gt;y the Scriptures. this definitely settles the question as to the type; for type and antitype must always be harmonious. Hence the conclusion is that on the typical day of atonement the court pictured the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">perfect hiim/ni condition.</span><span class="font9"> made so on the antitypieal day of atonement by the imputation of the merit of Chri&lt;t Jesus. During the antitypieal day of atonement, no one remains in the court except the justified, spirit-begotten ones. Some may seek to get in there and their consecration be not accepted and they would not be justified, as was the case with Simon Magus. If once justified, they must finish their course in one of three ways: by passing into the (1) second death, (2) great company, or (3) little flock. There is no other alternative. This seems to be in exact harmony with statements made in “Tabernacle Shadows”. We know that from time to time some apparently conflicting statements have been made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">On page nineteen we read, “The court represented the condition of justification entered through faith in Christ —the gate”. On page fifty-four: “The bullock was slain in the court, which we have seen typified the condition of faith in and harmony with God, the highest attainment of the flesh, the human nature”. In the explanation appearing immediately beneath the chart of the tabernacle on the chart of the ages in Volume I, Studies in the Scriptures, we read: “The entire ground of the Tabernacle enclosure was called ‘holy’. Outside the court all was unholy. . . . The court enclosure parallels the justified or perfect human plane.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">UNDER-PRIESTS IN THE COURT</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">This question is apropos to another one closely related : Who was in the court on the day of atonement ?— in the type, as well as in the antitype. The word Levite as used herein refers to those of the tribe of Levi aside from those composing the priesthood. The priests were selected from the tribe of Levi and, of course, they were Levites, but we use the term Levites in this connection </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font9">distinguish a certain class from the priesthood. There is no Scriptural proof that the Levites were in the court on the typical day of atonement. The teaching of the Scripture is to the contrary. That Aaron, the high priest, was there is admitted without question. 'Who was there with him ? This question can be definitely answered by reference to the eighth chapter of Leviticus, which deals with the consecration and inauguration of the priesthood. Anointing is the authoritative designation to official position. When one is officially elected and duly installed into office the presumption must follow' that he performs the duties of that office, unless positive proof to the contrary is produced.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In the inauguration of the Levitical priesthood, the Lord instructed Moses thus: “And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying. Take Aaron and his sons with him, and the garments, and the anointing oil. and a bullock for the sin offering, and two rams, and a basket of unleavened bread.....\nd lie [Moses | poured of the anoint</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">ing oil upon Aaron’s bead, and anointed him, to sanctify him. And Moses brought Aaron’s sons, and put coats upon them, and girded them with girdles, and put bonnets upon them; as the Lord commanded Moses ” (Leviticus 8: 1. 2. 12. 13) If God anointed some man to perform the duties of a certain office, the presumption must be indulged that he performed those duties, unless there is positive proof to the contrary; and that being true, it would definitely settle the question as to who was in the court on the typical day of atonement. The mere fact that the Lord was dealing with the sons of Aaron in connection with Aaron in the inauguration of the priesthood would definitely show that they were being used together with Aaron in some official capacity. Aaron, being the head of the priesthood, clothed in the garments of glory and beauty, pictured the high priest. Christ Jesus, including, of course, his body members in antitype. The anointing oil poured on the head of Aaron and running down upon his garments, as set forth in Psalm 133:2, showed that the under-priests receive their anointing through the high priest, their head. Their wearing bonnets pictures that they have for a head another than themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">JUSTIFIED HUMANITY ON THE ALTAR</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In antitype, then, it would show that all who come into Christ Jesus receive their anointing through the Head, Christ Jesus, who himself received the anointing without measure. In other words, looking back to the type we would see that Aaron had the oil poured upon his head and it ran down upon his garments, and through him his sons were anointed also as priests; and being anointed as priests, we must indulge the presumption that they performed some official duties as under-priests with Aaron.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The court represented those in harmony with God, pictured by the priesthood. Aaron and his sons alone wore in the court on the day of atonement. This shows that during the antitypical day of atonement none are in the court except the justified, spirit-begotten ones. Their justified humanity remains on the altar in the court until consumed, the new nature being shown elsewhere, of course, as we shall see presently.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">On the typical day of atonement there was no one in </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">the Holy</span><span class="font9"> except the high priest ; and this shows that on the antitypical day of atonement only the high priest, Christ Jesus, is in the Holy, and the members of his body are shown in him, because each one loses his individual identity (viewed from an official standpoint) as soon as he is immersed into the body of Christ. He is no longer treated as John Smith or William Jones, but he is shown as in Christ: therefore it is the high priest that is in the Holy. The under-priests, still having the new creature treasure in an earthen vessel, remain in the court, assisting the high priest to the extent of presenting their bodies a living sacrifice, as admonished by the Apostle in Homans 12: 1. “I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service.” This is another proof that the court did not picture “tentative” justification, but real justification—“in harmony with God”. There is no such thing taught in the Scriptures as “tentative” justification. It is either justification or it is not. This, then, would definitely show that on the atonement day in the type Aaron and his sons (the two sons who remained faithful) were together in the court, Aaron himself going into the Holy and the Most Holy, the sons remaining in the court to help perform the sacrifice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The humanity of Jesus was in the court condition for three and one-half years. The members of his body are there so long as they are being offered up as a part of his sacrificial body, and none but the justified can be there because the place is holy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">APOSTLES JUSTIFIED AT PENTECOST</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Since consecration takes place at the gate and justification at the door of the Tabernacle, this shows that one may be consecrated for some time before being presented </span><span class="font9">to Jehovah by Jesus and accepted and justified by Jehovah. On this point confusion has arisen in many instances. Wc once thought that one stands in a justified condition </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">before</span><span class="font9"> he consecrates. The very reverse is the order. This is proven by the experiences of the disciples of Jesus. For three and one-half years, or from the time they left all to follow the Master, they were consecrated as fully as anybody could be; but they could not be justified nor accepted until the presentation of the merit of Christ in heaven. Hence their justification took place at Pentecost and not before. This proves that it is the imputation of the merit of Christ that makes justification possible, and no one has been justified since Pentecost otherwise than by the imputed merit of Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Cornelius was another example. Being consecrated, he waited outside the gate until it was opened for him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Since the age of sacrifice began, no one has been accepted, approved, or justified for any purpose other than as a part of the sacrifice for the sin-offering. Of course that is the purpose of accepting one in the first instance. The scapegoat pictured another phase of the matter, which developed later.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Everything in the court must be in harmony; hence every part of the furnishings must picture that which is in harmony with God. The linen curtains, forming the wall for the court, were white, picturing the righteousness of Christ furnished to the members of his body while on earth; “for the fine linen is the righteousnesK of saints”.—Revelation 19 :8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The posts supporting the curtains were of wood, set in copper sockets. The wood pictured the imperfection of our humanity, but standing in copper sockets pictured or foreshadowed the fact that wc have a justified standing, or are counted whole by virtue of our standing in the merit of Christ; therefore “right with God”. The hooks of the posts were of silver. Silver is a symbol of truth or verity. Seemingly, then, this represents the justified one as saying, 'This righteousness which I have is not a camouflage, not a subterfuge; but in truth and in fact, in verity, it is the real thing. I possess the robe of Christ’s righteousness, which makes me acceptable to God.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The altar, being entirely covered with copper, pictured the perfect human being--fully so. It pictured the perfect man Jesus at the age of thirty years. The total lineal measurements of the four sides equal thirty feet, indicating the age in years required of a priest, and the age at which Jesus consecrated. Nothing could be sacrificed upon that altar except a perfect animal, picturing that nothing is accepted for sacrifice except the justified—perfect in fact, or perfect by virtue of the imputed merit of Christ; therefore, this is another proof that the court represents the perfect human condition and not a “tentative” one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The laver was made of polished copper and contained water for the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">cleansing of the priest;</span><span class="font9"> and would properly represent Jesus holding forth and magnifying the Word of God, which serves to cleanse the child of God. The fact that the priests cleansed themselves at the laver after they were consecrated and installed into the priestly office, shows that the laver is used by the fully justified, spirit-begotten ones, for cleansing from all filthiness of the fie.Ji and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God. (Exodus : 8) Being of highly polished copper, it served as a mirror to all who gazed into it, to wit, the priests; for no one else gazed upon it on the day of atonement. Standing before it, the priest would see reflected his own imperfection' from the natural viewpoint, and at the same time the mirrored etlect would show to him the vault of heaven above and the pillar of cloud nearby, all these latter bespeaking the glory of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">THE ANTITYPICAL LAVER</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Referring, then, to the antitype, the spirit-begotten one having his mind illuminated, his face is open. i. e.. he is enabled to understand, see. perceive, and grasp spiritual things. St. Paul seems to have had this thought in mind when he wrote: ‘‘We all. with open face beholding as in a glass | really </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">mirror]</span><span class="font9"> the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the spirit of the Lord&quot;. That is what we do when we note his majesty, power, love, and justice, by looking into his Word; beholding this, we are changed by that image that which we see in the mirror—from glory to glory, even as by the spirit of the Lord. And thus the lav er would picture perfection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Again the words of the Apostle indicate that he had in mind the lavin’ when he wrote: “When the goodness ■of God our Savior, and his love to man. dawned upon us. not in consequence of things we. as righteous men. had done, but as the re-tilt of his own mercy he saved us by means of the washing of the regeneration and renewal of our natures by the holy spirit, which he poured out on us richly through Jesus Christ our Savior.’' Tnu- 3: J. 5. </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Wei/monfk,</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">'thus he pictures Hu new creature, dwelling in the organism of flesh, the mgain-m being in the court condition (and there by viitui' of the covering of Christ’s righteousness), undergoing the transforming influence which results from imbibing or appropriating to himself the Word of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In conclusion we would say, then, that on the typical day of atonement no one was in the court except the priests — high priest and under-priests — justified human beings begotten to the divine nature, in antitype. All things in the court must be in harmony with this : therelore the court and its furnishings </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">on</span><span class="font9"> the typical day of atonement represented justification actual, or by virtue of the imputed merit of Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">With reference to the three </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">fires: In</span><span class="font9"> the Holy the incense was being burned by the high priest; in the court, the fat was burned upon the altar ; and outside the camp were burned the hide, flesh, etc. That which was burned outside sent up a detestable stench, and shows how the world views the sacrifice of Jesus and his body members. To them it is a distasteful thing. Inside the court, the burning fat gave forth a sweet savor, picturing how beautiful it is to those in that condition to see others sacrificing to the glory of God. Inside the Holy the incense on the golden altar yielded a sweet fragrance unto the Lord, which passed beyond the vail into the Host Holy, showing how Jehovah views that sacrifice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In harmony with the foregoing, we quote the following from the pen of Brother Russell, appearing in Thi Watch Tower of 1916, page 281:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“The justification of the gospel church is an instantaneous work, ‘If is God that justifieth.’ But the basis of this .justification is the sacrifice accomplished by Jesus, finished :ir Calvary. Before the Savior will impute to us the merit of his sacrifice we must know o/ him and trust him and accept lit- terms </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">of</span><span class="font7"> discipleship and consecrate ourselves fully as his disciples, even unto death. The moment he imputes the merit of his sacrifice to us, covering our blemishes, we are acceptable to the Father, received into in's family by the begetting of the Iioly spirit, and thus, thereafter. members of the church of the* firstborns, whose names are written in heaven.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Ano opt of the mouth of the beast.—The Antichrist doctrine of the Divine right of the clergy was the </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">direct </span><span class="font7">cause of the great war.

Millions of </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">people </span><span class="font7">are being turned away from faith in a God of Love </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font7">from faith In the Bible as His Message by the mo«t </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">mon</span><span class="font7">strous blasphemies of the Dark Ages. I charge the responsibility of all this against the sects and creeds of Christendom.

A groat fraud, a great hypocrisy, you say? I answer. Yes: the most astounding the world has over known. Two hundred thousand professed ministers of God and of Christ are standing before the world today telling the logends of the Dark Ages and seeking to hinder the people from coming to a knowledge of the Truth, meanwhile receiving the people’s money and reverence. Does </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">not </span><span class="font7">such hypocrisy, such blasphemy against God, such deception of the people, such keeping of them in darkness, deserve » great punishment, nnd Is it not nigh?”—B.

<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Anti out of the mohtb or the false fkochet.—The </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">one </span><span class="font7">cardinal error upon which, all protestant (false prophet) sects agree is the doctrine of human immortality, </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font7">original lie told in Eden. (Gen. 2-17: 3:4) Tn speaking of if our Lord says, “When ho speakelb 17m lie. ho speaketb of ids own.&quot; (John 8:44. Diaglott.) Speaking of it .again, the Apostle Paul says, of the worshipers of the beast </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font7">his image. “They admitted not the love of the Truth </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">that </span><span class="font7">they might be saved. And on this account God will </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">send </span><span class="font7">to them an energy of delusion, to their believing the </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">false</span><span class="font7">hood.” (2 Thes. 2:10. 11.) Tn each case the Greek </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">gives </span><span class="font7">the definite article. The frog issuing from the </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">false </span><span class="font7">prophet (the image of the beast) is the doctrine of </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">human </span><span class="font7">Immortality. These deluded souls actually </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">believe this </span><span class="font7">error, and will be able to prove it </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">to</span><span class="font7"> the satisfaction </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font7">the dragon, without a doubt. This error lies at the </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">bottom </span><span class="font7">of the doctrines of eternal torment and of the trinity. There is a hint in 1 John 4:1-3 that the cardinal </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">error </span><span class="font7">on which the false prophet will insist is that when </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Jesus </span><span class="font7">came from the Father He was more than flesh, I. e.. </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">bad </span><span class="font7">at least an immortal soul.—Rev. 13:11. 13. 14, 15: 14:!). 11; 15:2; 16:2: 19:20; 20:10; Matt. 24:24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“All Christian people credit the book of Revelation to our Lord, as St.John does. (Rev. 1 :1.) Therefore we tire not responsible for the symbolism used in that book. There are so many ways in which one might be misunderstood, even by good Christian people, that we naturally feel a delicacy about expressing our views. As we proceed to set forth our understanding of the symbols of the Revelation, we wisli to state most emphatically that we are saying nothing whatever against godly Christians anywhere, at any time, whetlier in any church or out of any church. We have nothing to say respecting people. We discuss PRINCIPLES, DOCTRINES, ALWAYS: individuals, NEVER! God has not commissioned us to discuss </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">people:</span><span class="font7"> it is ours to discuss </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">H</span><span class="font7"> i.s- </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Throughout the Bible, a Beast is the symbol used to represent a government. In Daniel's prophecy the great universal empires of the earth are thus symbolized. Babylon was the Lion. Medo-Persia the Bear, Greece the Leopard, and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Home</span><span class="font7"> the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Drayon.</span><span class="font7"> (Dan. 7:1-8) The Roman Empire still persists. The Dragon, then, symbolizes the Roman power, represented by the civil power in the world. The Beast is the Papal system of government. The third symbol, the Ealse Prophet, remains to be interpreted. This, we believe, is another name for the system elsewhere called ‘the Image of the Beast.’ (Rev. 13:14.) According to the Scriptures, this image is a very exact representation of the Beast. The False Prophet, or Image of the Beast, we understand to mean the Protestant Federation of Churches.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“ ‘Three unclean spirits like frogs came out of the mouth of the Dragon, and out of the mouth of the Beast, and out of the mouth of the False Prophet.' In this passage, the spirit is a doctrine—an unclean doctrine—a false doctrine. Each of these systems will utter the same things, and these utterances will have the effect of gathering the kingdoms of earth together to the Battle of Armageddon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“The symbolisms of Scripture, rightly understood, are very forceful, and there is always a close resemblance between the symbol itself and the thing symbolized. When the HolySpirit uses a frog to represent certain doctrines or teachings, we may be sure that the application will fit well. While a frog&quot; is a small creature, yet it puffs itself up until it almost bursts with the effort to be somebody. A frog has a very wise look, even though it does not know very much. Then a frog </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">erouks</span><span class="font7"> whenever it litters a sound.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">&quot;The three most prominent characteristics of a frog. then, are pomposity, an air of superior wisdom and knowledge, and a continual croaking. Applying these characteristics to the picture given in the Divine Word, we learn that from kingly power, from the Catholic Church and from the Federation of Protestant Churches, will go forth the same teachings. The spirit of all will be boastful; an air of superior knowledge and wisdom will be assumed: all will foretell dire results to follow any failure to obey their counsels. However conllieting the creeds, the different cs will be ignored m Hie general proposition that .nothing ancient must be disturbed, or investigated, or repudiated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“The boasted Divine authority of tin<sup>1</sup> (Titir&lt;-li. and the Divine right of kings aside from the Church, will not be allowed to conflict : for both will be indorsed. Any persons or teachings in lontlict with these boastful, unscrijitural ilaims will be branded as everything vile, at the mouths of the frogs, croaking from pulpits and platforms, and through the religious and secular press. The nobler sentiments of some will bo strangled by the philosophy of the same evil spirit which spoke through Caiaphas. the high priest, respecting our I,ord Jesus. As Caiaphas declared it expedient Io commit a crime in violation of justice, both human and Divine, to be rid of Jesus and His teachings, so this frog-like spirit will approve of any and every violation of principle necessary to self-protection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Every true Christian is ashamed to look back upon the pages of history and see what terrible deeds were done in the name of God and justice, and in the name of our Lord Jesus. We are not to think for a moment that these frog spirits, or doctrines, are all bad. lint rather that they are doctrines of bombast and pomposity, representing themselves to be very wise and great, and having the backing of centuries. Out of the mouth of the Dragon comes the doctrine of the Divine right of Kings: ‘Do not look back of the curtain of history to see whore the kings got that right. Accept the doctrine; for if you do not. and if men look into the matter, there will be a terrible revolution and everything will go down I'</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“The Beast and the False Prophet have similar croakings. The Catholic Church says, ‘Do not look behind! Do not question anything about the Church!’ Protestantism says, also, ‘We are great, we are wise, we know a great deal. Keep quiet! No one will then know that you know nothing.' All say (croaking), ‘We tell you that if you say anything against present arrangements, terrible things will come to pass.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Political parties are figuring in this. All declare, ‘If any change should come, it will mean terrible disaster!’ Some have the backbone and some have the civil power behind them, but unitedly they croak to the people that if any change is made, it will mean ruin to the present order. In the language of our day, ‘Stand pat!’ is the order ir) Church and in State; but the people are being moved by fear. It is tills croaking of the Beast, the Dragon and the False Prophet that will arouse the kings of earth and gather them together to the Armageddon Battle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“The ecclesiastical kings and princes, with their retinue of clergy and faithful adherents, will be gathered in solid phalanx- -Protestant and Catholic. The political kings and kaisers, princes, and all in high places, with their henchmen and retainers, will follow in line on the same side. The financial kings and merchant princes, and all whom they can influence by the most gigantic power ever yet exercised in the world, will join the same side, according to this prophecy. They do not realize, however, that they are coming to Armageddon; yet strange to say, this is a part of their very cry, ‘Come together to Armageddon!’</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Speaking of our day, our Lord declared, ‘Men’s hearts failing them for fear and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth ; for the powers of heaven shall be shaken.' (Luke 21 : 26.) The kings of Europe know not what to do. All sectarianism is being shaken.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“The croaking of the frog spirits, or doctrines, will gather the kings and princes, financial, political, religious and industrial, into one great army. The spirit of fear, inspired by the croaking, will scourge the passions of otherwise good and reasonable men to fury—desperation. In their blind fidlowing of these evil spirits, evil doctrines, they will be ready to sacrifice life and everything on what they mistakenly suppose is the altar of Justice, Truth and Righteousness under a Divine arrangement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">&quot;Many noble people in this great army will assume an attitude quite contrary to their preference. For a time the wheels of liberty and progress will be turned backward, and medmwal restraints will be considered necessary for self-preservation—for the maintenance of the present order of things and for the prevention of the new order which God has decreed, the due time for which is at hand. E\en those Who nun be God's people do not stop to consider whetlier ii is His will that things should continue as they Ini'e been for ilie past six thousand years. The Bible says that such is not God’s will, but that there is to be a gieat o'erturiiuig. that a new order is coming in.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">&quot;For a brief time, as we understand the Scriptures, these combined forces of Armageddon will triumph. Free speech, free mads, and other liberties which have come to be the very breath of the masses in our day, will be ruthlessly shut oil' on the plea of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">neeex'dty.</span><span class="font7"> the glory of God. the commands of the Church, etc. The safety-valve will be sat upon, mid thus will cease to annoy earth’s kings with the sound of escaping steam : and all will seem to be serene—until the great social explosion described in the Revelation as an </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">earthquul.e</span><span class="font7"> will take place. In symbolic language an earthquake signifies social revolution, and the Scriptural declaration is that none like it ever before occurred. (Rev. 16: IS, 19.) Dur Lord refers io it in Matthew 24:21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">&quot;At this juncture, the Scriptures show. Divine Power will step forward, and God w ill gather the marshaled hosts to Armageddon—to the Mount of Destruction. (Rev. 16:16.) The very thing which they sought to avert by their union, iederation, etc., will be the very thing that they will hasten. Other Scriptures tell us that God will be represented by Messiah, and that He will be on the side of the masses. ‘At that time shall Michael [the Godlike One—Messiah] stand up.’ (Dan. 12:1.) He will assume authority. He will take possession of His kingdom in a manner little looked for by many of those who erroneously have been claiming to be His Kingdom, and authorized b\ Him to reign in His name and in His stead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">&quot;Our Lord Jesus declared, ‘His servants ye are unto whom ye render service.&quot; Some may be rendering service to Satan and to error, who claim to be rendering service to God and to righteousness: and some may serve ignorantly, as slid Saul of Tarsus, who ‘verily thought that he did God service.’ in persecuting the Church. The same principle holds true reversely. As an earthly king does not hold himself responsible for the moral character of each soldier who fights his battles, so the Lord does not vouch for the moral character of all who enlist and fight on His side of any question. His servants they are to whom they render service, whatever the motive prompting them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“The same principle will apply in the coming Battle of Armageddon. God's side of that battle will be the people’s side; and that very nondescript host, the people, will be pitted at the beginning of the battle. Anarchists, Socialists, and hot-headed radicals of every school of reason and unreason, will be in the forefront of that battle. He who has any knowledge of army life knows that a great army is composed of all classes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“The masses will be restless under their restraints, but will be conscious of their weakness as compared with the kings and princes, financial, social, religious anil political, who will then hold sway. The masses have no sympathy with anarchy. They- realize truly that the worst form of government is better than none. The masses will seek relief through the ballot and the peaceful readjustment of earth’s affairs for the elimination of evil, for the placing of monopolies and utilities and the supplies of nature in the hands of people for the public good. The crisis will be reached when the hitherto upholders of the law shall become \ iolators of the law and resisters of the will of the majority as expressed by the ballot. Fear for the future will goad the well-meaning masses to desperation, and anarchy will result when Socialism fails.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“The Lord’s saints are not to be in this battle at all. God’s consecrated people, longing at heart for Messiah’s Kingdom and the glorious Year of Jubilee and Restitution which it will inaugurate, will patiently abide the Lord’s rime, and wait unmurmuringly for it. Their lamps trimmed and burning, they will not be in darkness respecting the momentous events of the impending battle: but they will be of good courage, knowing the outcome portrayed in the ‘more sure word of prophecy.’ to which they have done well to ‘take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place, until the Day dawn.&quot;—2 Pet. 1: 19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“The question now arises, Why did not God send His Kingdom sooner? Why is Armageddon necessary? We answer that God has His own times and seasons, and that He has appointed the Great Seventh Thousand-Year Day for tire reign of Christ. Divine Wisdom has withheld until our day the great knowledge and skill which is breeding at the &lt;me time millionaires and discontents. Had God lifted the veil of ignorance a thousand years sooner, the world would have lined up for Armageddon a thousand yean, sooner. God did not bring these things before the present time because His Plan has various parts, all of which are converging at the same time. In kindness God veiled the eyes of mankind until the gathering of Armageddon would immediately precede Messiah’s taking to Himself His great power and beginning His reign. (Rev. 11:17, 18.)—D v-xvi.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">[We publish the following letter as an interesting suggestion worthy of consideration. The year 1528 iros a year of crisis, in which the Protestant princes united their forces to save themselves in an immediate and impending danger. &nbsp;It was this very crisis</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">which must have urged them to the formation of the League, which was accomplished three years later. These facts may suggest</span></p>

Or it may be that the falling nt the non lain -hi <sup>1</sup> ol (he city (really two occurrences)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">are thus dissociated by three years. At all events we publish the letter for what it may he worth.1</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">I feel impelled to send you a few lines regarding a matter which, I trust, will interest you as much as it does me.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In making a repeated study of the Seventh Volume, particularly of the prophecies of Ezekiel. I could not help noticing several chronological features which I would like to bring to your attention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In interpreting Ezekiel 4:5. 6 the commentator make the 390-year period begin with 1528 and end with 1918; while the 40-year period appears to begin with the year 1878. also ending with 1918. It is my thought that the matter hen referred lo involves chronological features of very grea importance. It seems to me that in this chapter it is on, heavenly Father’s purpose to show us the exact time of tin lieginning of the culminating of the great time of troubl and the fall of the beast and the false prophet, i.e.. &quot;Babylon’</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7">(I) 1 call your attention lo the fact that the chrono logical statements &lt;&gt;f the Seventh Volume, as contained i Ezekiel, ilmpter 4. are not wholly free from objectioi Having previously served as minister of the Methodi' Episcopal Church, and thereby possessing an accurate knowledge of ecclesiastical history pertaining to Germany and of the great Reformation movement in particular, I could not help noticing at once that the Seventh Volume makes the 390-year period begin with the year 1528.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7">To begin with, the year 1528 plays no important part at all in the German Reformation movement. The historical events, as narrated by the Seventh Volume Ezekiel 4:5, did not occur in 1528, but in April, 1529, though it would not even be proper to say that the year 1529 would mark the beginning of the 390-year period. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Lest we make a mistake in this matter Ezekiel 4:3 mentions an “iron pan”, a very proper symbol of the “wall of iron”, wall of protection, established between beleaguered Roman ecclesiasticism and the antitypical reformer class —Luther and his co-reformers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The “iron pan” is nothing else than the League of Schmal-kald, by which all Protestant princes formed, as a protective measure on behalf of Protestantism, a combination or union, in order to make a stand against Emperor Charles V and against Papacy, since these planned to exterminate Protestantism by fire and by sword. This defensive and offensive Alliance of Schmalkald, as formed by the Protestant princes, made such a powerful impression upon the Emperor that he gave up his design of exterminating the Protestant heretics. The </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">League</span><span class="font7"> o/ </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Schmalkald,</span><span class="font7"> an accomplished historical fact, represents the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“iron pan’’</span><span class="font7"> in Ezekiel 4:3. When did this League come into existence? The answer is: Between December, 1530, and April, 1531.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Here we are clearly shown the beginning of the 390-year period. These 390 years, therefore, do not begin with the year 1528, but with April, 1531 (when the League of Schmalkald was formed), and end in the spring (April) of 1921.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">And again, the Seventh Volume, in Ezekiel 4:5, makes the break between England (Henry VIII) and Papacy also to begin with 1528. But it is not the beginning of this break which enters into this matter, but the completed break. The Seventh Volume, in Revelation 13:11, par. 2, makes the following statement: “In 1531, owing to a dispute between her king, Henry VIII, and the Pope, England withdrew from allegiance to Papacy”. The “iron pun”, that is, the political governmental power, was established at the same time in England as in Germany—in the year 1531.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7">(II) The Seventh Volume, in Ezekiel 4:G, makes the 40-year period begin with 1S78 and end with 1918. Now, it is known that the 390-year period makes it, among other things, apparent how long Roman ecclesiasticism lias been cast off by God, during which time the antitypical Ezekiel class is to bear its unrighteousness and at the same time make warfare against it. In the main, however, we are shown when it will come to an end. Thus it is also with respect to the Id-year period. These 40 years make it evident that Protestantism has also been cast off in the last 40 years of this 390-year period, and that God had chosen out a watchman, a new mouthpiece, in Ilie person of Brother Russell.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7">Tills 40-year period, during which time Protestantism has been cast oft' and yet is suffered to be. is therefore to have its beginning 40 years prior to 1921 : that is, in 1881. This is substantiated by the Seventh Volume itself by way of several proofs, to wit:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7">(1) In Revelation 10:3 it is stated that in 1S81 the first great cry went out to Christendom by means of the distribution of “Good for Thinking Christians&quot;.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7">(2) In Revelation 10: 7 it is stated that in the autumn of 1881, when “Food for Thinking Christians” was being circulated, the sounding began.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7">(3) In the comment on Ezekiel 3:16 the year 1881 is stated as having been of very particular importance in the life of Brother Russell. In the same year he published “Tabernacle Shadows”, and in the same year 1881, it is stated, God’s favor was finally withdrawn from the churches. Kindly read Seventh Volume comments on Ezekiel 3:16.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7">(4) In comment on Ezekiel 3:17 it is stated: “The function of watchmanship was not given until 1881&quot;.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7">(5) The tract entitled, “The Near Restoration of the People of Israel,” contains on the second cover page a chronological table which states, under VI, “Jewish Twofold Parallels,” as follows:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Babylon Cast Off 1881</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark16"><span class="font6">The “iron pan”—the League of Schmalkald—was established as a wall of protection on behalf of the reformer class in the year</span></a></p>
<p><span class="font6">Duration of being cast off and of besiegement, that is, warfare against Roman ecclesiasticism........................ 390</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark17"><span class="font6">Fall of Roman ecclesiasticism in the year</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark18"><span class="font6">Casting off of Protestantism and setting up of the new watchman (Brother Russell) in</span></a></p>
<p><span class="font6">Duration of his watchmanship.......................................... 40</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark19"><span class="font6">Fai! of Protestantism in the year</span></a></p>
<p><span class="font7">This prophecy, however, applies more to European Christendom than to countries outside of Europe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">What events will occur, beginning with the spring of 1921, we are shown in a most wonderfully accurate manner in Ezekiel 5:2. Chapter 5 is closely connected with Chapter 4. In verse 2 of Chapter 5 it is stated that all of Christendom will perish in three parts and in a threefold way. The key as to the time when these events are to begin is found in these words: “When the days of the siege are fulfilled”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Hence when the 390-year and the 40-year period, respectively, are ended in the spring of 1921, then Babylon will fall in Europe:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7">(1) By fire, that is, anarchy, hunger and pestilence. (See Ezekiel 5:12, 13) It will fall: in the midst of the city —that is, anarchy will begin in Germany (seat and centre of Protestantism) and in Italy (seat and centre of Catholicism and Papacy), and from there spread to the neighboring countries. The midst of the city (Germany and Italy) is particularly pointed out.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7">(2) By the sword, meaning that a new war will break out, and that outside of Europe and Germany, “round about thee”, probably a war between Japan and America. It is to be presumed that anarchy will come to America later than to Europe.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7">(3) Slaughter of the Europeans by colored races in the countries outside of Europe and spread of anarchy. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“A.</span><span class="font7"> [the third] part I will scatter into all the winds, and I will draw out a sword after them.”</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7">These, my dear Brother Rutherford, are the thoughts that came into my mind when studying the Seventh Volume, and I thought it might afford you pleasure if I should make them known to you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">I was formerly, for a period of fourteen years, a minister of the Methodist Episcopal Church. I was privileged to come to a knowledge of the truth in the fall of 1917; and thereafter, in 1918, I had to resign my ministry, amid many ami severe trials. But praise be to the Lord for his grace, which has blessed me so richly with spiritual gifts through our Lord Jesus Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We are eagerly longing for the establishment of the kingdom ; for conditions here in Germany are exceedingly sad and distressing. The ever increasing terrible famine is causing us much suffering, there being a great scarcity of the most-needed provisions, such as milk, flour, potatoes and sugar, as well as fats. A pound of rice, for instance, now costs twenty times as much as it did under the scale of prices in times of peace. All this is a great hardship for people like myself, afflicted with stomach troubles. How well off you are in America I To be sure, however, in the next year. 1921, the trouble will also visit you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In conclusion, we invoke upon you and all the dear ones in the Bible House the Lord’s richest blessings for the New Year.—Deuteronomy 31:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">With much love and hearty greetings, I am</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Your brother,--</span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">, Germany.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font11"><a name="bookmark21"></a>DAVID IN CAMP AND COURT</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">--Jui.y 4 — 1 Samuel 17 : 1 - 18: 9 — —</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">A MISHIT AND BOASTFUL ENEMY OF GOD--A CONTINUED CHALI ENGE TO IHIHT—DAX ID. 1 HE YOUTH, ACCEPTS THE CHALLENGE</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">IN THE NAME OF THE GOD OF ISRAEL — GOD IS WITH HIM — JEHOVAH’S IS '1 JI E X UlOBY — PBAISE 1 OB DAVID AND THE JEALOUSY OF KING SAUL.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">David behaved himself wisely in all his ways; and Jehovah teas with him.&quot;—1 Satnuel 18: Ilf.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">O</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">U </span><span class="font7">R lesson shows us another invasion of Israel’s borders by the Philistines, Saul at this time being king, though David had already been privately anointed but not publicly proclaimed as his successor. The Philistine hosts had advanced a considerable distance into the territory of the Israelites, and hail reached the more ■ mountainous country, where Saul gathered the army of Israel to meet them. A valley lay between the two hosts, and in the center of this valley there was a ditch about ten teet deep, cut through the rock by a mountain stream. The .place was favorable for a battle of the kind usually fought at that day. Neither army seemed to be anxious to attempt to cross the steep banks of the brook in the face of its ■opponent, for under such conditions the attacking party would be considered disadvantaged. Besides, the Philistines —know ing that Israel’s king stood head and shoulders above his fellow-Israelites—had pitted against him a giant Philistine, Goliath, still taller, about ten feet high and probably strong in proportion, as indicated by the weight of his armor, </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">■spear </span><span class="font7">and sword. The challenge set forth that the disputes 'between the two nations, of many years' standing, should </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">be </span><span class="font7">settled, not by a general battle, but by a duel between the Philistine giant and the most competent Israelite who could be found to come against him—who undoubtedly would have been Saul, the king. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">For forty days this challenge was made every morning, «nd the king of Israel and his chief mighty men practically confessed that they feared the giant and would not respond </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font7">his challenge. It was at this juncture that David, a young man of about twenty-one, was sent by his father to ■his bretfiren in the army of Israel to see how they fared, to </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">take </span><span class="font7">them some delicacies from home, and to bring back ■word respecting the prosperity of the laird’s hosts. The Infidel is prone to twit the Lord's people upon the statement ■of Scripture that Dat id was a man after God’s own heart— ■referring to some of his weaknesses and shortcomings ; but tn tills lesson we see clearly the feature of David’s character </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">which </span><span class="font7">God so highly esteemed, and which he has always ■esteemed in everyone to the extent that each possesses and ■manifests it. This quality winch God esteemed in David was his faith — the same quality that he esteemed in Abraham and in all the faithful of the past. Of all who had &quot;“this testimony that they pleased God”, il is written that by ifaitli '.hey did thus and so. “and it was counted unto them </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">ifor </span><span class="font7">righteousness”.—G.-ilat i.-ins .'1: G.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark23"></a>A GIANT OF FAITH</span></h4>
<p><span class="font7">Hiivas faith in the I.ord being great, he was surprised to learn when lie came to the army that the Philistine had heen boasting himself for forty days against Israel and Israel’s God, and that no one of his nation had possessed sufficient faith in God to accept the challenge. Ue at oneo ■propos'd that he would, accept it himself and asked to bo take:: to the king that he might be thus commissioned. Those who mentioned Inin to the king spoke of him as a mighty, xaliant man , xet when Saul looked upon him lie perce ved that lie wa&lt; bin a youth and was physically no mat-'h for the giant. Ilowexer. lie was the only eliampioi who had arisen, and lie was full of confidence in his own success as an instrument in the I,ord’s hands for delivering Israel from Hie boastful heathen. Saul finally consented, -and proposed to lend Israel’s champion ills own armor; blit, unused to such accoutrements. David found when he had donned them that he could not feel properly at home in </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">them. </span><span class="font7">It would require considerable time to learn how to </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">use </span><span class="font7">such armor and implements advantageously and xvithout discomfort, and he decided to go in his usual garb as a </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">shepherd, </span><span class="font7">armed only with his shepherd’s club and sling and </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font7">scrip or leather bag in which to carry the stones which </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">he </span><span class="font7">selected from the bed of the brook as he passed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The story of the conflict is quickly told. The Philistine </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">KM Indignant </span><span class="font7">that he should Lie asked to fight with a boy unarmored, and he cursed David in the name of his gods, saying: “Come to me, ami I xvill give thy flesh unto the foxvls of the air and unto the beasts of the field”. David’s reply was characteristic—full of that faith in God which marks his entire history from first to last, and on account of which the Lord speaks of him as a man after his own heart. He said to Goliath; “Thou comest to me with sxvord and spear and xvith javelin; but I come to thee in the name of the Lord of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom thou hast defied. This day will the Lord deliver thee into mine hand ; and I will smite thee and take thy head from thee; and I xxill give the carcasses of the hosts </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">of the </span><span class="font7">Philistines this day to the fowls of the air and to the wild beasts of the earth ; that all the earth may knoxv that there is a God in Israel. And all this assembly shall knoxv that the Lord saveth not with sword and spear: for the battle is the Lord’s, and lie xvill give you into our hands.&quot; Thus the issue was seen by both Philistines and Israelites </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">to be </span><span class="font7">as between the Lord, his people and their enemies. Hastening forxvard David threw Ids first stone, xvhich struck the giant in the forehead and caused him to fall senseless. Directly David finished the confiict witli Goliath’s oxvn sword, beheading him while the Israelites, their faith rexiving, attacked the Philistines, whose courage fled.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark25"></a>THE GREAT DANCING</span></h4>
<p><span class="font7">The first nine verses of the eighteenth chapter of 1 Samuel, the remainder of our lesson, have to do with the great rejoicing which was evinced when the victorious army of Israel passed back through the cities. We read: “The women came out of all cities of Israel, singing and dancing, to meet King Saul, with tabrets, with joy. and with instruments of music. .And the women answered one another they played, and said :</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Saul hath slain his thousands, And David his ten thousands.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It was for Israel what it was for this country and England xvlien the armistice was signed in November, 1918 —so great was the outburst of popular feeling. Only for Israel the joy meant much more: for the Immediate danger was much greater and the rejoicings were deeper and more sacred. Those rejoicings are embalmed, so to speak, xvith the word </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">mahalath,</span><span class="font7"> “the great dancing,&quot; xvhich is used as a sub-scription to Psalm 52.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The direct sequence to tills great dancing was Saul’s anger, the flight of David, and his coming to the house of Ahimelech. With Goliath’s sword in one hand, figuratively speaking, and his pen in the other, David wrote the fifty-second Psalm. The spirit of it is the same as that commemorating his battle with Goliath (Psalm 8) : </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">all ylory is ascribed to (led.</span><span class="font7"> If fids Psalm lie read in the light of the facts it becomes living and vibrant before us. Afterward it was formally handed over to the chief musician for liturgical use, because there was instruction in it for the people of God—that they should give God the glory: for whatever may he the goodness and mercy of’ God which lie has manifested toward us, we too can say today:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“I will praise thee for eier, Because thou hast done it: I will wait on thy name; For it is good before thy saints.”</span></p>

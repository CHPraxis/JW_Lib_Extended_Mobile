<h3><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark10"></a>Not Where to Lay Their Heads</span></h3>
<p><span class="font14">T</span><span class="font9">HE large financial interests of the country are spending millions of dollars in flooding the country with propaganda in their own favor; but it must be conceded that they are not showing the same amount of interest in the welfare of the common people, as that welfare centers in the housing problem. They must have made billions out of the blood and tears of the World War, but quite overlook their opportunity of seeing that their workers are properly housed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Put a hundred people on an island. Let all their belongings get into the hands of a minority, and an ever diminishing minority, and what happens ? The answer is so simple that any one can understand it. Yet this is just what we are coming to in the United States, it seems.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In 1890 the percentage of American people paying rent was 52:2; now, after the lapse of thirty years, it is 57:1. Thirty years ago an average of 110 families occupied 100 homes; there was an extra family in every tenth home. Today there- are 121 families for every 100 available dwellings in this country: there is an extra family in every fifth home. We are moving in the wrong direction and have nearly reached an impasse.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Family life is the greatest guaranty for the security of the state. Young people are the same now as they always were. They want to get marked and have homes of their o«n, but there is n'o place for them to go. Weddings continue at the rate of 1.040.000 a year, but only 70.000 new dwellings were built in 1919 and in the year previous there were 71 percent as many buildings destroyed by fire as there were new dwellings bq|lt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Neither young people nor old people can be happy when crowded into the quarters occupied by others. Two million new Americans are born every year, and the natural result should lie that they and their parents should have quarters of increased size. The present conditions of things is having a tendency to discourage marriage and child-bearing. It is forcing husband;; to seek boarding houses and wives to return to their parents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Most people, if properly housed, in suitable -surroundings, will take the other troubles of life philosophically; but put them into unsatisfactory quarters and they will become irritable and inefficient. Crowd them into narrow space, and their powers of vital resistance wane. Where the average number of persons per room is two, the death rate is more than twice what it is where the average number of persons is less than one. Most people wish to own their own homes and to have their homes to themselves, for they find this to be better for them and for their children than to be with others. In homes that are owned by the parents the death rate of children is less than half of what -it is in the houses that charge the lowest rent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The most efficient way to overcome industrial unrest is to see that labor is comfortably housed. Unrest will not spread among home owners, nor will a mechanic leave town in wrath if he owns his own home. A man owning his own home takes more interest in the community and is in a very special sense an asset to the town where he lives.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">If Big Business would divert a portion of its capital—namely, the insurance funds, hank deposits and other savings of the people which it uses to carry on its great enterprises—toward the building of moderate-priced homes, and if it would cease to think of larger and ever larger dividends as the aim and end of existence, it would get far better results in its fight against Bolshevism than by its present method of making up funds until which to propagandize the people against it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">One of</span><span class="font9"> the first things that the Bolshevists did with the Russian mansions was to allot their rooms to the homeless. Do you want to know how near we are to the edge of that very thing in America today? Read the New York </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font9"> of August 27, 1920, and note the proposal of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Nation,</span><span class="font9"> therein set forth, that in every large city in the United States where the housing situation is acute, the city should at once take possession of every unoccupied loft, store, shop or dwelling where human beings could be sheltered, fix a fair rental for the recompense of the owner, and let the people in. If that were done, how long dp you think it would be before every disused or half-used church or dwelling would be made to shelter those in need of it!</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In the month of June, 1920, members of a Manchester, England, tenants’ defense league seized fourteen unoccupied houses and turned them over to ex-soldier tenants who were without homes. Of course the owners at once made application to the courts to regain possession of their property, but this shows what the present situation is developing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Tenement House Commissioner Frank Mann said before the United States Senate Committee on Reconstruction and Production: “It is the job of the men of wealth to take up the question of housing. The wealthy should take up this question seriously to save their own skins.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">To get the country hack to 'where it was before the war the United States would have to build 1-,140,000 new dwellings, and to get it back where it was in 1890, with a home for 110 families in 100 apartments, it would need to build 2.190,000 new dwellings. Before the war it built about 430.000 dwellings annually: and counting on the usual increase in the population the present situation is already so bad that it cannot he overcome for at least five years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Not only are 57.1 percent of the people without any property, and therefore discontented and on the verge of revolution, but the condition of those who do own property is gradually growing worseTnstead of better. Of the owned homes, .34.4 percent were free of encumbrance in 1890, but this has fallen to 28.6 percent in 1920. The prosperity of the few has been at the expense of the many, The war produced 23.000 new millionaires, and they have been taking from the common people every cent they can extract.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Besides the 2.190,000 new dwellings which it should have, and which would now cost about $12,000,000,000 to build, the country needs about 128,000 factories costing $100,000 or over, about 325,000 smaller factories, 6,000 hotels, 5,000 schools, and 14,000 railroad stations, or a total building requirement of approximately $15,000,-OOO^pOO. This amount is somewhat less than one-third of the amount spent by this government on the World War. Why not top off the Victory Loan with a Plaoe-to-Live Loan and thus make the United States safe for democracy!</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark12"></a>New York's Terrible Predicament</span></h6>
<p><span class="font14">I</span><span class="font9">N THE old style tenements constructed in</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">New York city up until thirteen years ago, and comprising more than half of the living apartments of the city, three-quarters of the rooms have no window openings on the outer air, and no light except that borrowed from adjoining rooms. In one block of the city one-half of the rooms are dark. The courts constitute space for the ventilation of toilets and receptacles for garbage, and living or sleeping rooms open out to these courts. Food and coal must be hauled up five flights of stairs. Garbage and ashes must be carried down. In thousands of them there are no bath tubs and no wash tubs, and water pipes and even gas pipes are rusted nearly shut. Eighteen thousand of those apartments are unfit for human habitation, having neither water nor toilets in the buildings, and being never repaired. But nevertheless they </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">are</span><span class="font9"> inhabited, and that is enough in itself to-explain New York’s unrest. The janitors of such places get $6 a month and the use of a few dark rooms in payment for their services.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Normal construction in New York city is 2S.0OO apartments a year; and normal growth of population is 125.000 per. year. Ordinarily the one takes &lt;-are of th&lt;- other, and there have been times when many apartments were idle, awaiting tenant’. But the war has changed all this. Euildimr lias practically ceased, except for business purposes: but the city is growing faster than ever. Between July 1. 1919. and July 1. 1920. ifl-ini to the tearing down of old buildings or to their conversion for business purposes, there w&gt; re actually 271 less homes in the city at the later date than at the former one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It is well known that for every dollar put into factory construction there must be four dollars put into housing construction, in order to take care of the workers; yet in the Queens district of New York alone there have been $20,000,000</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font9">It is estimated that New York is short of ’ homes for 100,000 to 160,000 families. One of the contributing causes for this is that so many people made fortunes during the year and a halt the country was at war and have come to New York to spend their money. These new rich can Outbid any of the workers for anything they wish to rent or to buy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">As a consequence rents are going up, and will continue to go up until they reach the level of the now frightfully high building costs. In some localities three-room apartments that rented a year ago for $35 per month now rent for $95. Five-room apartments that rented for $45 per month were made into two smaller apartments, and each of the smaller apartments now rents for $80, as stated in our last issue. • Many of the rent increases are caused by tenants bidding against each other, but this is not the case with all of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Speculative builders claim that they cannot afford to build apartment houses unless they get $20 per month per room rental, and apartments recently completed command this figure. • At New Rochelle, a suburb, reports show an $18.50 rental raised to $32 per month, another from $20 to $42 and a third from $13 to $30. In a suburb of Brooklyn a landlord raised the rent of a tenant from $75 to $225 per month at one jump. A doctor had his rent raised from $150 to $400. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">New York tenements are built as poorly as the law allows. While they are new and in good condition they are filled with tenants, and, if necessary, at low rents. As soon as the house is filled it is sold, and before long the new owner sees his profits going in patching and repairs. He raises the rent, and the tenant has to pay it or move. The landlord justifies himself with the thought that he is getting a smaller return . on his money than he could obtain in other lines. Big Business does not consider such buildings good investments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The profitable apartments are the elaborate ones, the ones which command the highest rentals. One of the latest of these in New York city contains three thousand rooms. Its largest apartments rent for $15,000 a year, with no leases given for less than five years. The cheapest apartment has six rooms and three baths, and rents for $4,000 a year. More than one hundred of the city’s millionaires live in this new apartment house. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font9">of new factories built in the last three years, and no provision made for the workers. During the past year Brooklyn issued 6,348 building permits, and these permits showed a greater interest in automobiles than they did in people; ■ Tor out of the total number there were 229 more permits for garages than for all classes of buildings for housing purposes combined.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In New York's 982,408 apartments there are 60,000 apartments that are housing more than one family. Virtually the whole population live in apartment houses; for out of the total of nearly 6,000,000, less than 5 percent own any interest in land or homes. This is bad enough, but in addition, the apartments are </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">so dimintt-five</span><span class="font9"> in size and </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">so croivded!</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">■ In a single block in New York, comprising four and one-half acres of land, 5,021 persons find their homes. Two other blocks show 4,456 and 4,370 respectively, and there are 235 blo,cks in the city that hold over 2,000 persons each. It is not unusual to find two families living in three rooms, each family comprising father, mother and several children. Four of these , poor souls sleep in the kitchen every uight.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Children by the hundred are sleeping in bath-</span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">F</span><span class="font9"> tubs in which crib mattresses have been placed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">There are places in New York where twenty-five persons are living in apartments that were ' designed to accomodate five persons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A building erected for fifteen families was housing thirty-five families, and these had taken in twenty roomers. Another house constructed to house thirty families was sheltering forty, with thirty roomers added. In 109 houses built for twenty families each there were 1,033 roomers: in 150 houses built for twenty-four families each there were 1,209 roomers; in 358 houses built for twenty-eight families each there were 2,500 roomers. Such a multitude of roomers has caused the ruin of large numbers of girls occupying the same crowded quarters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">May first and October first are moving days in New York; and when the May moving day came around in 1920 there were 26,930 families, . who before the war would have had their housing needs supplied, that were forced to break up their hofiies, &quot;Store their goods and go in with other famines because there were no other places for them to go. For a considerable time </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font9">portion of this army of 107,722 persons was quartered in the city's armories. The storage warehouses are filled with their belongings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The housing situation in New York is so serious that in May Mayor Hylan named a committee of eighty-two of New York’s most prominent men to consider the problem, and in September the Governor of the state called a special session of the legislature to deal with the same matter. Progress is slow because there are so many conflicting factors to the problem.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">One of the greatest of these factors is the financial one. Big Business refuses to invest in low-priced apartments because it can earn more money elsewhere. The law prohibits a mortgage rate of interest higher than 6 percent and mortgages are subject to income taxes and surtaxes. Because of this the estate of Marshall Field is now said to be making 15 percent only on its mortgages where other concerns, with funds differently invested, are making from seven percent upward.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">. A great manv suggestions have been made. Some have urged that income taxes on mortgages should be abolished so as to attract capital. Others have urged that new dwellings should be exempted from taxation for several ■ years as an offset to their high cost of con&gt; struction. The Labor party has urged state credits for home building, and au act enabling cities to acquire, hold and lease land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">If a city can spend its money to assist in building subways it is difficult to see why it cannot build dwellings. It is no more important that people should be transported to and from their work than it is that they should have a place to live. In some of the newest and most beautiful cities of Europe the city itself is the largest landlord and the largest landholder.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Lawyers claim that before the city can build houses on city owned land, financed by municipal bonds, an amendment to the state constitution must be passed. Such amendments, even if unopposed by Big Business, usually take about two years to put through; and the problem will not wait &quot;so long. A few of the larger concerns of the city are doing something for their own employes by arranging with owners of I,&gt;ts to accept mortgages covering the value of the lot, usually alymt 20 percent, securing Ioans from money-lenders for 00 percent, the concern itself supplying the remaining 20 percent The employe thus has a house huiit lor him w ,,<sub>H </sub>advancing anything himself, and pays for his home gradually on a monthly payment basis. “</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A few tenants have undertaken to organize cooperative societies t o protect themselves against further rent increases. In many in- &lt;&nbsp;stances they have been defrauded into paying more for the properties than they were worth; and then after all their savings were invested in the properties the owners have called the mortgages, ruining the tenants financially and cancelling their leases. The owner then evicts them and gets a new class of tenants to go through another such experience.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Meantime New York continues to struggle * ■with a problem which is growing worse every day. Apartments are being cut down into ever smaller and fewer rooms, until finally the bedroom has appeared which is too small for a bed; and the two single beds which it contains are built into the wall one above another in the form of steamer berths. The one room and kitchenette apartments have been found a bad . thing socially. They make lazy and immoral . wives and increase the number of divorces. All this while there are 24,000 vacant farm houses in the state, and more farms are being • abandoned and more farm houses vacated right . along.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Housing Outside of New York</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">W</span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">HAT is</span><span class="font9"> true of New York is true of its suburbs. Commuters to New York have increased 50 percent in a year, and that notwithstanding the raise in commutation rates. Rents in the Oranges- run from $20 to $35 per room per month. Newark has had a tent city of two hundred army tents to shelter the homeless. Five hundred Passaic families have their goods in storage because they have no home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Philadelphia is short of 30,000 homes, but most of its 400,000 homes are owned by the occupants. Tenants of Roxbury, Dorchester and other Boston suburbs have organized for mutual protection. Washington is 10,000 dwellings short. The Federal Rent Commission has reduced the rents of some apartments. One l;imdr--d dollars charged for four rooms, kitchen and bath &quot;as reduced to $62.50: $65 charged for two rooms, kitchen and bath was cut to $37.50. The United States Housing Corporation was abolished in January. One of its considerable</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">ment dormitories &lt;in the Union Station Plaza, at an expense of $1,500 per room. These tem-</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">porary structures are in good shape and will probably be used for years. The temporary structures erected in Paris during the Franco-Prussian war remained in place for thirty years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Throughout the mining regions of Pennsyl-</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">&lt;, vania, West Virginia and elsewhere the average company town is a place with no sidewalks, dirt roads and four-room houses without running water or inside toilets. The towns are ■without trees, grass or shrubbery; and the houses ar&lt;&gt; all of one design and all in straight rows. In the coke regions the homes of the workers are frequently located in gaseous spots where they are enveloped in smoke much of the time and whore no vegetation can grow. The oft-repeated statement that the people that live in these homes do not mind it, do not want anything better, and would not know what to do with it if they had it, is all a plain old-fashioned falsehood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The Ignited States Steel Corporation is beginning to see the light, and will now build comfortable homes of any preferred design for any employe who will advance ten percent of the cost and pay the balance in ten years. This is a liberal and sensible arrangement. By the way, the housing situation is worse in Pittsburgh and Cleveland than it is in New York.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Akron reported that housing was needed for 25,000 people. Detroit is short 30,000 homes and is so crowded for hotel space that, at the request of hotel and business men of the city, the Northern Navigation Company sent its steamer N'oronic there to serve as a floating hotel. Detroit has under construction a $10.-000,000 hotel, containing 1.000 rooms on 23 floors. Flint, Michigan, wage earners have had their rents advanced forty percent. People are leaving the farms and crowding into the cities. Nine percent of the farms of Michigan were wholly idle in 1920. and there are 30,300 vacant farm houses in that state.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">Chicago and New York each have in contemplation new hotels, the expense of which will be $15,000,000 each. The one in Chicago is planned to front three city blocks on Lake Michigan. A leading hotel of that city, with all its rooms filled, recently lowered its rates, explaining to its patrons that it considered it was making too great a profit. Chicago takes . the prize for a high rent asked but not obtained. During the Republican national convention a wealthy home owner offered to rent-his honse to the National Committee for one week for the sum of twelve thousand dollars. Several hundred residents of Chicago are living in houseboats which, it is claimed, cost them about $1,000 apiece to build, contain five rooms and may be. moved anywhere on a moment’s notice.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">Of England’s male population, including the babies, one in every seven was in the battle line of the World War.

There is a shortage of 15,000 bricklayers. Conditions are such that, as a general rule, building is three times as expensive now as it was before the war. Houses that formerly cost $2,000 to build cannot now be erected for less than $6,000 and six-room cottages that formerly cost $1,200 now cost $4,000. .</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">* At the conclusion of the war the great financiers of the country who had accumulated untold billions of war profits engineered the greatest propaganda against foreigners ever witnessed in America. The purpose of this propaganda was to divert attention from themselves and prevent, prosecution for their thievery and knavery until it should be forgotten. The man with the wheelbarrow was denounced as a Bolshevist, a socialist, an anarchist and every other kind of ist. The result was that a vast number of honest, inpvt^it, industrious men were fright-■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ened out of their wits, and there followed a</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">! &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;great exodus to Europe of just the kind of labor</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">the United States needs. As the profiteer saw America swallow the bait, he smiled, raised the rent and smiled again. He could afford to smile and to lead in the cheering, and he did. The rest of us cheered feebly as we paid the higher rent: and if today we were asked why we cheered because the workers in the building material industries were being chased out of the country ' we could not tell. Yet if the newspapers started it up again we would doubtless “bite” as of A yore. Now another Wall Street propaganda is T seeking to get the European workers back.— jhus getting their steamer fares both ways.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In normal times the building material industry produces annually $3,000,(XX),000 in perma- ' nent taxable wealth and employs more than one-quarter of the railroad tonnage of the ceuntry. Now the estimated shortage of workers in all branches of the industry is about 4,000,000, and material is hard to obtain because the lumber ■ mills, glass mills, brick yards and cement plants - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>k</sup>-s</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">are running short-handed, or not at all. Not 3 all of these workers have been chased back to ’ _<sub>x </sub>Europe. Some have been drawn into the auto- ' mobile, industry, catering to the new disease which the British have named squandermania. ;</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Not only are the building material industries ' producing but 40 percent of their pre-war &lt;&nbsp;quota, but much of what they have been producing has been sold abroad for high prices, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">In the limestone industry for&quot; 1920 not more than sixty percent of normal was being pro- j duced. Steel had risen from $38 a ton to $110 a ton. Cement had risen from $1.95 a barrel p to $2.90. Sand that was 45 cents a cubic yard brought $1.90. Crushed stone and gravel that ’ sold for 85 cents per cubic yard brought $3.25. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;;</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Cement bags that used to cost $112 per thousand 1 cost $280. Laths were $13 a thousand; glass is practically out of the market. Spruce lumber soared from $40 to $75 per thousand. Oak-floor- ' ; ing went from $60 to $300 per thousand, and under-flooring from $20 to $60. Bath tubs that i were $14.50 sold for $40 and were not nearly ! as good; sinks that were $8 cost $28, and wash 1: basins that used to bring $7.50 were $25. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sub>;</sub></span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In British Columbia last year four plants f alone on the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway cut 154,000,000'feet of lumber and paid out $1,500,000 in wages. It thus appears that the labor cost in producing lumber is about $10 per M.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Transportation conditions have been very &quot;&nbsp;difficult and this has affected the building</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">material industry. The railroads have been congested, and there are almost no lumber schooners plying the Atlantic seaboard. The increase in freight rates has been another blow at the prospective home-builder because it has &lt;dded to material costs. And then, do you suppose the building material men overlooked their chance to gouge while everybody else was gouging! The profits of ten representative concerns for the years 1916-1918 were nearly three times as much as for the years 1912-1914. In the one case the average annual profits were $10,154,722, which would seem sufficient, but in the latter period they were $27,729,685. The investigations of the Department of Labor show that thirteen years elapsed before building material prices resumed the levels that prevailed prior </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">to</span><span class="font9"> the outbreak of the Civil War.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">New York has been greatly stirred up over the brick situation. The city is largely built of that material, made in yards along the Hudson Biver. These bricks used to bring $5.25 at the dock in New York, and now they bring $25. Delivered at the job site they now cost $31, and New Yorkers are trying to figure out why the same kind of brick is delivered at the job site in Chicago for $16.

Unless this is done the house will become danYpj^and even moldy. Houses not thus built are huntid in summer and cold in winter. Tin-reason for this is the condensation due to ence in temperature between the inside of the wall and the air within the room. The principle may be withered in noting that on the same day when ther.$ is condensation on the window panes of hen.-,i<sub>pr</sub>| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sub>s</sub>j<sub>n</sub>,,|p windows there</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">is no condensation on windows where storm windows are used.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Jn the past some concrete houses have been . poured and left in their natural state. This is very unsatisfactory. Seams show and are hard to remove, and the color is not attractive. All concrete houses should be stuccoed, preferably with three coats. Moreover, it is the opinio^ of the majority that to be attractive to its occupants, warm and cheerful in appearance, a -house should have wooden windows, door frames, &quot;&nbsp;' trimming, baseboards, floors and stairways.</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark48"><span class="font9">A great variety of methods of concrete con-.- truction is in use. We have mentioned the</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark49"><span class="font9">fourteen four-room houses built at Union, N. J,</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark50"><span class="font9">by Charles H. Ingersoll, using the plans and molds of Thomas A. Edison. These houses cost</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark51"><span class="font9">$2,200 each and rent for $23 per month. Some</span></a></p>
<p><span class="font9">of them were built and occupied in ten days.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The molds cost $7,000 and can be used for A •- &lt;&nbsp;hundred houses. After the molds are- erected the entire house is poured in a single day. This was permitted to harden for two days, after which the frame was removed. It takes longer to put the finishing touches on these buildings than it does to build them. When finished they • present a very pleasing appearance. Seventy-five houses, after the same plans, and by the same methods, some of four and some of six rooms each, were constructed at Phillipsburg^ N.J.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Another form of concrete construction is that . i’’. which forms are set up for a course a certain number of feet in height, and as soon as the concrete is set sufficiently to bear its own weight another course is poured. Another form is the building of concrete frames and the stretching of expanded metal on the outside, the nieshaB of which are filled with gunite.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In another system a steel stud is erected to which metal lathing is attached and the exterior wall is stuccoed on the outside and back-plastered on the inside so that the metal cannot rust. Subsequently the inner wall is erected and plastered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Many well-built old wooden buildings have b--m made over by concrete construction. Any s”.ch structures to which metal lathing is at-ta-'hed should be well braced. Otherwise cracks will develop due to the movement of the structure. If the metal fabric is not completely embedded in the cement the stucco is liable to break !&gt;;&gt;d|v.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">slabs, beams, girders, partitions and columns are made at the factory, conveyed to the building site and &quot;''ire assembled to form th? finished structure. Lite too's are either framed in timber and covered with tile or are made of concrete. As much as ninety percent of the building is 'made in molds and' afterward assembled on the foundation walls. Stair stringers are cast in place. Metal lathing is used, to provide airspace. In some instances the inside walls are heavily escalloped or channeled from top to bottom. Heavy building paper is drawn over these scallops, then metal lath and then plaster, to secure dead air space.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">At present there are four thousand plants in the United States working overtime trying to supply the demand for concrete block and tile. Concrete blocks are no longer built to mutate building stone. The present high cost of day brick has opened a wide field for concrete brick. Any face or texture can be produced, the same as in the clay brick. Structurally the bricks are stronger, and their absorption is less than clay brick. Co'‘?<sup>r</sup>cte tile will produce a concrete house as cheaply as any other method, and when treated with'stucco finish will give any desired architectural effect. In France the debris of former buildings is ground together and made into concrete for new buildings. By using ground stone and ground brick separately the builders have been able to produce colored panels in the walls.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Adolie, the, oldest of building materials, is again coming to the fore. Adobe, be it known, can lie made of the soil which a man digs out of the ground when he makes his cellar. It is simply wet soil, mixed with straw, kneaded by the hare feet, cast into molds and dried in the sun. It can be made by anybody and provid.es a building material which is everlasting, soundproof, fire-proof, and always of normal temperature. cool in summer and warm in winter. Of all the,building materials it is the least affected by changes of temperature. It will stand a compressive strain of 4-00 pounds to the square inch, and can be niade on the snot for half the cost of brick, tile, stone or concrete.</span></p>

It is proper to eliminate the jury fee; for as long as a trial by a judge is possible, no denial of justice can fairly be alleged.

Since our inquiry is only to determine the actual expense, all the various items may be rolled into one total.

<p><span class="font9">TheSe^ figures would be much higher, were it not for the advent of municipal courts, which have done much to reduce costs. In Cincinnati. Columbus and Dayton. for example, it is provided by the Court Act that costs, exclusive of witness fe£s, shall not exceed two dollars. While these actual expenses may seem small in substantial causes, they loom large in the troubles of the noor. Tn claims under $50, an immediate expenditure of four or five dollars may well be disproportionate: in any event it is often more than the needy litigant can afford, particularly where additional outlays for witnesses and attachments are necessary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Costs on Appeal. Costs paid to the court on appeal consist of the entry fee and the expense of making up and printing the record of the • case on appeal; or on exceptions, or on writ of error. Such costs in the aggregate are seldom less than $25 and often run to over $100. While appellate costs affect the poor only in a proportionately small number of cases, it is highly, desirable in the interests of justice, and for the sake of a well-rounded development of our common law, that it lie possible for poor persons to obtain decisions on questions of law which arise in their cases. The condition which has been too common under the compensation acts, of having cases appealed, briefed, and argued only by the insurer, the employ^ being Ttnable to meet the expense, is not heal th v. Onesided argument inevitably tends to produce </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">a ■ </span><span class="font9">one-sided construction of the law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">These expenses represent a waste and ar? unnecessary. With proper organization of courts they will automatically disappear. In * unified court, as in England, there is no entry • <sub>r </sub></span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">fee</span><span class="font9">; for the appeal is affected merely by transfer -from the trial to the appellate division. There is no necessity for printing of records, transcripts, bills of exceptions, certificates of evidence, and the like; for, since the appellate and trial tribunals are simply branches or divisions of one court, each judicially knows the records of the others, and uses all the orginal files, papers and documents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Witnesses. Briefs and Transcripts. Exnensea incurred in litigation for witness fees, briefs and transcripts of evidence, which counsel invariably needs for his own preparation, raise an entirely different problem. Their amount varies indefinitely according to the number of witnesses summoned, the complexity of the points to be argued. and the length of the trial. The peculiar difficulty which they present is • that they are not payments which the state-can waive. Persons who are compelled to leavw their work to testify in courts, printers and stenographers are unquestionable entitled to he paid. Such expenses cannot be scaled down, nor </span><span class="font9">can they be eliminated, by any reorganization of courts or procedure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">There is no solution except for the state to provide a fund to be disbursed by, and under the supervision of, its judicial department, or legal aid bureau. Such a proposition is not wholly without precedent. It is a general rule that the state will reimburse for expenses incurred in disbarment proceedings. In the municipal legal aid bureaus provision is made for the expenses incurred in the litigation of the bureau’s clients. The Duluth Legal Aid Bureau has expended out of the public treasury the following amounts: in 1914, $150: in 1915, $126.01; in 1916, $108.18. In Los Angeles the Public Defender is authorized to apply to the county treasury for litigation expenses, although he has never done so, fearing that such a course might be unconstitutional. The 1913 Bules of the English High Court of Judicature, in making provision for poor litigants, call for the defraying of their expenses by a Treasury grant. Mr. Taft, in speaking before the Virginia Bar Association in 1908, after arguing for “a mandatory reduction of court costs and fees”, said: “I believe that it is sufficiently in the interest of the public at large to promote equality between litigants, to take upon the government much more than has already been done, the burden of private litigation”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dexial of Justice Through Costs. Certain it is that until thorough-going changes are made, denial of justice to the poor because of inability to pay the required court costs and fees will continue. That the present system of costs works daily to close the doors of the courts to the poor is proved by ample evidence. In Boston the Legal Aid Society has kept precise figures since April 1, 1916. During the seventeen months ending August 31, 1917, there were 551 cases which could not be settled out of eoufb^nit which were meritorious and required court action: 386 were taken to court and won, 36 were taken and lost, and 129 could not be brought before the courts because of the client's inability to pay </span><span class="font8">the costs. Tn other words, the </span><span class="font9">fees requited ly the state caused a total failure of justice^to 23 percent of the persons who needed to invoke the aid of the machinery of justice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">How thn existing system of costs liternllv forbids resort to the courts by the poor is illustrated by the laws requiring security for costs. A plaintiff not only must pay the costs for summons, service, entry, trial, judgment • and the like, but in addition he must, on motion, furnish a bond to guarantee that the defendant, if successful, shall not be out of pocket. In the Connecticut law, for example, the bond is in the ' • sum of $15 in the City Court of Hartford, and $75 in the Superior Court. The defendant may bring such a motion on the ground that the plaintiff is a poor person. The net result is that a poor person who is unable to give or . secure such a bond may be thrown out of. Court altogether. In Campbell v. Chicago, etc. R. Coe, a defendant, moved that the plaintiff, a poor person, be required to furnish a bond. The judge .</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">continued the case for a week to give the plaintiff time to file such a bond and, on his inability to do so, dismissed the case. On appeal the court said: “We have no statute which permits a person to sue </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">in forma pauperis.</span><span class="font9"> It seems almost like a hardship that a poor person should not be able to litigate. But this is a matter for the legislature to regulate and not the justice.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Laws requiring security for costs, despite their patent harshness to the poor, have uni- ■ * formly been upheld. In striking contrast are the early English decisions which, perceiving the injustice of a rule of exclusion, and without hiding behind the absence of a legislative mandate, gave to the common law the proceeding </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">in forma pauperis.</span><span class="font9"> If, as excellent authority has stated, this -was done as “an indulgence arising out of the humanity of the judges'*, what can be said for our twentieth century judges who, acting in a democratic country, were not even willing to follow the fair provisions of the common law?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The result is no different from what it would be if our bills of rights read :“Every subject who can furnish a bond for $15 or $75 ought to obtain justice freely, completely, and without delay; to all others the courts are closed”. In a democratic government of laws &quot;where the state exists to guarantee through its administration of justice the security of fundamental rights, it is » a sad perversion for the state by its law to cut ; off any class of citizens from the protection of the courts. On the one hand, the state through its criminal statutes respecting breach of the peace and larceny forbids persons to redress their own wrongs or collect'thoir debts by selfhelp. and remits them to the courts; and on the other hand it imposes conditions as to the use of the courts which the poor cannot satisfy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">An epoch-making decision by the Supreme Court of California, rendered in 1917, lends judicial sanction to the ideas expressed in this chapter. The case is striking. It will be recalled that jury fees in California are $24 a day, to be paid in advance. A day laborer, the father of ten minor children all wholly dependent on him for support, desired to bring suit in the Superior Court for the wrongful killing of his daughter, and claimed his right to a jury trial. He filed an affidavit that he did not have more than $25, and asked leave to sue </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">in forma pauperis.</span><span class="font9"> There is a local statute permitting such a proceeding before a justice of the peace, but none making provision for suits in the courts of record. The Superior Court refused the application.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The attorney for the San Francisco Legal Aid Society intervened as </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">“amicus curiae’’,</span><span class="font9"> and the case Was appealed. The Supreme Court held that the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">in forma pauperis</span><span class="font9"> proceeding was a part of the English common law, which had become part of the American common law, and that the court had inherent power to grant leave to sue without costs so that justice might not be denied to the poor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Parts of this decision, which is the first ever to translate into action the fundamental constitutional principles of freedom and equality of justice, express the situation so clearly that it is difficult to understand why the majority of courts hav6 always been blind to it:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">&quot;Imperfect as wa- the ancient common law system, harsh' as it was in many of its methods and </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">measures, - . </span><span class="font8">it would .-trike one with surprise to l&gt;e credibly </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">informed. .« </span><span class="font8">that the common law courts of England shut their </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">doors </span><span class="font8">upon all poor suitors who could not pay </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">fees, until _ </span><span class="font8">Parliament came to their relief. Even </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">greater would </span><span class="font8">be the reproach to the system of jurisprudence </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">of ths ' </span><span class="font8">state of California if it could be truly declared </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">that ih </span><span class="font8">this twentieth century, by its codes and statutes, it </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">had </span><span class="font8">said the same thing.” . . . &quot;Again we say </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">that it </span><span class="font8">would bo an unmerited reproach cast upon the legiri- , lative branch of our state government to hold that </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">it . </span><span class="font8">. . designed to forbid such a poor suitor from </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">prom-</span><span class="font8">cuting his actions according to the laws of </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">the laafl ** </span><span class="font8">in a court of record, when rights might and could </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">be all</span><span class="font8">important and his recovery of the utmost </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">importance.?*</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Costs have their place as a deterrent; but they should serve to discourage, not all litig%-tion, blit false litigation, specious pleas, vexatious proceedings taken for delay, and to insure prompt compliance with court orders. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">The </span><span class="font9">system of costs in equity approaches this plan, and in England the use of costs for such purposes is established.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Costs, like delay, present in the main no fundamental or inherent difficulty. A reduction, of costs and provision for </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">in forma pauperif </span><span class="font9">proceedings can easily be effected.

Years later it also said: &quot;'Every possible presumption is in favor ■%of the validity of the statute and this continues until the contrary is shown beyond a rational doubt. One branch of the Government cannot encroach upon the domain of the other without danger. The safety of our Constitution depends in no small degree on the strict observance of ' this salutary rule.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Twenty years ago Congress passed an income tax law similar to laws which have been long in force in Europe, and five of the nine judges </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font9">the Supreme Court pronounced it unconstitutional. Then, by the usual slow and laborious process by which the common people accomplish their ends in the face of entrenched wealth and power, the Constitution itself was changed to make it constitutional, and another law was passed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The desire of the people was plainly evident in both instances; yet the value of the second law has been largely destroyed by another decision popularly known as the stock-dividend decision, which deprives the Government of $500,000,000 income annually, and returns that amount of income to the hands of the men whose incomes are already the greatest in the nation. The effect of this decision is that stock dividends are not counted as income, the trusts and the very wealthy are relieved of taxes to the amount stated, and the burden is thrown upon the moderately well-to-do. ■</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">This later income tax law decision was made by five out of the nine members, as in the case of the first decision. Four of the nine judges held that stock dividends are taxable. Hence we arrive at the point where the opinion of one man is sufficient to overthrow the decision of the national legislature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In'no other country can the judges declare laws to De unconstitutional which have been passed by a national legislature: and in assuming to have the final say in regard to all acts of the legislative branch of the government prerogatives hpve been assumed which were never committed to the Court either by the Constitution or by legislation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It would seem to us that if the courts can nullify laws passed in the interest of the public “Welfare, the people will thereby be taught that</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">the law' is a thing not to be respected and obeyed, but to be disesteemed and set aside. ' This would be a very effective training in anarchy—disrespect for law—if that is what dominant interests desired to teach American citizens just at this time. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Several remedies have been proposed to pro- ; , toct the people against these encroachments of -d America’s greatest and most respected tribunal. * It has been proposed that in cases where laws are declared unconstitutional the power shall »■_ vest in Congress to make them so by a two- -thirds vote over-riding the power of the Court.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It has also been proposed that since the Supreme Court is not a self-perpetuating body * its judges should hereafter be elected by direct vote of the people. But we eannot help wondering what would be the result if the Supreme Court should greet such legislation With five to four decisions that the proposed laws ehanging things are themselves unconstitutional.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Another recent decision of the Supreme Court which attracted considerable attention was the one that refused to dissolve the United States Steel Trust (recently so adversely reported on by the erstwhile Interchurch World Movement), j recognizing it as a good trust, not needing to be dissolved, as compared with the Standard Oil Company, which was found to be a bad trust worthy of dissolution. The decisions in each &quot;&nbsp;of these cases were rendered by a vote of four to three, two of the justices not voting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">This distinction between good trusts and had trusts was one which Congress considered at' the time the legislation was pending and which it refused absolutely to make. Here is a case, then, where a minority of the Court actually made the law of the land. A hill is pending in Congress forbidding decisions of this nature hereafter and requiring that at least six out of th*<sup>1</sup> nine judges must agree as to what constitutes the law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">We are not complaining that the Court did not dissolve the Steel Trust. When it dissolved the Standard Oil Company, that benevolent institution organized a dozen corporations, increased the capital stock of each, raised the | price <sub>(&gt;</sub>f oil, cut melons right and left, and the net result is that the holders of the stock are better off and the public is worse off than before the dissolution. Exactly the same thing happened after the railroad and the coal companies were pried apart by a similar decision.</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">D</span><span class="font9">ISCONTENT and dissatisfaction are growing among the farmers as never before; and there is a reason for it. The increased price ■ of farm products has not been proportional to the increased cost of production, and the farmer ‘ is awaking to the inequalities and injustice of our day. The youths and farm laborers are leaving the farms for the more attractive wages to be had in the cities; and this is true in spite of the fact that farm wages this year are 14 percent higher than they were in 1919, and in 1919 they were 80 percent higher than they were at the beginning of the war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decrease in immigration is one of the</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">leading causes of the shortage in labor. It is i estimated that approximately 4,000,000 foreign <sup>!</sup> wortanen were kept from coming to this country | on account of the war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It now-takes from 100 to 110 men to do the work 60 men used to do, because of the falling off in individual production. During 1919, employers : &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;spent $30,000,000 for “help wanted” advertise-</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">I ‘ meats. The increased cost of labor has resulted : &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in an enormous increase in the cost of every</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">thing the farmer buys. Thus, metal products I have increased 186 percent, clothing 243 percent, ;, lumber 197 percent and other commodities from i 100 percent to 300 percent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The farmers are inquiring into the reasons</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">। for the huge profits piled up by the large cor! porations. 'The earnings in many of these corporations exceed 100 percent and some exceed f &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1000 percent over all costs and taxes. The</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">* ous other instances like the above.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oil hasl advanced 650 percent since 1915, and</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">gasoline nil is over 30 cents. The sudden increase ia t’i&lt; price of gasoline </span><span class="font8">is in the face </span><span class="font9">\ of the fact that the profits of the big oil eom-panies already range from 133 percent to 2900</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">percent. Also, gasoline is now being extracted successfully and cheaply from natural gas without in any way interfering with the usefulness 1 of the gas. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The Standard Oil Company of Indiana has . made net profits of 467 percent in seven years 4 and its surplus last year was more than three times its outstanding capital stock. The Atlantic Refining Company has cleared over seven times its capital stock in six years, and has a surplus ' of over five million dollars now available for dividends. The farmer, as we stated above, is inquiring into these things and as to why sugar .J bought in Cuba at wholesale for 12 centahas . sold retail for 28 and 30 cents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Farmers in many sections rather than produce at a loss are letting large sections of land lie idle and are cultivating only what they and their families can attend to. We quote from a well known senator’s speech in the Senate: “Mr. President, unless substantial rewards are given for farm work a food shortage is inevitable—- . and it will not be long in coming’. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The reports of the Department of Agriculture ■ indicate that the average income of the Ameri- <sup>; </sup>can farmer is less than one-half of the average wage received by a carpenter, brick-layer, or_ any other organized city trade. These facts bring to mind a verse of Scripture that seems especially applicable today. After calling<sup>1</sup> our attention to the present day and its wonderful l eaping together of riches, and after stating that these things are about to bring a great time of trouble, the Apostle gives as the immediate cause of the trouble an unrest in the hitherto conservative class of society — the farmers. He seems to point out the condition of things precisely as can now be seen by all careful observers.—James 5:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Fraud has been practiced on this class of people by speculators and the moneyed interests, and the farmer has boon prevented from receiving a just price for the product of his labor. Farmers and all others would do well to </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">lift'd <sup>5 </sup></span><span class="font9">the Apostle James’ advice: &quot;Be patient,'tilt the presence of the Lord [who will adjust matters righteously]”. &quot;Vengeance is mine, I will repay, t’ , i &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hies..jng of the Golden Ago</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">will come shortly, and then labor will receive its just rewards.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">A Polar Paradise Coming:</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">W</span><span class="font9">ITH the exception of the southern-most part of South America and a few islands in the Southern Hemisphere, which were glaci-~ ated, all of the subsidence of glaciation (referred to in my article in your issue of May 12) has been confined to the Northern Hemisphere, the glaciation of the Antarctic Continent having remained as complete in area as at the time of the deluge, though the excessively low temperature there seems to have moderated. Glaciation at its maximum covered approximately 7,500,000 square miles in the Northern Hemi-1 sphere, but it has subsided and covers now approximately but 700,000 square miles, nine-tenths of the land area once covered by ice all the year around being now free from it; only one-fiftieth of the land area is now glaciated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The Noachic delnge was a phenomenal precipitation of snow, probably thousands of feet deep, all over the planet except in sections relatively near the equator, where the snow melted to rain before it reached the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The sudden overwhelming of animals which have been kept in cold storage in the glaciers and, in modern times, ejected at the moraines, \ having unmasticated herbage in their mouths, _ ’ demonstrates the accuracy of the foregoing conclusion. Of this deposit of snow on land north of the 42nd parallel in the Northern Hemisphere and also on land south of the 42nd parallel in the Southern Hemisphere, sufficient remained over one summer, and was augmented by other snows the following winter, to fix the i great Polar ice caps, reducing the temperature of the planet below normal. This process we f - &nbsp;&nbsp;■ see repeated in miniature after severe winters</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">with much precipitation of snow, there being some snow left in the ravines all summer, even in the temperate zone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">This deluge of snow, it is supposed, was <sup>1</sup> Caust^by the fall to the earth of a great ring of vapot that encompassed the planet, as we see now illustrated in the rings of the planet 1 Saturn. Recorded observations of Saturn indicate that the same creative process is going on there that, wept on at this planet. Each side <sub>(</sub> of the ring^s aixnit 25.000 miles in diameter.

<p><span class="font9">fell to it in the form of snow. Even altove the equator in summer, at a certain altitude, mercury registers zero all the time. The foregoing is mainly the theory of Prof. Vail, geologist and astronomer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Tee is a non-conductor of heat and of electromagnetic energy. The earth is a great electro- * -magnet. It not only absorbs and stores up heat -from the sun, but possesses heat of its own which holds the temperature, under the glaciers, ’ above the freezing point. Nearly half of the land in the Southern Hemisphere composes the Antarctic Continent directly about the South Pole and is constantly covered with glacial ice-It is so far from other lands that the heat of the sun can make no impression on it and the -warm currents from equatorial waters cool before reaching it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Conditions in the Northern Hemisphere are reversed, as nearly three-fourths of the land of the planet is located there (Cram’s Reference -Atlas) approximately 39,000,000 square miles, only 7,500,000 square miles of which (approximately) at the maximum of glaciation, were covered, or 20 percent. This area of glaciation ' has now been reduced to about 2 percent. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">To illustrate further what must Ite the still * more rapid subsidence of glaciation in the Northern Hemisphere we will say that the polar ice-caps may be compared to refrigerators. The. one at the South Pole is located where there is little surrounding heat. There is no land near it free from ice to absorb solar heat and radiate it to equalize the temperature and modify the extreme cold. The warm air currents and warm water currents from the tropics are cooled before reaching there. The ice in the ice-box remains in-tact, as when first put in at the time of the deluge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The refrigerator at the North Pole is situated where all the year around warm air is radiated from the large adjacent areas of land which have stored up solar heat—the direct heat of .*■ the sun. The internal heat of the earth, the cm rents of warm air over the land reaching the North Polar regions and the currents of warm water from the equator flowing along by the</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">th** ice in its ice-box. Already nine-tenths of the ice is gone. We all know that when nine-</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">tenths of the ice in a refrigerator is melted the remaining tenth goes quickly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The fact that Peary reached the North Pole, when for many years men equally as intrepid and resourceful had failed, shows that the temperature is moderating. In an attempt the same year to reach the South Pole, Scott lost his life and Amundsen failed by 111 miles to reach it. In 1917 he failed to secure even an anchorage | for his ship in Antarctic waters, so vast were the ice Hoes about the continent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Whatever the cause, there seems to be periodic oscillation in temperature and precipitation both of rain and snow. A period of alternating warm, dry seasons, gradually swings back to a period of cold, wet seasons, but each succeeding warm period the line of all-the-year-j round ice retreats further north than in the previous warm period, thus making ’ a new | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;record. For instance, it is reported that during</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">j &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the last .warm period the line of wheat pro-</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">i duction advanced north in Canada 800 miles. We may conclude that in the present period of cold seasons it swung back again nearly to where it was before.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The climate in the great Laurentian Basin , &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in Canada will soon be temperate all the way</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">f &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;up to the Arctic Ocean; and Canada, in the not</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">; • distant future is destined to be (after the ice 1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at the North Pole is gone) a paradise more</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">seems to most people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Prof. Geikie says in “The Great Ice Age”: * “The ice once removed from Greenland, the climate there will be as genial as in England”, where I have seen primroses blooming in the fields all winter, in the cool Midlands, in the same latitude as Prince Rupert, B. C.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The foregoing deductions harmonize with Biblical statements which are coming to be recognized as the base line, so to speak, from whidi, all doctrines in philosophy and physical scienclHnust be measured and tested. Kant, the 1 greatest philosopher of modern times, recog-! &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nized this fact; and Virchow, the father of</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">The Lord said to Job: “Canst thou bind the sweet influences of Pleiades!’’ (Job 38:31) “God j is Love.” Love is the essence of life, of all things the most powerful. May not divine . influence be more powerful than the attraction • of gravitation, attracting and controlling the * physical universe? What is attraction of gravitation? What is electro-magnetism? The Lord said to Job: “Out of whose womb came the ice?”. (Job 38:29) “Hast thou entered into the treas- . ures of the snow [all glacial ice is the productpf snow] ? or hast thou seen the treasures of thft hail, which I have reserved against the time jots trouble* against the day of battle and war!”—&lt; Job 38:22, 23. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;; • &gt;</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">May we not, in view of the unmistakable trend/ reasonably conclude that alone, through ther<sub>; </sub>action of normal physical conditions on thei planet, heretofore asserting themselves, withiiv 75 years or even less, the formation of glacial ice ami freezing temperature (which is plainly.; an abnormal condition on this planet) involving-. . fermentation (decay) null cease and the planet! will be completed—not unlikely the first to Jx*&gt; completed in the universe?

It will be an object lesson for the regenerated human race, of the old imperfect physical condition and worn out, social, political and religious civilization (wo rid) which has passed away. “Behold, I make all 'things new.”—Revelation 21:5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In the change from one age or condition to a succeeding age, while the line of demarcation is dear, the creative process seems to follow a lapping of the old with the new; and vthile this is noticeable more especially in physical conditions, in a less degree it applies to the social, political, economic and religious world, though the change in the latter at the time of the deluge, was relatively very abrupt and complete. Jesus, referring to the change now in progress, compared it for abruptness to the deluge. He probably referred, however, to the change in the social, political, economic and religious world.</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">A</span><span class="font9">N IRREGULAR lot is better for a home than a rectangular one. Raised ground, with slopes on all sides, is ideal. A frontage toward the east is desirable, giving the housewife a cool kitchen in the morning, when her heaviest work is in the rear of the house, and a cool porch in the afternoon, when she has her time for sewing. But houses exactly like one’s neighbors are objectionable for many reasons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Back stairs are much prized even in very moderate sized homes; but long experience has shown that the following features, once supposed to be very desirable, can be dispensed with and not be missed: fences, hedges, boundary lines, very large lawns or grounds, very high ceilings, small paneled windows, mantels, built-in sideboards, built-in ice boxes, laundry chutes and (hold your breath now) fireplaces. Nine feet is found a good height for ceilings, and stairs with wide treads and not over six-inch rise are appreciated more and more as the owners gsQw in years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Kitchens &quot;should have direct sunlight during some portion of the day. Furniture should not cover more than one-fourth of the floor space. Rooms should be adapted to both night and day use. FuiWtifre should not be too heavy to be readily nu^'ed. nor should it be weak and spindly. Chairs should not be too high, nor with deeply concaved backs unless yon are eager to become round-shouldered. Rocking chairs art nerve and strength wasters; if you are not nervous but wish to become so, do plenty of rocking. Carpets and rugs with designs of flowers and animals are not in good taste. Inlaid linoleum is the best floor covering for kitchen or bath room, and will last a lifetime.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">City fathers are beginning to take a real interest in city planning, but in this work America is a generation behind. Alameda, Palo Alto, Los Angeles, St Louis and New' York have adopted zoning ordinances stipulating the several sections that are hereafter to be used respectively for dwellings, flats, retail stores, wholesale houses and garages, warehouses and non-obnoxious factories, and obnoxious factories. By this arrangement land values are stablized, taxation is equalized, fire limits are rearranged and paving problems are simplified^</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A little while ago New York had an epidemic of cleaning the outside of her buildings, aud it must be said that when the buildings were newly cleaned they did present a very attractive appearance. But now comes along the Indiana Quarrymen’s Association with a protest and a warning, claiming that cleaning acids penetrate and disintegrate the stones, bleach them or turn them irregular in color, or streak them with spots, entirely changing the natural color and beauty of the stone and ruining the appearance of the building. They have denounced the sandblast method of cleaning because it opens the pores of the stone to an influx of dirt that cannot be removed, cuts down the sharpness of the arrises of moldings and tends to destroy the artistic value of the carvings generally. The Association recommends that only common soap and water, with a good fibre brush, should be used in the cleaning of buildings.</span></p>

This means that every nerve-cell will become weak, sluggish, and finally die. It is oxygen which gives the sparkling redness to the hlood. It is oxygen that supplies the body with warmth and energy. Oxygen makes it possible for food to be transformed into bone, muscle and tissue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Just ffs oxygen is the elixir of life, so carbon dioxide is the great enemy of life. Every act, every heart throb, means the burning of bodily cells. The resultant ashes is a deadly poison, the elimination of which is the basis of good health and a vigorous physique. We know it is the duty of the lungs to supply the blood with oxygen and to throw off from the body the carbon dioxide. Therefore the deep breathing of pure, fresh air is essential for the building of good health and strength.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Simple as the statement may seem, there are thousands </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">6f</span><span class="font9"> men and. women who are suffering from diseases directly contracted as a result of impure air and shallow breathing. Any intelligent person can readily acquire the habit of deep breathing; and by insisting on obtaining pure air under any and all conditions, when possible, he can improve his health, increase his strength and add many years to his life. There is hot the slightest doubt that the capacity and strength of the lungs can be developed as readily as a'n^muscle in the body; and certainly there are no muscles that can he developed and used with greater advantage to the individual.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The first point to hear in mind in regard to proper breathing is the necessity of breathing through Mie hose. Nature has so constructed man’s breathing apparatus that nasal breathing is essential to health. Parsing through the channels of the nose the air becomes equalized in temperature with the heat of the body, and</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">2?// </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Mrs. Andrew J.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">is moistened by the natural secreticn^ r fl:g nasal chamber when in a healthy condition. Moreover, any impure or foreign matter in the air we breathe is intercepted by the short-bristly hairs of the nostrils. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Some of the cardinal points to be observed in proper breathing are these: (1) Breathe pure- : fresh air only; (2) Breathe through the nostrils only; (3)Breathe deeply and fully. If a persbn breathes an average of tw’enty times a minute he would breathe 28,800 times every twenty-four-hours. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It has been demonstrated that fatigue and premature old age are largely due to &amp;&nbsp;lack of proper oxygenation in the body. In other words, fatigue is asphyxiation. If the tissues are not supplied with sufficient oxygen, they become poisoned and die. Deep breathing of pure, fresh air should be indulged in by all; for as “the blood is the life”, so oxygen is the life of the blood. An adult person breathes ‘ 2,600 gallons of air every twenty-four hours. After the air has been expelled from the lungs it is charged with carbon dioxide, due to the union of the oxygen in the blood with the waste carbon of the body. As has been said, this latter gas is of a poisonous nature, and acts on ♦ the human system very much like water upon a <sup>1 </sup>drowning person—it suffocates by reason of its density; for when taken into *!'e lungs, those organs have difficulty in throwing it off on account of its weight. ' &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It is estimated that in the Uni 'States there are 250,000 deaths a year from ancctions of the throat and lungs; and it must be conceded that impure vitiated air’is the principal cause of the greater proportion of those deaths. The evil of bad air belongs to the winter season, both because people stay indoors more than in warm weather and because indoor air is much worse in winter than in summer. After living all winter with closed doors and windows, and breathing superheated, devitalized air. the criminative effect on outraged throat and lungs reaches a climax, and death ensues.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The death rate from bad air diseases is highest during the month of March, the mortality from throat and lung diseases being twelve percent of the total for the whole year. In the month of September the total death rate is only five percent. Thus the death rate from lung and throat disease is more than double toward the end of winter what it is toward the end of s</span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">umm</span><span class="font9">er.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The essential of good health is pure, fresh air ^.nd plenty of it Go into the average home: and you fin'd the inmates languid, disinclined to exertion and “all tired out&quot;. The reason why this is so is that indoors we usually live in an atmosphere which lacks in life-giving oxygen and which is charged with carbon dioxide, a poisonous gas continually being thrown off by each member of the household, together with disease germs that are seeking lodgment in constitutions in which the power of resistance to their inroads has been reduced to a minimum.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The fresh air crusade against the White Plague is perhaps responsible for the reaction against the stupidity, the animality, of coddling. The doctrine of fresh air has received far too little attention from either the medical profession or the layman: but it promises to become more popular now since drugless healing and physical culture are coming to be better understood. But when a belief becomes as firmly rooted in the human mind as has the fallacy that cold air is inimical to health, both time and persistent reasoning are required to dislodge it. Cold weather ailments and diseases are only indirectly the result of the cold weather. Their prevalence during the winter season is largely due to our methods of housing ourselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">There are very few men and women who do not possess possibilities for better health and for the enjoyment of life which good health brings, if Only they would make a persistent effort to attain it. Determine that neither procrastination nor lack of application will in the future deter you from , the attainment of all that is wholesome and enjoyable as a result of the possession of good health. With ran- exceptions men and women are capable of developing infcK^trong manhood and womanhood if only they seek to learn the laws of health and to apply them daily. If you are in a w.-ak condition today because of la&lt;-k of will to develop into normal, vigorous, virile manhood, you are indeed in a’hadVway: tor a weak will usually accompanie.-na weak body. If yon seek health, strength and the happiness they bring, you must seek these hless’n &gt;’■ th ’ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">and the will to attain them: and as you know, xthere there is a will there is a way.</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">S</span><span class="font9">OMEONE advises, through The Golden Age, the use of acids for rheumatism. Experiences differ. Here is a person (myself), who, being of bilious temperament, felt the need of acids, and for years used them freely. At fifty I was exposed for a time to a damp atmosphere; and rheumatism developed, my habits of eating, etc., remaining unchanged. Removal from dampness failed to eradicate rheumatic symptoms, which spread and even threatened to become inflammatory. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">During the past few years articles on dietOtio subjects came into my possession; and among these I found the statement that the presence of acid in the blood will </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">cause</span><span class="font9"> rheumatism, also that nearly all meats (flesh of animals) contain more or less uric acid, which of itself will cause rheumatism and kindred diseases.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Appreciating this information, for over two years I have eliminated meat and acids from my diet, during which time rheumatic symptoms have entirely disappeared, leaving effect only in a sensitiveness to draughts in the muscles for- . merly affected. This effect is gradually decreasing, however.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In order to be able to enjoy the benefit of fresh fruits — strawberries, cranberries, pineapples. etc. — one must, while using these sparingly, at once counteract with fats—a piece of butter in one’s dish or pure cream or nuts. Substitutes for meat are eggs, nuts and milk— the last-named at meals where vegetables are not used. Inharmonious eating, which alone causes need for drugs, enemas, etc., creates acid in the stomach. This acid necessarily affects the blood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Most of us do not need an early morning ' meal, the night's rest sufficiently recuperating the body. Soon after rising, a glass of cool water, followed by a small se rvice of sweet fruit (softened over night in water, but not cooked), is very beneficial, if regularly used. A cup of rich milk, soon added. supplies strength.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">The literature sent out by &quot;The Society for Corrective Eating”, of New York City, is as helpful physically as The Golden Age is enlightening mentally and spiritually—with the marked exception that the former adulterates 5 its food with unscriptural, and therefore untrue, evolution ideas. Fortunately, however, one does not need to imbibe these ideas while profiting by the beneficial matter presented.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Color and the Messiah</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“TN HIM [Christ] all fulness dwells.” Since A Jesus, the Christed or Anointed, is “the express image of his [God's] person” it is but natural to expect that the same principles which work so harmoniously in the Father should also be found in the Son. But the word Messiah, or Christ, has a broader application than merely to the individual Jesus. It is used in the New Testament as applying to the Christ class, the glorified church, sharing with Jesus, under His headship, the glories and privileges of rule in Messiah’s kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">This Messiah class, during the thousand years of its reign, will fill a three-fold office of prophet, priest and king—successfully counteracting the baneful influences of the present triple alliance of the world, the flesh and the devil. As the prophet the Messiah will teach the people, as priest He will intercede for them, and as king He will rule them with unparalleled justice and power.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It is manifest that for the proper conducting of so grand an office as prophet for all mankind wisdom is a prime prerequisite. Furthermore, it requires superhuman wisdom to be able to discern with unerring perception what to teach, when fbs.teacli and how to teach it. To fulfil properly the office of priest will require oceans of love: for almost unbounded patience and benevolence will he necessary to deal with all the short&lt; omimrs of man. both willful and unintended. A ^erfVct king must be able to exercise both justie^and power. And the great Messiah king shall not fail; for “when thy judgments are in the earth, the inhabitants of the world will learn righteousness”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">'* It is singularly worthy of observation that</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">the divine wisdom of the divinely appointed , prophet is just what is needed to abrogate the claims which the present social system of the world makes on a human being. ’The world by ’’ [itsjwisdoiil has not known God,’ therefore, “the wisdom of their wise men shall perish, and the understanding of their prudent men shall fail”. Nothing but the fathomless billows of divine love can master the present partly depraved ' desires and penchants of the individual flesh; , and only the power and justice of the King of kings can deal adequately with Satan, the prince ' of the adversaries of God. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The Messiah class, Christ the head and the church, His body, is shown under another beautiful figure as consisting of the second Adam and a second Eve. The kingly and basic qualities of Jehovah’s character are justice and power (“righteousness is the establishment of his throne”) and the queenly crowning qualities are wisdom and love. Justice and power cooperating produce authority — neither can do it alone. Wisdom and love working together harmoniously produce splendor, even as orange' is the most splendid color. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;' &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p><img src="g_E_19201124_files/g_E_19201124-8.png" alt="" style="width:247pt;height:75pt;">
<p><span class="font9">If the crowning, queenly qualities seem to outshine the more sombre-hued kingly traits, and thus appear to bring more glory to the church than to her Lord, it must be rememliered that </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">she is His glory.</span><span class="font9"> “She is a crown of glory and a royal diadem in the hand of our God.” Furthermore if, even in her perfect state, she had the longing to bless and the wisdom to bless mankind she could not </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">do</span><span class="font9"> it without His power, for 'without him she can do nothing’—“He is the head over all things to the church, which is his body”. Nor can it be forgotten that that very desire to bless and that very knowledge of howto bless camo from Him; for He “of God is t made unto ns wisdom, righteousness, sanetifica- £ tion [the fruitage of love], and redemption”, | the trophy of power. Therefore, the church does j not outshine nor even equal the beauty of Him ! who is “fairer than the sons of men”. He, in j turn, is glorious because He is Jehovah's image, j</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">F</span><span class="font9">OR many centuries God dealt with the , nation of Israel to the exclusion of all other nations. The Scriptures declare that the Israel-F ites were a tyjiical people, and call their nation '] ''Israel after the flesh. It was typical of the j ecclesiastical systems of Christendom, Catholic and Protestant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">j . At the first advent of the Master the priestly ! class, the scribes and Pharisees, dominated the </span><span class="font2">j &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font9">religious thought of the people and controlled</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;them to a large degree. They had forsaken the</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">I teachings of the prophets of old and had drifted I away from the Lord, Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">j</span><span class="font9"> The counterpart of this is found today in Christendom—by which is meant all the nations •{ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of earth that claim to be Christian nations. At</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">&gt;• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the first advent of Jesus Jerusalem was the</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">d center of the religious world. The relationship ? Jerusalem then sustained to things religious is i like the relationship which Great Britain now 1 sustains to all Christendom. In fact, England 1 is the very center of Christendom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">■ In modern times, and during the second presence of our Lord, the clergy class, corresponding i </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">1</span><span class="font9"> to the priestly order above mentioned, have, as H a general rule, abandoned the teachings of Jesus and the apostles, as well as of the prophets, and have turned the minds of as many as they could influence away from the great divine truths. Among prominent ecclesiastics found in this class is Canon Barnes, who recently issued a statement denying the Bible account of the creation and fall of man and, of course, denying the great ransom sacrifice. He is a higher critic, an evolutionist: yet claims to be a minister of God’s Word. This bold declaration by Canon Barnes, supported by a large nurnlier of clergymen in London and other parts of Great Britain, has caused many honest-hearted ones of the various parishes to give serious; thought as to whether or not these men are any^ujQger safe leaders. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">This agitation came practically at the same time that a public lecture was advertised to be given in London by the writer, President of the International Bible Students Association, on the subject: ‘‘Mnlimls Now Living Will Never Die”. London newspapers took up the matter and discussed it at some length in comparison with the statement of Canon Barnes, all of which served to advertise the lecture. The Ib&gt;\ al Albert Hall </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">i &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">—the most magnificent public assembly hall in Great Britain, built by Queen Victoria as </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font9">memorial to her beloved husband—was die place, and Sunday evening, September 12, the time for this public lecture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">More than two hours prior to the beginning of the lecture great crowds of people began to assemble; and at the opening of the lecture it was reasonably estimated that there were fully 30,000 people who had come to hear, 13,000 of whom crowded into the hall, filling every available space, while many more remained in the streets, unable to gain admittance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">For nearly two hours the great audience inside listened with the keenest interest to the message, while the speaker explained in plain phrase, understandable by all, that the Bible is the only true source of knowledge concerning man's origin, course, and destiny; that the Bible account proves that God created the first man perfect; that man’s natural state is to live on the earth forever in happiness; that man sinned and lost his right to life; liberty, and happiness, as well as to the dominion of earth, and that the resultant condition of sorrow, suffering and death is an unnatural one; that God promised to redeem mankind from this condition of death ; ' that He sent to earth His beloved Son Jesus, who said: “I am come that they [the people] might have life and have it more abundantly”; and again: ‘‘The Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom”; that thereafter Jesus died upon the cross, was buried, and arose from the dead; and that the Scriptures emphatically declare His death and resurrection to be a guaranty that in due time every man shall have one fair and impartial opportunity to accept the terms offered by Messiah, and accepting, to be blessed with eternal life on the earth. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It was further shown that our Lord began </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">at </span><span class="font9">Pentecost the selection of His church, namely, His faithful followers; that this work will be completed at the setting tip of His kingdom; that the chosen ones will inherit the heavenly home, being changed in the first resurrection from human to spirit beings; that just prior to His crucifixion Jesus said to His followers that He would come again and receive these faithful ones unto Himself and that this would occur at the end of the world ; that this brought from the</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">‘ disciples the question: 'Master, tell ns what shall lie the proof of the end of the world, and of thy presence’: that lie answered that when that - time would come there should be a world war, nation rising against nation, accompanied by famine, pestilence and revolutions in various , parts of the earth, and that these things would mark the beginning of the end; that then there would be disturbed conditions of society, nations in distress, with perplexity, and men’s hearts failing them for fear. The speaker then declared that all these things have heen fulfilled or are now in course of fulfillment; that Jesus further stated that the return of the Jews to Palestine would be conclusive proof of the end of the world and His second presence, and that this is an accomplished fact; that the evidence shows the old world is ending and the new coming in; that all this trouble in the earth is for the very purpose of marking this time and humbling the hearts of the haughty, making them ready'to receive the new kingdom: that the Scriptures in many places declare that when the new order is established then will be the time for offering life, liberty and happiness to all the people. Tt was also demonstrated that this time is at hand, the Lord’s kingdom is now being _ established, and that a wonderful change in the affairs of men will be witnessed in the next few i years, as indeed it is even now seen to be in progress; that millions of people now living on this earth will never die. because restitution blessings will begin shortly; that after the peoples on the earth have had their opportunity, all the dead shall be resurrected and given an opportunity for life, for Jesus' death and resur-. rection were a guaranty that this shall be so, and He plainly stated: &quot;All that are in the graves shall hear [my] voice, . . . and shall come forth”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">This message of glad tidings was received with joy and approximately 3.500 handed in their names and addresses with the request that they he give'fkfurther opportunity to examine literature that would enable tle-m to acquire more knowledge upon this subject. Tt was &quot;ratifying indeed to mark in the great city of London— the very seat of the imatm of the beast. very headquarters ofc the higher critics and the evolutionist ca^te, the clergy—how the common people came and gladly heard the message of Messiah’s kingdom. Many remarked that never had they known of such a meeting in London.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Only three more places remained to be’ visited before the conclusion of the British lecture tour; viz., Leicester, Manchester and Bristol. In all of these places the largest halls were obtained and they were inadequate to accommodate the thousands who came to hear the glad tidings that millions now living will never die. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;’ &nbsp;&nbsp;_</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">BristoDmarked the end of the tour. This is one of the most ancient cities in Great Britain. It was built by the Ctesars and a portion of the old Roman Avail still stands. It holds much of interest to Americans, because it was the home of the Cabots. Ont of the Bristol channel the Cabots sailed on their voyage of American discovery. These men were enterprising and desirous of aiding humanity by finding other places of habitation. They, together with others, discovered the mainland of America, and without doubt God’s hand was in the discovery and establishment of that nation as an asylum of religious liberty. Seemingly the prophet speaks of it when he says: “Ho to the land shadowed with wings, which is beyond the rivers of Ethiopia, that sendeth forth ambassadors by the sea, even vessels of bulrushes”. It pleased the Lord to bring to America peoples of all nations, kindreds and tongues, and to give them a large measure of the religious freedom whieh for many centuries they had sought; and in this land has been conducted the greater portion </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">of </span><span class="font9">the work of His harvest in gathering unto Himself those who shall constitute the latter members of His body. From this land, above all others, the Lord has sent forth a great amount of printed literature—Studies ix the Scriptures, books, pamphlets, magazines, papers, etc.—teaching the message of His second coming and the establishment of His kingdom; and in this favored land came the greatest persecution in modern times upon His humble followers, who attempted to teach the truth, just as it should be expected and as He foretold.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Before the passing of many more years the Cabots and other discoverers of America will lie back on earth: and then they will rejoice that they had a part in locating the favored land; but they will rejoice still more when they learn that an opportunity will be given them to live on the earth forever in a state of happiness, provided they are obedient to the divine laws.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The prophet Daniel (12:1-4), speaking of the time of the end in which we are now living,</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">' ‘ said: &quot;Many shall run to and fro,and knowledge shall be increased&quot;. There has been a marvelous increase of knowledge in recent years along various lines. There has been a running to and fro such as men who lived a century ago never dreamed would come. The Lord foreknew it i &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;would come, however, and caused His holy men</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">] of old to make a record of such coming time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Among the many means of transportation— ; running to and fro—is the teroplane. Even a quarter of a century ago few believed that such a. thing would be possible, that a ship could overcome the laws of gravitation and fly through the air. Possibly the prophet of God had in mind these vessels that traverse the air when he wrote: “Who are these that fly as a cloud and as doves to their windows ?”—Isaiah 60:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The writer and Mr. G. C. Driscoll, director of the moving picture enterprise heretofore mentioned, departed from London on September ! &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;18, sailing by air to Paris and landing there</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">safely after being in the air four hours and 1 &gt;■ forty minutes. Since the time of the French ■ Revolution Paris has not been much given to things religious. The great World War, however, seems to have softened the hearts of many and directed their minds toward more serious £ matters. Sunday evening, September 19, a { large audience of Parisians heard for the first time the heart-cheering message, abundantly supported by Scriptural proof: “Millions Now Living Will Never Die”. The keenest interest t was manifested by those present, approximately । one-third of 'whom signified their desire for further information on the subject by writing their names and addresses on cards and handing ■ „ them in at the conclusion of the lecture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Much wickedness has been done heretofore in j Paris, as in other parts of the world, in the name of religion. It was the Queen, Catherine de Medici, who stood in the window of the royal palace at night and gave the signal for the I beginning of the slaughter of sixty thousand : &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Christiift^ which continued until the River</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Seine ran with human blood. God's prophet ' speaks of those who will be resurrected during the reign of Christ, thus: &quot;Many of them that <sub>(</sub> sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlastinglitX and some to shame and lasting contempt”. \$dien such por-ams as Catherine do Medici and Noro, and those who have deliberately repudiated God’s Word and done violence thereto by their teaching, are awakened out of death and the people learn what they have done J in the name of religion, they will not be so popular. However, the Lord, in the exercise of His j loving-kindness, will minister blessings-in due <sup>; </sup>time even’ to the wicked who fully repent and turn from their wickedness, and particularly to those who have done evil in ignorance. Of such the prophet says: ‘&quot;When the wicked man •' turneth away from his wickedness that he hath committed, and doeth that which is lawful and right, he shall save his soul alive. Because he considereth, and turneth away from all his -transgressions that he hath committed, he shall surely live, he shall not die.”—Ezekiel 18:27; 28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">On’ Tuesday, Septeml&gt;er 21, our party boarded the Simplon-Orient Express, which is reputed to l&gt;e the best train in Europe, from Paris-to Athens. In America it would not lie regarded as a particularly desirable train, but in view of the great World War and the havoc it has wrought in European lands, we think that the company does well to operate such a train across the continent now. Next morning we awakened amid the beautiful scenery of Switzerland, along the banks of Lake Geneva and amid the glorious Alps.

<p><span class="font9">The border between Switzerland and Italy on &gt;* this line is passed in the Simplon Tunnel, one of-the great triumphs of engineering. It is the ** longest tunnel in the world, being 12 miles, 537 yards from end to end. For fifty years engineers speculated on the possibility of such an undertaking. The work was begun in 1898 and finished in 1906, at a cost of approximately $15,-000.000. At one point in the tunnel there are 7.000 feet of mountain overhead. Great difficulties were encountered in the construction of this tunnel, such as hot springs; and sometimes the heat reached 127 degrees Fahrenheit aud it was necessary to pump fresh air info the great chamber constantly. Forty lives were lost during its construction. As w passed through it we thought how greatly Napoleon would have desir' d this tunnel in his day. wbmi his brave general. Macdonald, led the hosts r&gt;f France across the dangerous Alps, ini).criling the lives of many by the snow, the extreme cold, and the t rojiiendous avalanches.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Many may ask why such tunnels were not &lt;&nbsp;imstructed earlier, 'flic answer is found in the nurds &gt;&gt;f the prophet. It was not God’s due tune until the time of the end.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Emerging from this tunnel, one enters upon the beautiful scenery of northern Italy. The mountains have a charm and beauty beyond description, as have also the lakes, particularly the Lago Maggiore, whose shores are dotted with many small towns and beautiful residences, </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">an </span><span class="font9">of Which bespeak the glory of the earth that will be man’s portion at the end of the Millennial reign of Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Our journey was interrupted at Venice on Wednesday evening, due to the destruction of railway bridges by heavy rains. This afforded time for an inspection of that ancient and at one time very important city. A few centuries ago Venice was the gateway for the commerce ofiall central Europe, particularly to and from the Near East. It was here that the merchants of earth congregated and many money lenders plied their vocation of collecting usury. The Rialto bridge, made famous by Shakespeare’s “The Merchant of Venice”, still stands. This structure once afforded a meeting place for merchant princes to discuss the business of the world. In those days Venice was among the most important of seaports. Its harbor was constantly alive with merchant ships, as well as passenger vessels. It is still a unique city, in that its streets are chiefly waterways or canals. Means of transit is by boat or gondola, a canoeshaped vessel manned usually by two oarsmen (one in front and the other in the rear), who cause it to glide rapidly through the streets, to the pleasure of the passenger. No traffic officers are required in these streets, and dust and noise are conspicuous by their absence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">While Venice is still a city beautiful and far famed for its fine arts, its glory and importance as </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font9">commercial center have passed away. We were required to take ship from this point to Trieste, where we spent a day very pleasantly and profitably. Trieste was built and fortified by the Austrians, and a substantial city it is. It is eaSk: seen why the Italians greatly desired this port; for it really stands as the gateway to commerce upon the Adriatic Sea. It was a bone of contention during the recent World War and bids fair s^ill to produce controversy between some of the nations; but wo are glad to know that soon Messiah’s kingdom will be in full control, and then the naSo&gt; &lt;&nbsp;will beat their instruments of warfare into implements of industry. They shall not lift up a sword against</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark89"><span class="font9">each other; neither shall they learn war any* more.—Isaiah 2:2-4; Micah 4:1-4.</span></a></p>

<p><span class="font9">Through old Servia there are many marks of • the war.

<p><span class="font9">It.is quite apparent that there is a food short- ; age in Servia. It is difficult for one to see howjj these people sustain Efe on the visible focd r supply. Their clothing also indicates that theji ? are very poor. The men wear parts of different!;, -array uniforms; and the many tatters,ragsa,nd<sub>t</sub>f’ patches bespeak a condition of want. The great-r ; Master’s prophecy concerning the end of </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">T </span><span class="font9">world has surely been fulfilled in thisoountry,^ as evidenced by the war and the famine oo£$r.<sub>M</sub>-tion of the people.

<p><span class="font9">There is really no complete and authentic ; history of the Serbs written; but it is said ef j these people that if one desires to know their history he has but to get a complete translation^ of their songs. They love to congregate at ev$ii-r, 4 ing and sing their patriotic songs. They are people who love their homes and country, and from their temperament they seem to deSerrib better things than they have. Doubtless when Messiah’s kingdom is in full operation and thb_ blessings of life, liberty and happiness offered to them, they will readily grasp tM' , opportunity and advance rapidly over the hi£h-,' way of holiness hack to perfection of body, mind ’ and character.</span></p>

They were, in the main, men notable for fidelity to the Lord; and this history as - impartially records and reproves their weaknesses and shortcomings as it commends their - virtues, and faithfulness. This must astonish . .those who presume the Bible to be a manu-factored history, designed to awe men into f ' reverence of a religious system.

<p><span class="font9">, stamps it as truth. Knaves, desirous of repre-j &nbsp;&nbsp;senting a man as great, and especially if</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">The.first five books of the New Testament and ' several of the Old Testament are narratives or histories of facts known to the writers and * vouched for by their characters.' It is manifest'' to all that it did not require a special revelatioif ' simply to tell the truth with reference to matters, <sub>f </sub>with which they were intimately and fnfly acquainted. Yet, since God desired to make it&quot; revelation to men, the fact that these histories' of passing events have a bearing On that revelation would be a sufficient ground to make* the inference a reasonable one, that God wdultf^ supervise, and so arrange, that the honest<sup>1 </sup>writer whom He selected for the work should be brought in contact with the needful facta The credibility of these historic portions of the-*: Bible rests almost entirely upon the characters and motives of their writers. Good men will not utter falsehoods. A pure fountain will not give forth bitter waters.

<p><span class="font9">It in no way invalidates the truthfulness of certain books of the Bible, such as Kings, Chronicles, Judges, etc., when we say that they ,, are simply truthfully, carefully kept histories of pro</span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">min</span><span class="font9">ent events and persons of their times. When it is remembered that the Hebrew Scrip* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'tunes contain history, as well as the law and</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">&gt; the prophecies, and that their histories, genealogies, etc., were the more explicit in detailing circumstances because of the expectancy that the promised Messiah would come in a particular line from Abraham, we see a reason for the recording of certain facts of history considered indelicate in the light of this twentieth century.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">For instance, a clear record of the origin of the nations of the Moabites and of the Ammonites, and of their relationship to Abraham and the Israelites, was probably the necessity in the . historian’s mind for a full history of their nativity. .(Genesis 19:36-38) Likewise, a very detailed account of Judah’s children is given, of whom came David, the king, through whom the genealogy of Mary, Jesus’ mother, as well - - as that of Joseph, her husband (Luke 3:23, 31, 33, 34; Matthew 1:2-16), is traced back to Abra-_ ■ </span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">limn</span><span class="font9">- । Doubtless the necessity thoroughly to establish the pedigree was the more important, v since of this tribe (Genesis 49:10) was to come ] the ruling king of Israel, as w’ell as the promised .

<p><span class="font9">There may be similar or different reasons for * other historic* facts recorded in the Bible, of which by and by we may see the utility, which, , were it not a history, but simply a treatise on morals, mijrht without detriment be omitted; though no one van reasonably say that the Bible anywhere countenances impurity. It is well, .furthermore, to remember that the same facts fffay be more or less delicately stated in any lammace; and that while the translators of the Bible were, l ightly, too conscientious to ’ omit any of the record, yet they lived in a day less particular in the choice of refined expres-<sub>/</sub>xStons than ourl: and the same may be surmised , of ihe ear!V Bible times and habits of expres-<sup>1</sup> spjA.

<p><span class="font9">The first five books of the Bible are known -as the Five Books of Moses, though they nowhere mention his name as their author. That they were written by Moses, or under his super- <sup>v </sup>vision, is a reasonable inference; the account of ■ his death and burial being properly added by his secretary. The omission of the positive state- &lt;&nbsp;ilient that these books were written by h</span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">im</span><span class="font9"> is no proof against the thought; for had another -written them to deceive and commit a fraud, he tfould surely have claimed that they were written by the great leader and statesman of Israel,’in order to make good his imposition*— See Deuteronomy 31:9-27. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Of one thing we are certain, Moses did lead out of Egypt the Hebrew nation. He did organize them as a nation under the laws set forth in these books.; and the Hebrew nation, by common consent, for over three thousand ■ years, has claimed these books as a </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">gifts to’ </span><span class="font9">them from Moses, and has held them so sacked, that a jot or tittle must not.be altered—thus giving assurance of the purity of the text.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">”»3. </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">How does the Genesis account of Creation </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;">whs* </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">pare with accounts of creation by nations of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">our day, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">and what is the reasonable conclusion respecting </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Moses * </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">as its author? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font9">These writings of Moses contain the oply credible history extant of the epoch whidlr it <sub>; </sub>traverses. Chinese history affects to begin)at creation, telling how God went out on the water in a skiff, and taking in His hand a lump;of earth, cast it into the water, That lump of earth, . it claims, became this world, etc. But the entire story is so devoid of reason that the merest child of intelligence would not be deceived by it. On the contrary, the account given in Genesis . starts with the reasonable assumption that </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font9">God. a Creator, an intelligent First Cause, already existed.

<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">* mized by Jesus?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">H The Decalogue is a brief synopsis of the •whole law.

<p><span class="font9">i Tin- gOAVrn&amp;eiit instituted by Moses differed j from all others, ancient and modern, in that it s claimed to be that of tin* Creator Himself, and ’ the people were held accountable to TT'm: their ! laws and institutions, civil and religious, claimed to emanate from God, and, as we shall presently see, were in perfect harmony with what reason teaches us to lie God’s character. The Tabernacle, in the center of the camp, had in its \Most Holy” apartment a manifestation of Jehovah’s presence as their King, whence by supernatural means they received instruction for the proper administration of their affairs as </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font9">nation. An order of priests was established^ which had complete charge of the Tabernacle, and through them alone access and communion with Jehovah was permitted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The first thought of some in this connection would perhaps be,&quot;Ah! there we have the object of their organization; with them, as with other nations, the priests ruled the people, imposing upon their credulity and exciting their fears lor their own honor and profit”. But hold, friend; let us not too hastily assume anything* Where there is such good opportunity for testing this matter by the facts, it would not lie. reasonable to jump to conclusions without the facts. The unanswerable evidences are contrary to- such suppositions. The rights and the privileges of the priests were limited; they were given no civil power whatever, and wholly lacked opportunity for using their office to impose upon the rights or consciences of the people; and this arrangement was made by Afoses, a member of the priestly line.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">As God’s representative in bringing Israel out of Egyptian bondage, the force of circumstances had centralized the government in his hand, and made the meek Moses an autocrat in power and authority, though from the meekness of his disposition he was in fact the overworked .-errant of the people, whose very life was being exhausted by the onerous cares of his position. At-this juncture a civil government was established, which was virtually a democracy. Let us not be misunderstood; regarded as unbelievers would esteem it. Israel’s government was a democracy, but regarded in the light of its own claims, it was a theocracy, </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">1. e..</span><span class="font9"> a divine government : t&lt;&gt;r the laws given by God, through Moses, permitted of no amendments; they must neither add to nor take from tlieir code of laws. Thus set'n. Israel’s government was different from any other civil government, either before or &gt;ince.—Xum. 16,17. 24-30; Deut. 1:15.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">AU grim and soiled and brown with tan, I saw a Strong One, In his wrath. Smiting the godless shrines of man Along/his path.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Wealth shook within his gilded home With strange alarm.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Fraud from his secret chambers fled Before the sunlight bursting in;</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Sloth drew her pillow o'er her head To drown the din.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">“Spare.&quot; Art implored, ‘‘yon holy pile;</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Twas but the ruin of the bad—</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“The Finished Mystery:**</span><span class="font9"> Nearly everyone knows something about this famous work which explains every verse of the Bible prophecies of Revelation and Ezekiel and which throws a. flood of light upon the conditions now prevalent in the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">This book was made doubly famous by the fact that its publishers, seven Christian men, were each sentenced to eighty years imprisonment under the so-called Espionage Act. Later they were released, their judgments being reversed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It was not the object of this work to interfere with the Government; for it was written before this country entered the war. Its object was and is to explain prophecies which bear on the troublous affairs of this present hour.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">“Millions Now Living Will Never Die:**</span><span class="font8"> This is the marrow of the message of hope now due to a war-weary and revolution-racked world. Everlasting human life on a perfect earth!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">A most serious proclamation built on Bible facts, as abundantly set forth on the paces of this remarkable little work: showing that we are even now living in the end of the ace. and in the ‘’time of trouble, such as was not since there was a nation.&quot; spoken of by Jesus In his great prophecy of Matthew 24. There the Master said: “If those days were not shortened, there would be no flesh saved&quot;—implying that some would live through the trouble aTtd never die.</span></p>

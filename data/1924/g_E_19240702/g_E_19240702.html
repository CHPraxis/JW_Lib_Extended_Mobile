<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">HE </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Literary Digest</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> notes in the Brawley, California, </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">News</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> an article in which the editor of the </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">News</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> comments on the effort made bv automobilists to avoid license plates in which the number thirteen or any combination of that number appears. It quotes the </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">News</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> as saying:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“There must be something wrong with our churches, schools, scientific institutions, and educational authorities. After two thousand years of Christianity, after five hundred years of modern civilization, and after one hundred years of scientific achievement, it still appears that in America we have a large class who at heart an pagans, believing in spooks, incantations, magic numbers, signs, and witchcraft Fear ia the basis of this pagan worship. Fear ia the cune of mankind, and a drag on civilization.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Digest</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> was right in drawing attention to this editorial in the Brawley </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">News.</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> Fear </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">is</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> a curse on mankind; it </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">is</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> a drag on civilization. But this curse and drag could be at once removed if those who can, and should and do, know the meanings of the words </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">sheol, hades </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">gehenna,</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> and who know full well that these words do not in the remotest sense of the word signify torment of any kind, even temporarily, to anybody, would abandon their &quot;professional ethics” and tell the people the truth. Nothing could be more wholesome; nothing could be more helpful to mankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The 500 Methodist &quot;young men and women, representing 110,000 Methodist students in colleges and universities, who met at Louisville, April 18, 19 and 20, disturbed things in the M. E. Church greatly by their demands for continuous employment for labor, and for a constitutional amendment prohibiting child labor, by their protest against the use of injunctions in industrial disputes, by their demand for public control of public utilities, and by their demand that the Methodist Church should henceforth be a Christian church to the extent that it should never bless or sanction another war, and should at once abolish military training in its colleges and universities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">A Lithuanian gentleman by the name of Li-towsky is in America, giving exhibitions of his skill in remembering numbers. His explanation is that he associates the numbers with the colors of the spectrum. This is the key to the success of every mnemonic system, but there are people who are naturally gifted with most extraordinary mnemonic powers. The historian Macaulay uould read a poem once and for a long tima afterward repeat it verbatim; while the Italian Hbrarian, Magliabecchi, literally never forgot anything. He could read a book at any time, and afterward repeat the contents of the book word by word, from beginning to end, without a mistake; During the Middle Ages it was claimed that in one of the Central European countries there were four thousand men who could repeat the entire Bible by rote, without an error.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">An investigation by the Save a Life League of New York city shows that between 15,000 and 16,000 persons committed suicide in the United States during the last year, 2,000 of whom were disabled soldiers, left in sickness and poverty because of the wholesale graft in the Veterans Bureau.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Business-Finance—Transportation</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">B</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">USINESS is beginning to fall off in the United States, as is usual during the year of a presidential election. In the month of April, 60,000 men lost their jobs; and, as is always the case under such conditions, wages began to fall. The total decrease in payrolls for the month amounted to about $2,000,000. These figures are based upon a survey of 8,242 establishments.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">mi</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Profits in copper are large. The Anaconda Copper Company made a net profit last year of nearly $9,000,000 after all expenses were paid. The profits of the Southern Pacific Railroad for last year were more than $44,000,000. The profits of the International Harvester Company for 1923 were over $10,000,000, The net profit of the steel trust for the first quarter of 1924 was more than $50,000,000. The profits of the Timkin Roller Bearing Company for the first quarter of 1924 were about $2,000,000; and of the Underwood Tvpewriter Company, about $1,000,000. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;’</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">A novel experience is reported from Springfield, Missouri. On Saturday, May 10, there was a run on the Union National Bank of that city. The cashier telegraphed to St Louis and Kansas City for help. Kansas City responded by~ $100,000 cash, hastily collected on Saturday afternoon, not a very good time to obtain money; while St. Louis did the phenomenal thing of collecting $400,000, and sending it by aeroplane, surely a new way of delivering money.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">, The greatly increased use of automobiles in the United States, an increase estimated at five million </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">machin</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">e in 1924 over 1923, has created such a demand for gasoline that oil profits, very small a year ago, have now jumped again to large figures. The Standard Oil Company of Indiana reports $41,000,000 profit for the first quarter of 1924, after all charges were paid.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">An indication of the growth of automobile traffic in New York city is provided in the fact that in 1916 there were in the entire city about forty-five persons per motor vehicle, while at present there are about fifteen. In other words, there are about three times as many machines in the streets now aa there were seven years ago. Those who have been studying the problem estimate that in another seven years there will be in New York city about eight persons per motor vehicle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">H S. </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Postal Service</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19240702_files/g_E_19240702-2.png" alt="" style="width:15pt;height:18pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">VERY year the postal service delivers on an average 112 letters to every man, woman and child in the United States, and over 100 newspapers, parcels or other articles. Every hour of every day in the year, 1,400,000 letters are dropped into the letter boxes. To handle this work requires a total of about 351,000 employes. One-half of all the farmers in the country get their mail by rural free delivery. During the year 1923, 65,000,000 letters were carried by aeroplane. There are over 5,000 postal cars in the American mail service. In 1857 it cost $2.04 to send a letter to Australia; today it costs five cents, and a letter may be sent to New Zealand or to the Philippines for only two cents. The post offices in the United States uso 70,000 quarts of ink annually, and half as many quarts of mucilage. Six million yards of canvas are used annually to make the new mailsacks required.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Agricultural Notes</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">M</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">AY 10th is supposed to be the day for planting gardens throughout the North. It is safe to say that there were no gardens planted in the vicinity of Duluth, Minnesota, on that date; for only two days previous the streets and sidewalks of that city were covered with slush, and the air was filled with snowflakes. At the same time thirteen ships were jammed in the ice in the harbor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">We are very sorry for the people of California, where the epidemic of foot-and-mouth disease is raging among the cattle and sheep of Los Angeles County. Human beings are not very apt to contract the disease, although it is quite common among children. The disease is seldom fatal Milk from infected cattle is rendered safe for use only by boiling or pasteurization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Dr. Richard T. Ely, Director of the Institute for Research in Land Economies and Public Utility, has pointed out that in Chester County, Pennsylvania, taxes are now absorbing sixty-six percent of the net rent of all farms which are rented for cash. This is taken to mean that unless something comes soon to help the farmer, the Government, by taking the entire income of the land, will have taken the value of the land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">A woman in Madison, New Jersey, in answer to an advertisement undertook to raise rabbits for their fur and for food purposes. She started with six rabbits, and at the end of a year had nine hundred. But parties who had agreed to buy the fur and the rabbit carcases at seven dollars each, failed to keep their promise; and she went into bankruptcy, the rabbits in the meantime having destroyed every living thing on her farm.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Cana&lt;</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">C</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">ANADA is noir to have some excitement similar to the entertainment we have been having at Washington. Senator J. D. Taylor, of Vancouver, British Columbia, has accused the Canadian Government of using its merchant marine on the Pacific Coast for smuggling liquor into the United States. He charges also that Government officials in Vancouver have conspired together to defraud marine insurance companies, that they are reeking with graft, that dishonest employes are promoted, that honest employes are dismissed, and that every attempt at an investigation has been thwarted by the activities of officials higher up. The Prime Minister of Newfoundland is also involved in liquor graft scandals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Argentina</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">HE curious news comes from Argentina that the Argentine Government has been so dictatorial toward the Vatican that the Vatican desires a separation of church and state, which Argentina is not willing to grant. This is the exact opposite of the situation in Portugal some years ago, where the Pope then upon the throne made the most strenuous objections to the proposed separation of church and state in that country. It is well known that in </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">Am</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">erica the Vatican seeks, and desires and would heartily welcome, as much union of church and state as it can obtain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The students in Argentina universities have banded together, and succeeded in obtaining the dismissal of all professors who seem to them to be reactionary, out of touch with the spirit of the times.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Great Britain</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">HE following is from the pen of Ramsay MacDonald, Prime Minister of Great Britain, written on December 15, 1915:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;When war breaks out, Christianity is defeated; but that is no justification for its surrender and its joining the enemy. The temper of hate and lying which rises during war, and which hands over the war spirit u an inheritance to peace, has been only rarely checked from Christian pulpits and in Christian literature; the duty of rational thoughtfulness and reflection upon the errors which brought war, and the wisdom which will avert it, has been the message of secular rather than religious * bodies; the guardianship of honest inquiry and speech, which its own history has handed over to the Christian community, has been vindicated not by it but by those opposing. It is that neglect which marks the failure of the church today, and makes the songs of Christmas time a Cain's sacrifice.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Prime Minister MacDonald has done the courageous and manly thing to urge the world, or at least that portion of the world involved —Germany, France, Great Britain, Italy, and Belgium— to adopt the Dawes report complete and put it into operation immediately. Mr. MacDonald made this proposition within twenty-four hours after studying the report</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Britain has once more decided against a protective tariff, this time by a vote of 317 to 252.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">An attempt in the British House of Commons to nationalize the coal mines has been defeated by a vote of 264 to 168.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The English King has signed the agreement for a treaty establishing a twelve-mile limit within which liquor-laden vessels approach the American cdast at their own risk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Reports from London are that the British Government has almost decided upon the construction of a tunnel under the English Channel in order to relieve the unemployment situation. The plan is that the British build half the tunnel, and the French the other half. A French company is ready to begin work as soon as it is certain that the British Government will approve the undertaking. It is proposed to have in the center a chamber which can be flooded by either side in case of an emergency.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">It is estimated that the Dover-to-Calais tunnel could be completed in about six years. The channel rock is of soft chalk. The estimated cost is $300,000,000. When the tunnel is completed, only six hours will be required to go from London to Paris by tr</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">ain-</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Hebrides</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">W</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">E HAVE previously called attention to the deplorable condition of the 45,000 people who go to make up the population of the Hebrides Islands, off the west coast of Scotland. For two years there has been a succession of bad weather in the Hebrides, </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">making </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">it impossible to raise or harvest any crops. The British Government is now endeavoring to move about one-third of the population to Western Canada, so as to enable the remainder to earn</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">a living. The Hebrideans are loathe to leave their native land; and many times after full arrangements have been made for their departure, they abandon the idea of emigration and return to their cottages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">France</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">HE New York </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">World</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> says of the new party that has come into control of French affairs, that &quot;they are the thoughtful French middle class, whose principles of internal policy fall midway between the Socialists and the Republicans. They oppose the influence of big business </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">an</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">d of the church in government, and they also oppose the reactionary press.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The election shows that France has gone back to her pre-war democratic liberalism, with a completeness which has surprised even the most successful candidates. As a result of the defeat of M. PoincarS there was a sudden and heavy * fall in the value of the French franc, and also - in the Belgian franc. Normally worth twenty cents each, the French franc has been down to about five and a half cents, and ,the Belgian franc to about four and a half cents. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Senator Borah says that the defeat of M. Poincarfi creates the brightest outlook in Europe that we have had for a long time. He adds: &quot;The course of England, the wise, far-seeing, courageous policy of Prime Minister MacDonald, and now the course which seems to be initiated in France, may possibly lead even the United States out of its war trance, and cause us to adopt a tolerant and constructive foreign policy also.” Hopeful man!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The drift toward the control of public affairs by the common people becomes more and more accentuated year by year. Until 1910 France and Switzerland were the only republics in Europe. Since then Portugal, Russia, Germany, Austria, Greece, and Turkey, as well as China, have become republics. Britain has come under the control of a Labor Government; while France, Denmark and Sweden have become Socialistic. In the United States the present drift is away from a continuance of government by Mr. Morgan's U. S. Chamber of Commerce to government by the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Despatches from Jerusalem report that several weeks ago, when the natives under French control in Syria refused to pay taxes, French airplanes bombed and destroyed sixty villages, killing men, women and children indiscriminately. If this report is true, it becomes one of the greatest horrors of the time of horrors in which we live.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Nation</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> reports that in the section of France which was devastated by the World War an era of grafting has been going on unequaled by anything before known in history. It cites the shining example of a sugar refinery which was bought for 335,000 francs early in 1914. The refinery was destroyed by war. The company that had bought it asked for damages to the amount of 10,000,000 francs, and actually * received 7,000,000 francs—a little more than twenty times what the property had cost The same company received 3,000,000 francs indemnity^ for another factory purchased for 275,000 francs; and it received 2,000,000 francs for damages to other properties, the actual damages having amounted to only 240,000 franca. The current procedure is for the common people of France to pay these preposterous claims, and then French politicians endeaver to collect them from Germany as legitimate reparations claims.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Germany</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">HERE seems to be a slight difference between Germany and the Reparations Commission as to the amounts which Germany has paid toward reparation. The Commission published a statement showing that up to the end of 1923 the Germans had paid eight and one-half billion gold marks; while at the same time the Berlin Government issued a statement that the payments amounted to sixty billion gold marks. The reasons for these differences of opinion are too intricate for examination here, but the general report says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">'Tay after day, between September, 1919, and January 11, 1923, a coal train of fifty cars crossed the German frontier every quarter of an hour, all for the purpose of supplying French, Belgian and Italian industries, without any consideration in return. This was hardly an indication of bad faith on the part of Germany; and these coal deliveries, which amounted in round figures to a total of 54,000,000 tons, are only a small part of the vast tribute that Germany has paid to its former enemies from the conclusion of the armistice down to December 31, 1922. Such enormous payments as Germany has made in four years under the treaty of Versailles have never before been made or imposed upon any people in history.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Statistics compiled by the Bankers Trust Company show that the present wealth of the twenty nations that engaged in the World War is now almost exactly one-half of what it was before the war occurred. The wealth of Germany has decreased from $80,000,000,000 to $55,000,000,000. The wealth of Great Britain and her colonies has increased from $140,000,000,000 to $149,000,000,000. The wealth of the United States has increased from $200,000,000,000 to $230,000,000,000; while that of France</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">/remains unchanged at about $60,000,000,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">An </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">Am</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">erican returning from Berlin states that meals alone in that city now cost about $20.00 a day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">At this time there are 300,000 miners on strike or locked out in the mining districts of the Ruhr and Saxony. The miners demanded the seven-hour day and increased wages, and in consequence the mines were closed by the owners.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The Krupp Plant has been made over from top to bottom, and is now quite busily employed making locomotives, agricultural and textile machinery, cash registers, automobiles, giant steam shovels, and so on down to and including such small articles as needles and pins. There are fifty-three thousand workers at the Krupp Plant</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Denmark</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">W</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">HILE other countries are talking about disarmament, Denmark has really and completely disarmed. It has a national militia of 55,000 which could be organized for use in an emergency, but has discontinued its standing army.</span></p>

<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">HE Government of Czecho-Sloyakia is actively engaged in breaking up the greater estates within her border. Within the past year, 350 estates amounting to about 500,000 acres have been broken up into smaller portions of land. The owners of the large estates are being recompensed for the holdings thus taken from </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">th pm.</span></p>

<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">O</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">NLY a few weeks ago it was widely reported that Austria was rapidly recovering from the effects of the World War. Different reports are now current. In the effort to depress the French franc, the bankers of Vienna got beyond their depth, with the result that suicides among them are now matters of daily occurrence. Additionally, a crime wave is sweeping over that country. There has been an epidemic of poisonings. Suicides have been so frequent that six caseg of suicide were recently reported in one night; and in the city of Budapest, Hungary, there were 105 suicides in a single month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Roumania &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">I</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">T IS reported that the entire Roumanian army has been mo</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">bilis</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">ed, including all the men up to forty years of age; and that hostilities are about to break out between Roumania </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">and</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> Russia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Russia</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">“DESPATCHES indicate a very conaidarable J-f immigration of various sorts into Russia, including groups of colonists from the United States, Germany, Switzerland, and Canada. These settlers are occupying portions of the great estates which were broken up by the Soviet revolution. By way of retaliation, however, further immigration from America is now forbidden.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The name of the city which was once St Petersburg, and subsequently Petrograd, has been changed once more by the Russians. It is now called Leningrad. Despatches from Leningrad declare that in the graves of persons of wealth who were buried in Russia a hundred years ago, there were found passports issued by the bishop of St Petersburg, requesting St Peter to admit the bearer to heaven and to the full enjoyment of all its privileges thereafter forever, without any hindrances. It might be added that although these passports were signed by the bishop, they would have been just as efficient if they had been signed by a newsboy, a bootblack, or a be whiskered seller of vodka.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The idea that any human being has any scheme by which he can prevail upon St. Peter or Mary or Jesus or anybody else to obtain indulgences or other favors for some purchaser is as foolish as the carrying of a rabbit’s foot. All that can be said for such a scheme is that it helps the circulation of money; for it accomplishes nothing else.</span></p>

The reputed discoverer, Dr. Flinders Petrie, has a world-wide reputation for scholarship, having made many interesting discoveries in connection with the witness to the Lord in the land of Egypt; namely, the Great Pyramid, mentioned in the nineteenth chapter of the prophecy of Isaiah.</span></p>

The arguments offsetting this are generally of a financial sort, which evidently should not have much weight where questions of liberty are involved.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The President of the Philippine Senate, Manual Quezon, deciares that the Filipinos themselves can supply all the capital they need to develop their natural resources. Miss Alice Park, of California, always in the forefront of every good cause, was one of the speakers at the hearing in Washington in behalf of Philippine independence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">In the effort to find some argument against Philippine independence, the vice-president of the American Chamber of Commerce in the Philippines indicated where his heart was in the statement that the withdrawal of American sovereignty from the Philippines would be the beginning of the end of Anglo-Saxon influence in the Far East, in India and in Egypt. In other words, we may suppose that it would mark an end of the British opium monopoly. Well, suppose it should, what of it T</span></p>

<h5><a name="bookmark31"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark32"></a>An Astronomical Feast at the Observatory <sup>Mr</sup>^ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fSmtartaur)</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">&lt;*T BRING you an invitation to the observa-</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">J- tory.” With these words I was greeted by Dr. Minatti, a physicist, with whom I was acquainted. “There,” he continued, “we will meet Professor Xyland, who is en route to Asia, and who is m</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">akin</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">g only a brief sojourn here. But hurry, as we shall be called for immediately; and probably we shall stay up there over night”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">To me this meant a great treat The famous physicist, Professor Xyland, was not only a man of great learning, but, moreover/a devout Christian.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Hardly was I armed with notebook and pencil, when the automobile which was to take us to the observatory came into sight</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">It was a wonderful evening. The west was still dipped in gold and purple, from the last rays of the sinking sun, but not for long; for hardly an hour later the blue silk of the celestial dome was decorated with stars.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">In less than an hour we were at our destination, where we met Professors Xyland and Hennach, as well as a young student of physics, Eugene Bergolf. After the introduction and exchange of greetings,-Dr. Minatti whispered to me: “Professor Xyland is just our man. Like none other he understands how to point out the glories of the Creator and to help others to see His wisdom. Just ask him questions. I will make memoranda of all in your notebook.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">That sounded promising, as the golden stars beamed down upon me; and involuntarily I thought of the words of the great Ruler of the world to Abraham: “Look now toward heaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them!” (Genesis 15:5) Happily I anticipated that this evening, or rather this night, would permit us an especially deep insight into God’s great wonder-world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The guest stepped to the powerful equatorial, which he praised as being a very excellent telescope.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">“If it is agreeable to you,” he said, “we could utilize this exceptionally dear and beautiful night for consideration and observation of some of the fixed stars.” And hardly had all agreed when he invited us to look at the beautiful star Mira, at the neck of the Whale.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">“Mira, that is, the wonderful,” explained the Professor, “occasionally appears to us, of course only for a few weeks, as a star of first magnitude, then gradually decreases in bright ness. Now, however, we see it just in its most beautiful deep red luster, which does full justice to its name Mira, the wonderful. Yet after a few weeks it is no longer discernible to the naked eye. It belongs to the class of so-called variable stars, among which we distinguish three different varieties; the Mira type, the Lyra type, and the Algol type. There are known today hundreds of variable stars of the Mira type, whose variability, it is assumed, is traceable to spots, the same as are shown also at times by our sun.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">“Stars of the Algol type give forth a white light The assumed cause for their variability is that planets rotate around them and temporarily darken them to our eyes. The fixed star ■ Algol—the Arabians call it monster, devil—ia the constellation Perseus, is in all probability a giant sum”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Looking at the deep red glowing Mira affects me peculiarly. Doesnot the singer Isaiah call the Prince of Life wonderful—“Mira” f—Isaiah 9: &amp;</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">“To me,” remarked Professor Xyland, “it is a symbol of the glowing love of the Eternal God, like a blood-drop out of the ocean of love.” *</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Splendor of the Stars</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">A</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">LOUD exclamation of admiration interrupts the speaker, induced by the majestic Sirius, which had been caught in the instrument. In bluish-white splendor this sovereign of light looks down to greet us. A smaller sister-sun rotates about it once in fifty years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">“Just imagine this giant sun, which exceeds the brightness and warmth of our sun by six or seven thousand times!” Dr. Minatti now was heard to say. “Sirius, as Flammarion says, travels many </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">milli</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">on kilometers daily. In a fairly straight line, it rushes through space; and because of its tremendous speed, it overcomes all attraction. From unknown space it comes and travels on and on into unknown'star-worlds. In order to be able to appreciate this glorious sun in its full splendor, one would have to seek southern countries. Only there does this majesty of fire show itself in its incomparable magnificence and beauty.” '</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">“Now Arcturus sends its light to us through the telescope,” the young physicist interrupts his colleague. “It is well known to all of us, this red love-star. Even a glance at it with the unaided eye makes us conclude that it is a sun •f immense proportions.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;Yes,” assents Professor Xyland, &quot;Arcturus could actually melt our earth, if it would come near us. But quietly and majestically it runs its course, with its planetary princes rotating about it at distances of thousands of millions of kilometers, their revolutions probably requiring thousands of years. This king of light, according to Elkin’s calculations, exceeds the size of our sun by 550,000 times—a red ocean of fire, compared to which our king of the day looks like a little dwarf.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">“Looking at the innumerable worlds of light,” joined in Professor Hennach, who had thus far remained silent and who was now in charge of the instrument, &quot;the thought involuntarily forces itself upon one: What immeasurable energies must be at the command of the Creator of this universe I And for what lofty aims and purposes were all these glorious wonderworks created T This thought will not leave me, Professor,” he remarked to Professor Xyland; &quot;what do you think of it t&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">“On no account do I believe,” he answered, &quot;that these innumerable millions and millions of suns, planets and their satellites, were created only because of their being beautiful to look at, and will forever run their courses and rotate about each other without aim or purpose. When we see how upon our own planet active life obtains, not only upon land but in just as abundant profusion in the air and in the ocean —yea, even the waterdrop is a living world in which, no longer discernible to the naked eye, infusoria, monads, and above all the little wheel animalcule (or rotifier) with its wonderful little body clear as crystal, happily romp about and sail along—it would actually be difficult to imagine that, aside from our own terra, all planets should remain desolate and empty. In fact, the entire extended natural sciences speak against this. Kant, for instance, calls this assumption an absurdity.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;To the telescope,” calls Dr. Minatti; &quot;Regains, the main star in the Great Lion, a beautiful giant sun, is looking at us. How appropriate is its name—Regulus, the 'king star* I Proudly it flashes to us a royal greeting. This star, glowing forth in bluish white rays, has an olive-oolored sun revolving about it”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">“It must be even many times greater than the red Arcturus,&quot; explained Professor Xyland, “because notwithstanding the enormous distance, Regains beams down on us like a fixed star of first magnitude. This prince of light occupies a space in the universe against which our solar system with its planets represents only a tiny speck of earth.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The telescope is adjusted a little toward the north; and the wonderful and most beautiful double-star of the northern hemisphere sends its rays of light to us; the main star, glistening in magnificent golden brilliance, is circled about by a sapphire-blue sun. The illuminating power of this marvelously beautiful star is so great that it can be discerned with the aid of the telescope even in broad daylight</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">It is as though I hear the old seer Isaiah saying, &quot;Lift up your eyes on high, and behold who hath created these things, that bringeth out their host by number: he calleth them [these thousands of millions of </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">shinin</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">g stars] all by names I”—Isaiah 40:26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Orion A a United Family</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">B</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">UT in reality only the telescope, spectroscope, and photography make possible an insight into the world of fixed stars, magnificent above all conception, so that astonishment over the wisdom and greatness of the Builder of the Universe, everywhere manifest, becomes endless. Then first one begins to realize that it is God’s business to be Creator. Also His Divine Word is full of fine allusions and suggestions for man to listen to and to heed this symphony, whose sound waves and light waves lead to the Fountainhead itself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;Knowest thou,&quot; the Almighty calls to Job, “the ordinances of heaven T” “Canst thou bind the sweet influences of Pleiades [the seven stars, which are united into one celestial family], or loose the bands of Orion t&quot;—Job 38:33,31.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">As spectroscopical research reveals, the constellation Orion is a united family, which is bound together among themselves by invisible fetters. In like manner, unknown powers and bonds&lt; unite the far-apart suns of the Great Bear into one mighty family of stars in the heavens. Even to the naked eye the star-bedecked celestial dome provides an elevating spectacle, in which Job already rejoiced. But how would he have felt could he have discerned</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">fVLT 2, 1924</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">the swarms of shining suns, star groups, star fogs, light fogs, light oceans, etc., through modern optical instruments! How he would have marveled over phenomena like, for instance, spiral fogs, where thousands of suns represent a giant Catharine-wheel, whose direction of revolution is clearly discernible in the form of the rays! An incomprehensible richness of creation discloses itself to the gaze! &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">“While on my last trip to Africa,” Professor Xyland interrupted the awed silence, &quot;I often had opportunity to observe the southern skies. At that time the sight of a star of sixth magnitude in the Southern Cross, visible to the unaided eye only in a perfectly clear sky, interested me more than anything else. Seen through the telescope, it represents a true little jewelbox of celestial gems, compared to which the earth is only a tiny grain of dust. This wonder star is in reality a shining astral family of one hundred and ten suns, sparkling in beautiful opalescence—sea blue and sapphire, ruby, emerald, violet, some sending forth rays of precious gold and silver lustre—briefly stated, a family of light glowing beyond measure, whose members are bound together among themselves by various powers and bonds, and which presumably also have planets rotating about them. How this celestial roundelay, with its magically beautiful opalescence, praises the All-wise and Omnipotent Creator!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">I caught Tollman, in the constellation Centaur, upon the film. The sight of this double sun, shining in dazzling brilliancy, is overwhelming; no picture could possibly reproduce its splendor. Mentally, I pictured to myself how these oceans of light and fire are lashed into waves thousands of kilometers high, like gigantic red and gold colored fountains and cataracts of glowing hydrogen, gushing up and rushing down again. But never will it be possible for us human beings to behold such a dreadful, yet terribly beautiful spectacle close by; we would be driven to flight by the terrific heat before the flood of light could make us blind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Mystery of Light</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">W</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">HAT oceans of light, beyond comprehension, must surround the throne of the Most High, I thought. No wonder David declares: “Who eoverest thyself with light as with a garment; who stretchest out the heavens like a curtain!” (Psalm 104:2) Also, it was said unto Moses: “Thou canst not see my face] for there shall no man see me, and hve.”— Exodus 33:20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">“What is light, anyway!” questioned Dr. Minatti.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">“Science as yet gives us no definite answer to this question,” answered Professor Hennaeh. “For a long time the emission theory was believed, according to which the sun and also the other fixed stars cast off luminous matter with great velocity. Now light waves are assumed, that are transmitted through the primary substance, the earth’s ether. Nevertheless, even this theory does not explain what light is. On the contrary, one gets into even deeper fogs of mystery. In the case of light waves, one really does not know what undulates, but on no account is it a substance, as happens with water or air waves.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">“Light to this day has remained a wonderfully beautiful, glowing mystery,” Professor Xyland interposed, “which to us children of men pictures the glory and wisdom of the Creator of the universe in millions of ways. And the more we try to penetrate, the more there are revealed to us new beauties and powers. Greater miracles and riches come continually to view, and with them even deeper, more impenetrable mysteries, which emphasize and give unsuspected meaning to the words of the great Apostle: 'God dwell-eth in an unapproachable light; no man hath ever seen him, nor can see </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">him?</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> ”—1 Tim. 6:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">“As far as I know,” I interrupt the silence which ensued, “they are unable to give a satisfactory explanation of the appearance of the beautiful polar lights. Or has science recently made progress in this direction!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">“No appreciable progress,” Professor Xyland took up the question. “The electrical nature of the polar lights, of course, is now undoubted. It is supposed that they are caused by an illumination of the air, which originates from cathode rays of the sun. One distinguishes two kinds of polar lights; ray-emitting, and the so-called drape or mantle fight, which create the impression of a curtain suspended in the air.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;The polar lights seem to be connected in some way with the magnetic elements of the earth. Except for a belt about twenty-five degrees wide surrounding the equator, one can observe them throughout the entire earth. Self-evidently, however, they appear more frequently and more beautiful nearer the magnetic poles. The disturbances of magnetic needles, so often observed during display of polar lights, point to a close connection between the polar light and earth magnetism, although probably produced by a common cause. The color is affected by the intensity of the phenomena; and possibly also by the meteorological conditions of the atmosphere. The effect of the light, as has been observed to date, is not powerful enough to conceal stars of first magnitude. The explorer, G. Kennan, describes in his writings a polar light observed by himself. This must have been an extraordinarily beautiful one.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Description of Northern Lights *</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">A</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">T OUB request, to secure for us this de- scription, the Professor left the following excerpt, which follows here verbatim:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>&lt;f</sup>While we were yet in Anadyrsk, we had the opportunity to see one of the fineat Northern Light displays, the brilliance of which astonished even the natives. It was a cold, dark, but clear winter night, and not a trace of the coming phenomenon could be observed in the early evening hours. Several rays of light did flash up in the north; and a faint glimmering, like that of the rising moon, appeared on the horizon. But those were ordinary appearances. Late at night, however, Dodd called to us: ‘Quick! Quick! Come out I* Arriving outside, there appeared to us a splendor of light and colors, which kept us completely spellbound. The universe seemed to be on fire. A gigantic bow, shining in all colon of the prisma, spanned from the east to the west; and from its convex edge a long fringe of red and yellow lights extended toward the zenith. In short intervals, parallel with this bow, broad light waves appeared on the horizon, and flowed majestically over the entire heavens like great clouds of phosphorescent light, that rolled out of an endless ocean of light</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“Each part of this great bow undulated, quivered for a moment, changed colon; and the brilliant lights that surrounded its edge flashed back and forth in great curves, like the flaming sword of the angel at the gate to paradise. Immediately thereafter the large Northern Light rainbow with its lights moved slowly toward the zenith; and just below the first, a second bow of like beauty formed itself, from which a long row of colored spears flashed toward the North Star, as if a heavenly battalion were presenting their weapons before their</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">manding</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> archangel. With every moment this phenomenon unfolded its supernatural beauty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">‘/The rays of light revolved rapidly like the spokes of a great light wheel, the bright streams shot forth from the ends of the bow towards its center; and also in the north a fiery glow showed itself, making the sky purple and flooding the earth with a roseate gleam. But already the red had disappeared, and an orange colored lightning flashed above us with such blinding brilliance, as though the entire atmosphere were suddenly on fire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;I held my breath for a moment in expectation of a terrific thunder clap, which I believed must now follow this phenomenon. But neither in the sky nor upon the earth did any sound break the silence of the night. I could not imagine that anything could be added to this beautiful spectacle. The rapidly changing red, blue, green and yellow in the sky were reflected so vividly by the white blanket of snow that the entire world at times seemed dipped in blood. Then again it quivered in a pale greenish atmosphere, against which the great purple and yellow bows contrasted in indescribable beauty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;But that was not all! While we were watching with unaverted gaze, the ebbing and rising of this exalted canopy of varicolored lights, the last seal of this beautiful revelation broke suddenly, and both bows were </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">sumU </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">taneoualy shattered into many thousand parallel beams, each </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">of which,</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> tn regular succession showed </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">the</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> seven </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">original colors of the</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> spectrum.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;From horizon to horizon, there were now spanned two broad bridges of colored beams, upon which one almost imagined the bright figures from another world going to and fro. Amid exclamations of amazement and the shriek of the natives: *God hors mercy </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">upon usf</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> these numerous beams now began to move rapidly in dancelike fashion and shot past each other with such confusing swiftness that the eye could no longer follow them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“The entire dome of the sky seemed to be a large growing kaleidoscope of shattered rainbowa Never would I have thought that a Northern Light could form such a beautiful spectacle; and I am not ashamed to admit </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">that its stateliness filled mo for the moment with </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">reverential fear.</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> The entire sky from zenith to horizon was a rolling ocean of colors and fire, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">purple and rose, scarlet and green, colors for which language has no words.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“The signs in the sky were even marvelous enough to be heralders of a coming to end of the world. Lightnings of glorious quivering color covered half of the sky for a moment and disappeared like summer lightnings; bright green rays of light shot quickly and without sound toward the zenith; thousands of colored beams passed by each other in two beautiful bows, and huge, glowing waves rolled out of space, breaking through the atmosphere of the dark earth in long rows of shining rays.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“With the dividing of the two bows into uniform ban, the spectacle reached the height of its beauty. The first bow disappeared, and shortly thereafter the second also. The colored rays became less frequent and paler. The waves of light no longer extended to the zenith; and an hour later nothing but a few dimly lighted clouds in the dark sky reminded one of the Northern Light.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">&quot;No other natural phenomenon</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> if </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">to wonderful, to mysterious, to terrible</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> «n </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">its supernatural brilliance as the Northern Light.</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> The veil which hides from the eye of mortals the glory of the throne of the Highest seems to be lifted, and the reverent observer is removed from everyday life and imagines to stand before God.&quot;— *Tent Life ijx Siberia.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Everlasting Life Necessary to Know God</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">^^TTTHETHEE it is in God’s plan ever to</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">VV reveal upon our as yet young terra all the wonders now concealed, will probably remain unanswered for a long time. Under any circumstances, however, this will require noth- . ing more and nothing less than everlasting life!” the Professor concluded.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">“To Job,” Professor Hennach again took up the conversation, “the question was propounded: ‘Where is the way where light dwelletht' And again: &quot;By what way is the light spread out [according to exact translation]!* (Job 38: 19,24) Job did not answer; and science only makes up hypotheses concerning it”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Here Professor Xyland interrupted with the words: “We answer to the first question: &quot;To Thee, O God, because Thou art the light F ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">“ &quot;But Him/ says the wise Solomon, &quot;the heaven and heaven of heavens cannot contain? To solve this mystery, we must follow the traces of the Divine Sun, just as with the question: What is life!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">“What a Being of Light, beyond comprehension of the human mind, must the Creator be, whose incomplete works even, as the innumerable fixed stars probably are, shine in such rich, glowing beauty of colors!” mused the young physicist.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">‘&quot;Even our sun alone,” Professor Xyland continued this trend of thought, “of necessity must offer an unheard-of, overwhelming spectacle, if closer by we could admire its flaming, ruddy geysers of hydrogen, its gold-colored natrium flames and its emerald-green copper gases, etc. What power and beauty of light this king contains and has around him! His wonderful sparkle greets the morning with rays of gold and in the evening places, as if by magic, in the blue of the western skies a glorious purple, embroidered, as it were, with gold. And what immeasurable wealth he gives us human beings, even though he lets us have only a fraction of his power! But even that suffices to produce life so rich and varied that after many hundred years we would be able to search hardly, the thousandth part.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">A Moon Viewpoint of Earth</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">«TF WE could observe from the moon the * * playing of the sunbeams upon our earth, we would be witnesses of a fairylike, playing of lights. In beautiful glittering color we would see the earth hovering above us as our moon, her shining lights so vividly contrasted against the deep blade sky that we would hardly be conscious of the night. We would there see the beautiful earth thirteen and one-half times larger than the moon viewed from the earth. Beautifully the emerald waves of the Atlantis Ocean would glitter toward us, while in the vast water surface we would immediately recognise the reflection of our king of the day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">“And with the passing hours, the picture would change continually. Now we can distinguish the American Continents. A white belt seems to lie around the equator; these<sup>-</sup> axe masses of clonds driven by the winds across the ocean. Far up north glitter the ice fields of the arctic zone. And now appears a wonderful picture. The vast Pacific Ocean shines in beautiful sea-green; we even recognize numerous islands in it .</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">“And once again we see, like a giant diamond, the dazzling picture of our sun. Already we see Asia and Australia coming to view on the western edge, glittering in many colors; China and Japan shine forth a deep green; the deserts, on the other hand, are yellow. After a short time we recognize Europe, especially conspicuous Italy, which is bathing in the shining blue waves of the sparkling Mediterranean Sea. So it continues, while the earth indefatigably turns on its axis, and thereby lets the sun light up ever new beauties and charms; surprising colors play into the darkness of space.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;&quot;How, then,” Dr..Minatti interposed, “would the glorious sun Capella, which in one day sends forth such floods of light as our daystar does in one year, wrap the earth in a blaze of light of indescribable color beauty I Or what a pleasing sight would present itself to the inhabitants of such planets—in case they are inhabited, of course—where several suns of different colors rise! What an unfathomable wonder-work is this world structure! &quot;Star differs from star/ nowhere mechanical or monotonous; incomprehensible complexity and still all complete harmony. In fact, the entire creation is a beautiful poem made up of wonderful verses of light, colors, forms, sounds, powers, and laws</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;Professor,&quot; I interposed, &quot;in this beauty of creation, does our little earth not look like a black, sinister little dot, when we think of all the existing misery, all the strife and contention; in short, the dark night of sin and death, which has punished mankind now for 6,000 years!&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Great </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">God, Thee We Praiee!</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">W</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">ITH flashing eyes he flared up: &quot;Our terra a dark little dot! Next to the throne of God it is to me the brightest spot of the entire universe. For did not the mighty Logos, the world's Builder who created all these things under the direction of the Most High, these sovereigns of light and majesties of fire [with sparkling eyes he pointed up to the sky with his hand], did He not live here upon this earth, and was it not ennobled by Him! For what purpose, you all know. In like manner, as undoubtedly millions of years before the eternal God had given </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">Him</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> the cnmimaamn to bring into being these wonderful hosts of stars and to establish the laws for all of them, suited to each individually, so 1,900 years ago a new work, which He had to accomplish upon our earth, was put before Him!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;The Logos left His glory and came down to pay the ransom for Father Adam, condemned to death, in order to purchase back for </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">him,</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> and thereby also for all his posterity—mankind— the life forfeited by disobedience. Therefore, no matter if ever so dark shadows hover about the earth, I already see it in the golden brilliance of future aions completed, in indescribable glory and beauty, worthy, in the days when</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">He was flesh, to have given lodging to the great Logos, now the Prince of Life; worthy also of a perfect race of human beings, when every one as a wonder of divine love reflects the image of the Creator, and causes joy and pleasure to the Baler and King of the universe. What, then, does this six-thousand-year night of the permission of evil mean in the future aions, when every new brilliance and beauty outshines the previous! An eclipse of the sun caused by the shadows of sin, which permits the sunshine of . divine love, wisdom, supreme power, and righteousness to shine forth only the more bright!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;How all powers and characteristics now dormant in man will then grandly develop, and bring forth precious fruits! And earth itself will blossom in beauty never seen before! Must not hearts be kindled in blessed rapture over the satisfying joy! Every being will breathe love for the gracious Creator, as well as for his fellow creature I And as none of the sweet flowers in the wealth of their glory is like another, so every creature shall bring pleasure to the great God by his own beauty and kind; and praises and adoration will rise up on wings of love to the throne of the Eternal God. And He will open up the gates of heaven and pour out floods of blessings and streams of love upon alL</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;Then a powerful *Te Deum Laudamus'— Great God, Thee we praise!—will roar and thunder all around the terrestrial ball And in this all the heavenly hosts will join exultantly as they did at the creation of this earth!&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The words filled our hearts with solemn joy. Moved and touched we took our leave and parted. The astronomical feast, which had lasted until'four o'clock in the morning, will long remain in our memories like a benediction from' heaven. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~</span></p>

<h5><a name="bookmark33"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark34"></a>Pork as an Article of Diet </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">By Gerald Barry</span></h5>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">I</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">T IS well known that the Jewish people to this day do not eat pork, which irone of the articles of food forbidden by the law of Moses. (Leviticus 11:7,8) Our Lord Jesus when on earth showed His perfect harmony with </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">His </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Father’s will in this respect, not only by observing this command Himself, as all Jews were required to do, but also by His dealings with the man possessed with a legion of devils (demons) which He allowed to enter into the herd of swine, as recorded in Matthew 8:28-34; Mark 5:1-20; Luke 8:26-39. Jesus’ action in this respect showed His perfect harmony with His Father’s law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Some might query: Why did Jesus permit the devils to enter into the herd of swine, thus causing a considerable loss to the owners of the swine t The answer to this question seems to'be that if those Jews had been living faithfully up to their law, they would not have been keeping swine. Apparently they raised the swine not for their own use but rather to sell to their Gentile neighbors, who had no scruples about eating pork. But Jesus in this miracle showed that even in doing this they had violated the spirit of the Mosaic Law; for we cannot imagine that Jesus would permit the wanton destruction of any creature or thing without a purpose. Evidently His purpose was to show His full harmony with both the letter and the spirit of His Father’s law, and also to show them that if pork was forbidden to the Jews as an article of food because it was unclean, they were not loving their neighbors as themselves when encouraging them in the use of it</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">St. Paul clearly shows that the Gospel Church of this age, from the first advent of Christ until the glorification of the Church during His second presence, is not under the restrictions of the Jewish law (Galatians 2:16); and that they therefore may eat without condemnation the things that were forbidden under that law.— Romans 14:14; 1 Timothy 4:3-5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">God thus places such under a law of liberty, which in His wisdom He sees will best accomplish the purpose He has in view during the Gospel Age. This law of liberty in no wise forbids anyone from voluntarily foregoing the use of swine’s flesh or anything else that one may perceive to be injurious to health, even as it places no condemnation on those who use these things. The only command God places upon His people in these respects is that they follow His example and grant full liberty to each other to follow the dictates of their own conscience in these matters.—Romans 14:2,3,13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The writer of this article has long wondered what was the reason why swine were forbidden by God to the Jews. Just recently he read in a medical work some facts that fully demonstrate the wisdom and love of God in the matter. The following quotation is from a work entitled &quot;Plain Home Talk and Medical Common Sense,* by E. B. Foote, M. D.:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“One of the most causes of blood imparities is the use of pork. ... As an article of diet, pork exerts a most pernicious influence on the blood, overloading ft with carbonic acid gas, and filling it with scrofula. The hog is not a healthy animal. From its birth it is an inveterate gormandizer; and to satisfy its . . . cravings for food, everything in field or gutter, however filthy* finds lodgment in its capacious stomach. It eats filth, and wallows in its filth, and is itself but a living ma* cf filth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“When, therefore, it is remembered that all our Umbo and organs have been picked up from our plates, that our bodies are made up of the things we have eaten, what pork-eater will felicitate himself with the reflection that according to physiological t</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">eaching</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> he is physically </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">pari hog</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> f . . . From the earliest history of swine, they have been regarded as more subject to scrofula than any other animaL . . . Again, pork is charged with being wormy. . . . They are called Trichinss, and the disease they produce in man is denominated ‘Trichi-niasia?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“The parasites are so minute that they can make theft way to any part of the system. . . . Trichiniasis took the form of an epidemic in some parts of Germany in 1865, and handled a great many people on this side of the Atlantic very roughly. ... A scientific investigating committee in Chicago reported having found in twelve hundred hogs slaughtered that one in fifty-eight was affected with a parasite; and the advice of that committee was that in cooking pork the Triahinos be thoroughly cooked to death ! 160° Fahrenheit was thought sufficient to do this. . . . The discovery of the Trichins and the fatality attending their transmission to the human system in many cases resulted in an excited controversy between pork lovers and pork hater*</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“At a meeting of the Berlin Butchers’ Association, a medical professor set forth the best means to avoid toe spread of TrichiniaiJs. He was followed by a veterinary surgeon. Dr. Urban, who denounced the whole excitement as unfounded, and offered to eat any amount of Trichiniaed pork. But when a slice of pork affected with the parasite was offered him, hr as taken aback. It is reported that he declined, ‘but the jeen of the meeting haring touched him, he took a little nibble at the proffered slice, and hurriedly left the room. He proceeded to a neighboring chemist and administered to himslf so violent an emetic that the learned doctor's friends need labor under no apprehensions as to his safety?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“Still there seemed to be those who, while admitting the existence of the parasite in pork, claim that it is entirely harmless if the pork be thoroughly cooked. It is undoubtedly true that the epidemic character of Trichiniasis in Germany proceeded from the habit of the people of eating raw pork, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">ham,</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> and sausage. My own opinion is that after a cooking Trichina are not liable to revive in the human system, unless there are impurities to nourish them and'to favor their resuscitation and reproduction. ... If a man be scrofulous, or have other impure affections of the blood, the Trichina are liable to be resuscitated and reproduced in the system, no matter how much they may be toasted, short of absolute scorching. . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“If it be urged that there an animalcula in water, vegetables, and everything we eat, when viewed through the microscope, then I reply that those contained in water and vegetable matter are readily destroyed as soon as they come in contact with the gastric juices of the stomach, while parasites existing in the flesh of animals are not thus destroyed. Experiments have demonstrated that the eggs of the latter may be even dried and cooked without destroying their life; and that taken into the stomach in this condition, they go through the process of incubation almost as readily as if they had not been cooked or dried. The animalculs of water and of vegetables have no such tenacity to life. The mildest of acid or alkaline solutions will destroy them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“It is not improbable that Trichine, after entering the stomach, are sometimes transformed into other worms. It has been contended that the tape-worm troubles only those who eat pork; and further, that the Hebrews, who do not eat the flesh of swine, are never troubled with this parasite; that dogs fed to any extent on pork are subject to it; and that experiments on a condemned criminal, made by M. Kuchenmeister of Zittoria, ‘with great professional care and minuteness of detail, have established the fact beyond contradiction that an exclusively pork diet will produce tape-worm.*</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“But there are unquestionably pork eaters who have no apparent disease whatever. Although the scrofulous impurities of their diet find lodgment, they remain latent in their systems, and are even transmitted to their children without manifesting themselves in the parent stock. ...

<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">HEBE are many in the world today who understand the wonders of nature; but they are few who see and appreciate it as a manifestation of God’s wonderful character, as Job expresses it after viewing some of the works of nature: “Lo, these are parts of his ways; but how little a portion is heard of him!”— Job 26:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Perhaps of all God’s work the rain is the most abused. But let us trace its course and see that it, as well as all other works, magnifies the great Creator.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The vapors which rise from the surface of the sea, drawn upward by the heat of the tropical sun, bear the cooling influence to the heated air. The vapors now begin their circuit around the . earth, carried by the steady trade-winds to the regions of equatorial calms, that wonderful belt of heat and accumulated moisture, and are there met with breezes which, in like manner, are traveling north. These opposing winds are Laden with vapors from the two hemispheres,</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-variant:small-caps;">LbW </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Sy Dorothy AUonby (England)</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">as the Psalmist says: “He causeth the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth.” Each has its mission, and works according to an appointed law.—Psalms 135:7; 148:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Th* Forming of Rain Drogo</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">I</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">T IS the province of the vapors to carry the exhalations from north and south into the upper strata of atmosphere, where the circum-fusion of moisture over the earth is made with greater velocity and freedom. As soon as the vapors enter the more temperate atmosphere their particles expand and portions of them cling together in drops. Thus as these drops become heavier, the condensation forms clouds, until there is a rainfall</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Some of the moisture-laden currents of air rest high above the earth and sea, so high indeed that they in no way interfere with the winds below. The vapors are borne along by the upper currents of air, which carry them forward on their journey of. beneficence and never-ceasing good. But this is only a portion of the career of the vapors of the sea.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Man may say that divided interests are the rain of fools, but God's work shows that extended ones are the glory of the wise. At the next meeting at the outskirts of the tropics with travelers like themselves coming in opposite directions there is renewed pressure of the opposing breezes which makes these vapors descend, to be dispersed by the surface winds on their course of usefulness to man. Taken up by all the variable breezes that sport over the northern hemisphere, there is no direction in which they are not to be found. A portion was ’ wanted here, another there. The snow of Iceland, the vineyards of Italy, the orange groves of Spain, and the river which pours over the mighty rocks at Niagara, must all be fed at their appointed seasons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">But the eye would weary which strove to look • sympathizingly over the vast expanse of the globe. Let us now make a mental picture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Parched Ground</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> Is </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Refreshed</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">O</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">N THE summit of a mountain, over the sides of which the gorse and heather are wont to grow and flower together in bright profusion with their beautiful intermixture of hues, all the ground was parched and dry; a summer drought ruled over the spot, and the withered flower beds bore painful witness to the fact. The pretty, tumbling waterfall fed by the streams from the hills was reduced to a miserable trickle. The fanners wore a gloomy, anxious look which told of a thousand fears about the crops and cattle. (Surely this teaches us the lesson that whether small or great all are dependent on each other.) But while thus troubled, relief was coming from afar.—Psa. 104:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Traveling toward them upon the wings of the wind, vapors from the tropical seas were coming as clouds, to fall as gracious rain and dews upon the thirsty earth. They are variable and fantastic winds that course over the northern hemisphere, but not steady and uniform in their direction, as the trade-winds in the tropics. Therefore we cannot reckon on their arrival to a day, nor to a month; but on their arrival at last we may always surely depend. Perhaps in this trial of patient expectation a lesson of great faith is intended to be learned.—Job 38: 25-27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">We take a great deal for granted in this world and expect that, as a matter of course, everything should fit into our humors and wishes and wants; and it is often only when dangers threaten that we awake to the discovery that the guiding reins are held by One who, in our careless ease, we had well-nigh forgotten.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">When the vapors pour into the earth as rain, or seep into it as moisture, the soil gives off &quot;gases. The roots of the trees, plants, etc., draw them together and, feeding' upon them, expand and flourish and grow. When this useful deed is done, and when the sun shines out in all his heat and glory, again the rain is changed into vapors, this time taking with them the salts, lime, and </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">min</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">eral virtues upon which the shells, coral reefs, and zoophytes of the deep, aepend.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Miuion ofthelkm</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">rpHEBE is a mission for every portion; even through the saturated ground the raindrops sink together amidst roots and stones and soil, moistening all before them and replenishing the springs that run among the hills.— Psalm 104:10, IL</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Thus from age to age, since the primary mists went up from the sea and watered the face of the whole earth, the mighty work has gone on and on, and still continues its course. For not to idleness and inactivity do the vapors now return, but only to commence afresh their labor of love, through all the varieties of accidents of climate and of place-—whether as snow or hail, showers or dews, as floods, springs, rivers or seas. The waters are still obediently fulfilling His word who called them into being.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">O ye showers and dews; 0 ye winds of God; O ye ice and snow; O ye seas and floods, even when man is mute and forgetful, ye bless the Lord, and praise Him and magnify Him forever I</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“There is a God—all Nature speaks,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Through earth and air and seas and skies: See! from the clouds His glory breaks, When the first beams of morning rise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“The rising sun, serenely bright, O’er the wide world’s extended frame Inscribes, in characters of light, His mighty Maker's glorious name.’’</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark37"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark38"></a>Revising the Dictionary </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">By c. H. Williams</span></h5>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">O PRODUCE an effect there most first be a cause. Broadly speaking, all effects obtained can be divided into two great divisions, good and evil Good effects are produced from true causes. A true cause itself has for its foundation a right principle. It is-based on reason.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">When Jehovah, God of the whole universe, says to His people: “Come, let us reason together,” He is wishing to show them the effects produced from causes based en eternal truths. All good causes and their resultant effects are inherent in Jehovah God, &quot;the Giver of every good and perfect gift”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">On the other hand, evil effects have fortheir genesis evil causes. Thus evil causes and their effects are the stock in trade of Satan, &quot;the god of this [present evil] world.” He is the father of every evil gift, including all the cant, humbug, deceit, and misery rampant among the children of men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">In the production of both good and evil effects, language plays a greater part than is usually acknowledged. Words are the vehicles used to convey thoughts. The power of speech is one of humanity's greatest boons. It came direct to father Adam from God Himself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The control of language means the control of thought. The apostle James points the lesson when he says: &quot;But the tongue can no man tame.” We can then readily see how in the march of events language sometimes becomes corrupt We are living in the time foretold by the prophet Daniel, when knowledge shall be increased. (Daniel 12:4) The dictionary is a well-spring of knowledge. It is a most wonderful and helpful book. It is especially helpful to a bad speller. But it is often found necessary to revise the dictionary. Certain words become obsolete, and are dropped from ordinary parlance. Others are coined to fill real or fancied wants. As an example of the latter we will examine one of these recently coined words. The great World War, in itself an evil cause, produced the word camouflage. This word has now passed into general usage. What is its definition!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">We learned on the battlefield that to camouflage a battery of ‘guns meant to hoodwink the enemy into believing that that particular battery was not there. If it happened to be located in a grassy field, it was painted to look like the grass. Again, a sniper would get himself up to look like a tree. If he was caught, he was up a tree in more senses than one. In plain English, to camouflage means to deceive. Then why not use the same word that was used by us in olden times—deceit! No, indeed!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The war was waged by God—so said the Allies. The trouble was, however, that the Germans said the same thing. Really, it was begun by Satan in his endeavor to keep the kingship of the fifth universal empire out of the hands of &quot;Him whose right it is”—the Lord Jesus Christ, Head and body. One of Satan's names is “that old serpent.” The word serpent means deceiver. One wonders whether Satan, king of evil, coined the word camouflage, to camouflage the true position lest the people get to know who really instigated the World War.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Pim Language</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> in </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Proepeet</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">W</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">E ARE standing on the threshold of the new age of good causes and good effects. Will it be necessary to revise the dictionary in this age of righteousness! Let us see. Without going further we can see good reasons why camouflage, and words like unto it, would be deleted. But can it be that the matter goes further! We look between the coven of the dictionary and begin to count the words that have been used as vehicles of thought, to convey impressions of evil to mankind, under the reign of sin for six thousand years. We do not go very far. To count them to a finish would be a vast task.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">One is amazed at getting only a glimpse of the multitude of words explanatory of both thoughts and actions that are evil. Truly our language will get more simple and more pure as evil is destroyed from among men. It is written that “when the judgments of the Lord are in the earth the inhabitants of the world will learn righteousness.&quot; And also of the new or Golden Age it is written that God will “turn unto the people a pure language.&quot;—Isaiah 26: 9; Zephaniah 3:9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Let us, then, suppose that the new age is fully ushered in, and then let us constitute ourselves a court of justice to determine whether certain words are now of value to </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">mankin</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">d in these new conditions of life. Our rule of judgment shall be the one laid down by the prophet Isaiah many centuries ago: &quot;To the law and to the testimony; if they speak not according to </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">the</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">ft word, it is because there is no light in them.&quot; (Isaiah 8:20) Thus if the words before the judgment bar of the new age cannot according to the Word of God give good reasons for remaining as vehicles of thought for the many millions of restored mankind, condemnation shall be passed upon them. They shall be consigned to </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">gehenna;</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> “they shall be as though they were not.&quot; The trial is on. Then let the prisoners come before us in their families; for many a hoary root-word has brought forth abundant brandies after its own kind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">JFbrds </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Which Shall Became Obsolete</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">T\OCTOR, Medicine, Dope, Disease: Quite a nice little family; but their judgment is swift and sure. It is written: “And the inhabitant shall not say, I am sick; the people that dwell therein shall be forgiven their iniquity.” —Isaiah 33:24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Despot, Tyranny : Each man is to be a king in the new age. Their kingdom is the earth and their dominion the animal creation. Despotic and tyrannical actions toward each other will then be a thing of the past. Thus these words are condemned; as it is written: “For thou wilt save the afflicted people; but will bring down high looks.”—Psalm 18:27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Pain, Woe, Distress, Sorrow, Trouble: Another little family that has left its mark in no uncertain manner on the people. Thank God that there will be no place found, for these words! So away they go; for it is written: “And they shall build houses, and inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them. . . . They shall not labor in vain, nor bring forth for trouble.”—Isaiah 65:21-23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Accident, Cataclysm: These words, also, shall' have had their day. It has been a long six-thousand-year day. On these words we must write “Finis.” For again it is written: “They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain [kingdom]: for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea.”—Isaiah 11:9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Adultery: We have no space to mention the children of this term. Their name is Legion. Certain it is that this family has been responsible for most of the crime and misery in the </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">world. They are well known. Judgment on them does not tarry. It is written that “when they [dead people] shall rise from the dead, they neither marry nor are given in marriage; but are as the angels which are in heaven.* —Mark 12; 25.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Parson: What! Will there be no gentlemen going about in peculiar garments, the livery of pseudo piety 1 No, verily! This word and aU that it has meant have been weighed in the balances and found wanting. So into the limbo of forgotten idols it must go. It is written: “They shall call the nobles thereof to the kingdom, but none </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">shall be there,</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> and all her princes shall be nothing.” (Isaiah 34:12) And again it is written: “And it shall come to pass in that day, that the prophets [preachers] shall be ashamed every one of his vision, when he hath prophesied; neither shall they wear a rough [distinguished] garment to deceive.” (Zechariah 13:4) So it seems that the preachers’ peculiar clothes have been mere camouflage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Fear: O bane of humanity, unto whom aU have worshipfully bent the kneel You too at last must die. Not even your corpse will remain in sight It is to be buried deep beneath the debris of a departed evil age. And so even you, as a vehicle of thought, are forever doomed to destruction; for it is written: “They shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig tree; and none shall make them afraid: for the mouth of Jehovah of hosts hath spoken it”—Micah 4:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Grave, Coffin, Death: Grim monarchs, indeed! This family is a large one. It incorporates </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">all the</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> misery and suffering and evil that have descended upon a sin-cursed earth. But &quot;death itself shall die.” Its condemnation was assured when on Calvary the Just One died for the unjust that He might bring us all to God. In the judgment and destruction of Death, all other evil words are involved. And so in the now-dawning new age, Death and his minions shall be no more. The mouth of the Lord God hath spoken it: “He will swallow' up death in victory: and the Lord God will wipe away tears from off all faces; and the rebuke of his people shall he take away from off all the earth: for the Lord hath spoken it.” (Isaiah 25:8) And again: “Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he [Jesus] also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he [Jesus] might destroy him</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">[Satan] that had the power of death, that is, the devil.”—Hebrews 2:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">And therefore having raised a train of thought we, for the time being, close the court The real work of revising the dictionary will be a great one. Not only will words be deleted from it in the new age, but the me</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">anin</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">g of words that spring from good and true roots will be fully and perfectly understood. The true meaning of such words as joy, peace, and love will be fully discerned, that the pure, clean and lovely thoughts of the people may find their expression through words from which the sting of fear and of death has been removed.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark39"></a>A Golden Rule House</span></h5>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">HE Magnolia Metal Company, 113 Bank Street, New York city, is out with a little folder in which they assert:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“The curse of this world is selfishness. It is at the bottom of all industrial and social trouble.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“If men can be brought to regard other men as brothers, if they can be induced to love their neighbors as themselves, if men would do unto others as they would be done by, there would be no trouble between capital and labor. Social strife and international conflicts would cease.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“ We, therefore, individually and as a corporation, advocate the Golden Rule with all of our power, as an aid to 'peace and good will among men.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“From the very inception of this Company, nearly thirty-eight years ago, we have tried to do right in all our dealings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“At this time we wish to emphasise the Golden Rule as the guiding principle of our business: 'As ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them likewise?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“First: As to our</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> employes. Recognizing the divine principle that *we are our brothers’ keeper? we regard employes as brothers and sisters, children of a common Father, and take the same interest in them as we do in ourselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“Second: People from whom we buy.</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> It is our determination to do unto them as we would be done by; to attempt to put ourselves at all times in their places as far as possible; and to be as generous as we consistently can.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“Third: People to whom we seTL</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> It is our desire to be just, fair and generous with customers and, as far as practicable, to put ourselves in their places in every transaction, always studying their interest as we would our own.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“Fourth: The world at large.</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> It is our desire to share the burdens of others as far as we are able, and to give encouragement and help.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">We can say that these are remarkable words, and we wish the greatest success to the Magnolia Metal Company for every honest attempt to put these principles into effect. We realize that in order to do so, they must meet with many discouragements; for they will find few who really share the same motives. In the New 'Age it will be different Every company will then be like the Magnolia Company; and overrea</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">chin</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">g and unfair dealing will be a thing of the pest</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Mr. E. C. Miller, the president of the company, declared:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“If business men would displace the 'iron ruW of hatred and rivalry for the Golden Rule of love and cooperation, most of their troubles would melt away. This change would bring healing to Europe; it would revolutionize the world.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">A reporter in writing on this subject said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“The head of the concern pulled a blank letterhead from his desk and pointed to the place where most manufacturers have printed the words: 'Notice—This order is accepted subject to strikes, insurrections, or other causes beyond our control? and in its place there appeared these words from Matthew 7:12: 'Whatsoever ye would that men should do unto you, do ye even so to them.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“He picked up a yellow bill of lading covering a consignment of thirty tons of babbitt metal from a concern in the West, which had violated its written agreement with the Magnolia Company and had made unjustifiable demands. ‘This is an order involving about 915,000? said Mr. Miller, ‘and I have no doubt that if we took the case to court we should win; but our days of litigation are over. We shall pay the bill and meet all the other demands of this company, but we shall refrain from doing further business with them until they see the error of their way? ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">This same reporter, in giving his write-up a little touch of the human to embellish properly the situation around such noble principles of righteousness and magnanimity, said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“There is a quaintnees about the surroundings [of the office building and factory], such an atmosphere, perhaps, as one might have encountered fifty yean or more ago in almost any mercantile establishment in New York. There are, perhaps, fifteen or twenty clerks and stenographers in the offices; and every one seemed to radiate contentment, kindness and good cheer ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Does this statement demonstrate to us the deplorable condition of our own money-mad day? The conditions surrounding this firm are unique and worthy of praise and commendation. Possibly up-to-date business men would think of the management as antiquated and “old fogy.” It is indeed a rare exception to the rule. It is a bright spot in the financial firmament.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Selfishness and a sad lack of brotherly kindness are at the bottom of the world’s trouble. The world has lost its sense of justice. That sense is being restored, but only in the head— theoretically. Trouble, strife, discord, revolution, and anarchy are possessing the awakening* masses. Finally, in dismay at the depths to which h</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">umani</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">ty can </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">sink</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> in the mite of selfishness, there will come a realization of the passing away of the old order of things; and the merely head-justice will sink into the heart, and will prompt each one to exercise himself in the general cause and uplift of humanity, and not act for himself only. When the Golden Rule gets into the heart, it will work wonders!</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark40"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark41"></a>, Authority—Democratic versus Plutocratic </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">By Freeman Bel</span></h5>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">HE doctors of our physical bodies were slow to learn that they should differentiate between the symptoms of disease and the causes or real seat of the disease itself. And now our sociologists, doctors of the social body, appear to be even more slow to differentiate between effeet’and cause as concerns the social body.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Our sociologists find the people ignorant and the wealth unjustly distributed. These are but the effects of a maladjustment that should be looked for elsewhere—in the fact that the people are insufficiently equipped with the machinery of organization for authority. At the outset of our national life, much was done, and much credit is due to those who were most insistent on organizing the people as the rightful source pf authority. But it is not for us to rest upon what others have done for us. Ever in the clash of two opposing forces, as in our case the people versus the profiteers, continuous planning and continuous work are needed to overcome the enemy’s schemes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The real cause of the people’s suffering is not to be found in their need of food, clothing and shelter. Let the profiteers’ authority be supplanted by that of the people, and all such problems will find a ready solution. This must have been the view of Jesus, when He told ths multitude to consider the lilies and the birds. (Matthew 6:26-30) His idea of the ownership of things is also shown in His answer to the question about tribute money.—Luke 20:19-26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Our profiteers are now our Cesar. Their authority transcends that of the people; and when authority speaks for things, it gets them. But the people want democracy; they want a shifting of authority from the profiteers to the people. Then let us find men of influence to lead the people to what they want.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">[We hold that God made just such a “find” centuries ago, when He “laid help on one that is mighty,” and in Jesus of Nazareth provided the world’s future Ruler, the One alone able to untangle earth’s affairs.—E&lt;Lj</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">This world’s greatest need is a government able to protect the people from sharks; a form of government commanding the respect of all, and demanding and enforcing absolute right* eousness. Such a government is now coming into power. Such a government is now causing the world-upheaval, and is breaking into pieces and consuming all other world powers. Such a government is one for which all creation groans, and one which alone can satisfy the desire ol all nations.</span></p>

<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">W</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">E LIVE in a day when almost every branch of science and learning is being subjected to close scrutiny. This searching and . examining of facts has resulted in the discard&gt; ing of many of the old, useless ideas, and the bringing forward of a new, clearer light Essentially, one of the great studies of mankind is man. “Man, know thyself.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Phrenology is a branch of science which has as its object the study and betterment of man through a correct understanding of his organs and their proper functions. Many think that phrenology is merely a study of the bumps on one’s head But its scope is eminently wider; for the one great principle which the student of phrenology learns is this: No real good can be acquired without working in harmony with the essential laws of one’s being.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Again, phrenology should be disassociated from psychology and the occult.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The body is controlled by impulses generated in the </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">min</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">d- The greater the power of any organ of the brain, the greater will be the power of the individual to act in that particular capacity. The lover of music has the organs of time and tune well developed through constant practice, and can discern fine distinctions in the rendering of a piece of music. One less developed in these particular organs would not be able to distinguish the beautiful harmony in music to the same extent as the one with well developed organs. I have frequently observed people reading a paper or a book while beautiful classical music is being played. At the same time others have listened with rapt attention and evident enjoyment</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">In the new era, all such people will be given ample opportunity to acquire a taste for music by education and practice. As their knowledge and ability along this line increase, so will their joy and happiness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Every faculty of the mind was placed in man for his well being and personal enjoyment Phrenology grades these faculties according to the degree of good their legitimate use is able to render. The highest faculties of the mind are the moral, or religious, and the intellectual. Any faculty is developed by constant use. The man whose mind is constantly on his business, or on the acquiring of money, is not only enlarging his acquisitiveness but dwarfing, or leaving undeveloped, the more important organs of the mind, of which reverence, conscientiousness and benevolence are the highest</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">True character cannot be developed without the growth of these three faculties. They are the most important of all; and hence phrenology shows them to occupy the topmost or highest position in the head. Stand erect, and have someone place a ruler on your head, along the center, from front to back. The middle of the ruler will rest on reverence. Directly in front of the middle of the head will be found benevolence, and immediately behind is firmness. On either side of these grand organs lie imitativeness, spirituality or faith, hope, and conscientiousness, in the order named from front to back. And below these latter lie ideality, sublimity, and cautiousness, supporting all the organs of the top-head.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The Bible tells us that God is love; that is» He is entirely unselfish. The motive prompting His actions is a benevolent, unselfish desire to do* good. Every one who is godlike will have the same unselfish desire to do good. This is true love. It seems that reverence, benevolence, and conscientiousness are the only faculties of the mind which are entirely unselfish. They are termed the superior sentiments, in contrast with faith, hope, sublimity, and ideality, the use of which brings pleasure to oneself; whereas the others give pleasure to God, and to everybody.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Centuries ago, the prophet Micah showed what is indicated today by phrenology. In Micah 6:8, these prophetic words are found: “What doth the Lord require of thee, but to do justly [conscientiousness], and to love mercy [benevolence], and to walk humbly with thy God [reverence] 1”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Thus phrenology agrees with the Bible that man’s chief aim should be the development of unselfish love.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">St. Paul said: “Love is the f</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">ulfillin</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">g of tho law&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;Not gold, but only men, aa malm A people great and strong—</span></p>

<h5><a name="bookmark46"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark47"></a>Preachers Condemning Themselves</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">OPYRIGHTED, full-page write-ups with that the beggar was carried literally into Abra*</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">lurid illustrations of hell and the devil have appeared in the Hearst periodicals, giving accounts of a revival of hell-fire preaching in Altoona, Pa. The purpose of this revival is set forth in the title of the article, “Preaching Eternal Punishment to Deter Lawbreakers.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">It was proposed to have “one hundred old-fashioned sermons on the torments of the wicked in the future life thundered from the churches in Altoona to purify the city.” Both Catholics and Protestants joined in this league of purification; and the Bev. Dr. E. L Milburn, pastor of the Christian and Missionary Alliance Church, was selected as the standard-bearer, his subject being “The Terrors of HelL”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Mr. Robert W. Smith, a prominent lawyer of Altoona, had declared that the ministers of the gospel were “firing pea-shoot'ers at heaven, when they should be training heavy artillery on helL” • A mass meeting was called, and a local civic association urged 5,000 of its members to hear the sermon to which we have just referred.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The minister said that he believed in a hell which has fire in it, which has brimstone in it, which is a place of torment; and asserted that it is a place of banishment from God. He quoted the scriptures which tell of hell being “beneath” and “down”, and that it can be “moved” and “enlarged.” He said that the fire is never extin-_ guished, that hell is anything but pleasant, anything but joy, anything but happiness; that hell is what heaven is not. He said that “man by his wickedness may create hell on this earth,” that hell is in the heart of the wicked, that hell is in the home where drink is.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">As the </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">mini</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">ster gave the parable of the Rich Man and Lazarus a literal interpretation, may we not with propriety give his words a literal interpretation 1 Most assuredly. If we misrepresent him, then we can rest assured that he misrepresented Jesus. If hell is in the heart of the wicked, that wicked heart must therefore have within it literal fire, literal brimstone, literal torment; and, as an enlarged heart is always a good one, the hell-heart in this instance being enlarged must necessarily be good. But away with such nonsense I The preacher did not <sup>%</sup> mean anything so foolish. Neither did Jesus . mean that the torments of hell could be assuaged by a drcp of water on the tongue, or</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">ham’s bosom after he died I</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">We wonder whether the people of Altoona, especially the preachers, know that the word gospel means “good tidings” 1 The doctrine that hell is a literal place for the roasting of the wicked eternally is a message of “bad tidings” and has no place in Christianity. How many know that Paul said: “I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ,” and that in all his writings the word “hell” does not once occur!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">7%e </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Dead An Dead</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">R</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">EV. DR. Milburn says that “this word hell has no reference to the grave* t And in proof he quotes Psalm 9:17: “The wicked shall be turned into hell, and all the nations that forget God.” If he were a real Bible student and a real heralder of the “good tidings” message, he would know that the Hebrew word </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">shub,</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> translated “turned” in the text, means returned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Those who die go into the grave, they enter the death condition, and there they remain without knowing anything until the resurrection. “All that are in the graves • . . shall come forth.” says Jesus. (John 5:28,29) The good will enter into their reward, and the evil will enter their judgment trial of a thousand years to determine whether they are to die </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">again</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> or to live forever. If they make a failure in their trial, they will die opain; they will </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">return</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> to the death state, to the Bible hell, and there they will remain forever; for “the wages of sin is death.” Eternal death is an eternal punishment, but it is not eternal torment It cannot be torment; for the dead are dead. When a man dies Tiis breath goeth forth, he returnetb to his earth; in that very day his thoughts </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">perish/'</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> (Psalm 146:4) And when the thoughts are perished, there can be no conscious suffering, physical or mental. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">“Hell” is the English word used to translate </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">sheol</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> and </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">hades,'</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> and has no reference to torment If God were to have a literal burning furnace for the wicked, He would have told us in plain language about it The children of Israel had turned their backs upon God, and were worshiping Baal, and were causing their children to pass through the fire of Molech, the “eternal torment god.” But God reproved them in the following language: “They have not</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">hearkened to receive instruction . . . they set their abominations in the house which is called by my name . . . they built the high places of Baal, which are in the valley of the son of </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">Kin</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">-nom (Gehenna, &quot;hell-fire,” Matthew 5:22], to cause their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire unto Molech, which I commanded them not, neither came it into my mind, that they should do this abomination, to cause Judah to sin.”—Jeremiah 32:33-35.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Here is a clear indication that &quot;hell-fire” preachers are an abomination to God, that they are ministers of Baal, and that they are not authorized to speak forth in the name of Jehovah. No writer or speaker in the Bible ever used any word which corresponds to the theologians’ use of &quot;hell-fire”! Jesus used the word </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">gehenna</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> a few times, but as a symbol of destruction from which there would be no resurrection. The &quot;lake of fire” is specifically explained in the Bible to mean the &quot;second death,” the death from which there is to be no resurrection.—Revelation 20:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Rev. Dr. Milburn misquotes Revelation 14: 9-11, saying, &quot;They shall be cast into a furnace of fire. There shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.” A man who finds a reason for such juggling of Scripture as this surely could find a reason for doubting his premise. The text says: &quot;If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive his mark in his forehead, or in his hand, the same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation; and he </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">shall</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb: and the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever: and they have no rest day nor night, who worship the beast and his image, and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">As the day of Christ is ushered in thief-like, that day will be dawning while the world will be unaware of the fact. As Jesus Himself comes thief-like, He will be present for a time before the Church is glorified. The context shows that this is the correct thought, that Christ will be present, making an inspection of those who claim to be Christians. The &quot;beast and his image” are given the family name of Babylon in Revelation 18. If any man reveres (worships) that system, develops the ecclesiastical mind (mark in his forehead), and supports it (has the mark in the hand), God's wrath eventually shall be meted out to him. ‘&quot;Tormented with fire” means that the &quot;fire of God's wrath,” the “fire of God's jealousy,” will burn the error out of the mind. Brimstone is added to the symbol to show that it will be quickly done; for the Lord is present. In the presence of the holy angels and of the Lamb means that the spread of the truth which destroys the refuge of lies takes place on the earth, and not in. hell, the grave. The &quot;smoke” of their torment means that the destruction of the error will hurt them so badly that it will never be forgotten I</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">' ‘Eternal Torment” of the Deoil</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">HE doctrine of &quot;eternal torment” never made anybody good; it never converted a soul; it never wilL The doctrine is of the devil; those under Satanic influence are its advocates. Jesus said: &quot;God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit andin truth” (John 4:24) if they would have their worship accepted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Hell-fire screechers have been ranting for about fifteen centuries, and today there is everywhere a woeful lack of reverence for God. The preachers, taken in the net of their own weaving, have repudiated the Bible and are fighting among themselves; and the bitter pill of truth which will be forced down their throats will cause them to ‘gnaw their tongues for pain.’ Any person who will support any system of religion which teaches a conglomeration of confusing theories either is himself dishonest or else he does not stop to think.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The Altoonians want hell preached to deter lawbreakers! It will never work. Error does not sanctify. God's wrath (the dying process} is upon the sinner-world; His vengeance (the death sentence) abides upon those who prove themselves incorrigibly bad; but His love and mercy and longsuffering search out and bless those who are honest at heart and who are themselves desirous of extending love and mercy and blessing to others. &quot;Do unto others as ye would have them do unto you.” “Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">It is the goodness of God that makes people good and brings them to reformation. God is the embodiment of love; His mercy endureth for ever. St Paul says: “Despisest thou the riches of his [God's] goodness and forbearance and longsuffering; not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance T But after thy hardness and impenitent heart, treas-urest up unto thyself wrath, against the day of , wrath, and revelation of the righteous judgment of God; who will render to every man according to his deeds.”—Romans 2:4-6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">We have reached the cross-roads. Those who preach a mean and devilish god, one who has a diabolical abyss full of fire for the wicked, must soon lick the dust; and those who .teach and magnify the God of mercies and of all grace will surely be manifested. God has an arrangement, already set in motion, which will vindicate His plan, His character, and His people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The odd and senseless thing about this matter is the publicity. Why a newspaper syndicate should waste one page of printers’ ink, go to ■the expense of having their artist make the illustrations, have it copyrighted, and give it the space, is beyond our comprehension. Such a flagrant misuse of a vehicle for news and for what ought to be for the public weal, even if the editors are ignorant of theology, will surely have an accounting when the world is brought before the judgment bar of Christ When will the newspapers recognize their responsibility to humankind in the food they dish out for the mind to masticate! Such abominable, God-dishonoring, demoralizing, garbage food is inexcusable; and it is far worse for the morals of the people than are disgusting divorce suits and the publishing of other scandals, for the reason that these latter can be charged up to wayfaring humanity and credited to some weakness and soon forgotten; but the abominations of doo&gt; trinal error are given in the name of God, in the name of truth, and some few people will bo silly enough to believe and be further undermined in character by them.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark48"></a>A Desirable Government ■ /_____</span></h5>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">(Broadcast from WATCHTOWER WBBR on a wave lencth of 278 maters, by Jtodgo X F. ItatberfoM)</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">A</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> GOVERNMENT is a body politic, governed or controlled by duly constituted authority.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">A desirable government is one the powers of which are exercised in a just and righteous manner for the greatest good to all the people. Such government would bring a blessing to all people who desire to do right and who try to do right</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">For more than 6,000 years man has attempted to establish a government that is satisfactory. Today the leading statesmen of the world freely admit that their efforts toward establishing a desirable government have thus far failed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">What honest person would approve the present government at Washington,' which is besmeared with oil on every side! Who would desire a government the administrators of which are always seeking selfish interest, giving no heed to the welfare of the people!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">There is not a government on earth today that satisfies any reasonable proportion of the people. Discontent exists everywhere; selfishness is always to the fore; all nations are practically bankrupt, and many of them are ruled by dictators. Every effort at reformation has proven abortive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The statesmen of the world have attempted, by leagues and similar compacts, to solve the difficulty. The financiers have made an attempt. Church denominations have put forth every effort. All have failed. The reason is that all have ignored God’s way. Jehovah has said: “As the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways ... than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts.” (Isaiah 55:9) Man's extremity should cause him calmly to consider God’s way for establishing a desirable government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">In Eden Adam had an ideal government. When he sinned he lost it; and every effort since then has met with failure to establish a righteous government. While some efforts at reformation have made progress, not one has succeeded in bringing the desire of the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">God promised that through the seed of </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">Ahr</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">a. ham all the families of the earth should bo blessed. This promise is certain to be earned into effect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">' The seed of Abraham is the Messiah, the Christ. Orthodox Jews have for centuries past expected the Messiah to establish an ideal government Christians have vaguely looked forward to a time of the second coming of the Lord, the setting up of His kingdom; and all of the denominations have taught their members to pray as Jesus taught them to pray: “Thy kingdom come; thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">There Is </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">But</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> One </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Remedy</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">H</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">OW, then, can we expect the will of God to be done on earth as it is in heaven? Is there any hope of reforming those who indulge in fraudulent practices, in oil scandals, or like schemes to defraud men! Is it possible to remedy their wrongs by sending them to prison or by holding them up to the scorn of mankind! I answer, No I Long efforts at this have failed. If we would for a moment consider the real cause why men indulge in such wrong, then we could see that there is but one remedy. The reason why men in high official positions become unfaithful to the people is because of their weakness, and their weakness is inherited by reason of the fall of Adam. No one should condone the wrongful course of these high officials. Indulging in abuse of them will do no good. What we want to see is how the Lord is going to establish a different condition of affairs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">God provided through His beloved Son redemption of the human race, and promised that at Christ’s second coming each should have an opportunity to profit by this great redemptive price; that He would then establish His kingdom, and that those who would be obedient to it would be restored. Now we may be sure that the kingdom of the Lord will not be entrusted to selfish men. The kingdoms of earth are tottering; many have already fallen. The whole world is in distress and perplexity, and the rulers do not know what to expect. God, through His prophet, referring to this time said: “And in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom shall not be left to other people, hut it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever.”—Daniel 2:44.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The time has come for the establishment of the Lord’s kingdom. We know this because the old order has ended and is being destroyed. If you would attempt to build a large apartment house on a lot where there are ramshackle buildings, before laying the foundation for your new structure you would first tear away the old and clean up the ground. That is exactly what the Lord is now doing. He is removing the old ramshackle forms of government, and cleaning up the ground preparatory to the beginning of His reign of righteousness. We are not guessing about who is to be the governor of this kingdom. God, through his prophet, looking down to this time said concerning Jesus: &quot;And the government shall be upon his shoulder; and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counselor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace. Of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end.*—Isaiah 9:6,7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">For centuries Satan has been the god of the evil world in which men have existed. We are ; told in Revelation 20:1-3, that when the Lord : begins the setting up of His kingdom or government, Satan shall be restrained that he may deceive the nations no more. Satan has been the invisible ruler of all the world for these many centuries; but now there is to be a new invisible Ruler. The apostle Peter, referring to this, said: ' “We, according to his promise, look for new heavens [invisible ruling power] and a new earth [a visible ruling power], wherein dwelleth righteousness.” (2 Peter 3:13) This new invisible ruling power is the Christ, the Messialu</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Who Art Earth’/ Rulert &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">W</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">HO then will constitute die visible rulers or representatives of the mighty King of kings and Lord of lords! These visible rulers are to be men who have proved their loyalty to truth and righteousness, and who shall be brought forth for that purpose. I will give you the Scriptural proof of this fact Take your Bible and read the 11th Chapter of Hebrews. There you will see a list of men enumerated by the Apostle, from Abel to the last of the prophets. These were faithful men, who loved righteousness and hated iniquity. They were not popular in the world. On the contrary they were stoned; they were sawn asunder; they were slain with the sword; they wandered in deserts, being destitute, afflicted, tormented; of whom the world was not worthy. They were loyal to God under the most adverse circumstances and conditions. They all died in faith, and have been sleeping in the dust since. The Apostle in this chapter shows that when the Christ, the seed of Abraham, the royal family of heaven, is complete, these faithful men of old will have a resurrection. They will come forth from the tomb as perfect men. The Lord, through His prophet, concerning them said: “Instead of thy fathers shall be thy children, whom thou mayest make princes in all the earth.”—Psalm 45:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">It has long been the custom amongst men to speak of the faithful of old as the fathers in Israel, the fathers of faith. This will not be true when these men come forth from the tomb; but they shall rather be the children or the Offspring of Christ, and shall be made rulers in all the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Then there will be a new heaven and a new earth; that is to say, a new invisible ruling power and a new visible ruling power. Looking to that time, God’s prophet said: &quot;Behold, a king shall reign in righteousness, and princes shall rule in judgment” (Isaiah 32:1) Here again the Lord makes the clear distinction between the king that rules in righteousness, who is the Christ, and the princes, the visible rulers who will rule in judgment. Judgment means judicial determination according to the law. The same Prophet says: “Ou<sup>7</sup>: of Zion [the invisible ruling powers] shall go forth the law, and the word of the Lord [judicial determination] from Jerusalem.” (Isaiah 2:3) It is therefore dear that selfish men will not be putting in vogue their laws; but these perfect men on earth will be the instruments in the hand of the Lord to minister to the people the very things they heed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Now in proof that this government will not be an unrighteous one, we read concerning it: “With righteousness shall he judge the poor, and reprove with equity for the meek of the earth: . . . righteousness shall be the girdle of his loins, and faithfulness the girdle of his reins. . . . They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain [kingdom]: for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea.” (Isaiah 11:4-9) There will be no one permitted in that government to steal the oil that is in the earth, nor to rob the people by exorbitant taxation, nor to lay selfish schemes to .control the masses of mankind. There will be none permitted to oppress the poor, nor to rob the rich; but everyone </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">shall </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">stand equal before the law, which shall be administered fairly, justly, and equitably toward all; and all will be compelled to obey the law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">That will be a happy time for the people. Concerning it the Prophet says: “In this mountain [kingdom] shall the Lord of hosts make unto all people a feast of fat things.” (Isaiah 25:6) Not a feast to a few, but to all the people. No longer will the fraudulent advocates of prohibition be permitted to follow their own selfish course and fill their own cellars with illicit liquor, while they prosecute and punish the poor fallow who has some in his pocket</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">No longer shall a few build the houses, charge the poor excessive and oppressive rents, and frighten- with eviction when the rent cannot be paid; for as the Prophet states: “They shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig tree; and none shall make them afraid.” —Micah 4:4; Isaiah 65 :21,22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">When Warh No More '</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">I</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">N TIMES past selfish rulers of the earth,' desiring to accomplish some selfish end, have fallen out with each other. Instead of going themselves to fight it out they declared war between their subjects, and enacted conscription laws compelling the people to go forth and fight each other while the rulers stayed at home. Under the righteous reign of Christ, war will no longer be permitted. Selfishness will not be encouraged. Love and righteousness will be encouraged and the people will not wish to war. The Lord will see to it that war will cease; for the Prophet says: &quot;He . . . shall rebuke strong nations afar off [those that seek war]; and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruninghooks: nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.”—Micah 4:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Now we see that the nations are being shaken by trouble. This is the time-mentioned by the Lord when He says: “I will shake all nations, and [then] the desire of all nations shall come.” —Haggai 2:7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">What really is the desire of manf I answer: A government of righteousness insuring to man life, liberty and happiness. Is it possible for these blessings to comef</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">, This new government will meet all desires ofl mankind; for it will provide everything that man wants. A blessing is that which brings benefit to people. The greatest of these benefits is life, which, to be enjoyed, must be endowed with peace and happiness. These are the things that man possessed in Eden before he sinned. These things he lost; these are the things wnich Jesus' blood purchased for man; and all of God's prophets foretold that these are the things which the new government will restore to man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Life Comet from God</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">L</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">IFE is the gift of God, through Jesus Christ our Lord. (Romans 6:23) This means that all who will be granted life everlasting must accept the Lord Jesus as the great Redeemer and Ruler. Adam sinned, and brought death and trouble upon his offspring. Jesus died to provide the gift o£ life and its attendant blessings. ‘'Therefore, as by the offence of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation; even ■ so by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men unto justification of life.’* (Romans 5:18) Jesus laid down His human life that mankind might have life. (John 10:10; 6:51) The coming of the Lord and the setting up of His kingdom are for the very purpose of granting life everlasting to the millions of people on earth, if they will accept and obey His new order and rule.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Concerning this the Apostle said: “Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord; and he shall send Jesus Christ, which before was preached unto you: whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution of all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began. For Moses truly said unto the fathers, A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me; him shall ye hear in all things whatsoever he shall say unto you.” (Acts 3:1922) Then those who refuse to obey him shall not go to eternal torment, but shall be destroyed. —Acts 3:23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">All the prophets foretold this coming restitution of man. (Acts 3: 24) Even those who have been wicked shall have a chance to live, if they will turn away from their wickedness, and do right. (Ezekiel 18:27,28) Concerning these Jesus said: “Verily, verily, I say unto you, If a man keep my saying, he shall never see</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">death”; “Whosoever liveth and believeth in ma shall never die.” (John 8:51; 11:26) Knowing . that the old world is passing away, that the new government is coming in, that the time of restoration is here, we can now confidently say that </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">millions now living win never die. For</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> this reason the Bible Students are proclaiming this message of good news throughout the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Liberty and Happinese Dttirtd &nbsp;&nbsp;—</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">M</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">AN has long had a great desire for liberty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The whole race has been held in bondage by Satan. Satan's representatives in the earth have oppressed the common people. It has been a favorite scheme of Satan’s representatives to enact and enforce espionage laws denying freedom of speech, and to persecute, imprison and kill men for attempting to exercise the liberty of preaching the gospel of the Messianic kingdom. This blame cannot be laid to man; for the wrong proceeds primarily from Satan, the great oppressor. When Satan’s government is entirely gone, and the Messianic government of righteousness is in operation, the oppressor and his present power over man will be no more.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The Devil, through his earthly representatives, has taught the people that the mwises will spend eternity alive in torment and not in happiness. This is a false doctrine. “All the wicked . will he destroy.” (Psalm 145:20) The obedient * ones shall be restored to perfection of body, of mind and of heart, and shall dwell together with their loved ones in happiness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Many now are blind and deaf and lame and halt These deficiencies shall pass away under the righteous administration of the desirable government. Concerning this, God’s prophet says: “The wilderness and the solitary place shall be glad for them; and the desert shall rejoice, and blossom as the rose. It shall blossom abundantly, and rejoice even with joy and singing; the glory of Lebanon shall be given unto it, toe excellency of Carmel and Sharon; they shall see the glory of the Lord, and the excellency of our God. . . . Then the eyes of the Wind shall be opened, and the ears of the deaf shall be unstopped. Then shall the lame man leap as an hart, and the tongue of the dumb sing.”— Isaiah 35:1-6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">In order foreman to be happy he must be relieved of sickness, given health, have peace and know the truth. Under the new government these things will be granted: &quot;Behold, I will bring it health and cure, and I will core them, and will reveal unto them the abundance of peace and truth.”—Jeremiah 33:6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">We are living now in the most wonderful time of man’s history to date. We are witnessing the transition period from a bad condition to a happy condition. We are standing at the portals of the Golden Age.

<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">I</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">T WAS Wynn who made the first reference to the discussion on the doctrine of the Trinity. He was speaking with Mr. Palmer; and in the course of the conversation he said: &quot;I am not at all satisfied with what you said the other day on the subject of the Trinity. There are two passages at least which show that the early Church was right in thinking that Jesus was God. One is 1 John 5:7, which states: - &quot;There are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one? The other is found in John 10:30, ‘I and My Father are one.’ You must admit that these support the ^ruth of this doctrine.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">“Yes; that is a good point,” said Tyler, who was listening.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Without hesitation P</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">alm</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">er replied: “First, I do not agree with you respecting the view of the early Church. The Christians of the days of the apostles certainly did not believe in the doctrine of the Trinity. It became a subject of discussion during the reign of Constantine, in the fourth century A. D. Athanasius, the bishop of Alexandria, made a statement which was challenged by a presbyter named Arias. A great discussion followed, which quickly spread and, from a matter of local interest, became one of universal concern.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">“So serious was the -controversy that the leaders of the Church called a conference under the instruction of Emperor Constantine. The result of that conference was the Nicene Creed, which, as I have before stated, was only made possible by the fact that two parties with somewhat different views voted for the proposition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The point at issue was the relation of the Father and the Son. The doctrine of the Trinity’ was not proclaimed until later. The establishment of this dogma was the be</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">ginning</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> of the dark agea.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">“The first text you quote was never known to the early Church, nor to those who first steed for the Trinity. It is a spurious passage, and is not found in any manuscript earlier than He seventh century. It has evidently been inserted by an over-zealous monk in an attempt to prove the improvable. So sure are scholars on this that those who were responsible for the Bevised Version of the New Testament have omitted this text altogether, and this notwithstanding the fact that they were believers in the creed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">“The other passage turns on the question as to what Jesus meant when He said: T and my Father are one? In John 17:22, Jesus prays to the Father (and you will note that it is not to Himself) that His disciples may be one as He and the Father are one. If the oneness of Jesus and God is that They are members of a Trinity,, then as soon as our Lord’s prayer is answered, the Trinity will be destroyed; for this unity must then take in all the members of the Church.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">“The Trinity is a unity of three; and with Christ’s disciples included, it would be a unity of many. Now it is clear that the unity which should exist amongst true Christians and the Father is not that of person and being, but of spirit and purpose; and Jesus here says that in the same way as we and God are one so He and the Father are one. I think that this is quite clear. The same thought is conveyed in the Apostle’s word when he exhorts believers to be of one mind.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">“Yes, I thought you would say something like that; but you are wrong/' said Wynn triumph* antly. “If you will read what follows you will see that I am right We read that immediately after Jesus said: *1 and my Father are one/ the Jews took up stones to stone </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">Him</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">; and He said to them: ‘Many good works have I shewed you from my Father; for which of these works do ye stone meF And the Jews replied: ‘For a good work we stone thee not, but for blasphemy; and because that thou, being a man, makest thyself God I' It is evident from this that the Jews understood Jesus to say that He was God. Now if the Jews were wrong in this, then Jesus would have put them right; and the fact that he did not proves that they had the correct thought, and that we are right in believing in the deity of Jesus.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">“Why, Wynn, you have come down to reason at last,” burst out Tyler; &quot;and a very good argument it is, too.&quot; With this they both looked to Palmer to see whether he could reply. He did not appear a bit perturbed, however, but quietly replied: “A little reason, like a little knowledge, is a dangerous thing. I might say that it is customary for Bible Students to study the context of the scriptures they use. It happens that I have noted this argument, and its weakness lies in not continuing the discussion between the * Jews and Jesus a little further.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">“Wynn says that the Jews understood Jesus to say that He was God, and that if they were wrong He would have put them right. My reply is that if they had understood Him to make this claim, then He did put them right. His answer to the charge of blasphemy was, *Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye are godsF He here quoted from the 82nd Psalm, a message that was addressed to the judges in Israel; and He continued: ‘If he called them gods unto whom the word of God came, how say ye of him whom the Father hath sanctified and sent into the world, Thou blasphemest; because I said, I am the Son of God!’ [John 10:30-39] Our Lord’s argument is this: The Scriptures call men in prominent positions gods; and the Bible cannot lie. If, then, imperfect men are called gods, surely it is not blasphemy for the perfect One whom God has sent, to call Himself the Son of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">“If the Jews understood Jesus to claim that He was God, the Supreme Being, then He enlightened their minds immediately by saying that His claim was that He was the Son of God. In fact, He did not even claim so much for Himself; for the literal rendering of this passage from the Greek reads: T am a son of the God.' He actually in this expression claimed no more than every true Christian has a right to claim; viz., that he is a son of God—Jehovah. We know of course that Jesus was and is </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">the </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Son of God, and that Jehovah was His Father in a special sense.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">“Jesus never claimed equality with God, but always acknowledged His Father’s authority by stating that He had been sent by God.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">F</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">OR some time I have been thinking to suggest that you send an able investigator throughout Oklahoma and northern Texas for the purpose of gathering information concerning the persecutions of the Bible Students there during the war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">While on my lecture tour in that territory during last summer and fall, I heard some very wonderful things. For instance, I heard of a case where a Bible Student was put into jail and his home and its furnishings taken from him, and his wife persuaded not to live with him any more. He was released after a time; and his wife changed her mind and is now living with him and is in the truth. The minister who led the persecution went insane and was taken to the asylum; the banker who got the Bible Student’s home committed suicide, and the banker who got his furniture died. This is but one of many strange things which I heard.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Many who were arrested and put into jail were relieved of their money and watches when locked up; and when on being released they asked for their belongings, they received only evasive answers. I am convinced that in many instances the arrests were made simply for purposes of robbery. I can furnish some leads which may be helpful</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">’“Then came Jesus, whose coining was announced by John the Baptist; and He was pointed out as the One who would take away the sin of the world. He chose His disciples and they walked with </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">Him,</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> and He taught them for three and a half years; yet they did not understand the great mystery. They expected Jesus to be made an earthly Ung and hoped that they might be with </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">Rim</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> in the kingdom, probably in His cabinet; for He was asked if one might sit on His left and the other on His right hand in the kingdom. They expected Him to make Israel a great nation and believed that through that nation other nations would be blessed. When he was put to death they were greatly disappointed, mystified, and in great distress. (Luke 24:21) Even after His resurrection they did not understand His mission, and this is shown by their words to Him on the day that He ascended into heaven. &quot;When they therefore were come together, they asked of him, saying, Lord, wilt thou at this time restore again the kingdom to Israeli And he said unto them, It is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father hath put in his own power. But ye shall receive power, after that' the holy spirit is come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost parts of the earth. And when- he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight.”—Acts 1:6-9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">’“In obedience to the command of Jesus, these faithful disciples went to Jerusalem to the place known as. the upper room, and there waited. Ten days passed and then it was that the holy spirit, the invisible power of God, was visited upon them; and true to His promise, the disciples began to understand. -</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">/&quot;Jesus had now ascended on high and presented the merit of His sacrifice before Jehovah ; and the acceptance of this was manifested by the giving of the holy spirit to His disciples, who had been His consecrated followers for three and a half years. Doubtless the angels of heaven now began to know something about the great mystery. What joy must have been in heaven when Jesus Christ appeared before the Father and presented the merit of His sacrifice and was received by Jehovah! Surely the heavenly host must have sung His praises. They had beheld Him triumphing over death and the grave and now exalted to a position in heaven next to the Father. It must have been a great joy to the heavenly host, even as contemplation of it was a great joy to Jesus Himself, &quot;For the joy that was set before him [he] endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God,&quot; (Hebrews 12:2) What joy must have filled the , hearts of His disciples when they began to Ok derstand the mystery of God and to see how wonderfully He had led them and their fathers before them, preparing them now for the revs* lation of this great truth !</span></p>

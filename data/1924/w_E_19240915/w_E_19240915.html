<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">THIS JOURNAL AND ITS SACRED MISSION</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">T</span><span class="font6">HIS </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">journal is one of the </span><span class="font6">prime factors or instruments in the system of Bible instruction, or “Seminary </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Extension”, now being </span><span class="font6">presented in all parts of the civilized world by the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, chartered A. D. 1884, “For the Pro</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">motion </span><span class="font6">of Christian Knowledge”. It not only serves as a class room where Bible students may meet in the study of the divine Word but </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">also </span><span class="font6">as a channel of communication through which they may be reached with announcements of the Society’s conventions and </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">of the coining </span><span class="font6">of its traveling representatives, styled &quot;Pilgrims”, and refreshed with reports of its conventions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Our “Berean Lessons” are topical rehearsals or reviews of our Society’s published Studies most entertainingly arranged, and </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">very </span><span class="font6">helpful to all who would merit the only honorary degree which the Society accords, viz., </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Verbi Dei Minister</span><span class="font6"> (V. D. M.), which translated into English is </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Minister of God’s Word.</span><span class="font6"> Our treatment of the International Sunday School Lessons is specially for the older </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Bible students </span><span class="font6">and teachers. By some this feature is considered indispensable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This journal stands firmly for the defense of the only true foundation of the Christian’s hope now being so generally repudiated •—redemption through the precious blood of “the man Christ Jesus, who gave himself a </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">ransom,</span><span class="font6"> [a corresponding price, a substitute] for all”. (1 Peter 1:19; 1 Timothy 2 : 6) Building up on this sure foundation the gold, silver and precious stones (1 Corinthians 3: 1115; 2 Peter 1:5-11) of the Word of God, its further mission is to “make all see what is the fellowship of the mystery which. . .has been hid in God, ... to the intent that now might be made known by the church the manifold wisdom of God”—“which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men as it is now revealed”.—Ephesians 3:5-9,10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It stands free from all parties, sects and creeds of men, while it seeks more and more to bring its every utterance into fullest subjection to the will of God in Christ, as expressed in the holy Scriptures. It is thus free to declare boldly whatsoever the Lord hath spoken—according to the divine wisdom granted unto us to understand his utterances. Its attitude is not dogmatic, but confident; for we know whereof we affirm, treading with implicit faith upon the sure promises of God. It is held as a trust, to be used only in his service; hence our decisions relative to what may and what may not appear in its columns must be according to our judgment of his good pleasure, the teaching of his Word, for the upbuilding of his people in grace and knowledge. And we not only invite but urge our readers to prove all its utterances by the infallible Word to which reference is constantly made to facilitate such testing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">TO US THE SCRIPTURES CLEARLY TEACH</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">That the church is “the temple of the living God”, peculiarly “his workmanship”; that its construction has been in progress throughout the gospel age—ever since Christ became the world’s Redeemer and the Chief Corner Stone of his temple, through which, when finished, God’s blessing shall come “to all people”, and they find access to him.—1 Corinthians 3:16, 17; Ephesians 2:20-22; Genesis 28 :14 ; Galatians 3 : 29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">That meantime the chiseling, shaping, and polishing of consecrated believers in Christ’s atonement for sin, progresses; and when the last of these “living stones”, “elect and precious,” shall have been made ready, the great Master Workman will bring all together in the first resurrection ; and the temple shall be filled with his glory, and be the meeting place between God and men throughout the Millennium.—Revelation 15 : 5-8,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">That the basis of hope, for the church and the world, lies in the fact that “Jesus Christ, by the grace of God, tasted death for every man,” “a ransom for all,” and will be “the true light which lighteth every </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">man that cometh into the world”,</span><span class="font6"> “in due time”.-— Hebrews 2:9; John 1: 9; 1 Timothy 2:5, 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">That the hope of the church is that she may be like her Lord, “see him as he is,” be “partakers of the divine nature’,’ and share his glory as his joint-heir.—1 John 3:2; John 17:24; Romans 8:17; 2 Peter 1:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">That the present mission of the church is the perfecting of the saints for the future work of service; to develop in herself every grace; to be God’s witness to the world; and to prepare to be kings and priests in the next age.—Ephesians 4:12; Matthew 24: 14 ; Revelation 1:6; 20:6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">That the hope for the world lies in the blessings of knowledge and opportunity to be brought to </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font6"> by Christ’s Millennial kingdom, </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font6">restitution of all that was lost in Adam, to all the willing and obedient, at the hands of their Redeemer and his glorified church, when all the wilfully wicked will be </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">destroyed.—</span><span class="font6">Acts 3 :19-23; Isaiah 35.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font11"><a name="bookmark19"></a>CIVILIZATION DOOMED</span></h3>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">but—Millions Now Living Will Never Die</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">T</span><span class="font9">RUE civilization is the very antithesis of barbarism. The name properly stands for education, culture, refinement, and truth. There is a civilization in name only. It is veneered, while underneath exists barbarism in its most malignant form. True civilization can be founded and builded only upon truth, justice, and righteousness, with love as the moving cause.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">During the 2,000 years past there has gradually developed what we call civilization. It has made quick and rapid growth during the past half century. It has been the boast of many nations and peoples of earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The commerce of the world has brought the peoples t&gt;f the nations into closer proximity with each other, increased education and science, and developed culture. It has performed its part in the present civilization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Politics has organized the peoples into forms of government with a few governing the masses, and has enacted many wholesome laws which have been enforced when convenient. It has performed a part in modern civilization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The religion of Jesus Christ was founded and organized in purity. Elevated above the sordid things of earth, it has been the beacon light on the mountain top to guide the honest searcher for truth over the morass into pleasant paths that lead to endless life and happiness. This true religion of Christ has had a savory influence upon men and, for a time, performed its part in civilization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">COMMERCE TURNED INTO GREED FOR GAIN</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Greed for gain and power turned legitimate commerce into wicked profiteering. The commercial giants traffic in human bloood as they do in the inanimate products of the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Ambition for power and influence has caused politicians to juggle with the rights of the people, prove unfaithful to their constituency, and use public office for private gain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The desire for bodily ease and comfort, the desire to be approved by men rather than have the approval of God, an ambition for the establishment of the Lord’s kingdom on earth before due time, and contrary to his way—these have caused the clergy to fall to the seductive influence of Satan, to become unfaithful to God and to the Lord Jesus Christ, and to form a part of present civilization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It is said that war is a relic of barbarism; and this is true. It has been said that commerce would so unite the peoples of earth that wars will no more be known; and yet in 1914 commerce produced the greatest and most devastating war of all time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It was claimed that education and science would prevent war; and yet education and science have been employed to make war more diabolical and fiendish than he barbarians ever dreamed of. The leading nations of Christendom encourage their scientists to produce the most deadly instruments of war. Recently several of the so-called civilized nations were contestants in the acquisition of a “death ray” by which it is claimed a great city like London might be wiped out in a night. This is a product of modern civilization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">“THOU SHALT NOT KILL” IGNORED</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Jesus Christ is the great Prince of Peace. He said: “Thou shalt not kill.” He taught his disciples and his followers to refrain completely from the use of carnal weapons. Yet the clergy, who claim to be teachers of his doctrines, have sanctified war and made it a holy thing. They have delighted to have their portraits and statues exhibited side by side with those of bloody warriors. They have hailed the greatest warriors as the greatest heroes of all time. When the world War came they acted as recruiting officers, turned their church buildings into recruiting offices; yea, they even accepted money for their work of preaching young men into the trenches, and told them if they died on the battlefield they would go straight to heaven. The money which the clergy received for this work was saturated with human blood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The clergy have admitted into their church organizations the greedy profiteers and the faithless politicians, and have made them the principal of their flock. The clergy were taught by the Lord that Satan is the god of this evil world; yet they have willingly become a part of it. They have failed to defend the poor and the fatherless, and have delivered them into the hands of the greedy, wicked ones to serve as targets for the war. They have dealt unjustly with the afflicted and needy, and have indulged in the wicked persecution of the meek and lowlj followers of the Prince of Peace, who dare to tell the truth; and they have caused the arrest, imprisonment and death of such.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The people have lost faith in their political leaders because they see that these are in the control of the wicked profiteers. They have lost faith in their clergy because they observe the Modernists, claiming to be representatives of the Lord and at the same time denying God’s Word, and denying the blood of Jesus as the great redemptive price of man. They mark the Fundamentalists, who claim to believe the Bible, and yet unite with wicked profiteers and politicians in their effort to foist upon mankind the League of Nations, which they hail as the “political expression of God’s kingdom on earth.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">PROMINENT MEN SENSE IMPENDING DOOM</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Millions are out of employment without homes and without means of support for themselves and loved ones. With confidence in their leaders gone, with no visible means of betterment, without God and without hope in the world, countless millions are turning to the rankest radicalism. Because of these conditions the rulers of earth are in fear and trembling. With distress and perplexity they view the situation. Some of the most profound thinkers of the present time express themselves in no uncertain terms:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Before the war people often supposed that ours was a Christian culture. The war has revealed us to ourselves. Civilization is Pagan.”—Dr. Bernard I. Bell.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Airplanes, poison gas, and hatred mixed together are spelling the doom of civilization. America is preparing for war on a scale so colossal that it has no parallel in the history of the world. Our civilization will perish unless we strive for international peace.”—Frederick J. Libby.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“We have come to the crossroads and no one knows the way out.”—H. G. Wells.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“The future is very dark. We have reached the twilight of civilization.”—Dr. H. L. Brailsford.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“No man unless he is drunk with optimism can deny that the world is very sick, and it may be a sickness unto death.” —Sir Philip Gibbs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“The United States is preparing for war that would tax us to the utmost in man-power resources.”—Secretary of War Weeks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“You responded to Europe’s need in 1917. The work is only half done; and if not completed, civilization is doomed within this generation to a catastrophe such as the world has never known.” “Force is the only thing that rules in the world. Unless you stamp out that conviction civilization is doomed upon this earth.”—Lloyd George.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">THE REASON FOR CHRISTENDOM’S DOOM</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">These great men of the world see the storm of fire and blood irresistibly sweeping on to the destruction of human institutions; but they assign no cause, and are at a loss for an adequate remedy. Hence their perplexity and distress. Jehovah knew the end from the beginning. He foresaw this dreadful day, and through his prophet foretold it. He pictured how the blackness of fear would be upon the faces of all the governing elements. With the voice of authority he speaks to them through his prophet, thus: “Come near, ye nations, to hear; and hearken, ye people; let the earth hear, and all that is therein: the world, and all things that come forth of it. For the indignation of the Lord is upon all nations, . . . For it is the day of the Lord’s vengeance.”—Isaiah 34: 1, 2, 8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">But why should Jehovah manifest his displeasure and vengeance against the nations of earth? The answer is that Satan’s empire has reached its full in wickedness, and it must fall before the onward and triumphant march of the Prince of Peace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The only nation on earth organized and controlled by Jehovah was the nation of Israel. He made it a typical nation. He gave that nation a perfect code of laws, and promised them that he would grant life to them if they kept those laws. He warned them against disobedience. They failed to keep the law, were disobedient to him; and he executed his decree of punishment against that nation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Lucifer, who because of his disobedience became Satan, the Devil, without hindrance from Jehovah overreached the nations round about and organized them. He exercised his baneful influence over Israel; and that nation fell a victim and was overthrown in the year 606 B. C. There it was that God declared that he would not interrupt the reign of the Gentiles under the supermind of Satan “until he should come whose right it is” and to him, the Righteous One, would God give the power, as well as the right, to rule. The period of the Gentile Times was to continue for 2.520 years, beginning in 606 B. C., and necessarily would end in 1914. There the Gentile dominion legally ended; and then and there he whose right it is to reign assumed such authority. It was in that year that civilization, so-called, reached the zenith of its glory; and in that same year its disintegration began.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Prior to that time men with honest desires put forth their best efforts to establish a righteous government. But being imperfect, their power and influence were nullified in a large degree by forces of evil; and Satan succeeded in keeping all the nations subject to his own invisible power. He has completely dominated the three ruling factors of the earth, and has truly been the god of this world; namely, civilization so-called.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">THE PROMISED KINGDOM</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Long centuries ago, through his holy prophets, God promised a kingdom of righteousness which would rid the earth of the oppressor and his wicked methods. He promised a coming seed, or ruler, through whom these blessings should flow out to humankind. Concerning that ruler he said, through his prophet: “The government shall be upon his shoulder; and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace. Of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end.” (Isaiah 9:6, 7) Of that coming blessed kingdom all prophets wrote and the Psalmist sang; and the godly ones looked forward with eagerness to that happy time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">When Jesus of Nazareth was on earth he taught his disciples in corroboration of the words of the prophets. The burden of his speech was the coming of that blessed kingdom. They were familiar with the teachings of the prophets; and hearing again and again the words of the Master concerning that kingdom, they inquired of him in these words: “Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the proof of thy presence and of the end of the world?”—Matthew 24: 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The disciples knew that Satan, the evil one, was the prince or invisible ruler; for Jesus had told them so. They knew that there is enmity between the seed of promise, the Messiah, and Satan and his seed. They knew that God had said that in due time the seed of promise should bruise Satan’s head. They knew that the prophets had written of the coming day of God’s vengeance upon Satan’s empire, and that this vengeance would be expressed through the one chosen to be the King, the Prince of Peace. It therefore necessarily follows that, when the world should end, and the kingdom of righteousness be set up, if the powers in control did not willingly submit to the great Prince and Ruler of righteousness, God’s vengeance would be expressed against the wicked systems.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It is, therefore, important first to determine definitely the time of the end of the world, the Lord’s presence, and the time for him to take unto himself his power to reign, in order that we may properly understand the time when God would express his vengeance against the ruler of darkness and against his organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The vengeance of God is not against the rank and file of humanity, but against the ruling factors. The Lord, through the Apostle, expressly states that the creation, mankind in general, are groaning and travailing in pain, waiting for the manifestation of his loving kindness through his kingdom. Let it be understood then that God’s vengeance is against entrenched wickedness in high places, and that this vengeance is to be expressed when the old world legally ends. Now as to the answer of Jesus to the question propounded: “What shall be the proof of thy presence and of the end of the world?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Jesus answered: “The nations will become angry, and God’s wrath is come.” “Nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.” (Revelation 11:18; Matthew 24:7) Without doubt the nations here embrace those that would claim to be Christian nations, those that claim to be the authors and producers of modern civilization, about which there has been so much boasting. Exactly in harmony thereto the great World War began August 1, 1914, affecting every nation of Christendom either directly ot indirectly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Jesus then said that the World War would be quickly followed by famine and pestilence, earthquakes and revolutions in various parts of the earth. These things have been literally fulfilled since 1914. Millions fell victims to the great famines of Russia and other European countries. The great Spanish influenza, a pestilence such as the earth has never known, destroyed more lives in twelve months than the World War had done in four years. There have been more literal earthquakes since 1914 than known in all the history of man; and revolutions, which began in 1918, have spread from one country to another.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">JESUS’ WORDS HAVE HAD FULFILMENT</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The words of Jesus foretelling that which would mark the end of the world were spoken prophetically. Prophecy means to foretell the happening of future events; and when those things foretold have exactly transpired, then we may know that such is a fulfilment of prophecy. A fulfilled prophecy we call physical facts. The physical facts beyond doubt prove that the old world ended in 1914. The things above mentioned, war, famine, pestilence, etc., Jesus said would mark the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">beginning</span><span class="font9"> of trouble at the end of the world. The inference is that there would be much more to follow. Then he spoke of the persecution of Christians. During that World War the persecution of humble and faithful followers of Jesus started in Germany, spread to England, to Canada and to America; and the records show that a more relentless persecution was never indulged in by human beings. This persecution of Christians was inspired and carried on by clergymen and their allies in polities and profiteering.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Jesus declared that at the same time there would be a great falling away from the faith; and it a well-known fact that during the past ten years there has arisen the greatest apostacy ever known amongst the clergy. The Modernists have assumed a bold position, denying the Word of God, denying the fall of man and the redemption by Christ Jesus, and teaching instead the doctrine of evolution, which is destructive of faith in God’s Word. They have engaged in controversy with the Fundamentalists, who claim to believe the Bible, yet who in truth and in fact deny the teachings of Jesus, his kingdom and the blessings it will bring.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Jesus furthermore said that the return of the Jews to Palestine would be an evidence corroborative of his presence and the end of the world. It was in 1918 that the Jews, acting under authority granted by world powers, took control of Palestine and began to lay in Palestine the foundation of a government of the Jews, by the Jews, and for the Jews.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Jesus stated as a further evidence of his presence and the end of the -world that there would be “upon the earth distress of nations, with perplexity; the sea [restless humanity’] and the waves roaring; men’s hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth; for the powers of heaven shall be shaken.” (Luke 21:25, 2G) This testimony of fulfilled prophecy is complete proof of the end of the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">By 1918 fulfilled prophecy had so definitely settled the matter of the end of the world that there could be no doubt about it. Every Christian should have known that, and particularly the clergy, who claim to be teachers of Christianity. When these facts were called to the attention of the clergy, and they were reminded that these evidenced the end of the world, and that the kingdom of heaven is at hand, instead of receiving the testimony they scoffed at the proofs. The Lord had foretold that this would be an additional evidence of the end. Speaking through his inspired Apostle, he said: “There shall come in the last days scoffers, walking after their own lusts, and saying, Where is the promise [proof] of his coming? for since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation.” (2 Peter 3: 3, 4) The Apostle then adds that for this reason they are willingly ignorant concerning the end of the world. In other words, they did not want to know that the world had ended; for it interfered with their selfish desires. Even politicians and statesmen of the world saw that the old world has passed; they plainly said so. At the Paris conference it was announced: “The old world is ended. We must build a new.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">That was the opportunity of the clergy, not only to know, but to call attention of the people to the teachings of God’s Word; to show them that the time had come for the Prince of Peace to reign, that the kingdom of heaven, for which they had prayed, was at hand, that the kingdom of God is the only remedy for their multitudinous ills. In this the clergy failed; yea, they went even further; for when the profiteers and politicians brought forth a League of Nations, manifestly the product of the devil, to keep mankind in subjection to him, the clergy with one accord hailed it as “the political expression of God’s kingdom on earth” and urged the people to join it. Herein they were guilty of blasphemy, as the Prophet had foretold; for while assuming to be teachers of God’s Word they declared that a man-made institution, superinduced and managed by Satan, represented the kingdom of God. They should have known that God, through his prophet, had plainly stated that a combination such as the League of Nations could never stand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">This warning God plainly gave through his prophet in these words: “Associate yourselves, 0 ye people, and ye shall be broken in pieces; and give ear, all ye of far countries; gird yourselves, and ye shall be broken in pieces; gird yourselves, and ye shall be broken in pieces. Take counsel together, and it shall come to nought; speak the word and it shall not stand.”—Isaiah 8: 9,10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Upon the clergy rested a greater responsibility because of their fiduciary relationship to the Lord. They had assumed to teach his Word and to instruct the people in the way that they should go. There is nothing in the Scriptures that authorizes the clergy to participate in politics or to advocate war. On the contrary the Lord admonished them to keep themselves separate from the world. (2 Corinthians 6:15-18) It is a fact well-known to the people that the clergy have not done this, but have indulged in politics and have advocated war. In a speech before the Democratic National Convention in New York city in June, Mr. Bryan said, in substance: “What the people need more than anything else is to get nearer to God and to follow the Prince of Peace.” If the clergy would tell the people as much, they would do much to better conditions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">PRESENT OUTLOOK ONE OF ANXIETY</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Six years have passed since the war. All thinking people admit that conditions are worse today than at any time before or since the war. Democracy has practically perished from the earth. The leading nations of Europe are governed by dictators. The value of their money has gradually depreciated. The unemployed are so many that they are without number. The people are oppressed with burdensome taxes, not only to defray expenses of the World War, but to make extensive preparations for another war. Science and education are called into action, and every conceivable power and means possible are used in a further preparation for war. Truly did Mr. Lloyd George say:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Force is the only thing that rules in the world. Unless you stamp out that conviction, civilization is doomed upon this earth.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In America there is great unrest, perplexity and distress. The soldier boys, who were forced to war by the profiteers and politicians aided and abetted by faithless preachers, have been cast aside, scorned and neglected. They bore the heat and burden of the day, while profiteers and politicians corrupted and indulged themselves in the nation’s wealth. The soldiers are not in a happy mood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The farmers, who produced the material wealth of the nation, are the victims of profiteers and conscienceless politicians. Their faith in the Bible has waned, and their confidence in the clergy gone. They are in anything but a happy mood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In this land, which was founded as a home of religious liberty, there now threatens a great religious war. In the campaign just opened, this issue will be fought and will produce a worse rather than a better condition amongst mankind. Corruption in high places is freely admitted. In the language of a noted politician, “There is a saturnalia of corruption now.” In every branch of the government, in business, in politics and amongst the churches, selfishness is predominant. Individual selfishness has been crystalized into laws, and these are enforced at the whims of the interests. Indeed, selfishness has gone to seed, and the time for the harvest of blood and fire is due.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The vhole creation is trembling upon the brink of a volcano. There seems to be an unseen and sinister power that is goading the people on to desperation. Indeed this is true and was foretold by the Lord: “And I saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet. For they are the spirits of devils, working miracles, which go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world, to gather them to the battle of that great day of (lod Almighty. Behold, I come as </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font9"> thief. Blessed is he that watchcth, and keepeth his garments, lest he walk naked, and they see his shame. And he gathered them together into a place called in the Hebrew tongue Armageddon.”—Revelation 16 : 13-16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The book of Revelation is written in symbolic language. “Spirits” are symbolic of doctrines. Hence the teachings or doctrines of devils are here mentioned; and these doctrines and teachings go forth from the mouth of the “dragon”, the “beast”, and the “false prophet”. The “dragon” is one of the names applied to the devil bent on destroying God’s people. The “beast” is the title applied to the governing factors of the earth, made up of big business, big politicians, and big preachers. “False prophet” is the title applied to ecclesiastical teachers, who claim to be the prophets of God, yet are the prophets of Baal, teaching false doctrines to deceive the people. These three with one accord join in the message that the present order is by divine right; that war is holy and should be indulged in; that the people should patriotically support war whether right or wrong; that thoge who fail to heed these doctrines will suffer eternally in a hell-fire of brimstone. These false teachings, false doctrines, and false misrepresentations of the interests of the people, are goading them on to the great battle of Armageddon, a time of trouble such as the world has never known.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">COULD HAVE PREVENTED TROUBLE</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The clergy, having claimed to represent the Lord and assumed his name, are called in the Scriptures by the title gods or mighty ones to judge amongst the people. It would be understood, of course, that when the world ends, which is now an established fact, the time of God’s judgment upon the nations and upon the gods or mighty ones composing the ruling factors of the nations, would take place. Of that time the Prophet says: “God stand-eth in the congregation of the mighty: he judgeth amongst the gods [chief ones in ecclesiasticism].” To these he says: “How long will ye judge unjustly, and accept the persons of the wicked ? [This they have done.] Defend the poor and fatherless; do justice to the afflicted and needy; rid them out of the hand of the wicked.” (This they have failed to do.)—Psalm 82 :1-4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The great events happening since 1914 in fulfilment of the prophetic words of Jesus were sufficient to awaken the clergy throughout the earth to the fact that the kingdom of heaven is at hand. But they have not heeded this testimony; and of them God’s prophet continues to speak thus: “They know not, neither will they understand; they walk on in darkness; all the foundations of the earth are out of course.” This is exactly the condition of the world today as foretold by the prophets, and as seen by the statesmen of the world just quoted; and yet the clergy are seemingly oblivious to it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The Scriptures make it plain that had the clergy been faithful and told the people the meaning of these things, God would have spared the nations called Christendom from the impending national disaster. For this reason the clergy stand reprehensible before God for the great trouble that is ahead.—Jeremiah 18:8,9; 23:21, 22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Instead of heeding the words of the Lord and teaching the people the truth the clergy turn their churches into recruiting stations and preach the boys into the trenches; and for this reason God’s prophet says to them: “In thy skirts is found the blood of the souls of the poor innocents: I have not found it by secret search, but upon all these.” (Jeremiah 2: 34) It was the principal ones of their flock with whom they conspired and acted to carry on the war. It is they, and the principal of their flock, who oppressed the poor. It is they who have called themselves shepherds, but who have fed themselves and let the flock starve for the hearing of the Word of the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“Thus saith the Lord God unto the shepherds, Woe be to the shepherds of Israel [spiritual Israel—Christendom] that do feed themselves! should not the shepherds feed the flocks? Ye eat the fat, and ye clothe you with the wool; ye kill them that are fed; but ye feed not the flock. The diseased have ye not strengthened, neither have ye healed that which was sick, neither have ye bound up that which was broken, neither have ye brought again that which was driven away, neither have ye sought that which was lost; but with force and with cruelty have ye ruled them. And they were scattered because there is no shepherd: and they became meat to all the beasts of the field when they were scattered.” “Thus saith the Lord God, Behold, I am against the shepherds; and I will require my flock at their hand, and cause them to cease from feeding the flock; neither shall the shepherds feed themselves any more; for I will deliver my flock from their mouth, that they may not be meat for them.” Therefore, says the Lord to them: “Howl, ye shepherds, and cry; and wallow yourselves in the ashes, ye principal of the flock; for the days of your slaughter and of your dispersions are accomplished; and ye shall fall like a pleasant vessel. And the shepherds shall have no way to flee, nor the principal of the flock to escape.”—Ezekiel 34: 1-5,10; Jeremiah 25: 34, 35.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Thus God expresses his righteous indignation against a wicked system that has paraded before men in his name and has been used to oppress poor, unfortunate humanity. The Lord Jesus, looking to this great expression of indignation upon the ruling factors after failing to hear the testimony of fulfilled prophecy, said: “For then shall be great tribulation, such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time, no nor ever shall be. And except those days should be shortened, there should no flesh be saved: but for the elect’s sake those days shall be shortened.” (Matthew 24:21,22) This prophecy is a quotation from the book of Daniel, which says: “And at that time shall Michael stand up, the great prince which standeth for the children of thy people; and there shall be a time of trouble, such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time: and at that time thy people shall be delivered, every one that shall be found written in the book.” (Daniel 12:1) This definitely identifies the trouble that will overthrow civilization with the standing forth of the Prince of Peace for the blessing of mankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Again, God’s prophet expresses it in no uncertain terms when he describes how big business, in big combines, deal with the people and bring forth their great exhibition of science, invention and education, and use it to oppress mankind, until the trouble storm breaks over the heads of the people. Describing that trouble he says: “Their soul is melted because of trouble. They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, and are at their wits’ end. Then they cry unto the Lord in their trouble, and he bringeth them out of their distresses. He maketh the storm a calm, so that the waves thereof are still. Then are they glad because they be quiet; so he bringeth them unto their desired haven.”—Psalm 107: 26-30.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">I speak not with any spirit of vindictiveness against the clergy. I speak the truth in love. Would now that the clergy might awaken to the importance of the hour, and bend every faculty with which they are endowed in making known to the people that Satan’s empire is at an end; that the Lord Jesus is here; that the kingdom of heaven is at hand! If they would do this, they might save themselves and do a valiant service to the people, and retrieve some of their wrong and be to some extent an honor to the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">WHY MILLIONS WILL NEVER DIE</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">But let the people take courage. The darkness that now enshrouds the world shortly will be lifted; and the Sun of righteousness, with healing in his beams, will shine into the minds and hearts of those who desire the blessings which God has in store for them. There is a reason for this, and the reason assigned in the Scriptures I now here give.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">God created the earth for man’s habitation. He created it not in vain; and the earth abideth forever. (Isaiah 45: 12,18; Ecclesiastes 1:4) He intends for the earth to be inhabited with a happy, obedient race of mankind. He created the first man perfect, and put man on earth for that purpose. Because of disobedience Adam was sentenced to death. By inheritance all of his children were born imperfect, and are therefore sinners. (Psalm 51:5; Romans 5:12) God has created no man since, but has permitted man to exercise his powers of propagation; and thus there has been brought upon earth millions of people who have lived awhile and died.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Looking forward to a time when opportunity for life would be given to all thes''. Jehovah made this promise to Abraham, to wit: “In thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed.” (Genesis 12:3; 22:18-22; Galatians 3: 8, 16, 27, 29) Jehovah could not set as.de the judgment against man, but he could make provis on for its satisfaction. Therefore he could consistently promise, as he did in these words: “I will ransom them from the power of the grave; I will redeem them from death; 0 death, I will be thy plagues; 0 grave, I will be thy destruction; repentance shall be hid from mine eyes.”—Hosea 13 : 14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In the course of time God sent his beloved Son into the earth. Jesus came that the people might have l.fe, and have it more abundantly. (John 10: 10) He cams to give himself a ransom, according to God’s promise. (Matthew 20: 28) He died upon the cross and rose from the dead, providing the great redemptive price for man. His death must result beneficially for all, in this, that every man must be brought to a knowledge of the truth and have the opportunity to know and accept the Lord. (1 Timothy 2: 3-6; Hebrews 2:9) The seed of promise, through whom the blessing is to come, is the Christ. (Galatians 3:16,27-29) The Christ is composed of Jesus, the Head, and his body members designated the Church, that is to say, his true and faithful followers even unto death. These constitute the new invisible ruling powers, or new heavens.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">When Jesus was about to leave the earth he told his followers that he would return for them, that they should be with him. (John 14:1-4) That time is at hand. The setting up of the Lord’s kingdom and its operation is for the purpose of giving the living an opportunity for life, and for the awakening of the dead out of the tomb that they may have an opportunity for life. Jesus comes “to judge the living and the dead.” This means to try them and to give the obedient ones life. It is manifest that this scripture must be fulfilled at some time. The proof shows that the old world has ended. The Lord is here. The greatest crisis of the ages is now reached because of this fact.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The nations are all mustering their forces for the great conflict foretold; for God purposes to overthrow Satan’s organization through his beloved Son, Christ Jesus. This great time of trouble the Lord has promised to cut short in order that many human beings might be saved; and when the storm has spent its fury and the peaceful smile of the Lord is turned to the peoples of earth, then shall they be glad because they have come to their haven of rest. Now it is appropriate for the Christians to “say among the nations, that the Lord Teigneth; the world also shall be established that it shall not be moved; he shall judge the people righteously.” (Psalm 96: 10) The Lord will establish a civilization that shall never be moved. Then the Lord will minister to the obedient ones peace, prosperity, liberty, happiness and life everlasting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The old heavens and old earth mean the invisible ruling power of Satan and the visible civilization, so-called, of earth. The apostle Peter after describing this as passing away in a fiery time of trouble, adds: “Nevertheless, we, according to his promise, look for a new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.” (2 Peter 3:13) The Revelator, in beautiful poetic phrase, describes the new heaven and new earth and the blessings that will come to mankind: “And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away: and there was no more sea.” (Revelation 21:1) New heaven here means Christ, the Messiah, the invisible ruling power. The earth is a symbolical expression of the earthly phase of Christ’s kingdom, of society organized on earth on a righteous basis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Then God will bless the people. “God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain; for the former things are passed away. And he that sat upon the throne «iid, Behold, I make all things new.”—Revelation 21: 4, 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Assured of the fact that we are standing now in the presence of the Lord at the beginning of his reign, and certain of the fact that the kingdom of heaven is at hand, and that we are standing at the portals of the. Golden Age, it is with confidence that we announce that millions now living will never die.—John 8:51; 11: 2G.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Affliction shall not rise up the second time”—Nahum 1:9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">N</span><span class="font9">UMEROUS are the afflictions that have come upon the peoples of earth; too numerous are they to mention. Among the things that afflict mankind are ignorance, superstition, bigotry, bossism, and conscienceless profiteers, who deal in human rights and traffic in human blood with the same boldness and deliberation that they do with the chattel products of the open market. Another affliction is the deceitful, professional politician, who claims to represent the rights of the people while looking after private interests. Added to these are the unfaithful preachers, who claim to represent the Lord and to tell the people what is for their good, while in fact they represent the devil and walk hand in hand with his other wicked representatives. These three are the ruling factors of the earth, and are the seed of the oppressor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">To these afflictions are added poverty, famine, pestilence and war, anguish, distress, tribulation, trouble, sorrow, sickness, disease and death—all the outgrowth of sin. For centuries the people have eaten their bread in affliction, during which time they have shed tears of bitterness sufficient to float the navies of the world. They have groaned, and still groan, in pain and oppression, waiting for relief, but knowing not how and when it will come. Thanks be to God, relief is in sight; and the Christian can know and appreciate this fact.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The real Christian must have perfect love, which means love for God, for Christ Jesus, for his kingdom of righteousness, and a keen desire to see the people uplifted and blessed. Where is the man with love in his heart that would not haste to bring relief to his suffering fellow creature, if such be possible? Were you ever in</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">prison, suffering indignities unjustly heaped upon you and anxiously waiting for some word from your friends that would bring hope and relief? The whole human family is now in the prison-house of affliction and death. In a short time the great and righteous One will relieve them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The Lord commands his ambassadors now to bring this good news to the people, thus to comfort those that mourn. This good news must be preached to all the world for a witness. The people should now be told of the kingdom, and that all those who render themselves in obedience to it shall be relieved of their distress and oppression and restored to lasting peace and happiness and life. They should be comforted by the Scriptural assurance that the Lord, having made all things new, will never again permit affliction to rise. The long, dark night of sin and death will have furnished sufficient experience for mankind. There will be no occasion for it to rise again; and we have the sure word of the Lord that it shall not rise up the second time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Let each soldier of the cross keep in mind now the suffering condition of humanity, and his great privilege to bring to them the news of early relief. Let no soldier of the cross now falter, but go forward in the strength of the Lord and rejoice in the privilege of doing good to his fellow creature by informing him of early and complete deliverance. Happy will be the people when they know that never again shall they enter the prison-house, nor suffer the afflictions heaped upon them by the great oppressor. Happy will they be indeed when they know that they can forever bask in the sunshine of the Lord and dwell together with their loved ones without fear. It will bring joy to their hearts to know that then each one can have his own home, without fear of being ejected by a heartless landlord; that he can sit under his own vine and fig tree, and enjoy the fruits thereof. Thrice happy will he be when he knows that his great King will give him a perfect government, a happy home, and endless life in unspeakable joy.</span></p>

The Lord Jesus Christ is the great King of kings. To him Jehovah has committed his kingdom, with all power in heaven and on earth. For centuries the Word of the Lord has gone forth to inform those who have the hearing ear concerning the kingdom. Few have heard and believed; and a less number, through the power of Christ Jesus, have been overcomers. The latter shall be with Christ Jesus in the kingdom. Christ and his 144,000 body members will constitute the kingdom; for it is written: “And he that overcometh, and keepeth my works unto the end, to him will I give power over the nations: and he shall rule them with a rod of iron; as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to shivers; even as I received of my Father.”—Revelation 2: 26, 27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">For centuries the kingdom of righteousness has been made prominent only by word. Now the time is come when the kingdom shall be made known, not by word only, but by the exercise of power. It will still the storms of human passion, and bring calmness, peace and contentment to the people. The power of the kingdom will open the prison-house of death, that contains the countless millions, and will send forth the prisoners, as it is written: </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">“I</span><span class="font9"> the Lord have called thee in righteousness, and will hold thine hand, and will keep thee, and give thee for a covenant of the people, for a light of the Gentiles; to open the blind eyes, to bring out the prisoners from the prison, and them that sit in darkness out of the prison house.”—Isaiah 42: 6, 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">This divine power shall be exercised to open the ears of the people, that they may hear the jubilee message; and to open their blind eyes, that they may see and appreciate the love of God and his Christ. It will be exercised to lead the human race over the highway of holiness whereby they shall be cleansed from all iniquity. In love this righteous power shall be exercised until every living creature imbibes the spirit of the kingdom, until every obedient one is restored, and until everything that breathes shall join together in the hallelujah chorus, singing praises to God and his beloved Son, Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">To his faithful ambassadors Christ the King now gives command to tell this good news to the groaning creation, that their hearts may receive comfort now. Happy is the man who now hears the jubilee sound. Thrice happy is he who tells it to his fellow creature; for he makes himself happy, makes the hearer happy, and glorifies his Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The zeal peculiar to the Lord’s house will cause every Christian to exercise his faculties, with which the Lord has endowed him, to proclaim the justice, wisdom, love, and power of Jehovah and of the King of kings.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font11"><a name="bookmark25"></a>THE PARABLE OF THE SOWER</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">---October 19---Mark 4:1-20---</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">RESPONSIBILITY OF HEARERS IS SHOWN—PARABLE APPLIES DURING GOSPEL AGE—COMPLETE FULFILMENT IN OUR DAY—YIELD DETERMINES HEART CONDITION.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">“The sower soweth the word.”—Mark</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">T</span><span class="font8">HE Parable of the Sower, one of Jesus’ best known parables, was spoken after Jesus had had a very busy forenoon in Capernaum, teaching the people. In the afternoon, probably quite tired in body, and desiring a little time of refreshment, he went to the lake side. But the people crowded round him there. Matthew says (chapter 13: 2) : “Great multitudes were gathered together unto him.” They still wanted to hear what he had to say; and he was not unmindful either of their desire or of his opportunity. Obtaining the use of a fishing boat, he spoke from it to the whole multitude as they stood on the shore. Travelers have reported that there are places on the lake shore where it is easy for one to speak from a boat and to be heard by a great number of people standing around on the shore.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>2</sup>Jesus’ manner was always so unusual and interesting, and his appearance so striking, and the authority by which he spoke so contrary to that with which they were accustomed, that the multitude was attracted to him, even though the many cared but little to conform their lives to his teaching. It was not our Lord’s purpose to be interesting, but to speak the truths in which hi® message of the kingdom of heaven was conveyed. But he always made his message interesting; there was never a teacher like him. In this the Lord set an example for his disciples, and for all who should afterwards be privileged to speak for him. It is comparatively easy to attract attention to oneself by peculiarity of mannerism, or to be interesting by specialty of knowledge; but he who speaks for the Lord must absolutely cut out all purpose of attracting attention to himself. Failing to do this, such will speak for himself; he cannot speak as an oracle of God. Also merely interesting matter must be deleted ; knowledge must always be made subsidiary to the main purpose of conveying truth to the hearers’ hearts, that it may administer grace unto the hearers.—Ephesians 4: 29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">RESPONSIBILITY OF HEARERS IS SHOWN</span></p>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>3</sup>Jesus took the occasion for an opportunity of making the people realize their responsibility in hearing his words. He therefore spoke the Parable of the Sower with the immediate purpose of showing the relationship between nature in the field and in the human heart in order to bring home to them their responsibility towards God. He spoke of the sower and the seed, of some seed being wasted, and of that which fell on the good ground producing various degrees of fruitfulness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>4</sup>The illustration would be familiar. They had seen many a sower broadcast his seed. Nowadays almost everyone knows something of the field life of Palestine. The fields there are not like those in western Europe, in England, and are the antitheses of the great wheat-fields of the United States and Canada. The farmer of Palestine has only small plots of land upon which he sows his seed. Little plowing is needed; sometimes only the surface needs turning over. There will be thorn bushes in the little plot, and frequently there is little attempt made to clear them away. Often the rocky surface shows itself, for there is not enough soil on tile hillside to cover the rocks; and frequently a footpath goes alongside or even right across the field.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>5</sup>Some seed, said Jesus, fell on the roadside, and the fowls came and picked it up; some fell on stony places and sprang up, but, because there was no depth of earth, when the sun came up it was scorched and withered away; some fell among thorns, and the thorns sprang up and choked the seed; some, of course, fell into good ground and brought forth, some a hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty. Our Lord added: “He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.’’ (Mark 4:9) The Lord did not always exhort the people. He told the truth and let it do its work, thus laying the responsibility upon them. Truth heard is always a test of character. Kightly received it builds up; received unwel-comely, it hurts; despised, it damages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>6</sup> After Jesus had thus spoken, the disciples asked him why he spoke to the people in parables; for this was not his manner when speaking to them. He told them the reason. He spoke thus that Isaiah’s prophecy might be fulfilled; for Isaiah had said that a message would be given to God’s people which would apparently make them see, but would not bring understanding. He quoted Isaiah 6:9, 10: “And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Esaias, which saith, By hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and shall not perceive: for this people’s heart is waxed gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes they have closed; lest at any time they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and should understand with their heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them.”—Matthew 13:14, 15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">PARABLE APPLIES DURING GOSPEL AGE</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">’Jesus explained to his disciples what his parable had meant. He who receives seed by the wayside is he who hears something of the kingdom but does not appreciate the value of what he hears; and Satan’s emissaries come and take the word of truth from him. He who receives seed into stony places is one who hears the word, receives it with joy and endures for a time; but when persecution comes or tribulation, he finds ground for offense. He who receives seed into thorny ground is one who hears and understands something of the word, but who allows the cares of this world or the deceitfulness of riches to choke the word; and he becomes unfruitful. He who receives seed into good ground hears the word and understands it, and appreciating it conforms his life to it. He brings forth fruit unto God thirtyfold, sixtyfold, or one hundredfold. Here are lessons both for the hearer and for those who have the privilege of being messengers for God, as Jesus was.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>8</sup>The parable has had its application all down the age; for it applies to the work of the kingdom of heaven in its first or embryonic phase, the time between the two advents, when the disciples of Jesus are developing full fruition of character. But all who have heard the word of the kingdom, whether in that phase or in the later one, which is now being proclaimed and which tells of the establishment of the kingdom in power, have been brought into the responsibility of the parable; and everyone should examine himself. But as there are now more of the Lord’s consecrated people alive than at any other time, and as there is consequently much more preaching of the word of the kingdom new than at any other time, and therefore there are more hearers of the message of the kingdom than at any previous time, it is apparent that the parable must have special force now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">COMPLETE FULFILMENT IN OUR DAY</span></p>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>9</sup>The parable cannot be fully understood apart from its prophetic connection and Jesus’ application. Our Lord said that in his preaching and in the differing reception of his message Isaiah’s prophecy was being fulfilled. But it is certain in this case, as in so many others, that the fulfilment by Jesus was in miziature only; it was not the complete fulfilment. Our Lord’s first advent in the flesh was to his own people, and prophecies were fulfilled in him so that Israel according to the flesh could be brought into judgment by the truth. Isaiah’s prophecy distinctly shows that it could receive its fulfilment only when the Lord comes to his temple, and is manifested in his </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">glory.</span><span class="font8"> As this was not fulfilled by our Lord’s coming in the weakness of the flesh and in the limitation of humanity, apparently it refers to the time when he comes in power and glory, speaking not as then with his own voice, and in the limitation of his circumstances, but through the many voices of the faithful in Christ Jesus at the time of his second advent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>10</sup>This time of judgment when the Lord has come to his temple is now manifested to those of his true disciples, the Isaiah class. These, like Isaiah, have said in response to the call, “Here am I, send me.” It follows, then, that there must be a timely application of this parable now; and no doubt this is why the Lord “starred” this passage, calling particular attention to it by saying, “He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“The parable of the sower and the seed is not a lesson illustrating the patience of the husbandman waiting for the growth of his seed, as given in James 5: 7, but is of what happens to the seed and of the responsibility of those who hear. It is not an uncommon experience that, when the truth has been heard for the first time, some unexpected cumstances have arisen which have presented opportunities for temporal advantage. Often it is thought that this new thing, the truth, can wait a little while. Attention is diverted, if only for a little time; and, lo, the desire for the truth has been snatched away 1 The disposition of the heart has been turned, and it may not again be ready for the truth. Here is a lesson of personal responsibility. If a man hears something which would help him he should make iniquiry; how much more so when he hears that which bears evidence of being a message of the kingdom. He who declines to make inquiry, or who lacks energy or desire, will probably soon discover that his opportunity of truth has gone. One cannot but see that many in these days of sharp temptation allow truth to be snatched from them. We do well to take heed how we hear; for the responsibility is upon us. There are yet wayside hearers!</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“The stony-ground hearer rejoices in the truth, but lacks root. He takes the truth and its gladness, thinking of little besides his own pleasure; but there is insufficient love for God, and a lack of appreciation of the privilege of knowing and understanding God and of serving his interests; and he soon falls. His joy goes when he finds that the truth is going to cost him something, that he may be misunderstood, and that persecution comes because of it. The thorny-ground hearer seems as if he would develop some fruit; he grows, but he allows the course of this world and the deceitfulness of riches to come upon him. Either of these conditions, poverty </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">or riches, </span><span class="font8">will cause one to be unfruitful. He who is too anxious about the things of this world, or is desirous of making or keeping money or position, cannot possibly bear fruit unto God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">YIELD DETERMINES HEART CONDITION</span></p>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>13</sup>The good-ground hearer is he who understands the value of the truth, who does not keep it -waiting while he can get some present advantage, who is willing to bear either tribulation or persecution for the truth, who will not let the course of this world through either poverty or riches prevent him from giving his whole attention to the service of God. He seeks to bring forth fruit unto God and does so. But some bring forth more fruit than others, and the purport of this lesson is to show that the responsibility for this is upon the hearer. The variations in productiveness follow the course of the parable. The wayside has nothing, the stony ground shows a little prospect, the thorny ground more. Only the good ground gives a return ; and there it is in proportion to the honesty of heart and sincerity of purpose towards God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>14</sup>It will not do to say the ground has no responsibility; to say so would be to lose the point of the parable. The responsibility is ours, of how we hear the truth; hearing, what we will do with it; accepting, how much of our heart we will give to it. The solemn truth is stated: “Whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have more abundance: but whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken away even that which he hath.” (Matthew 13: 12) This is indeed the law of nature, but it is also the rule in the kingdom of grace. A question each must answer for himself is: Can I improve the “soil” of my heart that it may bring forth full fruitage to God, and what are the means to be used to that end? The answer is in the lesson of the parable. Each must see that all impurities are kept out of the heart and mind; for by the grace given to all the lord’s people these may be purged out (2 Corinthians 7:1), and the heart may be kept set for the things of God. Let each seek to serve God in the way he indicates; and the heart will be “good ground”, bringing forth much fruit to God's honor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>15</sup>Since it is the privilege of the Lord’s consecrated people to be messengers for him, they also take the position of sowers of the truth as well as hearers, having responsibility themselves towards God. Those who are thus privileged to speak for the Lord, whether publicly from the platform, or more privately at the doors of the people, should always take the opportunity of driving home the responsibility of carefully listening to the truth, the message which God is sending to the people. As the crowds listened to Jesus, and he found it necessary to show them.their responsibility, so do his disciples now need to speak these words of warning. And they themselves must take heed how they hear.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark26"></a><span class="font11"><a name="bookmark27"></a>THE STILLING OF THE STORM</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">---October 26---Mark 4: 35-41---</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">IN WEARINESS JESUS FALLS ASLEEP--SATAN’S AGENCIES REBUKED BY JESUS—GOD’S PURPOSE NOT TO BE FRUSTRATED.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">“Who then is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?”—IMark &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;R. V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">O</span><span class="font8">UR lesson for today is very closely related in point of time with the events of last Sunday’s lesson. Jesus had spent a whole morning teaching and healing the people and the afternoon in speaking the Parables of the Sower and that of the Wheat and Tares and in teaching the disciples their meaning; and now evening was come. He left off teaching, but saw that there was no rest in Capernaum, and he decided to go to the east side of the lake. Mark says (chapter 4:36): “They took him even as he was,” which indicates that the crowds were so pressing upon Jesus that the disciples felt the need for immediate action on his behalf. So, tired and weary, he was taken back into the little ship; and they launched out (Luke 8: 22) to go to the other side.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>2</sup>But even so there seemed no freedom for him; for while he had been discoursing to the people from the boat other boats had clustered round, and now as the disciples pushed out into the deep water these went out with him. Casting himself down on the little covering on the steersman’s seat he soon fell fast asleep. Before long a storm came on suddenly, as is still the case on the sea of Galilee; for the sea lies low, and as the heated air rises from it particularly towards evening time, the cold winds from the surrounding hills rush down and violent storms arise. This storm was unusually fierce, one which would have made the sailors seek shelter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">IN WEARINESS JESUS FALLS ASLEEP</span></p>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>3</sup> As there is no further mention of the other boats which put out with the disciples, it seems certain they turned back when the storm arose. But this little ship beat against it, though the victory seemed as if it would be with the elements. Some of the disciples were experienced boatment, but all were seized with fear. Yet despite the tossing of the boat, and the noise of the wind and waves, the Lord continued to sleep. He must have been very weary. At last the disciples could forbear no longer; they could do nothing more to fight the storm, and now the water was filling the boat. They went to him, seemingly not so much to tell him of the danger they were all in, as to waken him up. They said, as if he were responsible: “Master, carest thou not that we perish?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">‘Aroused, Jesus replied: “Why are ye so fearful? how is it that ye have no faith?” (Mark -1: 38-45) Then he arose and rebuked the winds and the sea; and “there was a great calm.” (Mark 4:39) He then said to his disciples; “Where is your faith?” (Luke 8: 25) The disciples were astonished; and they feared exceedingly when they saw this wondrous thing, and said one to another: “What manner of man is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?” (Mark 4: 41) None of these miracles seemed equal to raising their minds to saying, “Surely he is the Son of God</span></p>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>5</sup>There are many lessons for the disciples of Christ in this incident. There can be little question that it is symbolic, and has a large meaning for the Church of God, as well as being a record of a striking event in our Lord's life. Once again the disciple is reminded of the fact, so prominent in these accounts of our Lord’s life and ministry, that Jesus could get only broken rest. Nor did he desire otherwise; his life he had given to God; and he himself as a new creature, acting as priest, kept the sacrifice of his human life burning quite fiercely on the altar of service which God had provided for him. He could not carry on his work without some rest to his body; but these records show that he paid no more attention to it than was necessary for the accomplishment of his work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>e</sup>It may easily be admitted that the sleep of Jesus—the only sleep of which we have any record—was, in the divine order, that we his followers might profit by his example. But that does not at all diminish the reality of our Lord's weariness and need of sleep. If he slept soundly through the storm it was because he was tired and worn with the heavy labors of the hard days which he had recently had. Nor was Jesus selfish in thus resting and taking sleep, leaving the disciples to sail the boat across the lake. Most of them were accustomed to the handling of a boat, there was comparatively little work to be done, and his bodily care was their business. Also they had been resting through the day while their Master was talking. We are again reminded that the servant of God should not expect to get well-ordered times for his rest, and that rest can be had at odd as well as at set times.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">SATAN’S AGENCIES REBUKED BY JESUS</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">nt &gt;&nbsp;s evident that Satan was the instigator of this storm ; hence our Lord treated the winds and the waves as Satan’s agencies, and rebuked them. This shows us that Jehovah permits Satan to use the forces of nature for his purposes. It does not mean that Satan has full control of the powers of nature, but that God does in his wise providences and for the working out of his purposes allow him great liberty. Jesus probably understood from the first that a storm was threatening, but that had made no difference to his taking the rest and going to sleep. He was in his Father’s care while he was carrying out his work, and had no fear of what might happen. He knew that his Father would preserve him from harm; for the winds and the waves were his, as the Psalmist said: “Stormy wind fulfilling his word.” —Psalm 148: 8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>8</sup>The disciples ought to have had the same confidence in their Master. They were there at his direction, and carrying out his will. They ought therefore to have had so much confidence that Jesus was under the care of the Father, as to be free from all anxiety. True, the water was coming into the ship; but probably had they been men of faith the water would not have made such advancement on them. In any case there is a lesson for us that, when we are doing the Lord’s will, no matter what outward circumstances come we need have no fear that the enemy can outwit God and do us mortal injury. There may be discomfort in following the purposes of God; but evil, as such, cannot befall us.—Psalm 91:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>s</sup>The Lord’s people during their life’s voyage are called to go across many a stormy piece of water, and unforeseen and unexpected storms arise, but they need have no fear. The lesson tells us that our Lord, who is the Captain of our ship, can himself quell all opposition, and will do so when it comes to the point of danger to his people. None can pluck his own out of his hand, and the Father is greater than all.—John 10: 27-29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">GOD’S PURPOSE NOT TO BE FRUSTRATED</span></p>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>10</sup>This lesson also teaches us the folly of impatience under the Lord’s providences. The true believer rests in the Father's love and care, and he knows that the Father is too good, too kind, too just, to allow trials and temptations to come upon his children which would be too strong for them. (1 Corinthians 10: 13) The Lord rebuked the disciples by saying: “Where is your faith?” Their faith had gone with the winds! We may give to the winds our </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">fears,</span><span class="font8"> but we should never let them carry away our </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">faith&gt;.</span><span class="font8"> How often in effect do we rebuke the Lord. When circumstances are hard upon us and the clouds of trouble hang low and remain long, we are apt to feel sometimes that the Lord has forgotten us and, indeed, to tell him so. Our distress is too great to allow us to see the true position.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Could the apostles have freed themselves from their fear for a few moments, and have told each other of their faith in the Lord, remembering what he had done, and that they had accepted him because they believed he was sent of God, there would have been no record of their loss of faith. We may indeed put the matter in another way. Their care for the Lord should have overcome their fear for themselves; they ought to have been praying that he might be saved to continue his work rather than to disturb his much-needed rest to ask him why he cared nothing for them. Dark providences are often but the preliminary of richest manifestation of God’s favor. Cowper long ago expressed this thought when he said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Ye fearful saints, fresh courage take;</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The clouds ye so much dread Are big with mercy, and shall break In blessings on your head.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Without doubt this storm was one of the many attempts on the part of Satan to destroy the seed of promise. Ever since a deliverer seed was promised, Satan has been on the alert to frustrate the purpose of God, and has made many attempts to do so. Already he had several times sought to destroy Jesus, and here was an attempt to destroy the Lord and his little company of chosen ones. No doubt the whole incident is symbolical. The sea of Galilee, the turbulent sea of the Gentiles, frequently represents the troubled sea on which the little gospel ship has sailed since it was launched by the Lord (Matthew 28: 19, 20), and where it has sometimes seemed as if it were about to founder. Furthermore, it is almost certain that the incident is designed as an illustration for the days into which the Church is about to enter. ■Without doubt raging masses of humanity, human storms driven by Satanic forces, will sweep the world; and it may seem as if the Lord’s little company of faithful servants are to be cast out into the midst of the sea. But they need not fear. The Lord will never let Satan destroy his Church in any such fashion; and in his own time and way he will bid the storm cease, that his servants may finish their work.</span></p>

You asked the Brother to translate it and commit to you before you would sanction its going into the Watch Toweb.—Brother Fakofuey.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">[The letter follows.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Mv Dearly Beloved Brother in Chrtst:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Please permit me to tell you briefly of the change tha’ to ik place in me. I am a young man, being previously of the Catholic faith ; hut now I am a Bible Student. I often heard of jour Society from your brother; but prejudice had so blinded my heart as to make me curse all of its adherents. One day as I was walking through the street I saw a man passing out circulars. (The reference is here made to a free tract issued by the Syrian class, and distributed far and wide in the U. S. A. and Syria, the subject matter being “God is not Christ, and Christ is not God.”] I took one and commenced to read it. Before long the enthusiasm of blind prejudice seized me; and in rage I tore the tract to pieces and trampled it under my feet. The doctrine oi the Papacy was well planted in my mind, and I began to revile the Society and the one that established it. I was prevented from seeing and accepting the truth by that corrupt and evil doctrine of Papacy. But as I came to my senses I said to myself: “Could it not be that this Society has some truth ? Why not investigate?” So I visited your brother, and to my astonishment lie brought to me a circular similar to the one I had before. I was angry and said to him: “You are blind. Why don’t you see what the Scriptures say on this point? Read John 10:35. Does it not say: ‘The Father and I are one’? And does not the pope say that Christ is God, and does not the priest say the same tiling also? No one contradicts what they say except you. Keep away from me. I do not care to know a thing about your corrupt teachings.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Now, dear Brother, you know how much prejudice you had before coming into the truth, and you can imagine my being in the same condition. As I am naturally of a combative disposition, I began to call on your brother, with a number of questions each time. But he continually had answers for them ; and finally something new began to show itself to me, and created interest in me further to investigate the subject.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Time rolled on thus for about a year. One day he mentioned to me that a man by the name of Aboud came to his home on Sundays, and that he was quite able in these matters. I requested him to notify me when Aboud should come. I was well armed with the sword of wrong, corrupt teachings. ■When Aboud came, I began to propound questions to him; but victory, by virtue of the power of the holy spirit, was on his side. I was enlightened; and Brother Aboud began to feed me on the truth. But my father was against me. I now have a great desire to study and know the truth. When Brother Aboud left us for the U. S. A., a brother whose name is Botary was found here who could answer my questions ■ind convince me. God was pleased to give me the truth, and am now enlightened and strong and a brother of you brethren. Brother Botary and myself visit Brother Abraham Attia. [Tills brother is now in charge of the work in Tripoli, Syria, instead of Brother Aboud.] He is more able than us botli in the spirit and in the Scriptures; and each time we find something new. “How marvelous are thy works, O God, with wisdom thou didst create them all.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Behold, Brother, how beautiful are the works of the Lord in his slaves! How he leads them from one condition into the other until he finally brings them to his fold, the little flock. As I before received instruction in the school of a corrupt and atheistical knowledge (the school of the friar), now I am receiving the truth and sound instructions to which I was led by my Savior Jesus Christ through his holy spirit and his Word, which is the only means of salvation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">You see, dear Brother, how I was the companion of immoral children and how I am now the companion of Christ through his Word; how I reviled and blasphemed, and how today I bless; how when I did revile, I was not contented with the use of common profanity, but reviled the name of God the Creator and the holy spirit. But now I praise and magnify his holy and lofty name. I reviled the Society and the one who established it; but today I bless it. It grieves me to hear a wrong thing said against it. I no longer follow the pope and his corrupt doctrines. Thus I am being changed by the holy spirit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">I am enclosing herein a cheque to cover my subscription for the Arabic Watch Tower from its first year. The Tower is very interesting, and I want to become a subscriber to it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Your Brother in Christ, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Victor A. Ai.t.epy, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Syria.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">FAR-AWAY BRETHREN APPRECIATE THE TRUTH</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Deab Brethren :</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">I have been unable to answer the V. D. M. questions earlier. May it please the Lord that I pass this examination ; but let everything be according to his own gracious will who loved us while we were yet sinners. If I pass, and there be even the slightest error in my answers, let me be informed accordingly and the necessary explanation on the error made, as I do not want to teach myself, much more others, a mistaken way in the name of the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Kindly send me the I. B. S. A. vow of holiness of life at your earliest convenience.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A brother, one of those to whom I have imparted much of the present truth, asked me to have him symbolize his consecration to the will if the Lord by immersing him in water. I did so. This is the Lord’s doings and it is marvelous in my eyes. </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Society will never quite realize what it is doing for those souls who hunger and thirst after righteousness; but, thank God, he affirms that you shall in no wise lose your reward.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Yours in the Lord, Memo A. Dzingwa, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Cage Town.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">MAINTAINING ONE’S SPIRITUAL POISE</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Deab Brother Rutherford :</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Greetings in the Redeemer. I feel that I must write and tell you of the blessings the Watch Tower is bringing. I bad almost imperceptibly become somewhat “weary”, but the resolute setting aside of a portion of each day for study, particularly a careful rereading of the wonderful Wati h Toweb articles of the past several months, has reinvigorated me as nothing else could do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Thinking that my experiences may be beneficial to others, I wish to mention the fact that although one may be regularly in the service of the Lord, there is danger of becoming “faint” if the mental and spiritual sustenance is not carefully provided and thoroughly masticated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Also, since we are stewards of our physical powers, faithfulness to the Lord of necessity includes proper care of our bodily frame, the providing of needed rest, in order to serve tlie Master efficiently and well. Although zealous activity in the work often demands, and should demand, taxing the human organism to the utmost, yet sometimes I find myself prone to forget that the Lord's work is a “reasonable service”, and that Bethany was a part of our Master’s life as well as Calvary. My most grievous stumblings have been tlie direct result of overtaxing my physical vitality past the point of proper poise. I believe others are having similar experiences, and I feel like sounding a warning to the fellow-members of the Lord’s family; for the wily adversary is ever on the watch to trip us up in the very midst of the sweet service of the King. And many times I have had the bitter realization that a beautiful opportunity for presenting the message lias been misused, simply because I had thoughtlessly worn out to the point of inefficiency the human channel through which the message must flow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A further helpful thought in the matter of spiritual food is furnished by the example of balanced diet on the natural plane; for it is a well-known fact that a healthful ration must include not only pure nutriment, but roughage as well. I find myself at my spiritual best when I can not only keep up with my Studies and Towers, but also partake of the Golden Age articles. What the Golden Age articles so bountifully supply, many dear friends are mistakenly seeking by perusing worldly magazines and publications. As well might one seek to balance his diet by eating sawdust, with plenty of health-giving bran set before him! And yet these i cry friends most frequently explain their negligence of the study of the truth by tlie inexcusable excuse, “I have no time!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">As a zeal-inspiring meal, however, nothing can excel the exactly proportioned &quot;things new and old” of the latest exposition of the “Sheep and Goats” parable. The class in Fresno has set aside one evening a week for a careful study of this article, and the friends are receiving the inevitable blessings of such a course. In my Sunday services among the classes, I find that some have derived from this article what it does not contain, and have assumed that it sends all clergymen, politicians, and profiteers directly into the second death. As a result, some of the friends are puzzled, and needlessly so. I believe every eeclesia would be greatly benefited by a question-by-question mastication of this entire Watch Toweb article as a Berean study. A portion of one paragraph in particular (Page 312) should, I do believe, be printed in capital letters:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“As a goat class they will be forever destroyed. As to whether or not any of the individuals making up that class will have an opportunity for trial during the Millennial age we cannot surely tell. If they quickly change their course they may. The Scriptures seem to indicate that those who knowingly and wilfully repudiated the truth during the presence of the Lord, who have substituted Satanic doctrines for the doctrines of the Lord, who have neglected the Lord's flock while claiming to be his representatives, and who have persecuted his brethren, may not be counted worthy of a trial for life during the Millennial age.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Surely no balanced character, in full accord with the Just and True One, can take any exception to this!</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Yours in his blessed service, H. A. Seklemian, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Cali J.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">LIGHT SHINING BRIGHTLY</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brethren :</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Just a note to tell you how much we appreciate the Watch Toweb articles. They are getting better all the time. And while the leading articles are, of course, the most important , yet tlie Sunday School lessons are wonderful. Whoever is writing these articles is certainly bringing out many beautiful truths, and I would like him to know that his labor of love is appreciated by many of the friends.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The light is now shining so brightly that we can hardly keep up with it; but by our Lord's kind favor, and by such kindly helps as that blessed “channel” affords, we shall continue to follow swiftly on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Assuring you of our prayers and hearty cooperation, I am, Yours in Christian love, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;J. G. Tope, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Ohio.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">SEES SERVICE AS NECESSARY</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">May I take a few minutes of your valuable time to express to you in this way the joy that has filled my heart as a result of a c’Dse study of the recent articles in the Watch Tower?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Surely the shadow of God’s hand is plainly seen between the lines; and he often hears my praises for this. During the past year the Watch Tower has firmly entrenched in my mind the necessity of continued service and of the beneficial results that accrue from it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">May our blessed Father richly bless and continue his tfn-failing guidance for you, as well as all other Instruments he is using in sending out this blessed helper.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Your brother in King Jesus, J. Abthcb Payette, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Mass.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">BENEFITED BY BEREAN STUDY</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brethren :</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Asheville Eeclesia has been studying the Watch Toweb as a Berean lesson for some time, and the articles have been enjoyed so much by the entire class that they voted that the Secretary write you their sincere appreciation of the feast of fat things that you are supplying under the Lord’s guidance. They wish also to express their love to you for your labors on their behalf, and to remind you that the Lord is not unmindful of your labors of love, in that you have ministered unto the saints and do minister.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Your brother in Christ, Henby</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> G. </span><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">McKenzie, A<sup>t</sup>. </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">C.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“All unseen, the Master walketh By the toiling servant’s side;</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Comfortable words he talketh, While his hands uphold and guide.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Grief, nor pain, nor any sorrow Rends thy heart to him unknown;</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">He today and he tomorrow</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Grace sufficient gives his own.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Africa—Land of Giants and Pygmies</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">AFRICA is the home of the tallest, strongest xl&lt; <sub>me</sub>n </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">in</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> the world, the Watussi tribe, whose medium height is six feet, and who often attain to seven feet. It is believed by travelers that these forest giants of the northeastern Congo region can outrun and outjump the trained athletes of any other people. Curiously, they live in proximity to the shortest, weakest men in the world, the Wambutti pygmies, made famous by H. M. Stanley.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">This close relationship of giants and pygmies fairly well illustrates the relationship of blacks and whites to the problem of the development of Africa. It is essentially a black man’s country, essentially an indolent man’s country, because it contains such a store of easily obtainable food, and because the bulk of the natives are and will always be Africans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">Am</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">erican Phelps-Stokes commission, after a ten months’ investigation, declares that. Africa is a land flowing with milk and honey; that not only does the continent even now produce over forty percent of the world’s gold supply, but that it has the largest forests in the world and the most enormous regions of undeveloped fertile soil. The same commission reports that native Africans who have graduated from European universities are occupying many of the most important positions in all countries on the continent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Animal Life</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">A</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">S MIGHT be expected in a country which has such a large area of rich soil, Africa has an excess of wild animals. Formerly there were many elephants, but their numbers have been reduced on account of slaughter to obtain ivory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">There are still plenty of lions, too many, indeed, in some districts, where they have become man eaters. The lions soon learn that with a few cuffs of their powerful paws they can break down the walls of a native hut, and get a good meal without the trouble of looking for one elsewhere. They have even been known to board a moving train and enter a sleeping-car without obtaining reservations in advance, and, moreover, to do the very impolite thing of jumping out of a window with a passenger by the head.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Leopards, panthers, hyenas, and jackals are found in most parts of Africa. Of antelopes there are fifty varieties. Giraffes are not found elsewhere. The ostrich is a native of the Dark . Continent; so also is the serpent-killer called the secretary bird, and the honey-guide, which points out the nests of bees. The ants in some districts are so savage that the only things safe from destruction are such articles as are packed in metal boxes. A pair of shoes left exposed for one night is riddled by morning. Even the floors of houses are eaten away. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Climate</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">HERE is a great variety of climate. In the desert regions of the north it is extremely hot; but ip the central plateau, while it is hot in the direct rays of the sun, yet at night it is so cool that one must sleep under a blanket. Even in the Congo it seldom gets above 87* Fahrenheit. In South Africa the climate is ideal There are frosts in the winter season, but life out of doors is possible and enjoyable the year around.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">During the rainy season, everything in Africa that is within the rain belt gets wet. There is no keeping the rain out. No rainproof garments work against the combination of heat and wet. Mails are sometimes undecipherable, because the mists penetrate the mailbags and reduce everything to pulp.'</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">During the rainy season the Congo river carries such vast quantities of soil that its color is a muddy brown. Before the water can be used for washing purposes, it must be treated with permanganate of potassium, which turns it blood color.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Cape to </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Cain a Reality</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">RAVEL in Africa is now comparatively safe and comfortable. The much talked of Cape-to-Cairo route is a reality. The first man to make the complete trip was an undergraduate of Cambridge University, Ewart Scott Grogan, who left Cape Town in February, 1898, and ar-</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">rived at Cairo in August, 1899. Now the regu</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">lation time for the trip is fifty-three days. </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">. Wonderfully Efficient Porten</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">At present the route is made up of railway trips aggregating 4,456 miles, steamer trips aggregating 2,004 miles; and the remaining 368 miles are covered by automobile or by caravan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">A writer in “The Mentor&quot; gives the interesting details of the trip as he made it. He describes the famous Victoria Falls of the Zambesi, two thousand miles by rail from Cape Town, where a river over a mile wide plunges three times the height of Niagara, with a roar that can be heard nineteen miles. Next he tells os of the new and elegant city of Elizabethville, another thousand miles further north by rail, in the Congo Free State, where there are good hotels, banks, stores, residences, and a generous supply of automobiles. All this has come about in ten years, because a tremendously rich vein of copper lies on the surface of the ground. The railroad extends to the western shore of Lake Tanganyika, broken in one place by a steamer trip on the river Lualaba. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">In the Heart of Africa &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">HE traveler crosses the lake by steamer to the point on the northern shore where Stanley found Livingstone, then takes a short railway journey eastward through territory which until recently belonged to the Germans; then he caravans north 200 miles to the southern shore of Victoria Nyanza. He crosses the lake on one of the three steamers now regularly plying it* waters, sees the birth of the Nile, where it rushes out of Victoria Nyanza over the Ripon Falls a full-grown river, takes </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> short railroad ride, another short steamer ride, and then goes by automobile to Albert Nyanza, where his ride down the Nile begins. ■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">In the'journey down the Nile there is one place of eighty-qine miles where it is necessary to caravan, but the remainder of the trip is comfortably made up of steamer and railway journeys ending at Cairo. There are good hotels all the way; and almost anybody with a fairly good constitution who win take reasonable care of his food habits, as all must do in.the tropics, can make the trip without serious danger or even inconvenience. By this route most of the trip is on high ground, where there is little or no danger to the white man from sleeping sickness or the tsetze fly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">f iVtiE caravans plying over the routes indieaf-J- ed are under government supervision. Th* porters on these routes received sixty cent* a week only a few years ago, but now their wage* have gone up to two dollars. Their regulation load is sixty pounds. Groups of four negroes carry their own baggage, one and the traveler himself, unless he prefers to walk. They make fourteen to eighteen miles a day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Porters on the mail routes which branch off here and there, carry fifty pounds of mail and travel twenty-five miles per day, sometimes for as much as twenty-four days in on* direction. They are so faithful that in a journey of 600 miles they are seldom more than an hour behind schedule time, and generally less than half that They make better time in the rainy season, when they can travel without the sandals.whidi. are needed in hot weather.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Tn the Sahara</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">THE railway development of Africa progresses, but not so rapidly as is customary in the Western World. In Algeria, on the north, ern edge of the Sahara, there are lines carrying sleeping-cars, as well as in South Africa. It is anticipated that the full journey from Cap* Tf'Wn to Cairo will be possible by rail ere long.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The rainlessness of the Sahara is due te the direction of the winds, which are deprived of their moisture before reaching these lands. But there are in the Sahara elevated plateaux and mountains with more or less permanent streams and habitable valleys in between, and artesian wells have been turned to account in Algeria. There is more vegetation in the Kalahari desert of South Africa than in the Sahara.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The Sahara, in one place in Algeria, is on*-hundred feet below sea level; but in the middl* of the desert, half way from the Atlantic to th* Nile, are mountains which are covered with snow for three months in the year.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Gold for the Temple</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">I</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">T IS believed that Africa was first circumnavigated by the Phoenicians about 700 years before the beginning of the Christian era; and if so, it was a remarkable piece of courage and enterprise. There are reasons for believing that the rich gold mines of South Africa were those from which came the gold used in the construction of Solomon’s temple. The </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">imm</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ansA granite ruins at Zimbabwe, some five hundred miles north of the mining district of Johannesburg, are believed to be Phoenician in origin. In the neighborhood hieroglyphics have been discovered which are not at present decipherable. Traces of an ancient road have also been discovered. In one place the mountains were terraced for seventy miles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Vegetation</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">HE Belgian Congo is at this time probably the least known portion of Africa. It is in the Congo that the jungle is thickest. In area it is equal to all Europe west of Russia; it is the abode of about twelve million Africans and six thousand whites. Since the war the natives are complaining of the high cost of living, yet a whole bunch of bananas costs but five cents. Birds and beasts are everywhere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Palms are to be found all over Africa. The date palm is the special characteristic of the desert, to which it is specially adapted, and in which it forms the principal means of subsistence. The Arabs, who make a living by carrying ivory and other treasures across the desert, carry dates with them as their sole food, counting out just so many to be taken at each meal, and not varying the number. They know in advance, to a certainty, how many meals they have provided for. As in Australia, the ferns grow to the size of small trees, being often twelve to fifteen feet in height. In the western part of tropical Africa coffee plants thrive so luxuriously as to form thick woods.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">South Africa is the natural home of fruits of all sorts. Virtually every fruit used by man is grown in this region; and as the fruits mature at a time when the northern fruit season is closed, there is ready market for these products, although the spoliation is large on account of having to cross the equator. South African pears are in the markets of New York in May.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Kalahari</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">ITH</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> more water South Africa would be an ideal country for cattle-raising, but the water supply is a little too treacherous. In the rainy season the veldt becomes covered with a tall grass which, while it is green, burns the mouths of the cattle; but after it is mature it is eaten by them greedily. It will keep its nourishing power for years, and is stored by the natives against seasons of severe drought</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">A feature of the South African desert that makes it less dreadful than the Sahara is the Tsama, or wild watermelon, which affords a good substitute for water, and is widely dis-treated. As in the case of the Sahara, there is „ plenty of water beneath the surface; and when' wells are bored the life-giving underground streams are always found.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Egypt and Abyssinia &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">AFRICA is the continent without </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> country,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">• in the commonly accepted sense of th# term. Liberia, Egypt and Abyssinia are supposed to be independent; but in actual practice the United States controls Liberia, and Britain controls Egypt and Abyssinia. Whenever a European country wants a piece of Africa, it just helps itself, in the same way that any regular thief takes anything. France, Britain,. Belgium, and Portugal virtually own all of the Dark Continent. Italy has Tripoli, Eritrea and Somaliland. Spain has part of Morocco. Germany did have 1,000,000 square miles, but now does not have a foot of colonies anywhere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The native name of Egypt is the Black Country, which term is used to describe the color of the soil brought down by the Nile. While Greece and Rome were both wrapped in barbarism, Egypt was a country of elegant roads, immense temples, palaces, and other great structures of which the remains are with us to this day.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Kenya, Tanganyika, Mozambique</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">I</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">MMEDIATELY south of Abyssinia is the British state of Kenya where, in the .effort to persuade or to compel' others to do the work which they should do for themselves, a number, of great landholders have been recently ac. ‘ cased of practising slavery. We will have something further to say on this subject later in this article. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">South of Kenya is Tanganyika territory, which until recently was German East Africa. ’ South of Tanganyika, for a thousand miles along the Indian Ocean, stretches the country of Mozambique, or Portuguese East Africa. The latter country is said to be one of the richest countries, in agricultural possibilities at least, of all undeveloped countries of the world. The land lies high above sea level, has no deserts, no salt sinks, no large swamps, no mountainous wastes and no impenetrable jungles; but it does have millions of acres of the finest alluvial soil, and without doubt will sometime support a vast population. At present it has about 3,000,000^ inhabitants, of whom only one percent are' , whites. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Rhodesia and Southwest Africa</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">I</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">MMEDIATELY west of Mozambique lies Southern Rhodesia, an area of 149,000 square miles, which Britain has just' decided to annex and furnish with a responsible government Until now it has been under the administration of the British South Africa Company.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">West of Rhodesia lies what was once German Southwest Africa. The 8,000 Germans living there have been automatically made citizens of the South African Union, at the same time that they retain their German citizenship. Under the arrangement which, has been made they enjoy all the rights and duties of other citizens of South Africa, but will not have to bear arms against Germany for thirty years. By that </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">time</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">, however, there will be no more wars.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Repatriation Impractical</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">I</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">T IS but natural that Africans and others who know of the riches of Africa, and who realize the adaptability of the black man to its climate^ should think of the possibility of repatriating upon its shores the millions of blacks who are now in America and the West Indies; but the thing is impractical It could be done, but the suffering it would cause would be incalculable and the cost incredible. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">In 1877 there was such a movement A stock company was formed. An old boat was bought; and thousands sold their belongings, with the expectation of going on the initial trip. The boat was legally permitted to carry 206; but when sailing time came, there were a thousand on board. Hundreds were sent ashore in rowboats. The food ran low, and so did the water supply. Twenty-one were buried at sea in ten days. At length Africa was reached, but both natives and newcomers were disappointed, and. many of the newcomers died. The boat got back to America and never made another trip.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Natives and Missions</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">HE natives of Africa are, generally speaking, the most peaceful, most trustful, and best tempered people to be found anywhere. This would be apparent from the fact that there never has been an invasion of other lands by an uprising of blacks; nor has the black race in America ever given any serious trouble. It has had trouble, plenty of it, but the fault has generally not been of its making.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Missions have not worked out for the African’s betterment Taught by the mission schools some of the elements of the white man's trades, the native breaks away from the school and obtains work in a railroad gang or in a mine, only to learn in a short time all that is worst in life. His habits become corrupted, his reliability and trustfulness disappear, and it is literally true that he becomes twofold more the child of gehenna than he was in the first place. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Natural Ability of the Blacks</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">O</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">N SUBJECTS with which they are familiar, it is generally admitted that there are no better reasoners than the black men. When following the trail of game they read accurately every break in the branches, every mark in the earth, every twist in the grass, every rustling</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font1">•j</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of the leaves. They can even tell the kind of prey they are tracking, its height, and sometimes its sex.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">By means of relays of wooden gongs the blacks in central Africa quickly send complicated information hundreds of miles. How it is done the whiteman cannot even understand; yet it is done. From time immemorial in certain districts the natives have been accustomed to working iron, m</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">akin</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">g their own knives, bush hooks, hoes, and tomahawks. Every new white man is at once given a name which describes him perfectly, accentuating his peculiarities. The white man’s machines are named appropriately, to describe the sounds they emit or the work they do. The African is nothing if not original.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Cannibalism and Demonology</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;VT2S; there are cannibals in Africa, in some ■A- places. And the worst of it is that some of these cannibals are said to be fine fellows to meet They are very pleasant, but they are fond of meat, and fresh meat is hard to get in the tropics. Some of the tribes buy prisoners of war, holding them in reserve, killing and eating them as they are needed. Others eat only their enemies; others eat only because they wish to assimilate the strength and other good qualities of those that have passed away. It is all very hideous, almost as much so as the diabolical doctrine of eternal torture believed by some savage whites in America and elsewhere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Like his white brother, the African native has often been deceived by demons. Some are deluded into supposing that they are leopards, dress themselves in leopard hides, and leap upon their innocent and unsuspecting victims, killing them and subsequently devouring their bodies. This disease is called by scientists lycan-thropy, and has been known for ages. As in America, the black brother in Africa is easily misguided and misled; but for the most part he is an intelligent, simple-hearted, inoffensive man. <sup>x</sup></span></p>

A pair of trousers makes all the difference in the world in the ps</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">tima</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">te a man holds of </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">himself</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> in Africa, and in the estimate that others have of </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">him.</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> Put a pair of trousers on one who has never before worn them, and he at once becomes insufferably arrogant A good many strut when they get into fine clothes. What is the object of uniforms, robes, gowns, et% anyway, unless it is to attempt to convey to others a sense of the wearer’s superiority f In 1920 the United States exported to South Africa 585,819 pieces of second-hand clothing, in bales of fifty suits each, at an average value of about $4.50 per suit</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">There are tribes in Africa where the women paint as badly as they do in New York city. This may seem incredible to one who has ridden in a New York subway. It is probably not true, however, so far as lip-sticks are concerned. The African native woman has not fallen that far. But she does (in some places) paint herself with red paint from top to toe, staining even fingers, toes, and hair.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The African natives, in some places, devota much attention to their hair and teeth, as others do elsewhere. Styles vary. Some of these natives stain their teeth blue, yellow, and purple, leaving a white tooth here and there. Others file their teeth in patterns. The style of coloring or filing shows at a glance to what tribe one belongs. In some tribes the hair is plaited and wrapped with grass and clay so as to make the strands stick out “like quills upon a fretful porcupine.&quot; Bings and bones inserted in the lips, noses, ears and cheeks make a belle look as badly as some New York women look when they have put on overmuch paint; i. e., when they have painted not wisely but too well</span></p>

<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">r</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">? WOULD be good to say that there is no slavery in Africa; for no man was ever yet good enough to own another man. But the sad truth is that there is slavery in Af rica. In Abyssinia anybody can see it. British correspondents assert that it is also found in Kenya, bordering Abyssinia on the south. The Manchester </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Guard, ian</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> summing up the Kenya situation in a few words said .*</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">“The system of forced labor introduced into </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">the Kenya </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">colony becomes, however unintentionally, slavery. The stages precedent to the inauguration of this system </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">are </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">familiar ones; namely, a vigorous campaign directed towards showing first, that the African is but </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">a Tasy </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">nig-</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">ger*</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> and secondly, that the land he occupies is vastly in cxcers of his requirement!.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">There is slavery in Portuguese East. Africa and Portuguese West Africa, commonly called Mozambique and Angola. A law is in effect requiring each native to obtain a certificate showing that he has done three months' hard work within the year. No one is obliged to hire him; but if he cannot produce a certificate, he is seized and forced to labor several months as a prisoner. What are virtually s</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">imil</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ar arrangements have been uncovered at various times in Florida, Georgia, Alabama, and Texas. It will be noted that white men are the aggressors in these instances. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Cruelty of White Saoayeu .</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">W</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">HITE men, too, are responsible for the laws in South Africa where a native must get a pass to live with his wife, another pass to visit a family down the street, and another to work for his pittance of perhaps two shillings a week. These natives are all taxed, but the money is never used to benefit them. The schools are built for the whites only. Again, the whites are the aggressors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">In 1920 one upright judge in British East Africa astonished the white population when he sentenced an army captain to three months' imprisonment for flogging a dumb boy over the head, face, and body for an hour. Of course there was a provocation. The boy, with little to occupy his </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">mind</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">, had chased a pig to death, and was chasing another; but that was no excuse for the white man’s putting his mind on an even lower plane.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">In the subjugation of Somaliland, the British government only three years ago resorted to the bombing of native quarters from airplanes in order to accomplish their ends. It does not seem to us that it is any less murder or any less thievery to subjugate a black man’s land than it is a white man’s land; and both are alike execrable. In the end &quot;order” was established. Oh yes 1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. ... _</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">PATHETIC feature of recent migrations of natives in Africa is that of a whole people that left their homes on the southern edge of the Sahara, in 1921, and came down into the notoriously unhealthy coast region near the mouth of the Congo, in the hopb that they might die. They expressed the wish that they might die on account of the ravages of the white man's liquor in their midst, and the spread of the white man’s disease, sometimes called the Frenchman’s disease, brought into their midst by their conquerors. Their women have refused to bear children, and the extinction of the tribe is slowly progressing.</span></p>

It can be seen at once who were the aggressors and who were the sufferers in thi* terrible campaign: *</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;Numbering about 1,500 in all, the Bondeb </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">live on a </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">reserve on the southern border </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">at</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> Southwest </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Africa. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">They are extremely poor, and live largely on ‘gum </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">sad </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">goat's milk.' Their moat important possesions are </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">their </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">flocks and the dogs which protect them from </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">jackala. On </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">these dogs the Administrator imposed taxes which </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">fax </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">surpassed in most cases the total income of </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">the whole </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">family (a family po</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">wring</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> five dogs, for instance, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">would </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">be taxed £10.) In desperation, the tribe </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">refused to </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">puf </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">its taxes. Thereupon the South African </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Government </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">sent a force of 370 men with artillery, machine-guns </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">two bombing aeroplanes, to put down what it described as a 'rising.' The Bondels, it is officially admitted, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">had </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">less than 200 men capable of fighting; and </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">these mm </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">possessed among than about seventy rifles, all told. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">It </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">is not surprising, therefore, that forty-nine of them were killed, including their leader, Abraham Morris, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">who had </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">been mentioned in despatches for his great bravery </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">when </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">fighting on the British side in the World </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">War. Several </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">women and children were killed, and about 700 </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">takm </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">prisoners. Over 13,000 head of stock were also captured.**</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Subsequent despatdies showed that one of the chiefs who was captured was sentenced to five years’ imprisonment for giving shelter to the brave British warrior above named, and also for carrying arms. It is. things like this that have filled the natives with distrust of the fairness and honesty of their white overlords. Accordingly, many of the young natives in Cape Town have taken to politics; and as they are allowed to vote when they have incomes of $250 per year, they are making their power felt.</span></p>

<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">S</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">' OME time ago, a gentleman called upon me at my office, introducing himself, as I thought he said, as a coal porter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">He seemed much too clean to have anything ’ to do with coal except in a. small way, such as putting </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">a little</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> bit of coal on the domestic hearth to keep the home fires burning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">I had no recollection of having seen him in charge of a coaling gang on the wharf, nor had I seen him asleep in the engineer’s cabin during bunkering operations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Coal has a darkening tendency, whereas he, was wondrous fair, with blue eyes. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">At all events, he asked me for a few minutes of my time; and that being a commodity with which I am unfortunately too well endowed, I granted his request &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Had he mentioned money, my attitude would have been different.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">He seemed impressed with my concession. I offered him the choice of fourteen empty chairs; but he preferred to stand. His disinclination to sit down gave me apprehension.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Raising a warning finger, he placed an attach^ case on the table, and I thought I was going to • be involved in the purchase on easy terms of some valuable treatise. However, he only produced a circular which announced in bold type that &quot;MILLIONS NOW LIVING WILL NEVER DIE.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">I immediately thought of the shares which</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;Rejoicing I Rejoicing!</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The kingdom who shall gain? Of all the peoples on the earth, Who with our King shall reign?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">I held in the Crematorium, and which I hoped would maintain me in </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">yny</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> old age. '</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">He said that I might become one of the mil* lions, but I said that I would prefer otherwise^ as it would mean that I would have to wait to see the Durban Town Council come to a dedsioe about some subject In the ordinary course, I expect to pass away before such an event takes place. The Councillors are the men he should interview, as the ordinary threescore yean and ten are of no use to them; and a longer lease ' of life is what they require in order to come to a decision on anything.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">My friend carried on a fervid discourse for a considerable time, as when I woke up an hour later he seemed to be warming up to his subject. He thanked me for my patient hearing; and I expressed my gratitude to him for his very lucid explanation of whatever it was all about.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Reviewing my position as a shareholder in the Crematorium, there seems a possibility of making a doss if millions now living will never die. On the other hand, I am doubtful if I shall ever live to see a return on my Grosvenor Syndicate shares, although I have heard that she will be refloated .next week and be moored in Durban Bay. A man told me so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">I asked my friend to leave his card in case I wanted him at any time.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">from the Federal authorities, that about 8,000 more immigrants are getting ready to sail for Canada, as he writes, to swell the ranks of unemployed now within the Do</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">mini</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">on-</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">He refers also to the fact that the Government figures show an exodus of </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">16,000 to</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> 18,000 per month:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">“If this record be maintained throughout the year, it will mean a loss of 200,000 of population.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The Edmonton </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Journal</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> reports the same condition, and comments on the local situation: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup></span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">A London (England) despatch to the sum . journal states that Tom Richardson, a former -member of the British House of Commons^ who has been in Canada for three years, severely attacks Canada’s immigration policy: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">“It is an act of cruelty,” he says, “to encourage </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">' J </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">people to seek work in Canada, where thousand* of unemployed.in the cities, and seventy-five percent of th* &gt;&nbsp;immigrants who went to work on the land, went down.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">James Simpson, Secretary of the Federation of Labor for Canada, as reported in the London (Ont.) </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Free Press,</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> stated that there were hun- / dreds of men walking the streets of the city, with no opportunity for employment, and that this was one of the chief contributing factors to the exodus of native Canadians from the conn-try. It was the speaker’s contention that unemployment conditions today were as bad as they had been all winter. Immigration had added to the problem in a serious way by the introduction of mechanics who at the first opportunity leave their farms and seek work in the cities.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">From Canada</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">Y</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">OUR correspondent sometimes wonders as to whether the people will ever awake to a sense of their personal responsibility. As to whether the effort in telling the people the truth about national conditions as nearly as that truth can be approximated is recompensed for by the desire aroused in the hearts of the people for something better, sometimes appears doubtful We pride ourselves, as a nation, on being sharp people; we can see just as far through a brick wall as most; it is hard to flimflam us with any scheme designed to delude us to our own hurt; and yet a casual perusal of our daily papers convince us that we are the most easily deluded of any. Your typical Canadian is a person of mixed national characteristics: Scottish carefulness, English obstinacy, American resourcefulness and push, and the shrewdness of the Irish all combine to make him a hard m</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">an </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">to beat Today, much against his will be it said, he is being convinced that Canada is prosperous; and with triumphant flourish trade figures and bank clearings are published to show that she is getting steadily more prosperous.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Let us try once more.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">If Canada is prosperous, its manufacturers are getting wealthy, without a doubt. The Toronto </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Telegram</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> echoes its contemporary papers in the following: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;Four hundred and fifty firms withdraw from Canadian Manufacturers Association during year. Thoma* Roden, Toronto, addressed a gathering [of the C. M. A.], hi* opening remark being that it was a 'tragic year*, and then went on to advise the assembled manufacturers that 201 houses had failed, 107 had resigned, and 27 had pleaded financial embarrassment as their reason for dropping out.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">No comment is necessary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">If Canada is prosperous, its people are content to stay here to work and to enjoy their prosperity. The newspaper comments on the exodus of workers to the U. S. A., which continues unabated, would seem to indicate that they seriously doubt this prosperity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">London </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Advertiser</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">“Toronto mayo^ asks all cities to assist. Deplore* exodus of young Canadians to United States.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Mayor Hiltz refers to recent announcements from the various provincial governments and</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">loaded, and no doubt an attempt will be made to do this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">In the meantime, the public show an exasperating determination to get to the bottom of things; and there yet seems room for hope that for once at least, monied bank-wreckers will share the sufferings of their poor victims.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">From the Edmonton </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Journal:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;Half a million living on taxes of rest of people; Gratton O’Leary gives staggering National Debt figures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">“‘It is a conservative estimate that something like half a million people of this country are living on the taxes of the rest of us,’ declared Gratton O’Leary, Ottawa newspaperman, before the Canadian Credit Men’s Association. '</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">“The national debt of Canada is today $2,400,000,000. In other words, we have since the Armistice increased the national debt more than we increased it during the whole war. And this is not all. There are enormous railway securities which the Dominion of Canada has guaranteed, and which bring the gross public debt of the Dominion to $3,219,000,000, according to a statement of the Royal Bank of Canada. Adding the debt of our provinces and cities, we have the alarming total of $500 indebtedness for every man, woman, and child in the Dominion.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">We think that there may be a tendency to confuse terms, in the minds of some. Please note that the gross public debt is variously stated in newspaper reports; for it is a term loosely used to indicate either the gross national debt (Federal or Dominion debts incurred through the activities of the Ottawa government), or the gross public debt, which would he the above, plus debts incurred by other governing bodies within the Dominion, such as Provincial, Municipal, and Civic governments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The Edmonton </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Sunday Bulletin</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> asks the question in a special article, “What’s Wrong with the World These Days!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;And what ia the remedy for all </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">its ills ?</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> Everywhere government* are in difficulties; and all over North America we are discovering evidences of graft. What does it mean?—a sort of Jesting Paganism abroad.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">“The world is hard to govern just now. Unroll the map of the world, look where you will, and you will see a country that is politically upset”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The article presents many questions to its readers:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">“Have we got what the Allies fought for? One does not like to say yet that the world will not be the better</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">for its purging of war, but so far the benefit* are net visible.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">“Is there more dishonesty in public life? -Unfortunately, there is a popular levity about the charge* and exposures that have been made. The most shocking aspect of the whole shocking business is the attitude &lt;rf the daily press, which, for the most part, rails at the accusers and investigators rather than at the men in high places who assisted in the looting of the nation and gathered in bribes and thefts shamelessly.” ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">We would expect little better from the suborned press that claims to represent the voice of the people, and is merely the logos of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">exploiting</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> big interests. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">However if the Edmonton </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Bulletin</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> ia seriously looking for an answer, a postcard to this magazine will bring it a complete and satisfying one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">~ Political interferences of an extremely obnoxious character involving adverse criticism of the present provincial Government on the pari of the Roman Catholic Church has brought about a considerable coolness between Church and State.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The Montreal </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Daily Star</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> announces “Breach between Church and Government of Quebec wider. Liberals may appeal to Rome against </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">L’Action Catholique.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The offensive item apparently is an open letter written by Ferdinand Belanger, one of the &quot;&nbsp;editorial staff of </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">L’Action Catholique,</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> in which he says that during the last provincial campaign Premier Taschereau had threatened Cardinal Begin with open warfare if </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">L’Action Catholique </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">was not ordered to stop interfering with politics.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The Boman Church tries to keep the steel daw well hidden by the velvet glove. But once in a while it slips and scratches the wrong man; and for a moment a glimpse can be caught of the medieval spirit of Rome, and her unholy ambition to establish her ghostly headship over nations and to regain her temporal power.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">In the ranks of the Protestant Church the fight for legalized union goes merrily on. Ottawa is besieged by prelates and partisans for or against the union of the Presbyterian, Methodist, and Congregationalist churches.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The spiritual angle of the controversy, the scrapping of ereeds held and taught tenaciously for many years, commands little attention, but the property and financial rights cause much bitterness. What more could be expected of a commercialized system but that its hardest fight would be over the Golden Calf that it has worshiped so long I</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The question of peace is much in the public eye today.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Recently delegates from all over the world came to Canada to speak on peace. Presumably peace is the desire of all nations, and so long as soldiers and naval attaches et al are discussing it, no one says a word. These delegates were pacifists; so the Toronto City Council almost came to blows deciding whether it would be patriotic to let the word peace be spoken in the sacred precincts of Toronto's fair city.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The TorontoDcwly </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Star</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> headlines an interesting account of the meeting that was ultimately held with “Preached Gospel of Peace While Police Held in Reserve”! Yes; we in Canada want to get rid of war, just as a drunken man wants to have his whisky taken away from him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">And so the weary world wags on. &nbsp;*</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">America and Japan</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">I</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">T IS claimed that in California, in 1919, the Japanese who were in that state produced $67,000,000 worth of foodstuffs^ which would not have been produced if they had not been there. This shows that the Japanese issue is not all one-sided. Just how effective the so-called “Gentlemen's Agreement” is in preventing immigration from Japan may be judged from the fact that three steamers during the month of May made special trips from Japan to the United States to bring in the great number of brides selected by the photograph method by the men already in America.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The American ambassador to Japan has resigned, and the Japanese ambassador to the United States has also resigned, or will at least return to Japan temporarily or permanently; and while these resignations are explained away as having no particular significance, yet history shows that such resignations are common between countries that are on the brink of war. The news of the retirement or recall of the Japanese ambassador to the United States appeared in the press at the same time as the announcement that President Coolidge had signed the immigration bill, which includes the Japanese exclusion clause.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">If the flight of the aviators around ths world does nothing else, it will probably convince the militarists of all nations of the possibility that their own aviators can visit other nations in time of war, with generous quantities of poison gas and those other adjuncts of our present civilization, while the people will be taught to believe that all wars are of divine arrangement and have divine sanction. Each different kind of gas will have its own flock of dominies to bless it</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Along the lines of the proclamation of the true gospel it is encouraging to- read that the sale and distribution of the Bible is greatly on the increase, the distribution in Japan alone last year having been 343,588; while the increase in distribution in China watf more than a million copies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Java &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">HE Netherlands have a colonial empire of 50,000,000 people in the Dutch East Indien From generation to generation the Hollandish Government gets along peaceably with the natives. Java increases in population and in prosperity. One never hears of rebellions requiring the punitive expeditions so common in other colonial empires. Now we hear that the Dutch are founding a great Javanese university, in which the natives may be educated and fitted for the government of the islands when the time shall have come for Holland to place the control in their hands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Australia</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">F</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">OUR out of the six Australian states are now governed by the Labor Party, recent elections in South Australia and West Australia having both resulted in Labor victories. Tasmania came under the control of the Labor Party at the beginning of the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Between April 6 and May 19 two Australian aviators flew completely around Australia, most of the distance along the coast, traveling altogether 9,000 miles. While they were on the wing their average speed was ninety miles an hour. The Australian government is considering the use of airplanes in connection with a search for sites for meteorological stations, that is to say, weather stations, around the borders of the Antarctic continent</span></p>

<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">I</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">T IS interesting to know that the great body of water called Baffin Bay to the north of the Canadian mainland has regular service to and from Quebec; but unless any wonder at this, we explain that the regular service is limited to one vessel each year, which leaves Quebec July 1. To the few human beings living on the desolate shores of Baffin Bay it must be a thrilling experience when the hull of the vessel first comes into sight. However, life in the far north is not the same now as it was before the invention of radio. The Arctic expedition of Captain MacMillan has been in quite frequent touch with civilization throughout the year during which he has been in the far north.</span></p>

It was in 1824, one hundred years ago, that Brazil proclaimed its independence of Portugal and organized aa a republic. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The governor of the Bank of England and other prominent capitalists have recently visited Brazil, and have advised the Brazilian Government to dispose of the present federal railways and steamship lines and to abandon the policy of constructing and operating railroads and to postpone the development of government-owned steel interests. In other words, the people of Brazil are invited to put all their assets into the hands of bankers who will see to it that thereafter the Brazilians have no claim to the assets and no share of the profits.</span></p>

Richards, for</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> thirty-five years a missionary in Africa, in an address at Binghamton, New York, said: </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">“The white man took his Bible and Jesus Christ with him and invaded Africa and now the promised land ia his. The Mohammedan had swept the continent with fire and. sword, and got nothing but defeat and trouble for his pains. Other nations had tried to slice off the delicious African territory, but all to no avail. It took Christianity .to see the value of the black man, to give him a chance, just a chance; and now, all the land ia ours. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\</span></p>

The white man ie the first to handle the gold, and the ivory, and the valuable oatrich feathers, and the wonderful white ivory; and it ia all ours. We brought the black man the Bible, and • sterling religion—and the Almighty hands ua the reins of control and possession of the land.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Commenting on this the Walton, N. Y., Reporter says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">“The black man geta ‘the Bible and a sterling religion/ but the white man walks off with the profits. When the black man geta intelligence, will he think the exchange fair and retain his love for the Bible? The attempt of the missionary to act in a dual capacity, that of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">taring </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">the Lord and the commercial interests at the </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">same </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">time, can have but one outcome and that ia to discredit utterly the religion he professes. Commercialism and Chris* tianity </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">an </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">not twin religions; and the attempt </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Babsons and Richards to lure business men with the </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">bait </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">of profits to be supporters of the church is as sordid </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">aa </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">the gospel of the Tull dinner pail' -that the protective tariff was to give every workingman. It is an appeal to cupidity and nothing more, and the harvest will ba </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">crop of hypocrites.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">How brief is human glory!

<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">O</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">N ACCOUNT of the fact that the past winter has seen a good price for sugar, the island of Cuba has had a period of great prosperity with strikes of all sorts in all parts of the island to a degree never before experienced. The street-car lines have been tied up, and trains wrecked, and there has been some loss of life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Gnat Britain</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">M</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ERELY as a matter of news, and not because we approve its policies, we call attention to the program of the Co</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">-mTn-nnia</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">f. Party of Great Britain. The Communist Party, which is antagonistic to the Labor Party, but which is working to some extent in connection with it, has a program which includes the nationalization of mines and railways without paying anything to their present owners, control of industries by the workers, cancellation of the national, debt with compensation only to the small dapositors, state control of banks and of internal prices, old age pensions at sixty, and minimum wage laws. This is the immediate program, besides which there is proposed a state monoply of the press, the nationalization of all tea industries, and the general distribution of firearms among all classes, except those who happen to have a little property. To our way of thinking, the program is incomplete. It should provide for free admission to the insane asylum of all persons holding such impossible views.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The British and French Premiers have joined in a note to the German Government, protesting against the repeated open and secret activities of military associations throughout Germany. They have told the German Government that these activities gravely complicate the situation when the prospects of putting the Dawes Plan into operation has aroused hope of a settlement of the problems growing out of the World War.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The prohibition question is again advocated in England. The Bishop of Oxford has presented a bill providing that in certain districts a compulsory vote be taken every three years on the liquor question. It is not believed that the bill will be passed; but it is interesting to know that it has the support of thirty-two of the British Bishops, who by reason of their office are members of the British Government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The quiet advance of luxuries to the tables of all classes continues in England as elsewhere. Ten years ago, grapefruit was practically unknown in England. The present consumption is estimated at about 1,600 tons annually, and is on the increase.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The Imperial Defense Committee of the British Empire has decided that the tunnel to France must hot be built To this we can only say: What a pity that a tunnel which would mean so much in the way of convenience and benefit to millions of people in the British Isles, and on the Continent, should be held up by militarists. Arguments against the tunnel were that it might possibly be used to the disadvantage of British naval forces. This seems ridiculous.</span></p>

This statue is made from camion ■which Napoleon captured. Honest and decent human beings are wondering why they should allow to remain the statue of such a heartless butcher. It is a strange mental perversion that throughout the ages has glorified the men who are chiefiy responsible for widows and orphans, armless, legless, sightless men, and millions of rotting corpses. In our judgment the statue should come down; and if it were not for the valuable metal it contains, it should be buried a mile deep under ashes and tin cans.</span></p>

But the Swiss people instead of keeping these plants under their own control, have sanctioned development under a control which is part Swiss, part German, part French, and part Italian. As a consequence, immense quantities of power are being exported from Switzerland at rates much less than those charged to the Swiss people themselves.' The natural result is the breaking down of Swiss industries. It has even been proposed to transfer Swiss industries into the border provinces of France and Germany, and there to operate them on the low wage scale and at low cost for raw materials with cheap power exported from Switzerland. In the face of such</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The opposition parties have withdrawn from the Italian Parliament, leaving Mussolini and his friends in complete control. Mussolini has stated that, personally, he has no intention whatever of resigning or of disbanding the Fascist militia. Mussolini is having trouble in the controlling of his 600,000 black shirt warriors, many of whom are mere youths who have never done any real work, and who would not do it if it were offered to them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>

More recent papers stated that, as a last-minute favor, American bankers had been let in to take one-fifth of the loan. It now appears that they have actually taken about one-half of it. The way in which this matter has been given publicity convinces us that this is all propaganda, and that it was the intention of the United States bankers from the very first to supply a large portion of this loan.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ACTIVITY stiH- continues in Washington even though Congress is not now in session. The committee investigating the naval oil lease scandals has returned indictments against Mr. Fall, former Secretary of the Interior, Mr. Sinclair of the Mammoth Oil Company, Mr. Doheny, also an oil magnate, and his son. The first indictment charges the two Dohenys and Mr. Fall with a conspiracy to defraud the United States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The second indictment charges Mr. Fall and Mr. Sin</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">clair</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> with a like conspiracy. The third indictment charges the two Dohenys with paying a bribe of $100,000 to Mr. Fall The fourth indictment charges Mr. Fall with accepting the alleged $100,000 bribe. It is alleged in the indictment that competitive bidding for a certain lease was ignored in order that it might be obtained by Mr. Doheny from Mr. Fall; that false representations were made by Mr. Fall to other bidders for the reserves, stating that he was not contemplating leasing the reserves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Other testimony in connection with the Department of Justice activities under Mr. Daugherty shows that much corruption was eating the vitals of this most august department; that Mr. Daugherty took charge of the department with very modest resources, and refused to explain to the committee in what manner his fortune was increased so enormously. It tells of subordinates promoted for infidelity to the public * service, and of other persons demoted for fidelity to their duty. There were honest and brave officials who spurned bribes, and courageously stood against contamination.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Illegal transportations of moving-picture films, and their exhibition, and illegal sales of liquor enter into the report. There were plots and counterplots; and decoys were set in motion for the purpose of defrauding the government and otherwise prostituting government officials. Illegal, unauthorized and unconstitutional work was carried on by the great Burns Detective Agency. There were the breaking of locks, exploring of senators’ offices, and otherwise making efforts to destroy records which could be used against the department in the prosecution of crime. The detectives were employed not to run down the guilty, but more particularly to shield profiteers, bribe-takers and favorites. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>

The President declared, at a recent budget conference, t^at he was for economy, and after that he was for more economy. He has demanded of the government heads that they make a vigorous fight all along the line for maximum reduction in expenditures, and for efficiency in carrying on the business of the government. To the already large cut in expenditures he wants another cut of $83,000,000 in order to establish a surplus of $108,000,000 at the end of the fiscal year instead of the estimated $25,000,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">There has been also the greatest shake-up which the foreign service of the United States has ever experienced. Sixty persons have been dropped from Diplomatic and Consular'services, and others were reduced in rank. There was a re-classification and grading of the Foreign Service personnel</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The propagandists for the League of Nations are still busy trying to beat down the will of the people as expressed in the last national election. A military view is that the world has always been organized for war, and intermittently the world has always had war. The League of Nations is referred to as the first organized effort for peace; and the assertion is made that therefore, when the organization is completed by the entry of the United States into the “peace organization,” the world will secure peace. The statement is made that &quot;more and more are the people of the country looking into the League and its organization, policies and accomplishments; and they have been doing this rather free from the emotionalism and prejudices aroused by the last presidential campaign.” In setting forth other reasonings favorable to the League of Nations the propagandists sum up the matter by-saying, “These conclusion point inevitably to the League of Nations, or something so like it as to qualify for its twin brother.” Thus the ultimate necessity of the League of Nations is constantly forced upon our minds. They would have us think in the terms of a slogan for a well-known brand of flour: “Eventually, why not now?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The League of Nations was forced upon the Democratic Convention by its advocates, and was disposed of in a plank declaring for the referendum; and if the people of the United States are allowed to do their own thinking, neither the League of Nations nor its twin brother will ever be endorsed. The politicians are scheming, and if it is possible to override the expressed wishes of the people they will do it, and resort to any camouflage to do it</span></p>

<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">HE following is a three-weeks’ diary of a vacation spent in selling the publications of the International Bible Students Association, giving the experiences of four young ladies with one “Henry,&quot; in 1923.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">July 21. The day of all days 1 Our hopes have matured for a three weeks’ vacation, advertising the King and His kingdom. Edi-Mae and I are here in Keene. We arrived at eleven-thirty p. m., falling into the arms of Mary-Anne at the crossroads. Then came a grand rush for Honey-C on nearby steps, a warm welcome, and (bless the hearts of these dear ones!) a boiling hot dinner awaited us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">We tried very hard to relate the day’s experiences in one breath. This accomplished, EdiMae proceeded with a graphic description of procuring Henry in a week’s time. Two mouths were wide opened. Of course, this only added fuel to the fire; and the moments were lived to the full as we recounted seeming impossibilities overcome, the final start, and the wonderful trip to the colporteur camp. We were so delighted with freedom from office cares and worries that every breeze upon the fields of clover, every call of the songsters in nests and tree tops, lowing of cattle and the creaking of carts in fragrant hayfields cast around us its own mystical charm, holding us entranced. We were out where life was throbbing, on our way to tell the glad tidings that the boon of life, everlasting life, is to be man’s blessed portion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Could I describe my ecstasy to the girls that night? No! Just then I could only feel; words would come later; but I find that they have not. When one feels the most, he speaks the least. Would that we all felt more! However, I did attempt a description of one scene of solemn beauty—the moonrise over Monadnock Mountain and its subdued reflection upon the waters of Dublin Lake. The girls smiled. Do I interpret the smiles to mean that this beauty can be duplicated or perchance surpassed? I am content to wait</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">July 22. The day of much talk and little action. To the Christian who ’understands the Creator’s- beneficent character and marvelous plan of salvation, each day is a Sabbath of devotion and rest in Him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">I awoke with the warm sun streaming in at the windows of the little room which served as a kitchen, bedroom, sitting-room, wash-room and pantry. On arriving my senses were attuned to only one thing: I was where I wanted to be—with the girls in thetr colporteur headquarters; and it mattered not where that was or what it was. With the coming of morning, however, I was all curiosity, and with astonishment viewed the room in which we had slept. We made our beds, then sat upon them; for there was no room for superfluous implements of rest engendering lazy contentment. Our luggage reposed in the straight-backed ehairs, and the one rocker was shunned with vigilance. The towel upon the cupboard door—it posed as such—was a selfish thing, so I thought, claiming most of the space. It held my intense interest I couldn’t quite associate it with the library table (a typewriter stand) and the piles of books in pasteboard boxes (the bookcase). In time, however, my fascination changed to honest respect, and dean Miss Towel fitted most becomingly into my novel surroundings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Honey-C was busy cooking breakfast Land knows, I don’t, where the food came from and where the eggs were fried. A few yean ago I would have searched for Aladdin’s lamp. However, the goblins failed to appear after breakfast, and the dishes were washed in their familiar tub placed on the soap-box. The dishes— they were such once—then held my undivided attention. I was oblivious to their charm while eating, and why shouldn’t I be? Pewter spoons, chased silver, crockery and china are all the same when one is transplanted to the land of his dreams; and Edi-Mae and I surely were.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">As I scrubbed the platters and mixing bowls, substituted for plates and cups, I continued to satisfy my ever-increasing curiosity. I couldn’t explore the crowded nooks just then, but I was determined to discover the hidden source whence flowed the peace and sanctity of that little lowly haven. God’s spirit I knew rested there; for the two Christian soldiers nobly reflected His likeness. Nevertheless there was another influence abroad, and I must find it Then, in a moment as I glanced upon the walls, the mystery was solved. I saw there mottoes of comfort and admonition, precious promises from God’s Word and clusters of cards with loving messages cherished for the givers’ sake. The little red plaque with raised enamel letters, &quot;He Knows, He Loves^</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">He Cares,” was a constant reminder to me of the Christian secret of a happy life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Honey-C soon brought forth a bag of peas to shell Whenever in the future I shall see peas being stripped for the kettle, with joy shall I remember that morning's conversation. She spoke of her twelve years of devoted service in the Master's vineyard, and the few persons she had encouraged to enter the door of service. She spoke not of the sacrifices and denials, but of the privileges and superlative joys. When ones I mentioned the sacrifices, she replied in simplicity that there were none. I glanced again over the crowded room — a novelty for three weeks. Yes! But for twelve years! We were .going to pack for another headquarters the next day, and I looked forward to it. Would I look forward to moving from one city to another, from one state to another every five months or so! Her love for the Master and His cause enabled her to classify sacrifice and pleasure as the self-same </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">thing</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">- To great hearts enlarged by loving labor, sacrifices are counted as great gains; and the faces of these two dear ones speak to me. Blessed be such! &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">In the afternoon the girls' landlady, now much interested in the truth, joined our circle of four; and we had fulfilled within our midst the Lord's rich promise of blessing where two or three are gathered together in </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">Wie</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> name. We studied the seventh string upon the “Harp of God,” Our Lord’s Beturn, considering the many evidences that Christ is present for the work of setting up His kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">In the evening we motored over to see the new place we were considering as a future abode, chiefly because it was larger. We were very much delighted when ushered into four spacious rooms. The rent was cheaper, and we immediately engaged them, and decided to move the next day! A hair-raiser for housewives! Night overtook us in bed; a strenuous day lay ahead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">July 23. Moving day! However, the Lord's work came first; and while preparations were in process by Mary-Anne and Edi-Mae, Honey-C and I mounted our bicycles for a five-mile trip into the country to deliver books. I did enjoy that ride! It surely was delightful, pushing along the country roads in the early morning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">On our return the remark was made that no small part of the colporteur work is moving and that, as we desired to be three-week colporteurs, we had best be initiated. We were! When our Henry appeared at the door, we greeted him with the contents of that little room and told him to transport them faithfully. The room was little; but, oh my! what it contained! The more we moved out, the more there was to move out. Honey-C enjoyed the proceedings so much that she ordered the rest of us out of the room. MaryAnne was dismissed on the ground that the floors at our new domicile must be washed; EdiMae must needs drive Henry; and I had best wash the windows. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">1</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> demurred, being afraid that an avalanche of books and boxes would bury our poor Honey-C, if left alone. She didn't say that it wouldn't happen, but she ordered me out nevertheless. I had never washed windows before^ and scarcely escaped alive ever to wash them again.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">- The contents of the one room arrived in six Henry loads. Laughter and jest reigned in. profusion. It was a novel experience to Edi-Maa and me. It was more than a novelty. I took keen delight in watching the girls in ths midst of confusion and chaos, humming snatches of hymns and so often speaking tender words of regard and love, one to another. Sentimentality calls forth a love which responds when surroundings and circumstances be attuned; but how I glory in a love which will spread its unselfish warmth around a circle of dust and confusion. Begone the twilight hours and song of birds to open my heart to words; welcome the din and dirt where a heart Hes always approachable, dispensing its fragrance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">How does the poor moon ever blink so serenely as it beams down upon us and our rooms tonight!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">July 24. I doubt whether the moon did shine for long; for I declare that the moment after I fell asleep I was awakened with a kiss, and the sun was streaming in. We hastily bade adieu to the moving dump, and packed our Henry to the full We were off for our first day of the most wonderful work in which a being could engage. The ride was one never to be forgotten. The scenery was beautiful; but I was more intent upon whom I should meet at the journey’s end. Never before had I done country territory, much as I longed to; and now that the time had come I was slightly perturbed. What poor, queer creatures we are anyway! Imagine my astonished wonder when I placed a complete set (eight</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Aoovar IX </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">1934 </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">books) at my first house. Instead of fainting, my first decision, I returned to the astonished man two dollars and fifteen cents in change, in place of the proper amount of fifteen cents. He reminded me, however, that he had given me $3 ■ instead of $5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">I made my exit somehow, and walked for ten minutes in a trance. I came to, only to realize that my case was empty and that the anto with more books would not be back for at least two hours. What should I do? Of course I would sell a set at the next house; but no books. My enthusiasm was enkindled, and was not to be extinguished by the mere lack of books.* I returned to my first house and asked for my books back, if you please. I explained that I would take orders with the set, returning it at night</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">As long as I am troubled with nightmares, will the disagreeable color, awkward location, and frightful atmosphere of that next house continue to haunt me. To a passerby it might appear as a quiet, cozy home. My experience there made it' obnoxious to me. Had the lady of the house persecuted me solely, I could have left with less turmoil of heart; but the outrageous slander and false accusations against Pastor Russell brought flaming color to my cheeks. I had no desire to retaliate, but the rank injustice of her gross statements filled me with disgust. Nevertheless, mingled with it was a degree of pity for a warped and perverted mind. I recall it has always been thus. Men great enough to maintain the favor of God have been the objects of slander from the vacillating masses drifting with the current of public opinion. One Servant was hailed as king, and five days later was crucified. “The darkness hateth the light.” I sold no more complete sets that day, although placing a few single books. We drove home tired but happy, expressing our joy in the encouraging song, “One more day’s work for Jesus.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">July 25. Cloudy and rainy, a wonderful day to make order out of chaos. We started in bright and early. Who could boast of a more cozy home than ours when twilight came? We transformed into a kitchen one of the four rooms we now so proudly. owiied. The two-burner oil stove is there, and a barrel for a sink. A pair of deft hands had made a cupboard from a pasteboard box, and it gives the room the dignified appearance of a kitchen. A sitting room was created next in like manner. It boasts of a chair</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ns</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">and some springs, covered with draperies. I discovered that it had no upholstery, by pouncing my weary limbs upon it. Near to the box of books, the same cherished bookcase, stands ths dining table made whole by means of glue and two nails. It trembles when the one kerosene lamp our apartment boasts of is placed upon it. One more box was quickly made into a dresser for a bedroom; the trunk in the other room served as a dresser when covered with a towel. With two cots in each room the sleeping rooms were then completed, with the sole exception of a chair, when it was not needed elsewhere. Ohl the wash room and supply book room, the best of all The books were carefully covered; for we live in great haste, and the waves are many and great when scrubbing is in process. Then a rope was suspended from wall to wall and our towels carelessly but nobbily hung thereupon. A basin upon a barrel with a mirror in front makes a most satisfactory wash-bowl. At our feet stands a foot-tub, and at our right a box of toilet articles. Who ooulld ask for more?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">July 26. With the cares of this life attended to we were free to depart for our far territory, where the on-coming kingdom of peace and happiness was to be announced by willing lips and joyful hearts. The morning was glorious. As we spun down one of the hills which tried to be a mountain, a touring car swiftly glided by; and Edi-Mae and I recognized at the same moment a Boston face I What joy was ours to see someone from home! We called and called, but to no avail Could I let that car go by? No! And verily we bellowed as the car drove into a curve. We were left behind to fight back some tears and a lonely feeling. The lonely feeling vanished, however, as we became absorbed in heralding the glad tidings of great joy yet to be for all people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;’</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">One town having been finished, the good work was commenced in a neighboring village. Several books were placed. When dusk came on our Henry was turned about for home and the hill which we had left in the early morning with the lonesome feeling. No time for heartaches then. Henry decided to stop on the steepest pitch. The gasoline had run into the back of the tank! It was late; were tired; the last filling station had been passed miles above. The only thing to do was to back up. A car passed by. “Masxa-chusetts!” 'A smiling face glanced back at us. “In trouble t” Of course we were, but hated to say so. The summit was reached after a thrilling dimb of a mile and a half. Edi-Mae has a backache tonight</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">July 27. Someone had a bright idea this morning. Why not camp out over night, and then we would be on our territory bright and early in the morning! We all fell for it Mattresses were rolled up, bed clothing and tent packed into the carrier, and we were off. The day was a happy one, cheering, weary hearts and administering the Balm of Gilead. Edi-Mae and Mary-Anne left us to finish Marlow, while they took the country roads. They faithfully canvassed every path which had the appearance of a road. When the cow-path ended they left Henry and walked, often to receive no response. But it is this faithfulness under adversity which forms character, and they returned to us with radiant faces.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><sub>t</sub> Then it was time to camp. We must locate near the shelter of a house. The site chosen was near a house, and also near a pig pen, which was discovered too late. The woman was very hospitable until Honey-C alighted from the car. Of all the looks! &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;__ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;’</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“Didn't you canvass me yesterday!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Then we all recalled Honey-C’s strange experience of the day before, and decided that she must be the woman. She looked like a spiritist.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">It was growing late, and the tent must be pitched. Mary-Anne and Edi-Mae had the honor, while Honey-C and I prepared the evening meat The girls applied themselves to the task like men. It was no easy matter, as they had never pitched^ a tent before; and darkness overtook them. Supper was eaten hastily, and how good it was! With the last mouthful a threatening storm cloud burst One wild scramble for the tent; no flash light; giggling and squealing were plentiful; bub drowsiness soon came, as the day had been a hard one. I rolled to the end of the tent, and dropped into slumberland.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">I was awakened by startled voices. One look' at Edi-Mae—something had happened while I slept. Why was it so light in the tent! I was bewildered. .1 knew that I should be scared, and it didn't take much effort to feign it</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“What’s the matter, Edi-Mae!” I gasped in a stage whisper.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“The dash-light to the auto has been turned on.” The tent was pitched over the car. I felt too near the car for comfort The light in the tent was explained.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“Mary-Anne, where is she!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;Parading around the tent”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Whew! I preferred the inside. After anxious waiting she returned. No evidence of a soul, and who would stroll about at midnight in the pelting rain to turn on a dash-light anyway! It was mysterious to be sure, but what could we do! Honey-C decided to sleep chicken fashion,with one eye open; Mary-Anne and Edi-Mae decided to stay awake the rest of the night; but I could not resist sleep and dreams.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">A sprightly jump awakened me once again. Mary-Anne’s head was hanging out of the tent, and Edi Mae was bolt upright in bed. The dashlight was on again I Edi-Mae whispered to mt that it went on before their very eyes, and that Mary-Anne had jumped to the tent door at that very moment. There was no sign of a being, however, on our No Man’s Land. It was not a short circuit, as the light had been turned. Wo all told each other not to be frightened!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">July 28. The escapade ended by our giving our kind benefactress the next morning a book entitled, “Can the Living Talk with the Dead!” Having refused even a paper previously, she accepted this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">It was still pouring. The mattresses could nut go into the carrier now. What a Henry, can carry when pressed to the occasion is a revelation. Three mattresses were strewed hospital fashion on the back seat; and we were laid thereupon with suitcases, boxes, bags and books hugged close up to our chins for coverlets. It was a memorable ride home. Edi-Mae went to bed at high noon. At seven o’clock we all piled on her bed, and ate onion sandwiches. On the strength of these Edi-Mae turned over and went to sleep.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">July 29. We arose at eleven-thirty, and ate a royal breakfast. The girls then dressed our Henry in his best bib and tucker, while Honey-C and I studied for the afternoon’s lesson.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The hour’s study was refreshing and helpful as we considered the Laodicean servant’s faithfulness to the Church in proclaiming the truth? due to be understood. We realized at what great cost to himself he continued his proclamation of God’s gracious plan and character, fearlessly denouncing the creeds of men as responsible for the gross darkness covering the earth. Our hearts were raised in supreme thankfulness to.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">from Babylon when its true condition was recognized. She bought the complete set. I passed on to the “next door.” The minister's wife dismissed me abruptly. I approached her husband at the barn door.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“I would not be interested in your message,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“It is the message of the setting up of God’s kingdom here on earth, when </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">His</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> will shall be done here as in heaven.”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“I am not interested; moreover, I am a clergyman.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“Indeed! Then what.I have will interest you greatly.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“No!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“I never before knew that a clergyman would not be interested at least to investigate the subject of God’s kingdom.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“Well, you know it now, don’t you?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Yes, I recalled the words of the Apostle: “There shall come in the last days scoffers, walking after their own lusts, and saying, Where is the promise of his coming? for since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation.”—2 Peter 3:3,4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Afternoon brought us to a wealthy colony of summer people. We thought little could be done here, but were satisfied to give a witness. To our surprise several books were placed. One woman, through the efforts of a colored cook in the neighborhood, had become greatly interested and was glad to buy “The Harp of God.” “The Harp of God” was also placed at a beautiful mansion, although we were informed by the lady that positions as servants would be more remunerative than canvassing for books. We recognized the cold fact to be true. The woman of wealth cannot now understand the motive which prompts to the laying down of life and the forfeiting of ease for the joy of being harbingers of earth’s new day, the Golden Age.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">August 2. Four mighty tired girls Thursday morning. Wo did not start out until four p. m. We planned to canvass a few houses en route to Munsonville, and camp out again. At the first house canvassed Mary-Anne found a man who had the six books and was greatly interested. He bought “The Finished Mystery” to complete the set, “The Harp of God” and “The World’s Distress—Why? The Remedy.” He then invited us to camp in his yard. We did no more can-</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">God for the courageous, loving ministry of this devoted follower of the cross of Christ, and for bringing us out of darkness into His marvelous light.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">July 30. Off for Marlow. A most delightful day. The auto left us at a small village, and the girls departed for the country roads. I was glad that I placed my set of eight before the journey commenced, although I am persuaded that a ton weight could have been carried by me unnoticed. I had placed my set of eight books with a true spirit-begotten Christian. I enjoyed sweet fellowship with the elderly man for nearly an hour. It was a joy to hear him say that he believed God’s kingdom was coming here to earth. He quoted frequently from Revelation. Rvelation and Isaiah are his favorite books. What pleasure was mine to place within his hands the complete comments on every verse in Revelation and to tell </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> God’s due time has come for Revelation to be understood 1 The dear man fondled the books tenderly, and my heart burned within me. Here was a saint in bondage. May he have the courage to obey the Master’s . call, “Come out of her, my people.” With tears in his eyes he shook hands, exclaiming, &quot;Oh that our churches had those who would reveal God’s plan and character as you have this afternoon; and that we might hear their voices in our midst!” God has opened His people’s lips and placed a new song there, even the loving kindness of our God; and this saint recognized the song as that of Moses and the Lamb.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The girls also had a happy day. So far, we have placed over one hundred books; and it rejoices our hearts to leave behind us a path, blazed with the light of truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Mary-Anne and Edi-Mae picked thimble-berries by the way. The berries made a nice supper.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">July 31, August L. The good work' continues. Had many interesting experiences. Honey-C and I met with ministers. I was prepared to meet mine by a woman living next door. She told me that she had left the church two months previously, as she was receiving neither food nor comfort; the .urgent cry was money; her eyes were opened. She was rather skeptical at first; but as I showed her scriptures foretelling this very condition, she became greatly interested. I told her that she had done the very thing most pleasing to the Lord in withdrawing</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">vassing. While the girls erected the tent Honey-</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">C</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> and I explored the barnyard and a pen of sheep. Then we had a delicious lunch, went to bed and to sleep.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">August 3. “Wine on the lees’* for breakfast, followed by the morning’s service. We then had great sport in lowering the tent Mary-Anne was inside. Edi-Mae and I let the guy ropes go, and-called to her, “Babylon is falling!** Then as a just retribution it rained! Rained! Every time we camp out it rains! As Honey-C had developed a sick headache, we turned our Henry toward home. After an hour’s riding the sky cleared. A house appeared; it must be canvassed. “The Harp of God” was placed with a man who said he would have to forfeit a meal if he bought it I told him that it was worth it; and I was happy in leaving the book with him. Honey-C was very sick; but nevertheless as it had cleared, she wished us to branch off and do a little canvassing. We appreciated the sacrifice; for it enabled us to place a number of books. Then Mary-Anne pointed out a road over which an auto could not possibly pass; but EdiMae and she could walk it—a mile' and a half! .What an inspiring example of faithfulness! They knew that only one house lay at the end of the road. After three hours they returned, having placed “The Harp of God.” It was past noon. A quick lunch was prepared on the running board, and the repast quickly disappeared. Ambrosia was never sweeter to the gods than those blueberries and milk were to us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The heat waxed more and more intense. When we reached home, Honey-C went to bed; and the rest of us donned our bathing suits and went out hunting for something in which to bathe. We discovered only a stagnant pool, and had to return with dry feet. Next time we’ll find our body of water before we dress—or undress—for the occasion. We were going to get cool—and clean—somehow; and so we had a turn of hair washing, rinsing one another’s head under the pump. I hope to live until morning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">August 4. Off for the Green Mountain State. Edi-Mae’s brother has invited us to spend a little time at Landgrove, and we are very glad for a three days\rest and change. We continue to proclaim in a very unique way the glad tidings in every town passed through. A large pennant was stretched across our Henry—“Millions Now Living Will never Die.” At Rockingham a large car h</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">umm</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ed by us, calling-out, &quot;Quite right!” It has already aroused people’s curiosity, so that we- have placed two or three books. -</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The trip was wonderful, over winding hills and through sloping valleys with the majesties rugged peaks of the Green Mountains continually rising before us. A perfect day, and we glided along with songs of praise and happy thoughts. It was a change to relax quietly, conscious of no immediate work before us. We dwelt upon what the earth will be when it shall become as the Garden of Eden.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Never had my eyes beheld such continually changing scenes of quiet and restful beauty; and the sunshine of God’s love streamed over it all Perhaps other eyes might see only earth clothed in glorious array; but the little company, distinguished by its “Millions-Now-Living-Will-Never-Die” pennant beheld, by faith, the heart of the Eternal Artist and the love which prompted this inspired expression of His creative power for man’s enjoyment: “I will make the place of my feet glorious,” and “Thou openest thy hand, and satisfies! the desire of every living thing.” Our hearts responded with a reverent Amen, and into the fading light of day broke forth, the hymn of praise: . .............</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Transported with the view, I’m lost -. In wonder, love and praise.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">At six o’clock the beautiful valley of Landgrove appeared. What a place to visit I The tent pitched, we were welcomed to a delicious eupper of baked beans. Around the table sat five bashful boys and a baby. Such happy, wholesome faces as those youngsters had! I fell in love with all six; so I am safe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Guess what I After supper one of the children said that a dance was going on “up the road” in the school house. I immediately visualized scenes in books when country folk assemble. It wouldn’t be a husking bee, but surely just as amusing. I grabbed Edi-Mae and'pulled her down the road before she knew where she was going. Our laughter finally attracted the others at the house, and several followed. A shrieking violin headed us in the right direction. We hurried, every nerve tingling with excitement. A country dance 1 We had no money with us; hence no admittance. But the bank was somehow climbed, after much stumbling over logs and underbrush. The rhythmic stamping of feet and dapping of hands spurred us on. One more desperate lunge, and we were peering over the sill into a dingy room where an old-fashioned square dance was in full swing. Oh, this was better than my expectations! I squealed with delight, disdosing my hiding place to the enthralled spectators along the side line, keeping time with head, hands and feet. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Around and around swung the roomfull. An extra bang, an additional shout; partners separated; the march'began. “Hi — All hands around,” and partner whirled back to partner! I had thought such wholesome sport had long since died, and here before my eyes were the dances .of 1775. To be sure, the powdered wig, the velvet breeches, and hoopskirts were missing; but what were these things in comparison to the besmirched overalls, gorgeous shirts (ties to match) and ginghams of many colors! No director could stage this. I had laughed at first, but heedlessly. The awkwardness and ungain-liness were only in my mind’s, eye. The modern Ichabod had rhythm in his soul and unhesitatingly chose his blushing lass, swinging her in perfect unison to the never-changing tune. Happy hearts! Life was sweet; love was young, and who couldn’t dance! Mate met the shy glance of mate. Intervening years perhaps had buried life’s morning romance. Did the little dance in the school house on the hill awaken love’s pristine glow! I guessed yes. Warmth stole into my heart. It was late when we returned; but around the piano we gathered, singing grand old hymns until midnight.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">August 5, 6, 7. Three days of recreation, swimming, walking, haying and riding, with intervals of eating most heartily enjoyed. The boys were most interesting companions. Master Five-years-old and Master Seven-years-old took me for a most interesting walk while they chattered incessantly. Born naturalists- they are, and I returned much wiser in woodland lore.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">We left die beautiful valley home at noon. Edi-Mae was silent for some time. When children come into the heart, they come to stay; and partings hurt &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;J</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">August 8. Awakened with a kiss. This is one of the outstanding features of my vacation. Then the morning service, eases packed, and over the hills to Munsonville. Refreshed by our trip, we looked forward to another day's service. Men’s hearts failing them for fear; the cloud* of trouble looming darker and darker; and we were privileged to tell the people to lift up their heads and rejoice as deliverance is nigh, that God’s kingdom is the desire of all nations, th* panacea for earth’s present troubles. Many books were placed with interested people, while others only bore with us. Shortly every word will be recalled as oil upon troubled waters. We told all that when the dark night comes upon them to remember that the morning of peace and happiness lies just beyond; that it ia darkest just before the daydawn. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">A clergyman’s wife bought the “Harp of God** and told me that she had sought for truth all her life. An hour later, I passed by her house and was called back. The woman had considered the words spoken. She wished to hear more, especially concerning the return of her boy from the “land of the enemy.” We sat by the side of the road, while Honey-C opened up some of the treasures of God’s Word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“If only it were true!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">We spoke of Jesus’ work while here on earth, the healing of the sick, the opening of the blinded eyes, and the resurrection of the dead. Hop* dawned on a saddened face—a preacher’s wife</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;Jesus called Lazarus from neither heaven nor a place of torment. ^Lazarus sleepeth.’ 'Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice.’ This clergyman’s wife would have talked until sunset; but we told her to read the last chapter in “The Harp of God” and passed on to comfort other hearts that mourn, giving them “beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Edi-Mae has wonderful success in selling. She has interesting experiences with children, who plead with their parents to buy. One child gasped three times, “0 Mamma!” and the book was his.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">August 9. Our last day advertising the King and </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">His</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> kingdom. After selling our last book— and the man asked whether he should take it before or after meals—we climbed a mountain, not Pisgah’s Mountain, however, although I should have named it such; for surely it was Canaan’s land we gazed upon from the summit So far as eye could reach lay the broad expanse of mountainous horizons; hills rising upon hills, peaks above peaks, on and on until the blue haze of the distant Green Mountains merged into the blue depths of sky line. And did the city's din, noise and selfish rush lie beyond, just beyond these hills of green, these peaks of blue? Were there urchins there who never saw the summer’s breeze upon a field of green; who never stretched tired little limbs beneath a spreading tree which gently rustled a glad song of life ? Were there? A solitary wind wafted on the answer, Yes, thousands and thousands, thousands and thousands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Below me the sunshine was playing hide-and-seek in the waters blown about by the gleeful breezes; the breezes sped on and encircled me in their wistful play. Could I respond to their facetious mood, cognizant of that endless rank of little deformed and stunted bodies and minds; that pitiful display of upturned faces, some weary, some worn, some wistful—a few with the gleam of hope—‘thousands and thousands? But I did respond to the surrounding beauties as the sun streamed his warm and healing rays upon me.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">I greeted the mountain-born breezes with tingling blood and glowing pulse as I gazed up* on the awful, majestic grandeur of the &quot;forests primeval” From my heart’s depths welled forth waters of superlative joys and gratitude. The crowded rank of sin-cursed boys was just the framework, Eternity’s Building in process. The finished structure would magnify the Creator's wisdom. Quickly I traversed time into the Millennial Pay, and there saw the boys, now men with perfect minds, bodies and morals, praising God for the permission of evil and for all they had suffered under the Satanic reign. Praising God for the permission of evil! Magnifying Jehovah's wisdom, justice, love and power! Thank God, I could see, by faith, the finished work!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">I recalled a previous conversation, “If I knew not God's plan of the ages, I could find no enjoyment in these beauties surrounding us here and would be embittered. I could never bow my knee or heart to Jehovah.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The sun was sinking in the west, down, down beyond the farthest peak. The lights and shadows vanished; the mountains loomed dark and formidable; gradually darkness stole on. Earth’s sud had set I Then as silently and as noiselessly could I see rising before me the Sun of Bighteousness with healing. And this Sun would never sink?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">August 10, IL Days of reminiscences and packing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">August 12. The parting! Perhaps you think, little diary, I am going to write about this; but I’m not; I can't Not only were we leaving the girls, but we were leaving the kingdom work to return to secular duties.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">I waved good-bye; Edi-Mae stepped on the gas; we lurched forward. I knew that Edi-Mae was crying, but I dared not look. Our Henry had never seen a crying party before and drove madly into a curve; no more glimpses of the girls. Our vacation was but a memory! Seeds of hope had been sown. God will water and give the increase.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Edi-Mae soon smiled through her tears, joyfully exclaiming, “We’ve sold three hundred and twenty books; blessed privilege, three hundred and twenty books!” Henry’s spirit was revived when smiles appeared; and he boisterously sang over every valley, hill and mountain, “Three hundred and twenty books; three hundred and twenty books!”</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark38"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark39"></a>The True Philosophy of the Failure of the Churches </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">By Geo. R. Swain (London).</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">(Author of “Angola, Andani and Modern&quot;}</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">I</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">N THE great historic movements that have stirred men and nations it is difficult to obtain a true philosophy of the circumstances which led up to and culminated in mighty epochmaking events. Philosophy is the application of pure thought to the explanation of things.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">To apply pure thought to the explanation of these events is well-nigh impossible; for a personal bias in the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">min</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">d of the recorder invariably colors the presentation, and thus a onesided view is obtained. For example, many writers and thinkers have endeavored to explain the circumstances that gave rise to the Puritan movement in England, which came to fruition in the time of Oliver Cromwell</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Each record reveals the bias of the writer, toward either the Royalist or the Republican side, toward either the Established Church or Nonconformity. Thus that pure, well-balanced, unprejudiced thought which will neither distort nor suppress any fact connected with the circumstances is peculiarly lacking in all manmade records.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The application of pure thought to the explanation of things must eventually lead to the Creator as the great First Cause. St. Paul in his letter to the Corinthians plainly states that the world by its philosophy did not learn to know God, the Fountain and Source of all wisdom and knowledge; but he added that he had a philosophy which was not recognized by the leaders of thought in his day.—1 Cor. 1:21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">It was a divine philosophy, one which concerned or explained the hidden purpose or plan of God. In other words, the application of pure thought to -every problem and every movement amongst the people must lead back to the Creator of heaven and earth, &quot;in whom we live and move and have our being.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The Bible is the revelation of the mind of God. In it we have God’s thoughts respecting great movements which have made history; therefore its philosophy is pure. A notable example of this is in the book of Revelation. There we find the divine philosophy regarding the absolute and utter failure of the church systems of today.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">That they are a failure there can be no question; for no less an authority than the Archbishop of York said a few months ago that the people were desiring a spiritual religion. To these he said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;The church is- not </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">a witness </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">to the truth of </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">its </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Gospel; but in its divisions, its dullness, its unreality, it is an obstacle, a stone of ■tarmhling, an offence.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Dr. Charles Brown, one of the prominent free-church leaders stated that he thought &quot;the Laodicean spirit loathed in the New Testament was precisely the spirit approved in the churches today—a cultivated, colorless kind of religion, in mild doses, mixed judiciously with a considerable amount of worldliness.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The &quot;Seven Seale’’ ofRevelatiM &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">IN THE vision of the Seven seals, God reveal*</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">His mind in some clear-cut pictures. These show from the divine viewpoint the progressive development of the church whose doings fill the pages of history. In this remarkable vision God explains the cause of the downward and increasingly degrading course of the so-called church and its ultimate failure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The opening of the first seal deals with the period of history from the time of the apostle John to the year 325 AD. At the outset the church had the pure doctrines of the Scriptures as its rule of faith and practice. These are symbolized by a white horse. ' &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">These doctrines, however, got into the control of a class spoken of as the rider of the horse, who is represented as having a bow, a symbol of an instrument for the dissemination of error. This class sought to gain domination over their fellow members in the church and eventually obtained it Thus in a few words the true philosophy of church history for more than 200 years is disclosed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The first step toward the failure of the nominal church so apparent today was its wrong action in dividing its membership into two classes; namely, clergy and laity. The former soon began to lord it over God’s heritage, and to send forth teachings of its own, contrary to the pure teachings of Jesus and the apostles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">They sought the favor of. the rich and influential, and became allied to the ruling power* in the domination of the people. They were rewarded for their support of the pagan ruling class by being incorporated with it, as a powerful church-state system, under the Emperor .Constantine.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">m</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The opening of the second seal- gives God's explanation of the course of the church from 325 to 539. A red horse is seen, also with a rider who is described as a strife-maker and in possession of a great sword. Here the same class is shown as controlling, ■ not the pure teachings of the Word, but sinful (red) teachings, error, introduced by themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The sword that they wielded was not the sword of the spirit, the Word of God, but its counterfeit, the creedal sword. The creeds of Christendom were formulated during this time and, as is well known, were the cause of bitter strife and controversy. Error is. the root-cause of strife.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">“All truth is calm, Refuge and rock and tower;</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The more of truth the more of calm;</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Its calmness is its power.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">“Truth is not strife, Nor is to strife allied; It is the error that is bred Of storm, by rage and prida</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">“Calmness is truth,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">And truth is calmness still Truth lifts its forehead to the storm, Like some eternal hill”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Charles Kingsley gives a graphic picture of the church of this period in his book entitled “Hypatia”. He shows the bitterness of the controversies between the various factions of the church and the efforts of each to secure the aid of the civil power to support its ambitions. History relates that the outcome of the strife culminated in the ascendancy of the Papal system. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“Black Hon*” ofDarknta</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">HE vision of the third seal reveals a black horse and a rider holding a pair of balances in his hand. The further downward course of the dominant ecclesiastical system is here portrayed from 539 to 1160. Not only were its teachings black, that i^, absolutely contrary to the Scriptures, but the people were spiritually starved by the clergy, indicated by the rider of the black horse weighing out food in very sparing quantities. The Bible was not allowed to be translated into the common tongue, and the church services were in Latin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The dark age of history with all its ignorance, cruelty and superstition, was the direct result of the dark teachings of the exalted dergy class.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The fourth seal discloses events, seen from the divine viewpoint, happening in the so-called Christian church from 1160 to Martin Luther's time—1517. The vision shows a pale or ghastly horse, with a terrible rider doing a devilish work. Cruel persecutions, tortures and murders were the result of this rider's power. His evil purposes were carried out by the civil powers (beasts of the earth), and his sphere of operations were mainly in Europe (the fourth part of the earth).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The outstanding teaching and practice of the church of this time was that all footstep followers of Jesus were to be exterminated. So horribly cruel were the tortures inflicted by the dergy upon those who desired to serve God according to the teachings of His Word, and not according to the teachings of the creeds, that the blackest record of man's inhumanity to man finds its expression during this period.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">As late as the year 1799, when Napoleon's soldiers broke open the dungeons of the Inquisition in Spain and beheld the awful human wrecks caused by the fiendish cruelty of the clergy, the officers were unable to restrain their men from running amuck and killing every priest they could find.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Thus the downward and increasingly degrading course of the Church is explained from the divine viewpoint, and is therefore the true philosophy of its failure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">While the course of the Papacy is outlined in the foregoing, yet it is shown that the Protestant systems developed the same characteristics as the mother system in their lust for worldly power and honor. (Revelation 17:5) They, too, have sought by bitter persecutions to destroy those who proclaimed the good news that “the kingdom of heaven is at hand”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">God, who is causing the light of truth to shine so brightly today, is weighing these false systems in the balances of divine justice; and they are found wanting.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark40"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark41"></a>Heard in the Office—No. 14 </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">By C. E. Quiver (London)</span></h4>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">I</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">T WAS about a week after the discussion last recorded that Tyler opened conversation again. His whole manner seemed changed, and his face had a brighter look. Mr. Palmer and he were again at the office late; and as soon as they were left in quiet, Mr. Tyler went over to the other and, placing his hand on his shoulder, said: &quot;I have good news for you, Palmer.” Then in a tone of voice that betrayed excitement and pleasure he continued: “I want to tell you that I have taken my stand for truth and righteousness, and have given myself to God to do His will.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Mr. Palmer shook his friend warmly by the hand; and tears of joy started to his eyes as he said: “I am glad. I am thankful that at last you have been enabled to take this step, and am sure you will never regret it” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“I do not think I shall ever regret it,” Tyler replied. “It is good to know that the old life is ended, the emptiness and uncertainty gone, and in their place have come peace and satisfaction. I feel very happy, and everything seems changed like sunshine after shadow. There is much that I have to learn, but I mean to study. And I expect there will be difficulties, but I mean to overcome them if possible.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“Yes; there will be difficulties. The great adversary, Satan, soon makes a mark of those who stand for Christ. The Christian’s way is not ah easy one. Our Master said: ‘Strait is the gate, and narrow the way, which leadeth unto life; and few there be that find it.*- You have found the gate of faith and consecration and by God’s grace have entered, so that your feet are now on the way to life. But the path is narrow and fraught with danger and difficulty. There is no need for fear, however; for the great Jehovah has promised that His grace is sufficient and His strength is made perfect in weakness. If God be for us, who is he that can be against us?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“Faith wiH be needed to lay hold upon this grace, to grasp the exceeding great and precious promises of God’s Word. Works must also accompany faith. Works cannot commend us to God; salvation is by faith; but faith having been exercised, It must be borne out by appropriate works. We do not work towards life, but we are expected to work from life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;At times the adversary will try to discourage you by suggesting that it is no use trying, that you will never win through. Dismiss him with a pebble from the brook of truth, a ‘thus saith the Lord*; for God having begun a good work in you will bring it to completion if you but remain faithful. At other times Satan will try to swing you like a pendulum to the opposite extreme and, pointing to things you have done, will seek to stir up pride in your heart And nothing is more obnoxious to-God than spiritual pride. For what have we that we have not received, or done that was not made possible by the Creator’s good gifts? .'</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“Humility, confidence and love need to be cultivated, so that having pure hearts and instructed minds we may be able to stand in the testing time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“Although the Christian’s path is not an easy ~ one by reason of the opposition of the adversary, the Sprit of the world, and the imnlmnes of the flesh, yet there is a compensating joy and rest of heart in the consciousness of harmony with God. To know that we are right, that the.-heavenly Father’s smile of approval is upon us, is something which cannot. be described in words, but must be experienced to be understood. To have a heart in tune with the divine is to have a soul filled with sweetest music.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“Once I thought the Christian’s life miserable, but now I know that mine was miserable in comparison. It says somewhere in the Bible, does it not, ‘Once I was blind, but now I can see’?**</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“Yes; this was said by the blind man to idiom Jesus gave sight,” replied Palmer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“I feel that this is my experience, and that I have awakened to a new world,” said Tyler. ■</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">To this Palmer replied: “Those who give themselves fully to the Lord are translated from darkness to light, from the kingdom of Satan to the kingdom of God’s dear Son. Life, liberty and happiness are their heritage in the present and, if faithful, forever.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">First of all, they help to demonstrate how sound and reasonable is the basis for the Christian’s faith. There is no need for Christians to fear that their faith rests in a false security on the quicksands of error; but they can have assurance that it is firmly grounded on the bed-</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;’The hiding of this mystery was illustrated by Jehovah in the construction of the tabernacle in the wilderness and its furnishings. The inside walls of the tabernacle were covered with pure gold. Inside the Holy were the golden candlestick, the table covered with gold for the showbread, and the golden altar; and in the Most Holy was the ark of the covenant. The tabernacle inside, therefore, was beautiful; but it was hidden from the people on the outside because it was covered with three heavy layers of cloth and skins. The priest ministered inside the tabernacle, and therefore was unseen by the people. As God thus hid these things which were typical of greater things, so he has hidden the glories and beauties of spiritual things, seen only by those who have come into relationship</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">• with Him through Christ</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">•“The Gospel Age is the antitypical day of atonement. With the Jews there was one day-each year called the day of atonement In that day the priest alone was in the Holy and the Most Holy; and even so on the antitypical day of atonement, no one is in the Holy condition except those who are in relationship with Christ, the great high priest. The Lord has* been pleased to permit these during the Gospel Age to have some understanding of His Word, therefore receiving the sweet and refreshing music from His harp; and the light has grown in brilliancy and the music in harmony as the understanding has increased. To the world in general, Christians have been despised because not understood. The Lord was misunderstood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">’“Satan has tried to counterfeit every part of Jehovah's plan; so he organized a religious system in the earth which is iniquitous and is known as “the mystery of iniquity.” (2 Thessalonians 2:7; Revelation 17:5) This mystery of iniquity God will destroy in His great day of vengeance, which is now on; and then the mystery of God will be more clearly revealed to mankind. It is revealed to individuals now as they come into Christ. It is important, therefore, for us to know how one becomes a member of the Christ, the great mystery of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“‘The mystery of God involves an understanding and appreciation of the fundamental truths-of repentance, consecration, justification/ spirit-begetting, and- sanctification. Let us now trace the steps of one in the world as he comes to Jehovah that he might become a member </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">at </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">the body of Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“’Because of the disobedience of father Adam, all of his children are born imperfect, all^ sinners. “There is none righteous, no, not one.” (Romans 3:10; 5:12) All such are out of harmony with God. They have no right to life. It has pleased Jehovah, then, during ths Gospel age to draw to Jesus, the great Redeemer and Deliverer, those who have the desire . to come into harmony with Him., The Prophet •? says: The reverence of the Lord i* the bogus* ning of wisdom.’ (Psalm 111:10) The fi^t. , thing essential for one becoming a ChristianJa -, an honest desire to know the Lord and to ; His will A man with this honest desire, thea, realizes that'he is a sinner and’born soeh; and he has an honest desire to come to God. Ba learns that Jesus is his Redeemer, and he wants to know more about Him and to do His will- Io * his mind he does not approve the ways of tha world. He begins to think about the Lord and wants to know more about Him. He begins to turn his face in the right direction. When he ceases to approve the course of the world, he ia repentant to that extent Repentance means &amp;&nbsp;change of mind respecting one’s relationship to evil &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘</span></p>

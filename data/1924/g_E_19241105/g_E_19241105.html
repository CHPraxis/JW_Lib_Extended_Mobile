<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">[Radiocast from WATCHTOWER WBBR on a wav* length of 273 meters, by the Editor]</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Labor and Economics</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">T</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">HE</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> gradual process of the elimination of employes by reaching the “age limit” is attracting attention. Thirty years ago nothing was thought of the age if the work could be done. But with the coming demand for speed in industrial and business activities, the young and vigorous were sought. The age limit soon became “too old at 60”; later “too old at 50”; in a few instances it is now “too old at 40.” And where the children can do the work, those of 18 are being replaced by those of 14 and 15. The “efficiency experts” of our day are making our institutions a sausage mill for grinding the vitals and nerves of humanity, looking only at the profits of the present with no consideration of the future. Humanity is burning out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The United States makes a bad showing in the number of men killed in mines. The situation is such that in a bituminous mine employing 476 men, where the average daily output of the men is ten tons each, one man is sure to be killed every nine months. In recent years defective electrical apparatus has caused the loss of 500 lives in American mines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">For the first eleven months of 1922 the net profits of the Reliance Manufacturing Co. were only $600 less than $1,000,000. . In seventeen prisons this company gets factories, power, heat and light, and pays five cents apiece for making shirts for workingmen. No wonder their profits are large, and their competitors have a hard time!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Walter P. Hedden, research agent for the Port of New York Authority, is responsible for the statement that out of each dollar that a New York family spends for fruit or vegetables it now costs forty-eight cents to handle, transport, and distribute it after it has reached New York</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Social and Educational</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">WENTY-FIVE healthy children have bee* adopted by Mr. and Mrs. E. E. Beals of Edgewood (a suburb of Pittsburgh), according to the Pittsburgh </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Chronicle-Telegraph.</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> A five-column cut of the group is shown, presenting a picture of health, happiness and contentment. Mr. and Mrs. Beals are of the type which make good fathers and mothers. Mr. Beals is a railroad engineer; so most of the care falls to Mrs. Beals and a maid. Seventeen attend school; none is over sixteen years of age.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Scientists have discovered that the constant talking of a mother to her baby is an exceedingly important factor in the development of the child. The child sees, but does not understand ; and in time learns to read speech from the lips and to speak as well.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">France is reported as having a standing army of 700,000 men. Uncle Sam's armed soldiers are much fewer, but Uncle Sam does have a standing army of 700,000 school teachers—God bless them, one and all! These teachers, instead of being trained to shoot their fellow men, are teaching the young idea how to shoot. Three cheers for Uncle Sam’s army of teachers!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Acting upon the assumption that there is a natural law which automatically fits some for the highest and best-paid work and others for the hardest and least remunerative employment, some American educators, forgetting the histories of Lincoln, Garfield and Edison, are now deliberately proposing to separate the school children into groups, some of which would have held before them during school days only the prospect of a subsequent life of rough, hard and ill-paid labor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Out in California Captain Edgar Thompson says: ‘'Beneath the radiance of our flag there is no place for a pacifist.... His manhood is stared and branded by the hot trident of the master of hell.” On the same day, in New York, the Editor of the </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Graphic</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> wrote: &quot;Many wellmeaning folks like to use the word ‘pacifist* as an ugly name. See </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> without prejudice; and you will find that he is merely one who has driven the fire-eating, world-smashing devil out of his soul ahead of the rest of us. We shall all </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">get</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> there in due time.” The report of Captain Thompson’s address says that he faced &quot;his audience with burning eyes&quot;. What is wrong, Captain </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">1</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> Stick out your tongue, and let us feel your pulse, and take your temperature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Manufacturing and Financial Items</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">TpOR many years the practice of the Steel -I- Trust has been such that if a customer, say in Illinois, purchased from one of the trust's plants located in his own community he was compelled to pay the same price as would be charged for the goods in Pittsburgh, and in addition was compelled to pay the freight from Pittsburgh* This practice has built up Pittsburgh at the expense of all other steel-producing centers, and has added millions of dollars to the prices charged the consumers. The Federal Trade Commission has ordered the practice discontinued.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The seventeen concerns which manufacture mill work in St. Louis have formed a bureau which prepares official lists of the material needed for every important job in the city. This takes away from the contractors all opportunity to exercise skill in figuring closely on the material required, and assures their having more material than they need, whether they like it or whether they do not The Government is proceeding to undertake the dissolution of this trust</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The National Negro Business League is urging the founding of Negro banks, and the depositing in such institutions of the $100,000,000 now in the banks of the whites and the $20,000000 which is hidden at home. With these funds available for the use of their own race the progress of American Negroes would be much more rapid, and the whole country thereby benefited. ’ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">R. R. Batson* a financial writer in the New 'York </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">World,</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> speaking of certain prominent Wall Street bankers, says: “Much of the credit for securing an acceptance for the Dawes Plan is c</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">laim</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">ed by these bankers. They assert that it was a business arrangement, and that the presence of the various premiers was necessary only to give it their sanction.” This ought to make it clear who is running the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Transportation</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">W</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">ITH five motor bus companies contending for franchises in New York, it is evident that the street-car is doomed. Motor buses can take people on at the sidewalks, can go around obstacles, can operate on a new route at a moment’s notice, can turn out through fire, can maintain an express service without interfere ing in any way with the regular traffic; and if they break down they do not prevent other can of the line from operating as usual</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The officials of the American City Government League, in an answer to advertisement* o£ the Brooklyn Manhattan Transit Company urging higher car-fares, present evidence from Duluth, Olean, Kansas City, Syracuse, Romet White Plains, Albany, Jersey City and Philadelphia, showing that increased fares in thoe* cities decreased the net income of the operating companies. In Philadelphia during the year after the carfare was increased from 5 cents to 7 cents there were 75,000,000 less passengers carried.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">On its recent 1,300 mile cruise over the Atlantic Ocean the Navy's giant dirigible, Shenandoah, consumed 9,500 pounds of gasoline, and released 4,000 pounds of water ballast; yet it came back to the hangar at Lakehurst heavier than when it went away. This was due to an apparatus which converts the engine exhaus' into water, this water, in turn, being pumped into the ballast tanks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">U.S. Mail Service</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">A</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">LAR</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">MED by repeated robberies of mail - trains, especially the one near Chicago in June when the thieves led by a prominent official of the mail service, named Takey, obtained $2,000,000, the Government has now ordered 3,000 armored cars of such a design that it is believed future hold-ups will be impossible. The clerks inside the cars will be able to light up the neighborhood brilliantly and to shoot effectively at a distance and at short range. It is expected also that the clerks will be provided with gas masks, inasmuch as gas bombs were used in Inspector Taker’s raid.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The postal service of the United States as a whole is a marvel of faithfulness. In the last thirty months, fifty-five men have lost their lives in their efforts to live up to the high traditions of the Port Office department The two longest routes, located respectively in Minnesota and New Mexico, are each 143 miles in length.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">On one of these routes in Oregon the carrier is compelled to travel down the beach at low tide. If, for some reason, the incoming tide catches him before completing his trip, he must either abandon his team and the mails and climb the rocks or be dashed in pieces against them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Two of the most dangerous routes are to islands in Lake Erie and Lake Michigan, which can be reached in the winter only with greatest difficulty. At certain seasons a trip to these islands must be made partly on the ice and partly across open water, which all sounds very well until you have tried it once. One of the carriers reports that on one of these routes it has sometimes taken him eight hours to traverse a distance of four miles which at other times is made on the ice in twenty minutes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">In one instance in Lake Michigan a carrier with his team and equipment was blown out to sea on a cake of ice barely large enough to hold him. He was rescued by the United States life-saving guard, which towed his cake of ice to shore, where the mail was delivered as though nothing unusual had happened.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Ups and Downs of Government</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">I</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">T 'WILL be a surprise to many to learn that so many as 12,000 prosecutions have been made for violations of the Pure Food and Drug Act. The list<sup>1</sup> of adulterated foods contains practically everything used for that purpose, and is a sickening commentary on the low state of our civilization. One would think that regard for his own health and the health of his family would prevent anybody from adulterating food.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Admiral W. L. Rodgers, speaking at the American Institute of Politics, Williamstown, Mass., declared that when the population of the United States reaches 200,000,000 he expects that as a matter of course this country will go to war to keep its place in the world. It is plain that the Admiral has no use for the Bible, and does not believe at all that the time will ever come when the nations shall learn war no more. Thank God, he is wrong!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">By the consent of Major General M. M. Patrick, head of the army air service, Father John J. Sullivan, of St. Augustine’s Church, Boston, has been given the use of a government airplane for a flight from New York to San Francisco. Similar favors in the use of the city's automobiles are extended to the same class by some of the officials, of a certain city we could name.

They went in modern motor cars over concrete or asphalt highways, through busy cities, past immense workshops, across great railway lines, and through orchards and fields of a kind their fathers never knew. From some points of view this trip was a funeral procession of incalculable pathos, and yet the changes of the last century had to be.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Education and publicity have contributed materially in bringing about better living conditions in New York, with the result that during the past twenty-two years the tuberculosis death rate has fallen from 280 to 99 per hundred thousand of the population. It pays to point out things that are not right It helps to right them, to make the world better.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Near the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Golden Age</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> office in Brooklyn a German band was surrounded by a crowd of children sucking lemons, with the rather surprising result that the band was forced to stop playing. The leader complained to the police that the sight of lemons at the mouths of the children puckered the mouths of his musicians so that they could not play their instruments. He wanted to know what could be done about it. The advice received was that there was no</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">thing </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">to prevent the band from going somewhere else.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Mr. M. E. ThrailkiU, of Columbus, Ohio, offers three farms of forty to one hundred and fifty acres each, free of use to any farmer who will pay the taxes, keep the fences and buildings in repair, and maintain the fertility of the soiL In addition, he must pay the fire insurance on the buildings. These farms are within twelve miles of the city of Columbus, in the best part of one of the most fertile states in the Union.</span></p>

<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">HE daughter of Rev. Colin O’Farrell, pastor of the First Baptist Church of Butte, Montana, came home saying that her teacher had taught her that she was descended from a monkey. Rightly enough, Mr. O.’Farrell was indignant, and on a succeeding Sunday had his daughter sit in the pulpit chair, holding in her hand a stick to which a monkey was tied, while he urged the people to return to belief in the Creator. With some heat Mr. O’Farrell suggested that if evolution be true, then man must have descended from the ass rather than the monkey, which was merely another way of saying that in his judgment( and in ours) none are such complete asses as the evolutionists.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">They insist that everybody take their preposterous ideas for granted, even though they know that evolution has not been proven and never can be. Their methods are not to prove, but to sneer at those who disbelieve them. In due time the Lord will turn all this supposed knowledge backward and illustrate that its wise men are indeed foolish, as the Prophet declares. —Isaiah 44:2 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Dr. W.

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“During the war I told of official German marriages, and waxed indignant and furiously outraged.

<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">A</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">CCORDING to the Bankers Trust Company, Europe is all ready for the next war. The countries which have from 15,000 to 40,000 men under arms, ranging in order from the smallest, to the greatest armies are Lithuania, Norway, Esthonia, Latvia, Bulgaria, Austria, Denmark, Finland, Sweden, Hungary and Portugal The countries having from 86,000 to 163,000 in the order named are: Belgium, Turkey, Germany, Greece, Rumania, Jugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, Great Britain, and Holland.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The greatest armies of Europe are in the remaining countries: Russia with 1,000,000; and France three-fourths of a million; Switxer-land half a million; and Italy, Poland and Spain each a quarter o£ a million. Probably the German army could be made a million strong on short notice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Premier MacDonald has summoned a special meeting of the Committee on Imperial Defense to reconsider the question of building a tunnel to France, recently abandoned. All former Premiers will attend the meeting. The tunnel will cost about $130,000,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">One of the players in the International Polo Games was Major F. B. Hurndall, of the British Army, who was supposedly drowned October 10,1918. The ship upon which he was crossing the Irish Channel was torpedoed. A half hour later his body was discovered floating upon the surface of the water, with several other supposed corpses. He was carried to Dublin, where a surgeon pronounced him dead. But a nurse in the Dublin hospital, noticing some warmth about his heart, rubbed him with alcohol for three hours, with the result that at the end ol that time he opened his eyes.</span></p>

As a master of course, when he. denies the fall of mah he denies the need of a redeemer. But why take the trouble and expense to cable such news when </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">practically all</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> the clergy similarly repudiate the Word of God, of which they are paid to be the sworn defendants!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The Holy Trinity Church, Goodramsgate, York, England, has in front of it two noticeboards, on each of which appears the following doggerel:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“If aught thou hast to give or lend, This ancient parish church befriend;</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">If poor but yet in spirit willing, • Out with thy purse and give a shilling;</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">But if its depths should be profound,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">• Bethink thee well and give a pound. Ask not for any record given, But look for thy receipt in heaven.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">To the foregoing we subjoin a text which we hope the Rector will use the first time it is brought to his attention, i.e., “If I were hungry I would not tell thee: for the world is mine and the fulness thereof.”—Psalm 50:12.</span></p>

Persons who owned radio sets got the news through the air several hours before the printed records of the same was available. What reforms will be possible when there is a radio station in every home and when absolutely truthful news alone is permitted to be radiocast!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">According to a story we get from </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Mexico, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Our Lady of Gaudaloupe is reappearing after an absence of 400 years. The last time she appeared, she is supposed to have miraculously painted her image on an Indian blanket This blanket has for generations been an object of reverence in one of the Mexican cathedrals, but of late the paint has been peeling off badly. Our Lady probably knows this, and is getting back on the job with some of the modern cosmetics which are warranted neither to peel nor to crack off.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">For many years the San Blas Indians, whose home is on the coast of the </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Caribbean Sea, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">have not permitted a white man to enter their country; but because the whites know how to care for the sick, a group of San Blas girls are taking a complete course in nursing in a Panama hospital, so that they can return to their own land and care for their own people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The discovery of White Indians in Panama has led some scientists to suggest that perhaps the natural color of man is swarthy, and that all the white people of the earth are white because they are suffering from some mild, hereditary disease. This identical thought appeared in the writings of Pastor C. T. Russell in 1902. Pastor Russell was just about twenty years ahead of his time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">France and Germany</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">S</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">INCE the war there has been a tremendous immigration of Africans into France, a very . natural result of the using of so many soldiers from Africa and Madagascar. Hitherto, ths French Government has taken the most friendly view of this immigration; but the newcomer* work for such low wages and such long hours, and under such impossible housing and sanitary conditions that the French labor is feeling ths pinch, and is complaining to the Government that it can not compete. This places the Government in a quandary; for if immigration is restricted, it will make the recruiting of blade troops in the future much more difficult that it has been in the past.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Between Lyons, France, and Lausanne, Switzerland, a distance of about 100 miles, there is an aerial bus service. The aeroplanes make stops here and there to pick up passengers. Quite likely this is the next thing ahead in transportation. There will be stations where aerial passengers can send up rockets in the path of a flier to indicate that they wish to get aboard.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">In the effort to balance the budget, Germany has within the last few months discharged 400,000 State employes. Just at present this is having a depressing effect, as many of those discharged have not been able to find work elsewhere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Reports have it that 1,000,000 Germans are unemployed, half of whom are receiving a dole from the Government Reports from Britain show that over ten percent of British workers are unemployed, while the cost of living is seventy-two percent higher than it was at the outbreak of the World War.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Since 1876, Germany has had several Counts by the name of Von Schack. It seems that the Von Schacks were wealthy, and had a valuable collection of pictures They offered to present these pictures to the Kaiser if, as a reward, the title of Count would be given to two members of the Von Schack family. As a consequence, the Kaiser got the pictures; and the common people of the world got two more grand and glorious counts to whom they may look up, or upon whom they may look down, as they prefer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The king business in in bad shape. Despite this, however, the kings who have lost their jobs 'do not take kindly to the idea of engaging in honest productive work. If they cannot get a job in the regular king business, they like to get as near to it as they can. Accordingly, we read that George of Saxony, the ex-Crown Prince of the defunct or &quot;as-it-were” kingdom of, Saxony, has taken a job as priest in the Boman Catholic Church.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Following the example of Protestant churches of America which, while maintaining their separate identity, have united for political purposes in the Federal Council of Churches of Christ in America, the Protestant churches of Germany have perfected a similar federal organization.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">there has been a great falling off in the communicants of the two churches which have hitherto been dominant in that area. From 1911 to 1921 the Roman Catholics in Czechoslovakia decreased 1,290,915, and the Greek Catholics 60,097. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sub>x</sub></span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The Bratiano Brothers, who are said to control the oil industry of Rumania and also to control the Rumanian government, are supposed to be behind the new law of Rumania which gives ten years for the Standard Oil and the Royal Dutch to sell sixty percent of their holdings to Rumanian citizens; i. e., presumably to the Bratiano Brothers. Probably this hold-up will be satisfactory to the Rumanian people, if it works.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Financiers in Paris, who once owned the immensely rich oil fields of Baku, did not succeed in their recent effort to overturn the Soviet system which now'prevails through what was once the territory of the Republic of Georgia. The Soviet Government put down the rebellion quickly and easily, and compelled the groups of dissatisfied with their rule to flee into the mountains.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Despatches in the New York </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> state that since the days of the Czar eighteen successive governments have borne rule over the Ukraine, as Southwestern Russia is now called. The Jews are the principal sufferers. Most of the business of Russia has been at all times in the hands of the Jews; and with the advent of the Soviet into business, millions of Jews are without the means of livelihood. In the slaughters in the Ukraine, at least 70,000 Jews lost their lives.</span></p>

The professor has retired into the country, where he is busy translating works which will no doubt throw important light upon the history of the Roman Empire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">An American banker who had some reason for wanting to stand in with the Papacy has made the Pope a present of a chair of solid silver worth $60,000. This reminds us of the Christian religion, because it is so different. -The Son of God, when here upon earth, said: “The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have nests, but the Son of man'hath not where to lay his head.” If somebody had offered Christ a $60,000 silver chair, we are sure that He would have followed His own advice to the rich man, “Go and sell all that thou hast and give to the poor.” We have no objection whatever to the Pope's following Christ's example.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Since 1912, Spain has nominally held control of a strip along the northern coast of Morocco, 200 miles long and 60 miles wide. Never having gotten any further along the path of civiliza&lt;-tion than the attempt to rule by brute force, Spain has totally failed, with an army of 150,000 men, to hold her own against the 50,000 Moors she has been constantly fighting in this area. Nine hundred German mercenaries have been killed in the Spanish ranks, thirty of them for refusal to obey their Spanish officers. The Spaniards are sick unto death of their war in Morocco; but like the hunter who grabbed the bear by the tail, they dare not let go for fear of greater troubles to follow immediately.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The Moors are insisting that the Spanish leave their country, bag and baggage. They seem now in a fair way to have their wishes realized. Meantime, unemployment in Spain is growing at an appalling rate, the militarists having shown their utter incapacity to govern the country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The Roman city of Leptis Magna, which has been buried in the sand of Tripoli for 1500 years, is now being slowly brought to light by Italian excavators. This city once had a population of about 300,000 inhabitants. Very probably it contains manuscripts which, when discovered, will be of value to Bible students, historians, and others. The buildings are found practically intact</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The attack which led to the death of Major Imbrie, acting American Consul at the Persian capital, was directly due to the act of a Mohammedan priest who made the false accusation against Major Imbrie that “he had put poison into the well”, a sacred well where the priest was ministering. So savage was the attack upon Major Imbrie that he sustained 135 wounds. Perhaps even these would not have caused his death had not the mob broken into the hospital and renewed the attack.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The British Government has under construction an airship which is to have an cubic capacity of 5,000,000 feet, and will have a carrying capacity of 200 passengers. With this ship, which will be capable of making eighty miles an hour, the Government expects to make the journey from Britain to India in four days. The airdome at Cardington, near Bedford, will be located on a plot of level ground 1,000 acres in extent.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The Japanese officials whose business it is to deal with the Japanese gods have appealed to them to do something to prevent the Japanese women from bobbing their </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">hair</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">, but all to no purpose; for the bobbing still goes cheerfully on.</span></p>

Recently they kicked over the traces and invaded the principal hotels, demanding food and accomodations and ordering it to be charged to the government This started something, right away.

<h3><a name="bookmark33"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark34"></a>The Progress of Co-operation</span></h3>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">A</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">MERICANS are not interested in cooperation ; but they ought to be, and the time will come when they will be. “Every man for himself and the devil take the hindmost,” may sound like a good philosophy to the selfish and the strong; but it is not even for the selfish and the strong. There is a better way for men to get things worth having and worth keeping. That way is the un-American, but nevertheless very desirable, way of cooperation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">In America individual profit-seeking has been carried to such lengths that a Congressional investigation discloses that for each $1 paid to the producer of food it is necessary to pay out $2 to other persons before the consumer can have his needs supplied.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">In the Scriptures man is advised: “Go to the ant, thou sluggard; consider her ways and be wise.” (Proverbs 6:6) If we consider the ways of the ant sufficiently, we are amazed not only at her industry but at her spirit of cooperation. The ants are all working industriously, not for themselves individually, but for the common good; and in working for the common good they each have protection and comforts which no one of them could gain by working selfishly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">A thing that has hindered cooperation in the United States is the vicious attitude of the press, which is maintained largely for the purpose of effectively discouraging the people from doing anything for their own welfare. The more things people do collectively, the less chances there are for the grafters, who already own nearly the whole country, to get what is left</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">FARMER in North Dakota received $1.4C as his reward for ploughing, planting, spraying and digging a carload of potatoes and carrying them to the railroad station. The railroads got $180.60. The other parties, the American business men that “assisted” the farmer to get his just dues for his labor, got $154.00. They do not believe in cooperation. It is un-American. It is Socialistic, so the newspapers say; and if the newspapers are to be believed, Socialism is next, door to Red Anarchy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">In fact, there are newspapers that would not hesitate to say that for the farmer to try to take away the chance of the Board of Trade or the Produce Exchange, or whatever crowd of prosperous citizens it was that got the $154, to do the same thing over again to every farmer every year, and to take another slice just as big, or twice as big, out of the consumers, is nothing but wildest anarchy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">We may be all wrong, but we cannot help feeling that the principle of cooperation is </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">right; </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">for it eliminates waste and does for the many what some of them, at least, could not do for themselves individually if working alone. One bee would have quite a task fixing up a hive for himself; and it would not be a very satisfactory hive when finished. It is the same with man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Cooperation has usually failed in the United States, even when it has been well started, because the American people do not have the cooperative spirit They do not like to save money, and they do not like to see others save money. They like to be known as good sports, good spenders. This may be good Americanism, but it is not good sense.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">At the other extreme are some true Americans who are so convinced that the fate of civilization, like the fate of the ant-hill and of the beehive, hangs upon cooperation that they declare that chaos is just ahead unless better counsels prevail; and they are for making cooperation </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">compulsory.</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> This does not seem to us to be practical, either. The bosses of cooperative societies in which the people were compelled to be members would be bosses indeed. They would probably be grafters of the worst sort.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">A significant item respecting American cooperation movements is that on at least two occasions, and probably many others, the employes of such movements have had to go on strike in order to obtain adequate wages and fair treatment. On one occasion there was a strike of stenographers in the offices of the national headquarters of the American Federation of Labor at Washington, D. C., so we are informed. This shows how easy it is to be inconsistent, and brings out in strong relief a reason why cooperation is so successful in Europe and so unsuccessful here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Co-operative Wheat Marketing</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">S</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">PURRED on by necessity, the farmers of the United States have been virtually forced into doing something for themselves in the marketing of their wheat crop, with the result that</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">■wherever there are cooperative elevators established it has been demonstrated that the growers are saved three cents to five cents a bushel on their grain. In the aggregate this is a great sum.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">There are now several cooperative wheat marketing societies: The Nebraska Farmers' Union, the Northwest Wheat Growers, Incorporated, and the Equity Cooperative Exchange. The latter society started in 1912, at St. Paul, Minnesota, with a handful of members and a paid-up capital of $14,600. Now it fras 25,000 members and a paid-up capital of $2,000,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">It is estimated that in eight of the wheat states the cooperative wheat selling associations now handle one-eighth of the wheat crop. The farmers in these associations were virtually compelled to go into them because of the shark practices upon them of the “business men”, the gentlemen who previouslypurchasedtheir wheat “in the regular way”. The wheat selling organizations are run on a democratic basis of one vote for each member, regardless of the worth of the stock he holds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Co-operative Milk Selling</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">I</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">F THERE is one thing which it seems should lend itself to cooperation easier than another, it is the milk business. The supply of milk is constant, and the demand is constant. The milk is produced every day and used every day, in every street, and by every person on the street.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">And yet, in New York city, where there would seem to be ideal conditions for putting some kind of common sense cooperative plan into operation, the consumers have been facing a steadily rising price of milk, almost none of which has gone to the producers, but practically all of which has gone to the grafters in between.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Just now the Dairymen’s League of that city is conducting a fight to try to get six cents a quart for the producers who, until recently, never received more than 4.4 cents per quart, even when milk formerly retailed at six cents was retailing regularly at sixteen cents. The Dairymen’s '■ League sells for its members according to the butter-fat in the milk, and pays the producers at the end of the month, deducting a percentage to pity the costs. Since these farmers are paid according to the quality of their milk, they make every effort to keep the milk at the highest grade.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">What is claimed to be the largest single Bulk business in the world is the Franklin Cooperative Creamery of Minneapolis, Mimn, which was founded as a result of a lockout of the driven of those who had been theretofore monopolising the milk trade in that city.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The drivers went around'to their old customers, picked up what trade'they could, and started in business. This was in 1919. Now they are doing a business of many miliionB of dollars per year, and are branching out into ice-cream manufacture and the restaurant field.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">On one occasion, when the autumn season came around and the price was due to go up one cent per quart, and the Franklin Creamery had already announced the increase, the old companies tried to get their business back by announcing that they would not make the customary increase. Thereupon the Franklin withdrew the increase and another one cent besides, and in four days the war was over, and the people were all getting their inilk at the old price of eleven cents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The Franklin Creamery has its own theatre, where plays are given for the benefit of employes and stockholders; its own cafeteria, where seventy-five can get their meals at one time; and its lockers and shower baths for its driven and other male employes. It also maintains * school for cooperative executives.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">There are several other cooperative creameries in the country. There is one in Cleveland which does a $500,000 business per year. There is a large one in Vermont. There are several in Nebraska. The latter are estimated to produce a net gain to the farmers of two cents to four cents per pound of butter-fat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Co-operative Fruit Marketing</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">I</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">F MILK would seem to be specially easy of handling cooperatively, fruit would seem to be the opposite. The crop ripens all at once, and must be cared for without delay. The great problem of refrigeration comes up, and the equally great problem of wise distribution and adequate reception.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">And yet California has made a world-wide name for itself by its success in the cooperative marketing of fruit, the sales by this method-, for* California alone, having amounted in 1919 to $225,000,000. In 1923, the sales were still larger, in the neighborhood of $350,000,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The so-called &quot;California Plan&quot; aims to control seventy-five percent of the crop. The members agree to market all their fruit through the association for a period of five years. An initial payment is made when the crop is delivered. Other payments are made as the sales proceed. At the end of the season there is a final settlement. All producers are paid alike for the same grades. ■</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">There are limits to what can be done. The California cooperatives tried to carry the pricefixing a little too far in the raisin and prune market. They had no difficulty in fixing the prices; for California has a monoply on raisins and prunes. But they were surprised to find that the people of the country turned away, and used other foods or went without There are two sides to cooperation. The customer must be considered, too.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The system of cooperative marketing developed in California has spread to such an extent that 1,200,000 farmers altogether are now handling their crops by this method, with a volume of business estimated at somewhat in excess of $1,500,000,000 for the entire country. All this has been done in about four years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Many of the cooperative organizations have failed to make good. The Department of Agriculture has made a survey of 243 of the failures, and found that 200 of them did not have sufficient business to make them going concerns; 148 were badly managed; 73 did not have enough capital; 35 over-extended credit to consumers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The subject of cooperative marketing is now being taught in eight state universities and eleven agricultural colleges in a very complete manner, including accounting, purchasing and credit There are fifty-nine other colleges and universities that give a considerable amount of attention to the subject in their regular courses in farm management</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Co-operative Purehut of Education</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">A ME RIC ANS are as loath to save money by **• cooperation in buying as they are to save it in selling. ' But they are slowly making progress in some lines of guying, generally being driven to it by necessity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Greater New York has three cooperative educational institutions. At least one of these came into existence because the private school which ■</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">several hundred young men were attending, was managed in such a grossly inefficient way, and so evidently had no motive except that of profit, that 200 of the young men went on a strike.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Now these young men, constituting the Cooperative Educational Institute of Brooklyn, New York, choose their own teachers, decide on their curriculum, determine their tuition fee, elect their own administrators, manage their own business aiiau^, ai d choose their own holidays. The attendance s now 400.</span></p>

<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">A</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> BUILDING am’ Loan Association is noticing in the world but a cooperative plan &lt;&nbsp;purchasing homes^ Where these associations have been efficiently managed they have turned out to be excellent channels of saving, turning into permanent investment large sums that otherwise would have been wasted in rents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">New York city now .has many cooperative apartment houses. The owners of the apartments are obliged to live in them. They can not lease them to others. They can not sell them except to the board of directors of the house and at the price paid for them. In one of these apartment houses there is a cooperative kitchen in which the cooking is done for all tenants. By means of dumb waiters the food leaves the apartment raw, and comes back cooked at the proper time. This is said to work out satisfactorily.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">In Milwaukee, Wisconsin, under the guidance of a commission appointed by the mayor, there is a successful cooperative housing plan somewhat similar to the above, except that the homes are private homes. There are like arrangements at Endicott, New York, and elsewhere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Co-operative Purchase of Fuel</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">I</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">T IS evident that in the cooperative purchase of fuel only the first steps have been taken anywhere, as it is manifestly the wise thing and the economical thing to supply all the heat, light and electricity for a town from a single centrally located plant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">A few steps have been taken, however, toward reducing the fuel costs, which have become a great burden since the gigantic anthracite steals were pulled off during the war. We published in these columns notice of Governor Bryan’s state-owned coal yards in Nebraska, which are</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">pstimated to save the Nebraskans about $4 per ton.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">There have been some sporadic efforts made at cooperative coal purchasing elsewhere, always, however, because the people were really pressed into it. One of these cooperative coed yards is at Staunton, Illinois, where the employers of some miners attempted once too often to profiteer in selling coal to their own men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Another illustration is at Lehighton, Pennsylvania, where some workers, mostly railroad men, had a fairly successful cooperative store. . They hit upon the coal idea, but could not at first find any way to get the coak At length they rented a siding, built some bins of concrete in their spare time, and finally arranged with an independent coal operator to sell them coal, with the result that they are saving about $4 per ton in their purchases.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Co-operative Purchase of Credit</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">C</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">O-OPERATIVE purchase of credit is (he way we designate the workers' banks, which are operated as banks for the common people, and not intended or operated as adjuncts of big business. There are now twenty-three of these banks in various parts of America, only a </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">pitiful </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">few as compared with the hundreds that are to be found in various European countries; but it is a start.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">These banks are a real foundation upon which the workers may build their own homes, their own factories, and their own educations. They are not run for profit, but for the good they can do to their own depositors and customers. The issues of stock are limited, the dividends on the stocks are kept low, and the surplus profits all go to the depositors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The first cooperative bank in the United States was that of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">at</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> Cleveland, Ohio, November 1,1920. &quot;Seemingly this bank has either changed its original plan, or else it did not plan as we had hoped; for we observe that one of the directors of the Brotherhood Bank has been made a director of the Empire Trust Company of New York, and it is announced that the Brotherhood has acquired a large interest in the Trust Company. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>A</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">A man who was being swallowed by a shark might say that he had a great interest in the shark is a shark, and would not postpone the obsequies. This is not to say that the Empire Trust Company is a shark, but it is one of the great financial powers of the metropolis, .and its sympathies are that way.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">shark; but it would not change the fact </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">that</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> a . thing to help. Yet in spite of all difficulties the</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">FpkLK farmers are doing well with their coSper-ative insurance companies. There are said to be over 2,000 such companies in existence, providing all classes of protection at the actual cost.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">A case in point is the Farmers’ Cooperative Fire Insurance Company of Woodridge, New York. This concern has about $6,000,000 in force, and yet manages to do its business at a premium rate of $4.45 per $1,000, as against double that amount charged by other companies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Terre Haute has a • cooperative laundry. Staunton, Illinois, has a cooperative motionpicture house. The town is a strictly mining community. All the men in town belong to the miners’ union; and six nights a week the union shows the best pictures in its hall, with the result that the other, theatres in town have had to close up and move on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">In the British Isles</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">I</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">T IS to Great Britain that the whole world must look as the successful pioneer in the field of cooperation. In the little city of Rochdale, England, in 1844, the Rochdale Society of Equitable Pioneers founded what is now the Rochdale Society, which supplies virtually all the necessaries of life to -4,500,000 families.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The credit for this great idea is due to Charles Howarth and the twenty-eight .flannel weavers whose first investment was in a barrel of oatmeal The Rochdale Society now has its own factories, and even its own steamship line. It conducts almost every sort of enterprise. The competition which the Rochdale Society has been able to give other concerns has prevented the profiteering in Britain which is such a feature of .-American life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">This-cooperative movement has grown in Britain not because it.was favored or pampered by the government, the press, the banks, or the pulpit Every one of these worked against it; and with rare exceptions none of them did a</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Rochdale Society has doubled in the last twenty years, and now has a third of the British homes as members.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The men that are actually managing the Rochdale Society work for small wages. One of them being reminded of that fact, and being offered much larger remuneration, had the courage and the character to reply nobly: “My fellow cooperators pay me sufficient to satisfy my needs. I am happy serving the people. I should not be happy serving you at the expense of the people.” We wish every American business man was like this young man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">It can not be said that the Rochdale Society was absolutely the first cooperative institution, even in the British Isles. As early as 1830 there were in Scotland not less than 170 shops organized on what was then known as the Owen plan, but within the next four years most of these ceased to exist.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The Rochdale plan succeeds and grows, and accomplishes what is desired. Its first cooperative bank was founded in 1872. Now it is a gigantic institution with over 1,500 branches throughout the United Kingdom, and an annual business in excess of $2,418,000,000. Its motto is “Service instead of Profit”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The Belfast (Ireland) Cooperative Society began the handling of milk ten years ago. In the early part of this year the milk business of the society reached a total of 20,000 gallons per week, and arrangements were made to increase the outlet to 50,000 gallons weekly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">In Scandinavia ‘</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">C</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">O-OPERATION has made a new country out of Denmark. A generation ago it was common to see Danish women working in the fields; today it is a rare sight Cooperation is is what induced the change. One-half of all the Danish homes are in direct touch with the cooperative movement</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The way it works out in agriculture is that Danish farmers can buy concentrated dairy feeds in this United States, transport them to Denmark, Mid then undersell American buttermakers right on their own soil. Moreover, they can and do undersell the great American packers in the London market.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Cooperation in Denmark operates the laundries and the bakeries, thus removing two of the greatest burdens from the home. The houses and their grounds are becoming more beautiful. Music, art, and education are all improving. Class and social distinctions are passing away.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The people of Denmark were agitating for cooperation for thirty years before it was finally obtained. What held them back? Why, the foes of every step of human progress, of course! You know who they are. Everybody knows who they are. The four P’s in one pod: Profiteers, Politicians, Press, and Preachers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Cooperation has given Denmark regular supplies and stable prices. It has made the people happy by ridding them of the “snobocracy”. It has raised the per capita wealth from that of 27th place to second place. It has elected a farmer parliament, and it has a cooperative premier.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">We use the term “cooperative” because so many Americans have been poisoned by the press that we hardly dare say “Socialistic”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Norway reports a steady expansion of cooperative banking and cooperative stores. Sweden reports that of her six million inhabitants one-sixth are definitely committed to cooperative methods. The three countries, Denmark, Norway and Sweden, have a joint committee that buys the tea, coffee and other articles for the cooperators of the three nations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Finland differs from the three countries just named in that the cooperative movement there (which is only twenty years old) was started not as a result of pressure from beneath, but as an act of public benefit from above, by those who were in charge of the country's affairs and who desired its welfare.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">In Western Europt</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">C</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">O-OPERATION is growing steadily in Western Europe. We give a few scattered items which have come to our attention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Amsterdam, Holland, in spite of the almost prohibitive cost of building materials (brought from other countries) has since the war built on the cooperative plan a village of one thousand houses, attractively laid out, each in its own little garden. Both the city and the state advanced the funds necessary to help the cooperatives in this enterprise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The tiny but densely populated country of Belgium is a great hive of industry. The workers planned a cooperative vacation resort and purchased one of the grand old castles, situated in a beautiful park in the hilly region. This has been transformed into an ideal summer home where hundreds of workers can be entertained at the same time nt a minimum of expense. Who can say that it ia not better every way •for this castle to be a source of joy and of health to hundreds of workers than to be merely the occasional home of an imaginary nobility!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">In France, cooperative societies are accomplishing considerable, especially since the war, and are receiving some friendly aid from the</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">• state. Even in Spain there is something being accomplished, although the number of cooperators is comparatively small. Next to Denmark, Switzerland is the most thoroughly organized along cooperative lines of any country in the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Until the Fascisti anarchists seized the Italian government, the cooperators in Italy were making wonderful progress. They owned farms, ships and factories, and had constructed and were operating one railroad. They were building a great canal to connect Milan with the River Po; they had reclaimed large tracts of waste lands, had built and were operating irrigation systems, and had founded several thousand workers’ banks. In </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">Milan</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> they had built and were operating a model workingman’s hotel. The Milanese cooperators could even buy their dinners, all ready to serve, delivered to their own doors by the cooperative delivery wagon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">But with the advent of the black shirt anarchists much of this progress has been blocked, and in some instances the fruit of thirty yean of effort has been destroyed. Scores of cooperative stores have been burned; land, machinery, horses and oxen have been seized; all in the name of—what!</span></p>

<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">I</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">N </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">The Golden Age, No.</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> 124, your article on “Modern Medicine Men” was read with great interest, especially the one regarding the “Shrine of St. Hickson”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The writer of this letter, who has been crippled a good many years with spinal trouble, attended one of St. Hickson’s healing services several years ago in Hartford, Conn. St. Hickson received a big ovation from the clergy, and his wondrous -work was broadcast throughout the country. The writer, having received no help or benefit from other sources, expected to see great works done by this Hickson, not for his benefit only but also for other poor cripples and afflicted persons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The church in which the healings took place was crowded with the sickly and maimed, young and old, with all kinds of complaints. The writer was handed a card to be filled out, stating trouble, how long afflicted, etc; and was then seated at the extreme end of the church, where there were a few empty seats left.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">At ten o’clock a. m. the healing service began, and until one o’clock a steady stream of afflicted humanity knelt at the altar, while St Hickson laid his hands npon them and blessed them. During the three hours’ service the only sound to be heard in the church was an organ playing, a low, solemn sound. In such an atmosphere one could expect great works to be done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">At one o’clock the service was ended, with more people waiting to be blessed, the writer included. St. Hickson requested the re</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">maining </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">ones to kneel in the aisle, while he passed through and laid his hands on their heads. </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">This </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">was done, and he touched each one with a &quot;God bless you”. And thus ended, the service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">If any healing or miracle was done that day, it was not visible or made known. The writer saw the blind, deaf, lame, etc., leave as they entered, with their afflictions still with the</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">em. </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">As to the writer, he is still crippled and waiting for that day to come when Christ will reign, when all those who are afflicted will find relief ; for there will be no more pain, sickness, disease, or death and God himself will wipe away all tears from off all faces.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark37"></a>The Land of Flowers and Springs</span></h3>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">F</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">LORIDA the land of flowers might as well have been called the land of springs, or the land of waters; for it is as much one as the other. Other states may boast of their mountains, but not Florida. But no other state can truthfully boast of more water.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Florida is a giant thumb thrust down into the gulf of Mexico, which it separates from the Atlantic Ocean. It has 1,145 miles of coast line. Nowhere more than 300 feet above the sea, its scenery, while beautiful, is of necessity that of lake and river and seashore and forests.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Florida is unique in the number and size of its springs. A navigable stream bursts forth from the earth at Silver Springs. Another equally great spring emerges in the ocean a mile east of St Augustine. These springs are doubtless outlets of some of the rivers which here and there lose themselves in Kentucky, Missouri, and elsewhere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Florida has countless lakes, countless islands, and several large rivers, the largest of which, the St Jolin's, is navigable for a distance of 250 miles. The St. John’s is a mile wide 150 miles from its mouth, and is six or seven miles w ide near its mouth. The Kissimmee, Suwanee and Apalachicola rivers are also navigable, two of them for a distance of ninety miles each.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Lake Okechobee in the south, twenty-five feet above sea level, covers 1,200 square miles and has served as a great reservoir to keep the Everglades filled with water. It is now being used otherwise, and the Everglades are being drained. They cover 3,600 square miles, much of which is recoverable for agricultural purposes. The Everglades throughout are dotted with dry hummocks, some of which cover over a square mile.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Key West, which always was an island until the courage and the genius of man connected it with the mainland by the Florida East Coast Railway, has one of the finest island harbors in the world. The railroad to Key West is amarvel of engineering, running 107 miles along coral reefs all the way from Florida mainland to Key West—a railroad at sea.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Florida’s Star Attraction—Climate</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">^VTOBODY would dare believe the things that A w Florida people themselves have to say about their climate; but one may quote from others, and this is wbat </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Collier's Weekly</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">At its best—no, even at its average—the Florida climate is a thing so wonderful that you sometimes scarcely believe at the end of a month that you hava really had thirty such golden days. Lying between two sun-wanned seas, aa it does, the peninsula is always fanned by salt air. Florida weather at its best, in those incredible spring days of warm, fresh sea winds, almost accomplishes the impossible. It is both tonic and soothing; it at once invigorates and ealms you. The calmness is accentuated by the inevitable sense of remoteness which the oranges and roses give you as you read your letters from home of frosts and blizzards in the North. The South, one must repeat in closing, is a. miracle, a pretty fairy tale which no one, if he </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">can</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> be carried aboard the Florida train on a litter, can afford to miss. What charm can there be in snows and the fire crackling on the hearth, when down yonder the moon is flooding the orange blossoms with light, showing golden fruit and white blossoms, and the mw* </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">king</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">.hirds, tricked into belief that it is day, are singing through the gorgeous southern night ?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Coming down out of the skies, we ihay say that the normal mean temperature for January ranges from 60° to 70°, and that in June, July and August it is hot. If you don’t believe it, try it. Three great railway systems, the Southern, the Seaboard, and the Atlantic Coast Lines, bring Florida within one night's ride from New York, Chicago and St. Louis, 1,000 miles distant, and are making it an extremely popular resort state. More than a million people visit Florida each year. Some of these visitors come from Europe and South America, charmed by its saltladen, ozone-saturated atmosphere, to which is added the health-giving qualities of a delightful odor of pine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">A Glimpse at Florida History</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">I</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">T IS sometimes said of Florida that it was the first state to be discovered and the last to be developed. Ponce de Leon, the Spanish explorer, first landed near St. Augustine, March 27,1512, and thereafter spent some years seeking among the now famous springs of the state, and far over its borders, the fountain of eternal youth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The Spaniards did little or nothing toward settling the country. In 1763 it was ceded to Great Britain, and twenty years later was returned to the Spanish. In 1819 it was sold to the United States for $5,000,000; and the real settlement of the country was undertaken.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The whites began their usual invasion of the territory of the red man, pushing him farther and farther back into the swamps and the less desirable country, taking the best of his land and killing off his game. This was the cause of all the Indian wars and of the greatest of all Indian wars, that of the Seminoles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The Seminoles were brave, and they were honest. Their chief Osceola was summoned to a conference. When he came, he conducted himself with the air of the ruler of the country, which by right he was. General Wiley Thompson tried to break his spirit by having him put in irons for a day. The mistake cost Thompson his life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Osceola promised all that was required. On the date when he was to turn over the Indian stock to the whites, scalping parties descended upon the white settlements, burned their cabins, murdered the inhabitants and drove their cattle into the swamps. Osceola scalped Thompson with his own hands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">After seven years of courageous defence of his country Osceola finally approached the commander of the United States troops under a flag of truce, to endeavor to arrange terms of peace. He was accompanied by a retinue of several chiefs and seventy of his best warriors. With unspeakable treachery the entire company was seized and imprisoned in Fort Moultrie, where Osceola finally died of fever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The United States government never did fully conquer the Seminoles. The bulk of the tribe was seized and moved to the Indian Territory (now Oklahoma), where a remnant of 2,757 still have their own government and manage their own tribal affairs. The unconquered remainder, now dwindled to 358, still live in the Everglades. They are partly civilized and entirely inoffensive, but avoid the whites on the ground that “white man no good, lie too much”. With the draining of the Everglades, their last chance to escape white domination passes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Conquering the Everglades is a slow job. The Tamiami trail, which is intended to connect Tampa and Miami, was abandoned during the war, on account of shortage of labor; but work on it is to be renewed. A party of ten cars actually made the trip over the entire route early this year. Seven of the cars managed to get through in ten days’ time; two were lost in the swamps, and one gave up the fight and went back to Fort Myers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">What Florida Produce*</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">T</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">HE</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">RE are still plenty of deer, wild turkeys and green turtles in Florida; and there used to be plenty of alligators, but they are now rare. Several of the brilliant birds have been greatly reduced in numbers by hunters employed by wholesale milliners.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The richness of the soil, the warmth of the climate, and the large rainfall make Florida an ideal place for vegetation of almost any kind. Twenty years ago it was claimed that Florida was the only place in America where a man could buy a piece of land, and raise enough crops on it within two years to pay the cost of the land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">There are 250 different .varieties of crops, nuts, etc., brought into northern markets from Florida. The two leading crops are oranges and pineapples. Florida oranges are famous for juiciness and a delightful tang not notion-able in other varieties.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Not only does Florida produce all kinds of early foods for northern markets, but it also produces large quantities ofstaples such as sugarcane, cotton, rice, sweet potatoes, Irish potatoes, peanuts, casava, melons, lemons, limes, grapefruit, guava, plums, olives, figs, and cocoa-nuts. It has a greater variety of trees than any other state in the Union. Of trees peculiar to Florida itself, in the United States, are the wild oranges, cocoanut, Indian almond, mahogany, satinwood and manchineeh</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The largest sponge market in the world is at Tarpon Springs, Florida, twenty-eight miles north of Tampa. Like other Florida industries it has been developed by those who have come in from outside. The sponge fishing is in the hands of Greeks, of whom there are about 1,500 in the industry. They carry on the work scientifically, using the latest modern appliances. The best sponges are harvested 120 to 140 feet below the surface of the water, and grow as fast as they can be cut</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Florida has no metals, but stands first in the mining of phosphate rock for fertilizers. The phosphate deposits skirt the Gulf all the way from Tallahassee to Tampa. Tampa has approximately 200 cigar factories, employing about 10,000 workmen in the manufacture of clear Havana cigars.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">A Statt with a Great Future</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">TT^LORIDA has a great future before it. This * fact is coming to be recognized. More than one-fourth of all the building done in the United States during the years 1920-1921 is said to have been done in that state.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Florida has no possible sources of cheap power ;.yet the people of Jacksonville buy their current at a price lower than any other city in the United States, unless it is Seattle. The reason for this is that the city owns the power plant, as every city should.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The Ashing industry of Florida is large, there being about 200 vessels engaged in the trade off Pensacola. A considerable quantity of hones, mules, and cattle are raised for export to Cuba. The present population is an even million, of whom two-fifths are colored. The state maintains a double system of schools, one for white children and another for colored.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Miami has done much for Florida, but it has done more for itself. Following the example of some western states it engaged upon an ad* vertising campaign, setting forth in northern cities the advantages of a winter home where the water never gets colder than 72° and where the sun is always warm.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">In ten years Miami has multiplied its population four times, and its permanent residents now number 50,000. During the months from November to May every room that will house a boarder is filled. The city is built on a limestone rock, and many of the homes are built of the material beneath. A million dollar boulevard connects Miami with Miawri Beach, 3A miles distant.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Eastern Texas as Viewed by a Northener</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">W</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">E </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">HA</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">D supposed before coming to Texas that we would see rattlesnakes, plains, prairies, and possibly alligators. But we find that the plains are 500 miles farther west; rattlesnakes are very scarce; and the landscape generally looks like the hills and vales of Ohio. The roads in Smith and Van Zandt counties are mostly improved, and remarkably well taken care of.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Cotton is grown, and hauled to town, where it is ginned and bailed for shipment It was interesting to us to see how the seeds are separated from the cotton. The raw cotton is sucked up from the farmer's wagon outside, by means of a twelve-inch galvanized iron pipe. It next passes through the gin, which is a machine equipped with a number of circle saws about twelve-inches in diameter, revolving rapidly on the same shaft. These protrude through narrow slots, pulling the cotton away from the seeds. The separated cotton is then carried on a conveyer to a press, where it is baled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Occasionally xwe see a sorghum cane mill Tins is a very primitive, backwoods affair. A mule walks around in a circle, pulling a long pole which rotates iron rollers. The cane is</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">By M. M. Parmenter </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">fed into these rollers, and the juice squeezed out into a vat Nearby is a long oven, made of bricks and stones, on the top of which there is a large pan about six inches deep, and four feet wide by six feet long. The juice is here boiled down to syrup. Immense quantities of cane stalks are thrown away after the juice is squeezed out It would seem as though this might be good material for making paper.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The towns look much like the ones we used to see in the moving pictures. The restaurants are called cafes, the men wear broad-rimmed hats, and the streets are very wide. Large groups of men are often seen standing around the stores and garages, and they look very intently at travelers passing through. Most of these people seem filled with the spirit of helpfulness, however; and when our car is broken down, nearly all passers-by stop and ask if they can be of assistance. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Some of the things we never saw before axe water drained from the roof for drinking purposes ; Negro preachers interested in I. B. S. A. literature; white women dipping snuff; and * Baptist minister butchering hogs.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark38"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark39"></a>Reports From Foreign Correspondents</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">From Canada</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">M</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">b.</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> R. E. FAiBBtray, writing in the “Christian Guardian”, is somewhat fearless in his arraignment of the modern pulpiteer, so much so that we cannot but fear for him inasmuch as, knowing what short shrift is meted out to all who are not pleasing to the “machine” which governs us through politics, church and state, his utterances must be most distinctly displeasing to large numbers of those who read the columns of-his vehicle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Without doubt,” he says, “our modern world needs the prophetic voice and message. It is surfeited with the cloying sweetmeats of sentimental preachments designed to engage the sensibilities. That is the due penalty of religion made easy and palatable ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Mr. Fairburn proceeds to detail the crying evils of our day, all of which he states should be vigorously attacked from the pulpit, but deplores the fact that the modern ministers are unable to lead in the work:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“Not the eloquent departmental secretary, not the crowd-attracting evangelist, nor the expert organizer of drives, nor the pleasing singer; only the prophet!” “Needless to say,” he goes on, “The religious world does not welcome such a voice, if there be found a man of insight and courage to arise in the name of the Lord. Oh, for half an hour of Isaiah!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">We sympathize with Mr. Fairburn’s cry as we do with his expressions against war, commented on in a previous article. He seems to be one of the few voices crying in the wilderness; and we can sympathize with any who, seeing clear-eyed the stark horror of modern conditions, yet mills hopelessly around in the narrow cage of tradition and &quot;orthodoxy”, knowing naught of the freedom beyond the bars. Let us hope that his eyes may soon be opened to the “new and living way” from his troubles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Ontario faced a plebiscite on the liquor question in October. Your correspondent prophesied some time ago that the prohibition law would be amended in some form before Christmas. If our present Provincial Government has its way, Quebec is due for a considerable drop in revenue from Ontario’s “wets” before long. “Keep your booze money at home,” is the popular sentiment ;.<sub>A</sub> and “Patronize home bootleggers” is another expression of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Recently our papers have endeavored to justify the Government Immigration policy by proudly showing that the tide of emigration from Canada southward was slowing up and that many Canadians were returning. The </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Mail and Empire,</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> Toronto, ceases its propaganda, however, with the statement that the exodus still continues as heavy as ever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The Vancouver </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Daily Province</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> tries also to peer through the propaganda smoke to see what immigration from Continental Europe and the British Isles will really mean to the country. It comments on the prosperity before the war, with an aggressive immigration policy in force and thousands of people flocking in and then says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“We do not seem to have decided upon </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">which was </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">the cause and which the effect, or </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">whether the two wen </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">concomitant. We had free homesteads for </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">them and </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">railroad work to help them get on their </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">feet. Wa st91 </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">have plenty of land available, but </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">it is not free^ cad </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">railroad work has dwindled to </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">minimum. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">This be</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">ing the ease, it is not at all certain that </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">wo know what </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">we want to do with the newcomers. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">We cannot expect </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">them to create the tide </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of prosperity which will sweep </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">them on to a competence. That </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">is too much like look</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">ing to a nation to raise itself </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">by its bootstraps. Tte </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">machinery is all ready, but the engine </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">won’t start. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Priming of some sort is necessary.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The Moose Jaw Times puts the matter quite clearly:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“Canada </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">lost $182,000,000 in </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">man power to the </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">United States during </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">1923. 182,000 men went over </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">during the year, and Immigration officials </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">figure that </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">each immigrant is worth $1,000 to the country. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Accord</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">ingly the 182,000 who went across the border </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">represent </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">a loss of $182,000,000. It is reliably estimated </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">that </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">every man, woman and child in the country </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">is an ef</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">fective consumer of $700 Worth of products during </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">year.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Thus we must add to our $182,000,000 the immense sum of $127,400,000 loss to general business, making a total of $309,400,000 loss to Canada. It goes on:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“A few weeks ago the Government announced </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">that </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">the tide of emigration to the United States had </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">turned, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">and in proof of this is was said the statistics </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">collected </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">by the Department of Immigration showed that during April and May an average of 2,000 people per moathi had returned to Canada from the South. But </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">what did </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">the United States figures show? They showed </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">that dur</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">ing May about 13,500 people went from </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Canada to the</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Republic. That is to my, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">far</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> every one that came back, six went over.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">This pertinent commentary on the Government bluff should make us think. Prosperity is not just around the corner. In fact, a pair of high power binoculars will fail to discern it anywhere on the horizon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The Toronto </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Star</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> carries as a news item the statement of Canon F. G. Scott, Bishop of Quebec, and noted war time padre, at a recent meeting of the Anglican Social Service Council:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“We must admit,” states the Canon, “that Canada </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">is </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">today being carried on one big bluff. We cannot build a country on false hopes. We must get to rock bottom. It is no use saying we should bring Britishers out here to go an the farms. They won’t do it.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">“They are doing it in my province,&quot; interrupted a member from Alberta. Later, Canon Scott added:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“Do you realize that this country is bankrupt? If this country was asked to produce gold for money in circulation if could not do it We are very heavily taxed. Every man, woman and child in Canada down to the last Indian papoose is paying $6.50 a year for the National Railway. We must go slow.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Yes, Canon; we must go slower than that even. In reply to your interrupter regarding the condition of Alberta, let us quote from a report recently received from one of our western representatives, one whom we have every confidence in as a reliable observer:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“We have been for the past two weeks in a very poor district (in Alberta). With no crops year after year the people are leaving by the hundreds. There is not ten percent of the farms where we have been for the past two weeks that are inhabited. Those that are staying are next to destitute. The C. P. R. is giving them free transportation to any place they choose io go. I never could have believed there was such poverty in the West had I not seen it for rayself. We have driven for twenty-five miles at a stretch on a road with houses on both sides and not one inhabitant. It will mean very hard times for the winter with a great many. This condition exists north and west of here also.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Alberta s is no doubt excellent territory for British refugees!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">There may still be doubt in the hearts of some as to the reliability of figures quoted in these columns concerning Canada’s indebtedness. Briefly let us quote from the Calgary </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Daily</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Herald</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> some figures which are considered reliable by the Bond Dealers Association of Canada. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“Dominion Debt, 1923, __________$2,512,126,559</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Provincial Debts, 1923 ___________$ 674,411,876</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Divide this amongst eight millions of a population, which incidentally steadily grows less, and you have the average per capita debt, for every man, woman, and child, Indian papoose and Eskimo, of $530. How nearly does this tally with our other statements T</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Mr. G. G. Coote, Alberta member of parliament in the Dominion House, gave his views to the Toronto </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Financial Post. As</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> reported by the Moose Jaw </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Times,</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> he states that fully one-third of the fanners of Western Canada are bankrupt: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“By the World War we gained a truer appreciation and a better realization of war’s unspeakable waste, its dreadful hardships, its cruel slaughter, and its aftermath of loneliness, sorrow and broken hearts. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">We know </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">that </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">as </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">a means of salving the world’s problems </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">removing international discard </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">war </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">is </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">delusion </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">* lie.&quot;</span></p>

If only our statesmen, politicians, ministers, et al, could have exercised foresight as well!

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">BOWLING GREEN, VA., Sept. 13. C. B. Conway of Moss Neck, former member of the house of delegates of the Virginia General Assembly from Caroline county, has started a sixty days sentence in the county jail here for violating the prohibition laws. Conway was arrested on May 1, after a fifty-gallon still had been found in operation in the kitchen of his home, together with a quantity of corn liquor and mash. He was not at home at the time but surrendered to Caroline county authorities later and, after indictment by the grand jury on two counts, he pled guilty before Judge R. H. L. Chichester and was fined $100 and sentenced to sixty days in jail. He was released under $1,000 bond for appearance October 13 to begin his jail term, but decided to begin serving his time this week.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">PITTSBURGH, P^a., Sept. 16.—Secretary Mellon's conduct of the Treasury Department and hi* influence with the Republican Administration were assailed by Senator Wheeler, of Montana, Independent Vice-Presidential candidate, in his address here to-night</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">An innovation was introduced by </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">the local manager* </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">of the Independent ticket </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">when they asked for and </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">obtained </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">fifty-cent </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">admission fee to hear Senator </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Wheeler’s speech.

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">The Treasury head. Senator Wheeler </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">asserted, ^em</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">bodied the economic idea that </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">government existed solely </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">for the protectum of property” </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">and he added that “in </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">matters of taxation, public expenditures, finance, law enforcement, foreign, oil and related quentiosi*, Mr. Mellon’s quiet voice is pretty nearly supreme in the present Administration.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">An example of “Mr. Mellon's tendernes* toward property,” Senator Wheeler went on, had been exhibited in prohibition laxity. The Senator seid:</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Introspection </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">By P. A. Me Swain</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">(&lt;Tl T AN that is born of a woman is of few 1VL days, and fnil of trouble”. (Job 14:1) This melancholy truth finds an echo in every human heart; for divested of all the sophistry concerning it, human life is the most pathetic tragedy the universe has ever conceived.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Man boasts himself the proud possessor of a soul. But taking history at its face value man is seen to be the most brutal being in the whole scale of animal creation, literally sprinkling the earth with pale sleepers, victims of the relentless god of war, while millions have perished in excruciating torture, even in the name of religion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Man prides himself on his ability to reason by use of the substance known as brain. But he forgets that the dog by use of the same substance can unerringly scent and follow the trail of an animal that has passed along five hours before, and that at last the worms get both.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Since time began, man has set himself the serious task of solving the great riddle of life. But all his efforts have turned to ashes in his hands; for neither the result of scientific research nor the discoveries of philosophy reveal anything concerning it, while the little mound of earth that marks the end of the journey mocks his puny triumphs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Stent of Lift Unknown</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">HE secret of life is not revealed by any of the processes known to man; and the only evidence we have that man has any pre-eminence above that of the beast is demonstrated by love, such as acts of mercy and tolerance. When the griefs, sufferings and disappointments of life become a fading memory and death lays hold upon the little throbbing heart, the only consolation to be had is the thought of any deeds of kindness that he may have scattered as he passed along the way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Looking down the dim vista of nineteen centuries we find the record of a man who freely sacrificed His whole life, and all that life embraced, in loving service to the downtrodden, the outcast of earth. Not a single transgression could be laid at His door, nor was guile found in His mouth; His life established the ideal that draws like a magnet, and His death brought the hope of immortality. Yet in that dark hour of dissolution amidst the fading scenes of earth we find among His last utterances the agonizing cry, “My God! My God! why hast thou forsaken me f”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">What then must be the last hour for the heedless, the ungodly who live their lives for self alone f</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">But did Jesus die in vain! Surely His sacrifice is to some now, and later will be to all, available for salvation. Thank God for the assurance of His Word that Jesus’ resurrection is a guarantee of coming times of restitution and the restoration of all that was lost when Adam plunged our race into sin and death! And still, for Christ’s kingdom we humbly wait.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark42"></a>Exploration of North Pole Region</span></h3>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">I</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">T HAS been thought that we were nearing the end of the glacial period, and that the climate of the entire earth was to become more moderate—the north warming, the south cooling. We believe this yet; hnt Captain Donald B. McMillan, who has returned from a fifteen months’ exploration of the Arctic region, brings some new ideas relative to this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sub>a</sub> Mr. McMillan’s observations, reaching over a period of sixteen years, incline him toward the belief that we are entering another glacial period; for the ice caps and glaciers of the far north are increasing in thickness and are moving southward.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Other discoveries made by Mr. McMillan corroborate the Bible record that there were no cold, barren, and uninhabitable areas upon the earth prior to the Noachian Tfood. Enormous</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Physical changes are unquestionably still going on in the earth; and as the frigid zones thaw out, on the surface by the warm waters of the . Japan and Mexican Gulf streams, and beneath by the internal fires which are believed to exist, we may expect the earth to buckle and twist and heave .and sigh in these convulsions of nature until all the ice is disgorged and the earth settles into the peaceful equilibrium of a perfect poise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Neither has the earth changed materially the axis of its polarity. The North Star and other stars are in motion, and no doubt change their relative position, not only to our earth but to our entire solar system. But the motion of all our planets with their polar inclinations (with the possible exception of Uranus) incline us to the view that our present axial relation to fte sun is as it always has been.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">God has manifested too great an interest in the human family by sending His Son Jesus into the world to redeem and, presently, in ths Messianic kingdom, to restore the race to the pristine perfection of Adam and Eve in a world beautified earth-wide like Eden, to permit * comet to shatter it, or another glacial period to freeze it up, or the sun to cool sufficiently to devitalize it. We should not be afraid—either for our children or for our children’s children.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">coal deposits, twenty-five feet thick, a few hundred miles from the North Pole, and eight hundred miles beyond the reach of any transportation facilities (except sleds), were found. As a result of this, the explorer claims that that region once had a very different climate from what it now has, and he thinks that the polar axis of the earth has materially changed. He found dam shells on the tops of hills, 1200 feet above the sea level, proving that the hills' were once under the water. And now, there are positive signs of the subsidence of great nd areas; for “the entire coast is si</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">nking</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">”, he jays. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Our opinion, however, is that we are not in a new glacial period, but gradually getting out of .the first and only one that shall ever be. Prior to the Flood the earth was a sort of hothouse, canopied with vapors of water through which the sun’s heat was equably distributed. These vapors gradually condensed and finally gravitated upon the earth, causing the great Deluge, the centrifugal force of the earth’s rotary motion compelling the precipitation at the poles. The earth, now having the sun shining directly upon it, warmed up at the equator, and cooled rapidly at the poles. The ice in the polar regions was not formed during centuries, but during a few days.</span></p>

This has hurt the regular religious trade seriously; for the common people had been previously taught that the bones ■were genuine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">But Mr. Thomas insists that while religious fraud has been made more difficult, yet there are many religious sects in Russia; and that he asked representatives of several of them whether they had been interfered with in any way by the Soviet and they stated that they had not. Moreover, Mr. Thomas stated that this was their answer without an exception.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">On the other hand Mr. John Spargo, famous Socialist, states that today in Soviet Russia a child may- not attend the Soviet schools if he attends church or Sunday school, and that children are expelled from the State schools if they do not admit that they are atheists. The revolution in Russia is the French Revolution right over again in all its phases.</span></p>

<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">R</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">alph Cohhob is supposed to be the name of a man. He is the author of &quot;The Sky Pilot,” “The Patrol of the Sun Dance Trail,” “The Sky Pilot in No Man’s Land,” etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">A sky pilot is one who is supposed to know the way of salvation; but in reality he is a pious hypocrite posing in the livery of sanctimony, disguising himself as a Christian. A sky pilot is of the tribe Magi; and obsessed with pride and vainglory he sallies forth to win the plaudits of the World, the Flesh, and the Devil, and is unsatisfied in his insatiable greed until these plaudits are received. He cares nothing for the Lord Jesus, for the Word of Truth, nor for the spirit of the truth. What do the lowliness, the goodness, the gentleness, of the Man of Galilee mean to him! His cloak of religion serves only to fool the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">In Winnipeg, Canada, there is a preacher by the name of Reverend C. W. Gordon. He is the pastor of St Stephen’s Church (Presbyterian). His annual salary from this congregation is $1.00—one dollar. Yes, a dollar a year; but read on.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">(Date of issue appended at end of paragraphs.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“While they were in Winnipeg the speaker [Dr. Gordon] felt certain that to many of there boys God had seemed but a name, but now they regarded Him as a great and real person, a -very trustworthy friend. ‘Our army,’ he said in conclusion, 'is a deeply religious army.’ ”—January 4, 1917.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“Taking for his [Dr. Gordon’s] text Luke 9.: 62, “Diis teaching is applicable to Canada and its duty today.... War from a distance may well bo a thing of glory; but near at hand war is an ugly thing, the commonplace of which are pain, dirt and death.... The red plowshare of war today is tearing through pleasant fields of life, bringing &quot;ruin upon the flowers and fruits of human lives and wrecking homes of many living things; and the teaching of the metaphor is that before Canada there is but one simply single duty, and for every man, woman and child in Canada that duty is to plow this tearing, terrible furrow of war straight through to tho end.... They are convinced we are right in our aim at the first; they are convinced we are still right in pursuing the same end; and that end with all reverence we say is nothing less than the Kingdom of God.'&quot;—January 15,1917.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;Mapar Gordon said that before the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">war he was an </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">anti-consariptianist and pacifist; that he </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">was </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">still </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">pacifist but that he realized that the way to peaaa lead through the blood red paths of </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">war. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">‘Everything/ said the speaker, ‘should be subservient to carrying on of war. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">Thing</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">s high, holy and sacred even should be considered of second importance.’ He personally </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">was </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">not so much concerned about saving men’s souls today as making them fit to fight and go help the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">matter </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">through.”—September 19, 1917.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“I [Dr. Gordon] believe the heart of Canada is wholly sound still for righteousness and this war, and still prepared to sacrifice.” “A chaplain that doesn’t </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">make </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">his men better fighting men isn’t on his job.... It is wonderful to see how the men steady up </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">when they </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">realize God is with them.”—November 14,1917.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">rpHAT &amp;&nbsp;preacher may prostitute his proles' A sion is entirely possible. It will be edifying to quote Luke 9:62: “And Jesus said unto him, No man, having put his hand to the plough, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">In the context Jesus was pointing out the hardships that would attend one who undertook to be His follower.<sup>-</sup> Every one knows that the life of Jesus from the time of His consecration was a stormy one. He was “a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief.” He said that the way of life was difficult: ‘Sit down first and count the cost.’ Jesus was humble, meek, kind, and sympathetic. “If any man have not the spirit of Christ, he is none of his.” His argument plainly was: ‘If any man makes up his mind to be a follower of mine, makes the starts and then turns back, he is not fit to be rewarded with heavenly glory.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">But Dr. Gordon applied it to Presbyterians, Methodists and Catholics in Canada taking up deadly firearms to kill off the Presbyterians, Methodists and Catholics in Germany. He says: “The metaphor is that before Canada there is but one simply single duty.... to plow this tearing, terrible furrow of war straight through to the end,... that end </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">with all reverence</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> we say is </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">nothing less than the kingdom of God.<sup>u</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Was there ever ranker blasphemy utteredr— that the hateful murderous war, which he himself admits “is an ugly thing, the commonplace of which are pain, dirt and death,” is man’s agency for ushering in the kingdom of God on earth! It is only partially paralleled by the blasphemy of the preachers who proclaim that the League of Nations is “the political expression of the kingdom of God on earth.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Dr. Gordon probably got the idea that his army &quot;is a deeply religious army” because the boys gave his oratory respectful hearing. Yes; he has oratory. No matter what else he lacks, he probably has oratory to burn. A preacher must have oratory, and an author has the gift of speech. Ralph Connor and Rev. C. W. Gordon are one and the same. We now know that he has courage and honesty! We can tell by the fruits. Before the war he was an anti-conscriptionist. He changed his mind about that when the Canadian Government began to conscript its soldiers. Before the war he was a pacifist. But now he is one in name only. “Everything,” says, he, “should be subservient to carrying on of war”—that the way to peace leads through the blood red paths of war, that “things high, holy, and sacred even, should be considered of second importance.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">World’s Standard of Mentality</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">J</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">UST how great this man is may never be known, but we will help somewhat. It is proverbially known that preachers* sons are bad ones, so young Gordon got a good start in life by being the son of his father, the Rev. Gordon, being born 64 years ago. He went to public schools in Glengarry; Harrington High School, St. Mary’s, Ontario; Toronto University; Knox College, receiving there the degree of D. D.; at Queen’s University, Kingston, L L. D.; and at Glasgow, D. D.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Dr. Gordon had put his hand to the plow as an anti-conscriptionist,. and turned back to join hands with the devil in the fiercest war ever known. His war promotions are as follows: Made chaplain 79th Cameron Highlanders, went with C.E. F. as chaplain of the 43rd Batt.; Cameron Highlanders as captain; May 1915 made senior chaplain of Canadian forces, rank major; proceeded to France 1916 as senior chaplain of 9th Brigade, B. E. F. (Canadian). He was attached to the British Mission to the United States and- Canada 1917-1918.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Before the war Dr. Gordon had also put his hand to the plow as a pacifist; but from this war record he demonstrates the fact that he is a pacifist in camouflage, hence turned back again.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">With the letters he might place before and after his name, we know positively that he is unfit for the kingdom of God—unless he becomes converted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">According to the world’s standard Reverend C. W. Gordon, D. D. LL.D^ alias Ralph Connor, would measure up pretty well with many of its preachers and 'warriors. He is some-mixer. He is of the world, and the world lovesits own. “The friendship of the world is enmity with God. Whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.”—James 4:4-</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The grandstand applause is seen in the following, taken from the Canadian </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Home Journal </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">of June 1924:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;The panon deacribed by Gddimith, who </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">was ‘pass</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">ing rich on forty pounds </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">year*, will hardly </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">bo envied . </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">by many modern clergymen, but </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">even today there ia </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">at least one minister of religion whose salary ia conisd-erably less than this amount. Indeed, it ia probably the smallest salary in the world. This pastor is the-Rev. Dr. C. W. Gordon, better known as Ttelph Connor*,, the author of ‘The Sky Pilot* and other famous novels.. He is the minister of </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Presbyterian church </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">at </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Winnipeg, but finds so much of his time taken up with outside engagements that an </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">associate </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">clergyman has been appointed to carry on while he ia away from homa. This associate gets the lien’s share of the salary, thr novelist being content with the modest stipend of a dollar a year for his services to the church.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">A reader of </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Thx Goldsit Agb</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> in Winnipeg: writes: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“The high salaries paid to Dr. Gordon and his associate must have pretty well ‘broken* the church up; for according to one of the local papers, they had to sell the church-house, an establishment kept for the purpose of instructing ‘whosoever will’ in the arts of basketball, boring, billiards, etc., the perform and playing being plainly visible to those who passed by. The indebtedness of the church wu $80,000. The building, brought $45,000”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Wonders of Publicity</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">P</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">ERHAPS Dr. Gordon, alias Connor, would be glad to tell the world that his salary from the St. Stephen’s church is only one dollar per annum. It represents a great sacrifice for the Master—supposedly so! We must remember that Dr. Gordon, alias Connor, receives royalties from the sale of his many fiction books. This is as it should be, but we are unable to figure out how a preacher can write numerous books on fiction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">‘ But another item concerning where Dr. Gordon, alias Connor, got his money is not so liberally blown to the winds: It reveals the secret why he turned conscriptionist, and remains a pacifist in camouflage. It follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Canadian Press Despatch, to the Manitoba </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Free Press,</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> Winnipeg, May 23,1924. “Ottawa, May 22.—Rev. C. W. Gordon (Ralph Connor) of Winnipeg, was paid $14,678 for his services as captain and chaplain in the Canadian Expeditionary Forces. The amount paid to his dependent was $2,962 during this period, making a total payment of $17,640. Dr. Gordon served for four years, three months, and twentyeight days. A part of the time he was engaged in delivering addresses at patriotic meetings throughout Canada and the United States. The information in regard to his services was given in the House of Commons in answer to a question by William Duff (Liberal, Lunenburg).”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">A Modem ‘‘Alexander the Coppersmith”</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">HE most despicable, devilish, and heathenish part that Dr. Gordon, alias Connor, had to play in the World War is yet to follow. For receiving such a handsome reward from the Government for preaching young men into the war, making of his church a recruiting station, and sanctifying war by telling the soldiers that they would go to heaven if they died on the battlefield, he surely thought that he had to earn his money. Diabolically and with fiendish enthusiasm he went before the Canadian Government, and persuaded it to cause the arrest and imprisonment of Bible Students if they had anything in their possession bearing the imprint of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society,</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> even though, it might be nothing more desperate than a Bible or a hymn book.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">As samples of how his wishes were carried out, on November 8, 1918, at Iroquois Falls, Ontario, A. R. Wood, Peter Wood, Thomas Phillipa, Mrs. A. E. Holland, Mrs. Wood, Mrs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">McCurdy, and Mrs. Acheson were fined $100 each for holding a prayer-meeting. The Bibles seized at this meeting, together with the Bible study textbooks, were all burned in the furnace by order of the trial judge, J. K. Ebbitt, a member of the Church of England. At Victoria, British Columbia, A. Sutherland was jailed three months for having a Bible study textbook in his possession.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">These outrages became epidemic throughout Canada and quickly spread to the United States, resulting in one of the greatest waves of bigotry, intolerance, beatings, fines and imprisonments, tarrings and featherings ever known in history.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">After his conversion, St Paul was an humble Christian and would harm no one. He had Christ’s spirit. As a Christian he had his opponents. He was beaten, imprisoned and otherwise ill treated because of his faith. He speaks of one, thus: “Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil: the Lord reward him according to his works: of whom be thou ware also; for he hath withstood our words.” (2 Timothy 4:15) When people learn what true Christianity is they will beware of all such men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The firebrands of hate and persecution that swept the North American continent during 1918 can properly be laid at the doors of the apostate clergy; and these, waiting for the chance to pounce upon the defenseless Bible Students, seized their opportunity when this one man Gordon, alias Connor, opened the way. This was made possible from the fact that the British Government (Church of England) had honeycombed both Canada and the United States with a gigantic police force known as the Council of Defense.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">While Bible Students are perfectly willing that “the Lord reward him according to his works”, yet it would seem certain that some visible retributive punishments should be meted out; and this may be manifested by a general disregard for the clergy as a class.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;But atm, wherever Hie atops they led, - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Hava ye founded your thrones and eltara, then.</span></p>

<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">I</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">N MY last lecture here, I submitted the Scriptural proof that God created man perfect;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">’:at in His due time God will restore the obedient ones of </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">mankin</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">d to that original perfection. It therefore becomes of vital interest to know where the home of the perfect man will be. It is manifest that in order to be in harmony with his perfect organism, a perfect man would need a perfect home, that which is pleasing to the eye and a joy to the soul.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">It is true that the Scriptures show that a few of the human race, because of faithfulness during the Gospel Age, will be changed at the first resurrection from human to spirit beings. The Scriptures definitely show that these will be a very small number. It seems strange, then, that intelligent men, who claim to be teachers of the Bible, have so long held before the people the thought that the only hope of salvation is to go to heaven; and that all those who do not find eternal life in heaven must be eternally tormented in some place beneath the earth. These have passed by entirely the great array of scriptures that show that the habitation of mankind in general will be on the earth. Bearing upon this point it is of very great importance to know what kind of home Adam, the perfect man created by God, had and possessed. It would be reasonable to expect that the Creator would provide that perfect man a home in harmony with his perfection. The Scriptures leave no doubt as to this, but clearly state:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;And the Lord God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there ha put the man whom he had formed. And out of the ground made the Lord God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil. And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became into four heads. The name of the first is Pison: that is it which compasseth the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold; and the gold of that land is good: there is bdellium and the onyx stone. And the name of the second river is Gihon; the same is it that compasseth the whole land of Ethiopia. And the name of the third river is Hiddekel: that is ibwhich goeth toward the east of Assyria. And the fourth river is Euphrates.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">And the Lord God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden, to dress it, and to keep it And the Lord God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat: but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.”—Genesis 2: 8-17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Meaung of Noma Significant</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">E</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">VERY name Jehovah gives to a place has a deep significance. The word &quot;Eden&quot; means a garden, pleasant, delicate, a place of pleasure and delight Eden, in fact, was the finished part of the earth and the only finished part When God pronounced the curse upon man He said to him concerning the remainder of the earth: &quot;Cursed is the ground for thy sake.” This word here rendered &quot;cursed&quot; means unfinished. God left the rest of the earth unfinished so that man would have employment, and this has been a great blessing to mankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Since God had finished Eden, the proof is clear that Eden was perfectly beautiful beyond the description of human words, because all ths creation of God is perfect, and so His Word declares. (Deuteronomy 32:4) We can think of the most beautiful spot on earth that man's eye in modern times has yet beheld, and know that Eden was even more beautiful than that The word &quot;Eden” means a paradise; and the word used by our Lord when He said to the thief, 'Thou shalt be in paradise,’ means Eden, the garden of the Lord. The clergy have long told us, therefore, that Eden or Paradise is in heaven; yet they have not had any scripture upon which to base this conclusion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Location of Eden &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">W</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">HERE then was the original garden o.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Eden? A careful examination of the Scriptures leaves little doubt as to its location. The Scriptures are definite that Eden was in the vicinity of the head of the River Euphrates. The River Euphrates flows from the mountainous district of Amenia into the Persian Gulf, and is made up of four tributaries. It rises in the vivinity of Mt. Ararat, which mountain was on the eastern border of Eden, as the Scriptures clearly indicate. There is nothing to warrant the conclusion that Eden was in a plain; but the proof is overwhelming that it was in the valley, surrounded by high mountains, and that it was accessible only from the east. (Genesis 3:24) Take a map, and look at the vicinity of the Persian Gulf, in the present land of Armenia, in the mountainous section, and you have approximately the location of the garden of Eden, the cradle of the human race.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">When God began the execution of His judgment against Adam and Eve, He drove them out of Eden, so that they could not have access to the tree of life; and He set cherubim and a flaming sword turning in every direction to keep them away from Eden.—Genesis 3:24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Beyond all question of doubt Eden, the garden of the Lord, was on earth. Therefore the question is settled beyond a doubt that if Paradise is restored it will be on earth. Eden was made for man, and man was placed therein. Eden was Paradise. Man is of the earth, earthy. This is definitely stated in the Scriptures. (1 Corinthians 15:47) Man is not spirit; therefore he could not inhabit a spiritual realm. When the few of the human race who are to be changed to spirit nature are changed from human to spirit beings, then they will be in the spirit realm. The Lord plainly says in His Word, through the prophet Isaiah: “I have made the earth, and created man upon it. I, even my hands, have stretched out the heavens, and all their host have I commanded.... God himself that formed the earth and made it; he hath established it, he created it not in vain, he formed it to be inhabited.”—Isaiah 45:12,18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The earth was never cursed. It did not sin; therefore there was no occasion to curse it. The earth was left unfinished outside of Eden, Eden alone being a sample of what God would make the whole earth when it is brought up to the standard which it shall be. It has been a blessed thing for imperfect man, however, to have something to do and to put forth an effort to beautify the earth. This he has done, to his pleasure and profit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Restoration of Paradiu World-wide</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">I</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">T IS here interesting now to notice scriptures which prove that God purposes to make the earth beautiful beyond the description of human words, a Paradise <sup>f</sup>or perfect man. His prophet wrote: &quot;The earth is the Lord's, and the fulness </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">thereof.<sup>n</sup></span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> (Psalm 24:1) Then what God intends to do for man concerning the earth is indicated by the same prophet, who wrote: “What man is he that feareth the Lord? </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">hint </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">shall he teach in the way that he shall choose. His soul shall dwell at ease; and his seed shall inherit the earth.” (Psalm 25:12,13) That the earth </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">is intended only for</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> those who are obedient to God and that those who are evil doers shall be cut off, is definitely shown by the scriptures which read: “For evil doers shall be cut </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">off:</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> but those that wait upon the Lord, they shall inherit the earth”; “But the meek shall inherit the earth, and shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace”; “For such as be blessed of him shall inherit the earth; and they that be cursed of him shall be cut off.” (Psalm ' 37:9,11,22) Then the Prophet shows that those who try to do right during the time of stress, such as the world is now passing through, will have special favors, when he says: “Blessed is he that considereth the poor: the Lord will deliver him in the time of trouble. The Lord will preserve him, and keep him alive; and he shall be blessed upon the earth; and thou wilt not deliver him unto the will of his enemies.”— Psalm 41:1,2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Heretofore I have pointed out from the Scriptures how that faithful men of Israel who proved loyal to the Lord would be the rulers on the earth; as we read: “Instead of thy fathers shall be thy children, whom thoumayest make princes in all the earth.” (Psalm 45:16) As the human race begins to be restored, before the millions of dead return to the earth, it will be necessary for some space to be cultivated on earth, to be made productive; and God has promised that it shall be thus: “Then shall the earth yield her increase; and God, even our own God, shall bless us.”—PSalm 67:6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Toil to Vanish with Restoration</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">M</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">ANKIND has always been required to toil with thorns and thistles, and to overcome many difficulties in order to produce his food. But it will not be thus when restoration is well under way; for, says the Prophet: “The wilderness, and the solitary places, shall be glad for them; and the desert shall rejoice, and blossom as the rose. It shall blossom abundantly, and rejoice even with joy and singing; the glory of</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Tia QOT AQE</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">hurt nor destroy in all my holy kingdom: for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea.” (Isaiah 11: 9) Looking to that happy time the same Prophet writes: “The whole earth is at rest, and is quiet: they break forth into singing.” (Isaiah 14:7) This same Prophet refers to the earth as God’s footstool, saying, “Thus saith the Lord, The heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool.”—Isaiah 66 :L</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Then through His same prophet God says, concerning the earth: “The glory of Lebanon shall come unto thee, the fir tree, the pine tree, and the box together, to beautify the place of my sanctuary; and I will make the place of my feet glorious.” (Isaiah 60:13) This glorious place shall be man’s habitation. It shall be his inheritance, which God has provided for man, and which He will grant those who are teachable an£ obedient. It was Jesus who said: “Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.*</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The major portion of the earth’s surface today lies a desert waste, untilled. Jehovah, speaking through His prophet as to the restoration during the reign of Christ, says: “Thus saith the Lord God, In the day that I shall have cleansed you from all your iniquities, I will also cause you to dwell in the cities, and the wastes shall be builded. And the desolate land shall be tilled, whereas it lay desolate in the sight of all that passed by. And they shall say, This land-that was desolate is become like the garden of Eden; and the waste, and desolate, and ruined cities, are become fenced, and are inhabited.” —Ezekiel 36:33-35.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Jesus said to the dying thief: “Today I say to thee, Thou shalt be with me in paradise.” Jesus is the great invisible King, and will rule the earth through His faithful representatives, the faithful worthies of old. Seeing now that the earth is to be made an Edenic Paradise, and that the dead will be resurrected and given a trial for life and the obedient ones restored, ~ - that man is to have a perfect government and dwell in peace and happiness, now we can ap^ preciate the words of Jesus when He said to the thief: “Thou shalt be with me in paradise.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Eden May Be Preeerved</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">I</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">T MAY not be out of place to ask: What became of the garden of EdenT Scriptural proof is that it was surrounded by very high</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Lebanon shall be given unto it, the excellency of Camel and Sharon; they shall see the glory of the Lord, and the excellency of our God. Then shall the lame man leap as an hart, and the tongue of the dumb sing: for in the wilderness shall waters break out, and streams in the desert. And the parched ground shall become a pool, and the thirsty land springs of water: in the habitations of dragons, where each lay, shall be grass, with reeds and rushes.”—Isaiah 35:1,2,6,7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">“For ye shall go out with joy, and be led forth with peace: the mountains and the hills shall break forth before you into singing, and all the trees of the field shall clap their hands. Instead of the thorn shall come up the fir tree, and instead of the brier shall come up the myrtle tree: and it shall be to the Lord for a name, for an everlasting sign that shall not be cut off.”— Isaiah 55:12,13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">One who has visited the Imperial Valley of Southern California can have some small conception of what the fulfilment of these scriptures means. Less than a quarter of a century ago the Imperial Valley was a desert waste. Not even a coyote could cross its parched sands and live. There was no living creature in it, aside from horned toads. The Colorado river was turned out of its course and irrigation ditches sent the waters through the Valley; and .today the valley is doubtless the most productive part of the earth’s surface, yielding its increase more wonderfully than any other land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Man and Hit Home Made Beautiful</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">I</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">N God’s own due time He will make it not only possible but certain that the vast desert wastes of Africa and other parts of the earth shall blossom aa the rose, and shall yield an abundance for the benefit of man. As the earth continues to increase in beauty, and as the people are restored to health and happiness, they will bless the name of the Lord, as the prophet says: “And blessed be his glorious name for ever: and let the whole earth be filled with his glory.” (Psalm 72:19) The people will increase in knowledge concerning the Lord, and His glory Will shine out in all the earth; because man being restored, and his home being made beautiful, shall be a reflection of the goodness of God, and peace and joy shall reign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The Prophet thus puts it: “They shall not</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">mountains, that it was accessible only from the east, that it is and was in the vicinity of Mount Ararat, and that Mount Ararat was the site upon which Noah’s ark landed, and which has since been hidden under perpetual snow. It does not seem reasonable that the Lord would have-destroyed Eden; but it seems more reasonable that the Lord would have preserved it so that in His due time He will exhibit it to man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Through His prophet Job God said: “Hast thou entered into the treasures of the snow!” (Job 38:22) Doubtless Eden is one of the treasures of the snow preserved by<sup>1</sup> the Lord in perpetual snow and ice. The inspired writer of the Scriptures declares that with the second presence of the Lord He will bring to light the hidden things of darkness. (1 Corinthians 4:5) The Lord Jesus himself said: “For nothing is secret that shall not be made manifest; neither anything hid that </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">shall</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> not be known.”—Luke 8:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">In the light of these scriptures it is reasonable for us to conclude that when God has restored man and brought the earth to an Edenic paradise, and all wickedness is eliminated, and everything in the earth is in harmony with God, then He will unseal the secret treasures of the snow and exhibit to restored man his original perfect home. Amongst those restored, who shall behold the glories and beauties thereof, will be Adam. And the whole earth then will be likened to the garden of Eden. Eden shall be the joy of man, and all the people in the earth will be joyful and happy. Then mankind will appreciate the love of God, and will sing the praises of Jehovah and His beloved Son, Christ Jesus. This song of praise, wafted on the breezes, will be caught up by the angels, and the other heavenly creatures, until every creature in heaven and in earth' and even the very elements of the earth shall be singing the <sub>f </sub>Hallelujah chorus to the glory of God. Then will be fully realized the goodness of God, and the creatures shall be saying, “Great and marvellous are thy works, Lord God Almighty; just and true are thy ways, thou King of saints.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">A restored race, a restored home, with peace and joy and endless happiness filling every heart; with their loved ones with them; with ne fear of ever being separated again; with everything in the earth being to the Lord’s glory, earth then will indeed be a paradise, a fit place for perfect man to dwell in complete harmony with God- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">With </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">!mm</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> Nuaber 80 we began running Judge Rutherford's new book, “The Harp </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">at</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> God”, with accompanying queaUona, taking the place of both Advanced and Juvenile Bible Btndtaa which have bean hitherto published.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">“•The apostle Paul declares that he was made a minister, according to the gift of God, that he should preach to the nations the unsearchable riches of Christ, “and to make all see what is the fellowship of the mystery, which from the beg</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">inning</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> of the world hath been hid in God, who created all things by Jesus Christ: to the intent that now unto, the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be [made] known by the church the manifold wisdom of God, according to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord.” (Ephesians 3:7-11) Thus we see that this great mystery is the Christ, and that for six thousand years Jehovah has been preparing for, developing and completing this great mystery; and that when completed, He will use the Christ as His prophet, priest, and king to minister unto the people, to rule over the people, and to bless the people, according to His promise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">“•The Apostle declares that the whole creation is groaning and travailing in pain, waiting for the manifestation of this great mystery. (Bomans 8:19-22) The people do not know for what they are waiting. But when the great mystery is complete and Messiah’s kingdom set up, then God will bring His long-promised blessings to mankind, and ultimately His will shall be done upon earth as it is done in heaven.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">“’Suppose your dearest friend and benefactor is away on a long journey and you expect him to return, because when he went away he promised to come again; suppose that since that time you have been looking, hoping and praying for his return, and that you were informed that he had arrived Such news would fill your very soul with joy and you could not keep from singing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">“•A friend is one who loves you all the time; one who even without your knowing it makes a great sacrifice in order that you might be the recipient of some real good. The greatest friend that you have had, or any one else has had, is the Lord Jesus; for He left all of His riches and glory, became a man, and laid down His life in ignominious death in order that all men might have one fair and full opportunity for the blessings of life everlasting.—John 15:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">“&quot;The facts show that nineteen hundred yean ago, Jesus went away on a long journey, even into heaven itself; that when He went away He promised His disciples that He would return and that, when returning, those who loved His appearing would receive many precious gifts. If the facts show that this precious Friend has returned and we begin to see that all the fond hopes of Christians are about to be realised and that even the world is soon to be blessed, what unspeakable joy this brings! Those who have watched and waited for His coming </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:line-through;">no</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">eee sarily break forth in singing the praises of the Lord.

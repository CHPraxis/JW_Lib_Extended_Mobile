<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">THIS JOURNAL AND ITS SACRED MISSION</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">T</span><span class="font9">HIS Journal !s one of the prime factors or instruments in the system of Bible instruction, or “Seminary Extension”, now being presented in all parts of the civilized world by the </span><span class="font11" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society,</span><span class="font9"> chartered A. D. 1884, “For the Promotion of Christian Knowledge”. It not only serves as a class room where Bible students may meet in the study of the divine Word but also as a channel of communication through which they may be reached with announcements of the Society’s conventions and Of the coming of its traveling representatives, styled “Pilgrims”, and refreshed with reports of its conventions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Our “Berean Lessons” are topical rehearsals or reviews of our Society’s published </span><span class="font11" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Studies</span><span class="font9"> most entertainingly arranged, and very helpful to all who w’ould merit the only honorary degree which the Society accords, viz., </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Verbi Dei Minister</span><span class="font9"> (V. I&gt;. M.), which translated Into English is </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Minister of God’s Word.</span><span class="font9"> Our treatment of the International Sunday School Lessons is specially for the older Bible students and teachers. By some this feature is considered indispensable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">This journal stands firmly for the defense of the only true foundation of the Christian’s hope now being so generally repudiated —redemption through the precious blood of “the man Christ Jesus, who gave himself a </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">ransom,</span><span class="font9"> [a corresponding price, a substitute] for all”. (1 Peter 1:19; 1 Timothy 2 : 6) Building up on this sure foundation the gold, silver and precious stones (1 Corinthians 3: Ills; 2 Peter 1:5-11) of the Ward of God, its further mission is to “make all see what is the fellowship of the mystery which. . .has been hid in God, ... to the intent that now might be made known by the church the manifold wisdom of God”—“which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men as it is now revealed”.—Ephesians 3 : 5-9,10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It stands free from all parties, sects and creeds of men, while it seeks more and more to bring its every utterance into fullest Gubjectien to the will of God in Christ, as expressed in the holy Scriptures. It is thus free to declare boldly whatsoever the Lord hath spoken—according to the divine’wisdom granted unto us to understand his utterances. Its attitude is not dogmatic, but confident; for we know whereof we affirm, treading with implicit faith upon the sure promises of God. It is held as a trust, to be used only in hi$ service; hence our decisions relative to what may and what may not appear in its columns must be according to our judgment of hia good pleasure, the teaching of his Word, for the upbuilding of his people in grace and knowledge. And we not only invite but urge oui; readers to prove all its utterances by the infallible Word to which reference is constantly made to facilitate such testing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">TO US THE SCRIPTURES CLEARLY TEACH</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">That the church is “the temple of the living God”, peculiarly “his workmanship” ; that its construction has been in progress throughout the gospel age—ever since Christ became the world’s Redeemer and the Chief Corner Stone of his temple, through which, uneu finished, God’s blessing shall come “to all people”, and they find access to him.—1 Corinthians 3:16, 17; Ephesians 2:20-22; Genesis 28:14; Galatians 3:29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">That meantime the chiseling, shaping, and polishing of consecrated believers in Christ's atonement for sin, progresses; and when the last of these “living stones”, “elect and precious,” shall have been made ready, the great Master Workman will bring all together in the. first resurrection; and the temple shall be filled with his glory, and be the meeting place between God and men throughout; the Millennium.—Revelation 15 : 5-8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">That the basis of hope, for the church and the world, lies in the fact that “Jesus Christ, by the grace of God, tasted death for </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">every </span><span class="font9">man,” “a ransom for all,” and will be “the true light which lighteth </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">every man that cometh into the world”,</span><span class="font9"> “in doe time”.—. Hebrews 2:9; John 1: 9; 1 Timothy 2:5, 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">That the hope of the church is that she may be like her Lord, “see him as he is,” be “partakers of the divine nature’,’ and share his glory as his joint-heir.—1 John 3:2; John 17:24; Romans 8:17; 2 Peter 1:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">That tl\e present mission of the church is the perfecting of the saints for the future work of service; to develop in herself every grace ; to be God’s witness to the world ; and io prepare to be kings and prie&amp;ts in the next age.—Ephesians 4:12: Matthew 24; 14 ; Revelation 1:6; 20 : 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">That the hope for the world lies in the blessings of knowledge and opportunity to be brought to </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font9"> by Christ’s Millennial kingdom, the restitution of all that was lost in Adam, to all the willing and obedient, at the hands of their Redeemer and his glorified church, when all the wilfully wicked will be </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">destroyed.—</span><span class="font9">Acts 3:19-23; Isaiah 35.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">CHANGING SECRETARIES</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Classes are requested not to change Secretaries at election time, unless such change should be necessary. If a change is made, the Pilgrim Department should be notified promptly. Change of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">address</span><span class="font11"> of the Secretary should also be reported to the Pilgrim Department without delay. Mail is frequently delayed because of failure to inform us of change of Secretaries and their addresses. Where this is possible, it is desirable that a Brother living in the city act as Secretary, not someone who has a rural address.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font14"><a name="bookmark11"></a>ANNUAL REPORT FOR 1924</span></h3>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;And in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom shall not be left to other people, but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever.&quot; “The kingdom of heaven is at hand.&quot;—DanielS: JfJ/.; Matthew 10:7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">T</span><span class="font12">HE proof seems clear that the God of heaven is majestically moving forward in the work of establishing his kingdom; that we are now in the time of the fulfilment of the words of the prophet Daniel, as above stated. No one will have anything to do with the work of setting up that kingdom except those who are in harmony with God. Each one who possesses ability (by that meaning a measure of the holy spirit) will have a portion to do with the kingdom according to his ability. It is certain that the part of those who have to do with it at all is to preach that the kingdom of heaven is at hand! They bring no profit to Jehovah nor the Lord Jesus; but these are witnesses that Jehovah is God, that Jesus is King, that the kingdom is here. To give this testimony to the peoples of earth is a divinely-given privilege and duty to those who are in full harmony with the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">This Society, serving as a servant of the Lord, has been trying during the fiscal year ending 1924 to perform its privileges and duties in the proclamation of the message of the kingdom. Modestly, then, we claim to be participating in the establishment of the kingdom to that extent. We count this the greatest privilege that could be granted to any creature. Those who appreciate this privilege have entered into the joy of the Lord and realize that the joy of the Lord is their strength.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">While neither the law of the land nor the charter of the Society requires an annual report to be made, it is the privilege of the President of the Society to make such report to other brethren on the earth concerning the work done during the year. No one on earth has done anything great in the name of the Lord, but the work that the Lord has accomplished through his people is marvelous in our eyes. Particularly is this true when we take into consideration that only a handful of people has been engaged in the work. Some who have failed to use their talents have had the same removed and given to others. The work has gone grandly on, to the glory of the King. All glory and honor is due the heavenly Father and our Lord Jesus; and when we take a retrospective view of what has been accomplished during the past year we mark increased evidences that the kingdom of the Lord is being established.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">During the year the enemy has not been idle, but has diligently pressed the fight against the people of God. This is to be expected; and happy is the lot of those who are permitted thus to share in the sufferings of Christ Jesus our Plead. These recognize that tribulation develops patience, broadens our experience, and brightens our hopes. Through all the experiences the Lord has been the stay and shield and protection of his people. Truly he has brought his church into a large place and delivered the faithful ones, because he delighted in them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">At the end of this fiscal year we can truly say, with David: “Thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle.” (Psalm 18: 39) The year has been one of great encouragement, because we have observed the hand of the Lord in the work of the Society. His truly consecrated ones, all of whom jointly compose the Society, have been joyfully giving a witness. The mass of matter to consider in the yearly work makes it impossible to give a full and detailed report herein. The report therefore contains only the salient features that prominently appear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">ORGANIZATION</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Proper organization is absolutely essential to success in any work. Especially is this true concerning the kingdom work. The Scriptures plainly show that all of the work done that is approved by the Lord must be done orderly. He is not a God of confusion, but a God of order. Every one in the Lord’s organization is expected to work as opportunity is afforded. He </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">it </span><span class="font12">not to be slothful in business, but fervent in spirit in the Lord’s service. Jesus declared: “My Father work-</span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">eth hitherto, </span><span class="font12">and I work.” (Jolin 5:1?) All who are pleasing to the Lord, therefore, must work, as he gives them opportunity. To the end that his work on earth might be accomplished in harmony with the Lord’s will, effort has been made to organize and conduct the same on the plan of efficiency. Of course it is never so efficient but that improvement can be made.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font12">355</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font12">The main office of the Society, from which the work generally is directed, is situated at 124 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn, New York. The operative offices of the American activities are at 18 Concord Street, Brooklyn, with a number of branch offices under their respective managers situated in various parts of the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">It is the duty of the executive office at Brooklyn to handle all the official correspondence from all the branch offices, and to have general supervision over the finances and to direct the expending of the same in the various countries of earth, and to keep in close touch with the work in America as well as the foreign branches, as well as to exercise a general supervisory control over the same. There is a close sympathetic relationship between the home office and the branch offices, and the Lord is directing it all. It is rather difficult for one to have in mind the scope of the work by a mere casual consideration of what is being done. The suggestion is made that while considering the facts set forth in this report the reader take a map of the world and refer to it in connection with the reports from the various countries. In giving this report we will set it forth under the heading of the name of the respective branch offices. Some of these offices manage the work of several languages in several countries, as will be observed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">BROOKLYN</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">From the Brooklyn office the Society’s work within the United States is conducted in the English language; and in addition thereto departments in foreign tongues are maintained, and the work is directed under one general manager.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">For several months in advance the work is mapped out, and endeavor is made for each department to move exactly on time and in harmony, so as to enable the greatest results to be obtained for the effort put forth. In the performance of our part in announcing the kingdom, the work consists chiefly in bringing to the people a knowledge of the Lord’s plan. To accomplish this, books and literature must be produced and placed </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font12">their hands at the lowest possible cost.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">FACTORY</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">During the year it was found that the space for manufacturing our books and printing other literature was inadequate. To facilitate the work we took over the entire floor space of the building occupied, and now </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">occupy the </span><span class="font12">basement, in which are installed the large printing presses, and six floors above that, one of which is used for the office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The production of the printing plant at 18 Concord Street during the year was as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Volumes of bound books and booklets ....... &nbsp;3,582,295</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Watch Tower, number of copies printed.. 1,092.000</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Goi.uen Age, number of copies printed .... 1,816.900 “Proclamation” (Los Angeles, 1923) ________________ 13.478.409</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Handbills printed for classes .............................. I,0i0,300</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Handbills in foreign languages ............. &nbsp;&nbsp;698.900</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In addition to the presses employed at 18 Concord Street by the Society, we installed printing presses at the following points: St. Louis, Chicago, and Oakla.nl, California. These have printed handbills for the classes since being installed, as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">St. Louis ............. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;992.009</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Chicago __________________________________________________________________________ 553.00.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Oakland ________________________________________________________________________ 300.000</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The production shows a decided increase over that of 1923. The total amount of pieces of literature, books, booklets, tracts, etc., printed during the year from Brooklyn was 24,482, 895.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">DISPOSITION OF BOOKS</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The publications produced in bound volumes and sent out from this office to classes, colporteurs and branches, including Studies in the Scriptures, Scenarios, “The Harp of God,” etc., during the year, totals 985,811 volumes, in the English language alone. Booklets produced and shipped out during the same period, 1,294,085; Watch Tower Reprints, 2,223 sets. Added to this is “The Way to Paradise”, 40,781 volumes. This- does not include, of course, the “Indictment'” printed immediately following the end of the fiscal year, which will appear in the next report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The “Proclamations” from the Los Angeles Convention were printed and distributed throughout the earth to the total of about fifty million copies in various languages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">FIELD WORKERS</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">During the year there have not been so many workers in the field as last year, even though a greater work has been accomplished. This indicates that the Lord’s work must go grandly on; and if some find it necessary to slack their hand, or if others, because of indifference, turn aside, the Lord will increase the ability of those who are willing to work, that the work may go forward. During the year 1923 there was a weekly average of </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">1? </span><span class="font12">90 workers in the field service. During the year 1921 there was a weekly average of 1064 workers in the field.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The colporteurs are really the ones that bear the burden of the battle. The Lord has added his blessing. During the year the colporteurs and auxiliary colporteurs sold 7,394 more sets of Studies in the Scrip-Tt'KES than did all of the organized classes in the country. The following shows the comparative sales:</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Classes, sets of Studies in the Scriptures............32,195</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Isolated colporteurs, sets of Studies —---------------12,787</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">Auxiliary colporteurs, sets of Studies .—............... 2,581</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Driving the year the combined sales of English and foreign language books disposed of from this office were as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Studies in the Scejitubes, Scenarios, etc----------627.685</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“The Harp of God'’ ................ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. ..556,218</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">Grand Total.................. &nbsp;2,774.923</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The number of persons who engaged in the work at Brooklyn headquarters during the year 1924 has averaged 110.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">FOREIGN LANGUAGES</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In addition to the English work carried on at the Brooklyn headquarters is that conducted in the following foreign languages: Arabic, Armenian. French. German, Greek, Hungarian, Italian, Lithuanian, Polish, Ru-’sian, and Ukrainian. In addition to the languages last above mentioned, this office prints books and literature in the following languages: Bohemian, Croatian, Hawaiian, Japanese, Lettish, Roumanian, Spanish, and Yiddish</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">CONVENTIONS</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">During the fiscal year fifteen well-advertised conventions of English-speaking people were held in the United States. The general convention was held at Columbus, Ohio, which has heretofore been reported in The Watch Tower. These conventions have served as a great stimulus to the brethren everywhere and in binding closer together the hearts of those who are engaged in the service of the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">WORLD-WIDE WITNESS</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The Society during the year has pursued the policy of setting certain dates for world-wide witnessing, on which dates the classes in every part of the earth, in all languages, were asked to arrange for public meetings. This has been done with splendid success, and has had much to do with getting a knowledge of the divine plan into the minds of the people. The fact that the brethren at the same time all over the earth are speaking on the same subject is encouraging to them, and gives a wider advertisement of the kingdom message. The Lord’s blessing has been upon, this; and we believe it to be the Lord’s will that we continue in the same way of acting on the same day in regard to the same matter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">For each one of these public meetings the sub-title at least has been, “Millions Now Living Will Never Die.” This has become a sort of “trade mark” of </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font12">Bible Students; and all over the earth the people know that the Bible Students are the ones who proclaim this message.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">PILGRIM SERVICE</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">The </span><span class="font12">Pilgrim brethren have faithfully pursued </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">their </span><span class="font12">work, looking after the interests of the kingdom committed to their hands. The Pilgrim work in the United States, directed from the Brooklyn office, has been participated in during the year by 102 English-speaking brethren. The general attendance at the regularly advertised public meetings has increased during </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font12">year. There have not been quite so many meetings held ;■&lt; during the year before, but this has been offset by the number of lectures broadcast by radio. In addition to the public witness, the Pilgrims have made regular visits to the classes to encourage them and to build them up on their most holy faith. A detailed statement of the Pilgrim work follows:</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">Total number of miles traveled ....... &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;252,862</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">PUBLIC WITNESS</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The public witness in the United States has been well maintained throughout the year. The classes everywhere have done nobly in this regard. At great expense to themselves they have procured halls, extensively advertised meetings, and thus proclaimed the message of the kingdom. On the reverse side of many </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font12">the handbills has been printed a brief tract which, in itself, has been a large witness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In view of the fact that the classes spent so much money for the local witness, their contributions to the Society’s main office were necessarily reduced.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">FINANCIAL</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">We acknowledge with profound gratitude and </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">thanks</span><span class="font12">giving the manner in which the Lord has looked </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">after </span><span class="font12">his work this year from the financial viewpoint. Being enabled to produce our own books, we have also been able to sell them at a greatly reduced price, for much less than they would have been sold otherwise; and it has been the endeavor as nearly as possible to make the sale of these books cover the expense of manufacture, etc., leaving a wider field for the use of contributions, particularly in foreign lands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">During the year the Society has expended in the foreign field cash to the amount of $118,321.10. In addition thereto a large number of books has been furnished to the foreign offices. Thus we see that the American brethren have been greatly privileged to help stricken Europe and other parts of the earth in giving </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font12">witness to those who could not otherwise have it. We share their joy. In fact, our joy is double because </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">we </span><span class="font12">have been permitted to help to bless them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The brethren have been liberal with their contributions to the “Good Hopes” fund. These have been small, as individual amounts, but have mounted up when all were added together. Appended hereto is a summary of the financial statement prepared and filed by the Treasurer of the Society, as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">RECEIPTS</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">To balance from 1923---------------------------------$ 1,624.47</span></p>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">CORRESPONDENCE</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">During </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font12">year letters and cards to the number </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font12">199,218 have been received, and 277,259 dispatched.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">RADIO</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">It is with much pleasure that we can now announce </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">that </span><span class="font12">the Society owns and maintains a radio broadcasting station, situated on Staten Island, New York, and designated by the Government as Station WBBR, our name for it being “Watchtower”. This station has been in operation since February 24, 1924.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">It has been suggested by some of the brethren that it </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">is </span><span class="font12">exceedingly interesting to note that the first time the public discourse “Millions Now Living Will Never </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Die” </span><span class="font12">was delivered was at Los Angeles, California, February 24, 1918. Six years later, to a day, February </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">24, </span><span class="font12">1921, the “Watchtower” radio station put on its initial program. We feel that the Lord’s hand is clearly </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font12">this matter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Reports that come frequently from far away distances show that many are hearing the message of truth. We have good reports from Maine and Canadian points on the northeast, and from Wisconsin, Michigan, Illinois, Missouri, on the northwest and west, and clear to the southern border of the United States, the station having been heard on the Pacific coast. Quite </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font12">large number of books has been placed by reason of the station.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">It is impossible to tell how many hear, but it is certain that within a radius of one hundred miles of the station there were a year ago, according to report, 500,000 receiving sets. This number must be greatly increased by this time. The possibility of the size of the audience of a radio station is tremendous. It is hoped that by the permission of the Government we can soon use greater power and greatly improve the efficiency of this radio station.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Another station is now in course of construction at Chicago, and we hope soon to have it in operation. The Lord will see to it that the message of the kingdom goes to the people in his own good way and in his own due time. We believe that the radio is the most economical and effective way of spreading the message of the truth that has yet been used. It is suggested that even though the numbers engaging in the service may greatly decrease, the Lord will use the radio to spread the message just the same. We should learn this lesson that nothing can interfere with the message of the kingdom; and that if one neglects his privileges to give the witness in the way the Lord has granted him the opportunity, he may expect that opportunity to be removed and the Lord to use some other way to put the message out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The Society has urged upon the brethren activity in the service, knowing that this is not for the benefit of the Lord, but for the benefit of the brethren themselves. The privilege of engaging in the service cannot be overestimated. We hope the brethren everywhere will be stimulated to increased activity to their own joy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">It is noted that only those who are actively engaged in the service according to opportunity are really rejoicing in the Lord. It is a fulfilment of the Lord's Word: “The joy of the Lord is your strength.”—Nehemiah 8:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">If the Lord sees fit to build other radio stations for the spreading of the truth, he will provide the money in his own good way. It will be our privilege to participate in building these stations and spreading the message as he opens the door of opportunity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">LONDON, ENGLAND</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">From the London office the work is carried on throughout England, Scotland, Ireland, and Wales. The results for the fiscal year are gratifying indeed. With pleasure we quote from the local manager’s report, as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“I have the honor to give you the British Branch report of the actixities in this part of the field. The report is good in that it is the b*-st we have been able to send from London. Last year's figures are increased in respact to sales to the extent of more than 100,000 books; and what is satisfactory and encouraging is that the increase is nearly all in the larger books, the Studies, and ‘The Harp of God.’ The larger sale of the Studies is made possible by reason of the lowering of the price to the public, which in turn, is made possible by the fact that you supply these at a much lower cost than we could produce them here. The brethren have been much heartened as they have been enabled to place so many sets of eight volumes in the hands of the people. The newer, smaller booklets, ‘World Distress’ and ‘A Desirable Government,’ have been very acceptable to the workers as also to the public. The sales still keep up, and we are confidently looking for a great increase during the coming year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-variant:small-caps;">“Service. The service work is, of course, doing by far the greatest part in the output of the books. There is as yet no limit to the possible service; for experience here proves the same as in other places, namely, that territory can be gone over again and again with an increase of sales. There are still some classes who have not wakened up to the fact that the Lord has privileged those who know the truth to be his messengers, his heralds of the kingdom and of his presence. There are now 322 Classi's on our list, but there are only 260 who have undertaken this service for the Lord. We wonder why they do not rouse themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-variant:small-caps;">“Colpobteub. The colporteur work keeps steadily on. There is always a wide field for this service; and now that the books are so cheap, and the noise of the witness is going abroad and people are beginning to realize that the I. B. S. A. people are the only ones with a message, the work of canvassing is not nearly so difficult as it was when the work was unknown and when there was but little need beyond that of clearing away theological difficulties. The cry is still, ‘The harvest is great, but the laborers are few.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“Brother Rutherford’s visit to Britain, with the accompanying conventions and public meetings, was the outstanding feature of the year. Without doubt the brethren were stimulated in an uncommon measure by that visit, and the good results were immediate and permanent. Perhaps the next noticeable feature was the convention recently held in Glasgow, certainly the best attended there. It was with great spirit the convention congregation adopted the Columbus resolution. The Lord is surely amongst his people here also.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“I have never known the British friends to be so united or in such good heart in their purpose to serve the Lord. ‘The Harp’ is a wonderful help to the work. Owing chiefly to it we have paid our way during the year.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">A summary of the output of literature by the British Branch during the year is as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Studies in the Scbiptubes.................... 86.251</span></p>

<p><a href="#bookmark26"><span class="font11">Auxiliary colporteurs </span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark27"><span class="font11">Classes engaged in service work........</span></a></p>
<p><span class="font12">An analysis of the reports shows that the colporteurs have done the major portion of the work in placing the books in the hands of the people. Great is their privilege. Surely the Lord loves them greatly. The colporteurs should be much encouraged to press </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">on in the </span><span class="font12">work the Lord has given them to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">CANADA</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The Canadian branch of the Society is situated </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">at </span><span class="font12">Toronto. The territory embraced within the management of this office includes all the provinces of Canada and Newfoundland. There is also directed from thia office, in addition to the work in the English language, the French, German, Polish, and Ukrainian activities among the people of each province speaking the respective languages mentioned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">An examination of the facts relating to this branch office shows a decided increase over the work of 1923. The increase in all the books and booklets placed in the hands of the people was 271,709, which is an increase of 82.25 percent over that of the previous year. Thia is a very good criterion. When the people read they employ the best method of getting an understanding of the Lord’s kingdom into their minds. The subscription list of The Watch Tower has increased during the year to the number of 1,060 new subscribers. The free literature distributed totaled 991,971 pieces; and in addition to this, of the Los Angeles “Proclamation” there were 927,372 copies distributed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Throughout this territory during the year there were 370 more public meetings held than in the previous year; and the increased attendance was 20,781. During the year 1,547 public meetings were held, with a total attendance of 166,119. Class meetings numbered 1,868, with a total attendance of 84, </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">920.</span><span class="font12"> Seven Pilgrim brethren were regularly engaged in the service throughout Canada during the year. In addition to this there were nine auxiliary Pilgrims, to say nothing about the class elders who served other meetings. These traveling brethren covered 161,780 miles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The total number of books and other pieces of literature sold during the year was 271,709. The classes generally throughout the territory are in good spiritual condition and actively engaging in promulgating </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font12">message of the kingdom. During the year there </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">has </span><span class="font12">been an increased number of colporteurs in </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">the field, </span><span class="font12">the total being 53 actively engaged in this blessed service. These have had many hardships, but have faced their difficulties heroically and done their work with glad hearts. At times they have been reviled and persecuted, refused lodgings, found it necessary to sleep in the open; but they have met these experiences with glad hearts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Quebec is the French populated section. A number of colporteurs have been in that field during the year. Every town and city having a population of one thousand or more has been canvassed by the colporteurs, and has had free literature distributed; and in many of the places public witnesses have been given. Those opposed are complaining that their places are being turned upside down. Catholics in particular have used their power to stop the activities there. They appealed to the courts, and failed. Priests headed mobs, and assaulted the brethren with sticks. But this in no wise deterred this little army of the Lord’s followers from pressing on with the work, and the Lord has protected and blessed them. Many French-speaking people in that part of the world are awakening to the fact that the Lord has something better in store for them than what they have heard heretofore.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Work among the Germans throughout Canada has greatly increased during the year. There are now 55 German classes in Canada, having regular Pilgrim visits and service in the German language. There has been a decided increase in the amount of literature distributed amongst them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In Western Canada is a colony of Ukrainians. The Methodists appointed a committee to travel among them and make a report. This committee gave a glowing report of the large field, and recommended the publication of literature in the Ukrainian language to distribute among them. Our Society immediately profited by the suggestion, published and caused to be distributed a large number of tracts and booklets and to send brethren into the community for Pilgrim visits. There were few interested at the beginning; but at the time of this report there are 49 places requesting regular Pilgrim visits and service in the Ukrainian language.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The Polish population of Canada is probably less than 50,000, but a great interest has sprung up among these people during the past twelve months, and this interest is increasing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The increased work has necessarily increased the duties and obligations of the office force, but these have joyfully worked overtime, both in the office and in the printing department to meet the demands for the truth. Our printing equipment established at Toronto during the past year has been a great aid in preparing the message.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">It is gratifying to report that the brethren throughout Canada have a keen appreciation of their privileges of service, and are manifesting the zeal and enthusiasm peculiar to the house of the Lord. Those brethren manifest a keen appreciation of God’s arrangement in the Church, and are striving to do with their might their respective duties and to cooperate with and honor those whom the Lord honors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The report from far-away Newfoundland shows a good spiritual condition of the brethren there, most of whom are fisher folk, who are actively engaged in spreading the message of the kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Withal the Lord has greatly blessed the work in Canada during the fiscal year, for which we are grateful to him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">ZURICH, SWITZERLAND</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The office at Zurich, Switzerland, is known as the Central European Office. The general management of the work is conducted from there relating to the following countries: Switzerland, France, Belgium, Holland, Germany, Czechoslovakia, Austria, and Italy; also the Polish work in Northern France. Because of the diversified languages, each one of these countries makes regular monthly reports and more frequent specific reports to the Central European Office, which acts as a general clearing house and makes regular monthly reports to the home office at Brooklyn. This enables the machinery of the work to go more smoothly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Switzerland has a mixed population of German-speaking and French-speaking people. The German work of Switzerland is specially handled by the Zurich office, while that among the French-speaking people is handled at the Bern office. Excluding the Canton of Bern, the other portion of Switzerland has a population of about two million persons, a large percentage of whom are Catholics. In this district during the past year there has been a great increase in the sale of literature, the sale of “The Harp of God” increasing 500 percent. More than a million copies of free tracts were distributed. From the manager’s report we quote as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“The Society’s activities in this little country have been graciously blessed of God. No other part of Europe paid so liberally and willingly for the Society’s books and this notwithstanding great opposition to and persecution of the colporteurs.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">INCREASED EQUIPMENT</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Switzerland is so well located for the handling of work in Central Europe, and the demand for literature is so great, that it seemed pleasing to the Lord that the equipment for the work be greatly enlarged. Consequently the Society purchased a lot of ground immediately across the street from that on.which is situated the Society’s house and printing press in Bern; and there is now in course of construction a four-story building with full basement, 95 by 50 feet, with a tunnel under the street connecting the two buildings, and a tunnel connecting the new main building with a smaller building on the same lot. In the basement of these buildings is being installed other machinery for the printing of literature. In addition to other presses of the Society there is a large two-color rotary press; and a new two-color rotary press is about completed and ready for installation; and these two presses alone, running at full capacity, turn out an average of 16,000 copies of The Golden Age per hour.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">There are now more than fifty brethren engaged in the work at the Bern office; and as soon as the new quarters are complete, it is the purpose to increase the number to upwards of a hundred. This new building is being erected by brethren, while the money for the material is furnished by the Society. It will be a splendidly equipped plant when completed, and will furnish a tremendous amount of free literature and books for all Central Europe, particularly the countries just named. The construction of this plant and the furnishings are under the immediate supervision of the Central European Office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">BERN, SWITZERLAND</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">From Bern,Switzerland, is directed the French work among the French-speaking people of Switzerland, France, and Belgium; also the Polish work in France. The printing plant is under the direct management of the Bern office, and here are printed and manufactured the Studies in the Scriptures and other books and booklets of the Society published in the French and German languages; and in addition thereto books are published in Italian, Greek, Polish, and a number of other languages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The printing for the Central European Office and the countries under the supervision of that office is done at this plant, except a portion of the printing done in Germany at Magdeburg. The brethren in America can get some idea of the scope of the work done from the Bern office when we understand that the work there today is greater than the work in Brooklyn ten years ago.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">At the Bern printing plant is published and distributed The Golden Age in French, to which there are now approximately 45,000 subscribers, Also the publication of The Golden Age in the Polish language has been just begun. A large number of Polish people reside in Northern France, and there has been a tremendous interest in the truth there during the year. Public meetings held by Pilgrim; brethren have been well attended and a great amount of literature taken.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The French-speaking people are becoming more interested in the truth than in the past. A great many of them read The Golden Age, and buy and read the booklets and Studies in the Scriptures and other books; and the French work during the fiscal year has had a steady and healthy increase.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In the French Pilgrim service during the year 1924 there have been seven brethren regularly engaged; while ten brethren engaged in the regular colporteur work, and 1,304 in the voluntary colporteur work, which we usually call class work. There have been held 2,327 class meetings, with a total attendance </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">of 114,495, and </span><span class="font12">161 public meetings, attended by 16,585.

<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">AMSTERDAM, HOLLAND</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The Society’s branch office at Amsterdam is under the management of a local manager, and also under the supervision of the Central European Office. The Dutch have never taken particularly to the truth until within the last two years. The President of the Society addressed a large public meeting at Amsterdam in the early spring, in which great interest was shown; and during the year 5,984 books have been placed in the hands of the people, besides 1,055,000 copies of free tracts and other literature. Fourteen public meetings have been held, and 155 class meetings. Two colporteurs were regularly engaged in the work and one regular Pilgrim, who traveled 12,400 miles during the year, visiting the interested and organizing classes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">While the brethren are small in numbers here, comparatively speaking, they are exceedingly zealous. “The Harp of God” in the Dutch language is now off the press; and the brethren in Holland are just beginning an active drive, and expect shortly to place a large number of these volumes among the people. It can be truly said that there has been </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font12">splendid witness given throughout Holland during the year, far greater than at any time in the past.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">MAGDEBURG, GERMANY</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">At </span><span class="font12">Magdeburg is the headquarters of the German work, under a local manager, and this in turn under the direction of the Central European Office. There has been a tremendous increase in the work in Germany during the past twelve mow ths. The year 1923 showed a great increase, but 1924 shows even a greater. It was at the end of the year 1923 that the Magdeburg office was established. Since then the property has been improved, a large basement prepared for the printing presses; and in addition to the presses, binding machinery and other machines, the Society has purchased and is installing a large rotary press, which will turn out </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font12">great deal of literature, in the form of magazines, pamphlets and books.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">A convention was held at Magdeburg last spring, at which time a public meeting was held, attended by 17,000, the address being given by the President of the Society as already reported in The Watch Tower. Since then the class in Magdeburg has increased more than 300, and the increase is still continuing. From </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font12">reports submitted by the manager of the Central European Office we quote as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“In Germany the work proceeds in leaps and bounds. </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">We </span><span class="font11">had a banner year, and all hands have been busy. The Increased activity, however, has stirred up the enemy, both within and without, which has caused trouble for the Lord’s people. But this has not hindered the work. It is God’s work, and therefore the devil hates it; but he cannot interfere with it. He hates the leading brethren and causes misery for them whenever possible. Nevertheless, the work goes grandly on to God’s praise.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">From the report of the local manager of the Magdeburg office we quote the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“In sending you the annual report for Germany from October 1, 1923 to the end of September, 1924, we eall to your attention the fact that the books sold and lectures held, as reported, cover only a period of nine months, for the reason that a part of the period embraced by this annual report was the time of the greatest financial crisis in Germany. In that time there was no good selling of books, and no favorable opportunity to hold public meetings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“While the year 1923 shows a monthly sale of about 11, 000 Studies in the Scriptures, the year 1924 shows about 20,000 sold monthly. During 1923 the average monthly sale of ‘Millions’ books was 29,000. This book has been largely replaced by the ‘World Distress’ and ‘Desirable Government’ booklets in the work during 1924, which have been placed among the people to the extent of more than 110,000 copies monthly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“With each issue of The Watch Tower there has been an increase of approximately 6,000 copies; and an increase </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font11">100,000 copies for The Golden Age.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“The small number of public meetings is accounted for in the fact that the attendance at meetings for the interested increased from about 7,000, in the aggregate, tn more than 25,000; and the total attendance at meetings of newly organized classes increased from 30.000 to 38,000, as a result of the public lectures held during 1923, organization of classes and arrangement of meetings for interested friends.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“The increased sale of literature has meant an increase in the amount of work done at the Bible House in Magdeburg. For example, during the last three months of 1923 the shipping department dispatched 636 parcels, while during the first three months of 1924 4,174 parcels were dispatched. To faeiliate the quick distribution of the stock of literature, nine shipping depots have been established in as many favorably situated German cities. Often it is scarcely possible for us to keep up with the enormous amount of labor. New workers are continually coming, yet the hunger of the people is great. We ask the Lord that the year 1925 may show the same increase as in 1924.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“There are in Germany at present 462 places which are visited regularly by the Pilgrim brethren; and additionally these brethren serve classes in the German-speaking communities of Switzerland, Austria, and Czechoslovakia. Difficulties were sometimes encountered in connection with this service during the occupation of the Ruhr district by the French.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">‘ The number of brethren in the classes who engage in </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font11">service work is constantly Increasing, and with much joy the brethren go out to proclaim that the kingdom is at hand. We are very happy to have so great a part in this wonderful work. Our prayer is, that God may continue to give us that privilege, and make us more fit to glorify his name and to serve his beloved people in his wonderful work. For your help, which we have always received in generous measure, and without which it would have been impossible for us to obtain these results, we would not neglect to thank you heartily in this connection, praying that the Lord might continually bless you and all your true coworkers for the blessing of his work and people, even aS he has done hitherto.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">From a previous report by the local manager for Germany we quote the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“The work in Germany progresses wonderfully. The sale of literature, particularly ‘’The Harp of God,’ is astonishing. Editions of 100,000 books are too small. We have distributed so many copies of ‘The Harp’ that we could keep a press continually at work on printing that book and nothing else. At present we are printing on our great press a million copies of the ‘Desirable Government’ booklet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“Subscribei-s to The Golden Age at present number 175, 000, and the list is constantly increasing. We are now provided with an automobile, which aids us greatly in the work.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The trouble among the German people increases the demand for someihing to comfort their hearts; and they find nothing that brings this comfort aside from the good tidings of great joy of the kingdom message. Our brethren there continue in zeal peculiar unto the house </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">of the </span><span class="font12">Lord, and the great King of kings is blessing them in their hearts and in their efforts to serve him and to advertise his kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">VIENNA, AUSTRIA</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">At Vienna, Austria, is the Society’s local office under the local manager and the supervision of the Central European Office. Notwithstanding the public opposition in Austria, the truth has made great strides, especially in the distribution of free literature, the public witness and the Pilgrim service. When it is remembered that the truth was taken to Austria only a short time ago, the results are exceedingly gratifying. During the year the sales of literature have been as follows:</span></p>

<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">In </span><span class="font12">addition to the brethren in charge of the office at Vienna, three Pilgrims from Germany have visited Austria during the year. The brethren in Austria are rejoicing as they see the old powers crumbling and the kingdom of our Lord majestically going forward.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">MOST, CZECHOSLOVAKIA</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The Czechoslovakian work, though young in years, is showing a healthy growth. The housing problem was so difficult that it became necessary to purchase a house for the office and for the residence of the brother in charge and those who assist him in the work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">During the year there have been placed in the hands of the people of the bound books and the booklets 16,542 volumes; free tracts distributed, 205,000 copies; public discourses delivered, 28; attended by approximately 61, 000; class meetings, 702, with a total attendance of 20,000. There have been six brethren engaged in the Tegular colporteur service and two in the regular Pilgrim service. Letters received, 1,381; dispatched, 975.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">PINEROLO, ITALY</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Por a long time it was difficult to make any progress </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font12">Italy. It is now with joy </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">we </span><span class="font12">report that the work is moving well in that country. There are four colporteurs regularly in the field all the time, and they are doing well. The Italian brother in charge of the local office at Pinerolo is a very zealous worker, and the Lord is blessing his efforts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In Italy the printers are not permitted to print anything unless they sign their name to it; and they are held responsible for its contents. When the management of the Italian office received recently a copy of the “Indictment” and desired to prepare it for distribution, he presented it to the governmental authorities, who inspected it and readily gave him permission to have it printed and distributed. When presented to the printers they inspected it and readily agreed to publish it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Many more are becoming interested in the truth, and much literature is being taken and many books placed. In addition to the Volumes of Studies in the ScripTubes in Italian that have been sent there, as well as the “Millions” books and other literature printed, the Bem office has recently printed for distribution in Italy 25, 000 copies of the “Desirable Government” booklet. Bicycles have been provided for three colporteurs, who are traveling through the country distributing literature and selling books. We have great hopes for a wide spread of the truth in Italy in the near future.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">OREBRO, SWEDEN</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The work throughout Sweden is managed from this office. The report for the fiscal year is gratifying indeed. From the manager’s report we quote:</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“Although this field is In some respects hard, we are of good courage and are more determined than ever, by the Lord’s grace, to continue to work in the present fulfilment of his prophecy as recorded in Matthew 24:14. We know of no organization or body of men in the world now preaching tlie gospel of the kingdom except the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">During the year twenty brethren have been engaged in the Pilgrim service, and thirty-seven in the colporteur work. A number of conventions were held throughout Sweden, greatly to the upbuilding of the friends. Public meetings held, 2,459, with a total attendance of 176,247. Letters received, 11,010; letters dispatched 13,903. Studies in the Scriptures, “Harp of God” and other books and booklets sold during the year, 153, 833 copies; 1923 “Proclamation” distributed, 522,720 copies. Total number of copies of The Watch Toweb published during the year, 219,350; The Golden Age, 179,188 copies; Swedish Service “Bulletin” distributed, 9,182; paper Scenarios, 11,726; other tracts, catalogs, etc., 45, 940, making a total of 988,106 pieces.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">COPENHAGEN, DENMARK</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">From Copenhagen is directed the work of Denmark. We quote from the report of the manager:</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“There is a tremendous amount of prejudice against our message and work. The clergy continue the warning against us. Some years ago our work was termed a general plague or scourge by these opponents; and by this time we have reason to believe that they feel it so, even more keenly. Notwithstanding the opposition, the results of last year’s work are greater than at any time in the past. There are more classes in the country, and more profess consecration. The work is increasing.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">“As you see from the summary of the work done, the work has prospered in Finland, and we can only praise the dear Lord for all his marvelous goodness to us.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">The work for Norway is conducted from this point. From the report of the local manager we quote:</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“The work is greater this year than it was last. Some of the friends have permitted their hands to slacken, bul many other new ones have come in and the work has increased.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">WARSAW, POLAND</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The work in Poland during the first part of the year was greatly hampered; but after a visit by a special representative of the Society to Warsaw during the summer the work took on a new impetus. Later, another brother was sent there from Northern France to aid in the work; and now the Polish work is<sup>1</sup> greatly on the increase. Conditions are growing better for the prosecution of the work, and the brethren are manifesting a greater zeal and determination than ever before. In addition to this, the work is better organized.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">At this time there is at hand a report covering the last four months of the fiscal year, during which time 389 letters were received and 511 dispatched. Two regular Pilgrims have been engaged in the service, and six auxiliary Pilgrims; public meetings held, 157, attended by 32,062; class meetings, 197; attendance 2, 982; conventions held, 16; books sold, 11, 979; free literature distributed, 17,637 copies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The Photo-Drama of Creation is being shown, arousing great interest. The brethren have many trials from within and without. The adversary is making </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">them </span><span class="font12">all the trouble possible; but by the Lord’s grace </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">they </span><span class="font12">are pressing on. A more detailed report will ap</span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">pear in </span><span class="font12">the Polish Watch Tower.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">CLUJ, ROUMANIA</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">From this office is directed the Society’s work in Roumania, Hungary, Bulgaria, Jugoslavia, and Albania. There has been great opposition here by the governmental authorities, and yet the Lord has continued to bless his work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">It became impossible for the Society to find a suitable place to house the workers; consequently the necessity arose to build a house and office. This has been done during the year. The office and working part is completed, but not yet the residence portion. This has cost considerable money; but clearly the Lord’s hand has been in the matter, and he has blessed it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The Society has here a very good printing and bookbinding establishment, which enables us to produce the books for the countries above named at the lowest possible cost. This m'ust be done, because the people are so poor that they cannot afford to pay very much for books. From the report of the manager is quoted:</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“We are filled with keen gratitude toward our heavenly Father and our Lord Jesus, who have strengthened us at many dark points during the year and straightened out all our difficulties. We are indeed grateful and indebted to yon in a special way, with much appreciation, love and thankfulness for coming to our help both financially and with encouragement whenever we were at our wits’ end. Compared with last year, the sale of books has increased BOO percent. More would have been done, but at the beginning of the year we were without books. In September we finished printing 100.000 copies of the ‘World Distress’ booklet, and also the ’Desirable Government’ booklet, in two languages. For October 5, one day, the friends ordered 30,000 of these booklets for distribution. The field is steadily enlarging, and the need for more workers is becoming greater each day.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">During the year 793 brethren have symbolized their consecration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The brethren engaged in the work from this office are chiefly Roumanians and Hungarians. The Hungarian work and Roumanian work are linked together in this report. The increase in both is quite marked.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The Society’s printing plant at Cluj during the year has manufactured 226,075 volumes of books, and 129,952 books have been distributed. In addition, copies of The Watch Tower and Golden Age to the number of more than 175,000 in each of the two languages have been distributed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The people in the greater portion of this country are very poor, particularly in Jugoslovia and Albania. Notwithstanding the great difficulties, the brethren are zealously pushing on, carrying the truth throughout the Balkan states.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">During the year Pilgrim brethren to the number of 11, speaking the Roumanian and Hungarian languages, have engaged regularly in the service. Additionally, there have gone out from the office twelve brethren, who served the classes on Saturdays and Sundays. The class meetings held in the territory during the year have numbered 3,444 with a tel al attendance of 105,115.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The public witness is given under great difficulty. Nevertheless, 262 public meetings were held, with a total attendance of 31,504. There have been forty-seven local conventions, with an attendance of 11,521.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">ATHENS, GREECE</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">From this point is conducted the work in the Greek languages in territory embracing Greece, the Isle of Crete, and Northern Egypt. The w'ork has greatly increased in Greece during the past year. Two Pilgrim brethren are regularly in the field; but they have been laboring under difficulties, being required to procure their own halls and to get permission of the police before being admitted to speak. The opposition comes from the Greek priests. Frequently these print dodgers warning the people against the Pilgrim brethren, distribute the. dodgers and send criers through the streets to cry out against them, calling them heretics and deniers of the divinity of Christ and the “holy trinity”. Notwithstanding, the brethren have pressed on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">During the year these brethren have held fifty-two public meetings, with a total attendance of 35,000; 656 class meetings, attended by 7,900. There were three colporteurs in the field regularly. Books sold, 9,438; free tracts distributed, 90,000; letters received 810; dispatched, 700.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The Society has recently sent three Greek brethren to Northern Egypt to work among the Greeks there; also a special representative of the Society is now on his way to Greece, to engage in the work there with the other brethren. This is because of increased interest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">BEIRUT, SYRIA</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The Society has recently opened an office at Beirut, from which the work in Asia Minor, particularly Syria, Turkey, Georgia, and Armenia, will be directed. A lively interest is springing up in that country, particularly among the Armenians. Armenian brethren are engaged in establishing classes for the interested. Classes are now established at Beirut, Ilammana, Salima, also in Aleppo, Constantinople, and Philippopolis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In addition to the local work in the countries named, there are Armenians interested in other parts who are assisting in carrying on the work in Bulgaria, in Cairo (Egypt), Salonica (Greece), the Island of Cyprus, Abyssinia, Cuba, Buenos Aires (Argentina), and Persia. Even a few Armenians in China have manifested their keen interest in the truth. The work among the Armenians bids fair to increase greatly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In this connection we might say that the Armenian work in the United States has shown a marked increase during the year. Eight classes have been organized for service, and much interest has been manifested.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">RAMALLAH, PALESTINE</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The work in Palestine has not greatly increased during the year, although there has been some slight increase. The witness, however, is being given there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">CAPE TOWN, SOUTH AFRICA</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">From this office the local manager looks after the Society's work in the following countries: Cape of Good Hope, Natal, Zululand, Amatongaland, Orange Free State, Transvaal, Basutoland, Swaziland, Bcchuana-land, South West Africa, Rhodesia, Portuguese East Africa, and Madagascar. During the latter part of the fiscal year the work from this office has been reorganized and a great impetus has been added to it. The increased interest among the Dutch-speaking and Englishspeaking people is gratifying; and above this, the natives in the various countries are showing a tremendous interest in the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The Society has recently shipped a printing press, with all necessary types and equipment, which will shortly be installed at Cape Town for the printing of literature, for quick distribution. This will greatly facilitate the work there. The brethren are united and joyfully pressing on in proclaiming the message of the kingdom of heaven at hand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">FREETOWN, BRITISH WEST AFRICA</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">This local office manages the work of the Society in the countries of Sierra Leone, Liberia, Gold Coast, and Nigeria, British possessions of West Africa. The brethren there during the year have been greatly blessed by the Lord. From the report of the local manager the following is quoted:</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“The truth is steadily rising here, though there is great opposition from the denominational preachers, especially the Methodists. This denomination, being the greatest commercial system here, has felt the blow more keenly than others. The preachers have combined time and again to put down the truth, but have failed miserably before the onward march of the King of kings. Many have been heard to say: ‘What is the use of this great Babylon we are building; and what is the use of our titled men?’ We do not think much will be left of them when the Columbus ‘Indictment’ falls upon them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“The nominal churches are suffering financially. They have no money to pay the preachers. Many of them have not been paid for months. The Bishop of the Anglican Church called for a prayer meeting on the twenty-tll'rd of September, which lasted from 6 a. m. until 6 p. m. The burden of their prayer was for money.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“The rising generation here are losing all respect for the preachers, who have fleeced them in the past. The class here is steadily increasing. This is true in Liberia, Nigeria, and also the Gold Coast.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">From </span><span class="font12">Kottayam is directed the work throughout all India. The truth is published from this office in six different dialects, and thereby we are enabled to reach a large number of people. The work in India during the year has shown a steady increase. As the peoples of India suffer, they desire to know more about the truth. The dear friends in India during the year have shown a great zeal and, working under handicap, have done well. They show a continued enthusiasm and earnestness for the work. The public meetings have increased. The attendance has increased; and the disposition of literature has likewise increased.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">SEOUL, KOREA</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The work of Korea is directed from here in the Korean language, besides the printing of some of the literature in Chinese and Japanese. We have “The Harp of God” and the “Millions” book already printed in the Korean language, as well as some other literature. The work here, however, has not progressed as well as we had hoped. It is rather difficult to interest the Orientals in the truth. A few faithful brethren, however, are working and industriously pushing forward, that the witness might be given.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">MANILA, PHILIPPINE ISLANDS</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">During the year the Society has opened a branch office at Manila, in the Philippine Islands. The work is just beginning there, and at this time there is not a great deal to report. Brother William Tinney, who went out from Canada to start the work, has gone over China, Japan, and Korea, and has opened an office in the Philippine Islands. After a survey of the field he reported some interest in China and Japan and a little interest) in the Philippine Islands. We have hopes that this will develop into a great witness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">JAPAN</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The Japanese work has not yet taken any particular impetus. However, there are several friends on the Pacific coast who are deeply interested in the truth, and others are manifesting interest. This work is directed more particularly from Los Angeles by a Japanese brother who is now entering the Pilgrim service among the Japanese.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The work in the Orient up to this time has not been great; but it seems that the witness must be given there, and an effort is being made to do so; and it is hoped that during the year we shall be able to do more than has been done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">KINGSTON, JAMAICA</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The work in the island of Jamaica, of the British West Indies, is directed from Kingston, and has made healthy progress during the year. In addition to the </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">local </span><span class="font12">management, Brother J. C. Bainbow has made </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font12">tour of Jamaica, Costa Rica, Cuba, Panama, Canal Zone, British and Dutch Guiana. He reports more than 1300 fully consecrated in that land, with an ever increasing interest. The interest manifested warrants the Society in sending Brother Rainbow over the same territory, which requires a full year and which he is now beginning to work a second time.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">Quoting from the report of the local manager:</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“The service work has been a great blessing to all who have taken part in it. The ‘Indictment’ has caused the preachers to become very bitter and they are suggesting to the Government that efforts be made to suppress the Bible Students. The year has been one of activity, and the public has been made more acquainted with the truth than ever before.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">PORT LIMON, COSTA RICA</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The Society maintains a local office in Costa Rica at Port Limon, from which the work is directed, under the supervision of the Brooklyn office, by a local manager there. There has been as thorough a witness in Costa Rica during the year as possible by those engaged in the work. Brother Rainbow and local brethren have held a number of public meetings, at which much interest has been shown.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">PORT OF SPAIN, TRINIDAD</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Port of Spain, on the Island of Trinidad, north of Venezuela, South America, is another local office of the Society from which the work is carried on. There has been a decidedly healthy increased interest in the truth and witness to the kingdom on the island during tho year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The Society maintains also a local organization at Georgetown, Demerara, British Guiana; and class organizations in Dutch Guiana.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">RIO DE JANEIRO, BRAZIL</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The Society maintains an office at this point, from which the work in Brazil particularly is directed. As the truth spreads the persecutors increase. This has ever been so. It will be found that those most active in the Lord’s service will be the chief targest of the adversary. The dark land of South America is no exception.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The report from this office covers a period of only five months. During that time meetings have been held with a total attendance of 3,800. In addition to that a debate between Brother Dienst and a Catholic priest was attended by 7'00 people. Free tracts to the number of 47,000 were distributed. Nine brethren symbolized their consecration. One regular colporteur has been in the field, with others spending a portion of their time in that service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The Spanish work in the United States and Mexico is conducted from the Brooklyn office with the assistance of Brother Montero, at Los Angeles, California, where The Watch Tower is published in the Spanish language. There has been a healthy increase of interest among the Spanish-speaking people during the past year in these countries, a report of which will appear in the Spanish Watch Tower.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">BUENOS AIRES, ARGENTINA</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">It is with profound gratitude and thankfulness to the Lord that announcement is here made, of the increased interest in the truth in South America. Brother George Young has now been in South America for upwards of two years. The Society has established a headquarters and office at Buenos Aires; and from this point is conducted the work in Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, Paraguay, Patagonia, and Bolivia. It has been the privilege of this dear brother to carry the message of the truth to Punta Arenas, hr the Straits of Magellan, the most southern city on the earth. The message is also being carried from this office to the Falkland Islands and to Venezuela. From, the brother’s report we quote:</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“The first shipment of books was cleared from the customs at Buenos Aires about June 1; and since then the field of activity has opened wide, and the smile of God’s approval upon the effort to spread the message of the kingdom has been very manifest. Upon receipt of your letter, together with the funds, volunteer literature in Spanish began to be published. It has had a wide distribution in twenty-five of the principal towns and cities of Argentina and Patagonia. Books to the number of 1,480 have been placed in the hands of the people. The Eureka Drama has been exhibited in Buenos Aires and other places. Over 300,000 copies of volunteer literature in the Spanish language have been distributed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“In this part of the world the glad message of Christ’s kingdom has never been heard before. The time has come for the message to be proclaimed. The people are receiving the message gladly and the numbers of interested ones are increasing.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Brother Muniz, from Spain, has been sent to South America to aid Brother Young.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">From Melbourne, Australia, the work of Australia and New Zealand is carried on under a local manager. Sufficient time has not elapsed since the close of the fiscal year to receive a report for the whole year from that office. Monthly reports, however, show that the work in Australia and New Zealand during the year has progressed, and the brethren have manifested </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font12">great deal of zeal in spreading the message of the kingdom. There has beeen </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font12">decided increase in the output of literature, and the classes are in a healthy spiritual condition. We hope in a subsequent issue of The Watch Tower to give a more extended report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">LOGANSPORT, INDIANA</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">From this office the Society carries on a work in the interest of the blind. While necessarily this is small, yet we hope much good is accomplished by placing literature in institutions for the blind throughout the United States, and some in other countries, and enabling such, by means of the Braille system of reading, to get a knowledge of the truth who have no natural eyes with which to read.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">COLORED BRANCH</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The Lord has wonderfully blessed the work among the colored brethren during the year, proving that it was pleasing to him to have a separate department for the colored people of the United States. The manager of the colored work, together with his associates, has zealou -iy pressed on; and the Lord’s blessing upon them has been very marked.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">CONCLUSION</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">It does not seem expedient to give here an extended report of the work done from the Brooklyn office in the various languages. The Watch Tower is published at Brooklyn in the following languages: Arabic, Armenian, Greek, Italian, Lithuanian, Polish, Russian, and Ukrainian. We will publish a report in The Watch Towers in the respective languages, more fully setting forth the facts than we can here find space to do. We can not refrain, from saying, however, that it seems the Lord is carrying the truth to the foreign-speaking brethren in America as he has never done before. Thus he seems to be showing his special favor to those honest-hearted people who have left suffering Europe and made their present habitation in the land of America. The foreign-speaking brethren in America are also showing an increased zeal for the spreading of the truth in the respective countries from which they came.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Seeing that we have come to the time when the God of heaven is setting up his kingdom, what are we to expect? Surely that fact will be made known to the peoples of earth. Every truly consecrated and devoted child of God must now do his part if he would be pleasing to the Lord. To such the Lord has said: </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">“I</span><span class="font12"> have put my words in thy mouth, and I have covered thee in the shadow of mine hand, that I may plant the heavens, and lay the foundations of the earth, and say unto Zion, Thou art my people.” (Isaiah 51:16) Furthermore, he has commanded them to “say among the nations, that the Lord reigneth: the world also shall be established, that it shall not be moved; he shall judge the people righteously.” (Psalm 96:10) Praise God and his beloved Son, from whom these multitudinous blew-ings flow!</span></p><a name="caption4"></a>

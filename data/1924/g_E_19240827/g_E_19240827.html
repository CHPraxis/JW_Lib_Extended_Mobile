<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">G</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">eorge R. Lunn, Lieutenant Governor of New</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">York, declared recently at a convention of • their liberty, the Retail Credit Men’s National Association that seventy percent of American business men are economic illiterates. “The trouble with</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">them,&quot; he said, “is that they do not study the fundamental laws of economics.&quot; He said that “certain groups appear to think that legislative bodies can overcome the fundamental laws of economics&quot;, but this he explained is an impossibility. “Two-thirds of the laws on the state and national statute books should be wiped out; for no man can read the laws that are introduced in the state and national legislative bodies, even if he devoted twenty-four hours a day to it.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">A novel way of smuggling narcotics into this country was discovered lately when $2,000,000 worth of drugs were found hidden away in the handles of scrub-brushes that were shipped in crates from Germany, the ostensible destination being Trinidad, West Indies. In the handles of these brushes were found 500 pounds of opium, 800 ounces of cocaine, 1,600 ounces of morphine, and over 2,000 ounces of other drugs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">A school for sub-normal girls near Los Angeles, California, was recently burned to the ground. In this fire twenty-four girls, eight to fourteen years of age, lost their lives. When firemen got to the building they found the doors and windows locked and barred; and only by the breaking through of the windows, were any of the girls saved. One of the inmates, fourteen years of age, set the building on fire purposely to destroy it in order that the girls might be freed and permitted to have a good time such as </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">chil</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">dren in other places were having. She had no intention of injuring an^ one; neither did she think of any of the inmates being destroyed. She probably thought that the girls</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">were prisoners, and had a desire to give them</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">-*• hibition at Wembley planned to boom the British Empire and arouse British patriotism,&quot; says an editorial The loyalty of America to her own labor industries, and the big-heartedness and magnanimity of Americans in general, may be seen in another remark made by th® same editor. He says: “The great Everett Cotton Mills of Lawrence, Mass., have dosed—‘No demand for. colored cotton goods'. And England is shipping millions of yards of colored cotton cloth to this country. The stores discover that goods sell more ^adily when ‘Made in England’.’’ Also, “in England, if you buy goods </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">not </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">‘British-made,’ you are looked upon with contempt. Here, if you insist on buying goods </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">not </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">American-made, you are considered fashionable.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The Ohio coal-mining districts are in extremely bad condition, for the reason that freight rates are so high that it is impossible to ship the coal any distance, and this restricts the output of the 440 mines to local consumption.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The lull in industry continues. Production wanes, and more people are out of employment Iron and steel output shows a marked decrease, which indicates a slowing up of building contracts. Carload shipments of all classes of freight, except grain and livestock, are less than a year ago. Wholesale trade generally has decreased. The textile, metal, automobile, and leather industries are slumping the worst There is a less acreage of growing crops than formerly. Money rates, have declined materially to quicken the pulse of industry, but the tendency is downward.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">It is said that Wall Street is reaching out to . assume control </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">of</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> the nation's bread supply through the ownership of the retail baking business. And as a result, the retail bakers may be driven out of business, according to reports which come from Louisville, Ky., where a convention of the Retail Bakers' Association has been held.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">E</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">FFORTS are being made to make the Mississippi River a navigable stream for freight traffic to St. PauL By putting many spurdams along the banks of the upper Mississippi, it is thought that a depth of six feet at low water stage may he maintained. Already $33,000,000 have been spent. By this method the engineers who have worked on the project are hoping to straitjacket the river and hold it within the <sub>t</sub> limited confines. Henry Ford is building a $10,000,000 structure at the head of navigation, which will be used as a great distributing plant for the Northwest; and a considerable amount of this business will be carried on by steamboats.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">There is a disposition on the part of some railroads to electrify their systems. The C. M. &amp;&nbsp;St. P. has many miles of electrification over the Rocky Mo</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">untains.</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> The Ney Haven road has now abolished steam locomotives entirely from their system between New York city and Hartford. The Pennsylvania line is planning to complete electrification from New York to Philadelphia, and then to extend the electric motive power to Washington and to Pittsburgh. There is a new type of hi</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">g</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">h power electric locomotives that is giving entire satisfaction; and when once the electrification has been installed, the operation of the trains is done at much less cost.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">June 23rd, Lieutenant Russell L. Maughan flew in his twelve-cylinder Curtiss plane from New York city to San Francisco between suns, leaving at 4 o’clock a. nu, and arriving at 9:44 p. na, having made five stops en route. This 'was the Lieutenant’s third attempt, but the first successful one. The weather was good, and his machine worked perfectly. Aside from one short spell of nausea the flier had no difficulties to encounter. Considerable of the distance was covered in faster than two-miles-a-minute time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">A postal airplane service from New York to the Pacific coast has been started. The 3,000 miles are covered in thirty-six hours (two days and a night), with about fourteen stops, where mail is delivered and taken on. The airplane postage rate is about twelve times that of the regular rate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Federal </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Government Problems</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">HE Federal Government believes in good roads. In 1925 $75,000,000 will be expended for the purpose of constructing, maintaining, and putting in good condition the highways in every state in the Union. A specific sum has been allotted to each state. It is also proposed by the Government to keep a closer inspection of railroad locomotives in order to keep railroad transportation up to a high level of efficiency. There has been a laxity along this line, but it will be remedied.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">For the fiscal year ending June 30th, the nation has decreased its indebtedness a little over a billion dollars. The national indebtedness now is only $21,339,979,477. It is predicted that th* Government's income for the year will be $500,- * 000,000 in excess of the real requirements. This surplus is pointed to as a great “triumph of the Republican Party.&quot; We hope that this information is not campaign propaganda. The appre-priations made by the last Congress were near the $4,000,000,000 mark. We would like to see an itemized statement showing where every cent goes. A tax survey has been made which shows that fifty-five billion dollars worth of property in the United States is tax exempt, of which thirty-four billions are in Federal, State, and Local government securities. This fifty-five trillion dollars worth of property represents about one-sixth of the total valuation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The Government has brought suit against fifty oil companies for monopoly in price control. Most of the fifty companies are the Standard Oil Companies of the several states. The Standard Oil trust is supposed to have been dissolved in 1911.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The recent robbery of sixty bags of mail in Chicago, which was systematized and worked out with such precision, has awakened the Federal Government to the fact that the mail service has its thieves. A thoroughgoing housecleaning is now in order. But they should be careful to get the right men. Irving Greenwald is doing time in the Atlanta penitentiary, being sent up for seven and one-half years for forging and passing postal money orders with which he had nothing to do. The bogus money orders kept showing up; and finally the right man was captured, and confessed to the forgery of the entire lot. Mr. Greenwald, who had been positively identified by the buncoed merchants, will now get his release. The real forger is Richard Barry, who not only has confessed but likewise Jias been positively identified. Mr. Greenwald never testified in his own behalf; for, it is said, the Canadian authorities were wanting hin£ and he preferred not to have his identity disclosed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Anarchy in “Little Rhoda*’</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">I</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">N Rhode Island, the smallest state in the Union, has been staged the biggest riot that has ever taken place in an American legislative body. The disturbance was caused by Senator Sherman’s calling the Senate to order for the purpose, it is thought, to pass the annual ap-priation bill and other important legislation and then to adjourn the Senate. Under the rules, Senator Sherman could preside only in the absence of the Lieutenant Governor; and just as the session started, the Lieutenant Governor entered the chamber. A point of order was raised, but the reading clerk began to call the roll. One senator pushed the reading clerk away from his desk. The two men grappled, and in a short while there was a general mix-up. There were screams from women and cheers from partisans, while word was being sent to Governor Flynn that a riot was in progress. High Sheriff Andrews </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">got</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> into the fray. The Governor </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">hims</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">elf entered, mounted the rostrum, and cautioned the audience against disorder. Spectators heckled Secretary of State Sprague and the reading clerk. Police reserves from every part of the city arrived at the State House. Additional deputy sheriffs arrived and filled the Senate lobby. An attempt at adjournment'was frustrated by the Republicans; and the Democratic minority engaged in a filibuster, determining to sit tight' until the next morning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The Rhode Island Senate ship of state has long been stranded upon the rocks of deadlock. A poison-gas bomb was exploded in the Senate chamber, and at least two senators had to take to their beds. Twenty-two Republican members stayed away, and the Democrats were hampered by the absence of a quorum. Later, fifteen Republicans were arrested by High Sheriff Andrews, when they refused to resume their seats at the request of the Lieutenant Governor. The Republican State Central Committeeman announced that he had advised the Republican senators to leave the State to escape probable violence. Charges and counter charges were made against the various members; and it was reported that thugs and gunmen were circulating among Senate spectators to the peril of the Republicans and with the connivance of Democrats. The Lieutenant Governor declared from the rostrum that High Sheriff Andrews -was guilty of malfeasance in permitting the arrested Republicans to leave his custody. Governor Flynn, a Democrat, assailed High Sheriff An- -drews for disobeying the Lieutenant Governor and fostering a spirit of lawlessness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The gas bomb was examined, and was declared to have been skillfully filled with liquid bromide. High Sheriff Andrews is unable to . locate the missing Senators, and a doctor haa bobbed up who certified that they were not well enough to attend the Senate sessions. If a search is to be made for the absentees, it will be necessary for the official to have additional appropriations, which cannot be made; for no business can be transacted without a quorum. At last ' accounts, it was declared unwise for any of the Republican members to return to the State. The Republican State Central Committeeman, Mr. Pelkey, said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">“This is an honest-to-goodneas fight against mob rale and mob violence. We are not going to give in until we are assured that the Republican Senators will not have their lives endangered.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The anarchy existing in the Rhode Island legislative body still persists. The law-makers are fugitives from the Rhode Island laws, as they are in hiding in Rutland, Massachusetts, whence comes the word that they are prepared to remain there until the present legislature goes out, January 1st They are taking precautions to foil efforts to kidnap them and carry them back forcibly to Providence. Meantime the sun still shines in Rhode Island, the rain falls, the grass grows, the trains still move, and the dairymen continue to deliver the milk to the babies. So why the fuss? Why not glory in the fact that at least one legislative mill has ceased to grind its silage I Twenty-one Republican senators have signed a report to the public, giving their reasons for not convening with the legislative body, and making grave charges against</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">•M9</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">th® Lieutenant Governor, who is the presiding officer of the Senate. They charge him with violating almost every parliamentary procedure, with using coercive measures inimical even to the interests of the health -of the senators in order to domineer, intimidate and otherwise bulldoze them into submission to his wishes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">IVew Fork's </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“Garden Party’*</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">I</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">N T</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">HE</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> Democratic convention at Madison</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Square Garden emotionalism, sentimentalism, a general lapse of rationalism, and a little reason went to make up the sum total of the stock in trade. The newspapers colored the proceedings according to their party affiliations, but were somewhat handicapped in their discoloring proclivities by reason of the radio. Millions who listened to the proceedings via the radio received their first mental glimpse of the horseplay and the wirepulling of the politicians. The convention differed materially from the ’hard-boiled, made-to-order routine of the Cleveland convention of Republicans. Life was injected into the convention by the Ku Klux Klan and League of Nations issues. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The platform makes an effdrt to face the troubles the United States is up against. It reads well; and if it could be lived up to and enforced without friction, no doubt it would bring some relief. But we must remember that before any good thing can become lawful it needs must go through the red-tape labyrinths of blocs, amendments, and resolutions, accompanied with explosions of oratory from party machine-guns, each clique, clan, or division of the country pulling for its individual interests, with the people finally getting just what big business deigns to allow them. We think well of the plank which submits the League of Nar tions proposition to a referendum; for this means that the people will get the opportunity to express their choice. This plank was adopted in the face of a great effort made by Newton T. Baker to pledge the Democratic party for the League.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Mr. Baker appealed to sentimentalism. Pleading with tears himself, he brought tears to the eyes of many. He said that Mr. Wilson, the deceased ex-president, was speaking through him; that he was Wilson’s voice. This was clearly an effort made to hypnotize his audience; but when it came to voting, the delegates came out of the trance and buried the League proposition a thousand fathoms deep—where it belonged. The Klan plank lost by the narrow margin of 4.35 votes, the credit being partly due to the appeal of the Democratic war-horse, W. J. Bryan. The radio announcer said that in the beginning of his talk Mr. Bryan received a lot of booze. This sounded extremely strange of the man with the grape-juice reputation; but the announcer was spelling his boos with an “s’* instead of a &quot;z.&quot; This margin of 4.35 votes leaves it possible for the Democratic party to maintain its solidarity—at least for the present</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The candidacy of Governor Smith brought out the question as to whether a Catholic can be elected president of the United States. Most of the daily-newspapers are decidedly pro-Catholic; the galleries at Madison Square Garden were pro-Catholic; and the announcers over the radio made the effort to appear neutral.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The Lutheran Augustana Synod has removed “hell” from the Apostles’ Creed and substituted “hades.” Hell, say they, means a place of punishment; and “hades&quot; means, according to their findings, the realm of the dead. Hereafter they will have Christ “descending into hades&quot; instead of helL If &quot;hell&quot; is the English translation of “hades,” what difference does it make!

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The winter in Newfoundland was one of the mildest of which there is any record. Very little arctic field ice has drifted south this year. The International Ice Patrol at Halifax reports that the temperature of the sea covering 35,000 square miles at the Grand Banks of Newfoundland was seven degrees warmer than normal this spring. Similar conditions were found in other north Atlantic waters. Some unknown . physical causes are raising the temperature of vast areas of water in the north; and this no doubt will have an appreciable influence upon the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">clima</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">tic condition of the northern hemisphere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Many violent storms have visited different parts of the United States within the last three months. Hail storms, cloud bursts, excessive heat waves, and unusually high winds have played havoc with growing crops, destroyed buildings, washed away concrete bridges, interfered with transportation, killed many people, and destroyed millions of dollars worth of property. The worst storms were in Tennessee, Minnesota, South Dakota, and Ohio. At Lorain over sixty . are dead, 7,000 are homeless, and property loss reaches $25,000,000. At Cleveland, Sandusky, Port Clinton, Akron, Alliance, and Youngstown are many dead and much property loss. Six cottages were blown down at Cedar Point; some automobiles with their occupants were swept into the lake. Pittsburgh, Pa., and Buffalo, N.

She is also fortunate in having statesmen who realize the values of these water-power resources to the people. As a consequence Canada, with only about seven percent of the population of the United States, has more than thirty percent of the amount of hydro-electric horse-power. In the United States there is a development of ninety-five hydro-electric horse-power per thousand inhabitants; while in Canada there is a hydro-electric development of 350 horse-power for each one thousand inhabitants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">But this is not alL In Canada, this hydro-electric power belongs to the people and constitutes a wonderful asset; while in the United States of course all the hydro-electric power, like everything else in the country, belongs to the great corporations. These corporations in the recent past have manifested extraordinary interest in cooperating with the Secretary of the Interior and other officials at Washington in disposing of the assets of the American people. The effect of the Canadian policy is to enrich the common people; the effect of the American policy is to rob them.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">A</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> MAP of the air routes of Europe shows that there are lines already established from London to the most important points in France, Switzerland, Belgium, Holland, Denmark, Germany, Poland, Esthonia, Latvia, Russia, Hungary, Jugoslavia, Roumania, and Turkey. In addition, lines are soon to be started that will include Ireland, Scotland, Norway, Sweden, Italy, Greece, Egypt, Mesopotamia, and Asia Minor. A line is already operating from Southern France through Spain to Morocco and Algiers. Other lines are projected to Portugal, Corsica, and Sardinia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">It will be seen from this how .infinitely far ahead of the United States Europe is in the matter of aerial travel. The air tickets from London to Berlin cost $36, and the trip takes eight hours; while the tickets by rail and water</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">routes cost $27, and the trip requires twenty-four hours.

In harmony with a. prewar promise made by Britain to Italy because the latter joined the Entente, Enland. has now relinquished her hold on Jubaland. It is also-said' that England upon different occasions has made the offer to restore Gibraltar to Spain, bat that each of these offers was turned down by the Madrid Government It is said that today Spain bitterly regrets the rejection of these offers^ The offer will probably not be repeated so long as Spain is in her present frame of mind, .and we may not be able now to discern the wisdom, of England in turning back Jubaland to Italy.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">HE Dictator of Spain, General Primo de Rivera, is a man of seventy-two titles. When the King of Spain introduced the Dictator to the Kling of Italy, Alfonso said to Emmanuel: “Here is my Mussolini.” It is even true. Rivera is a second edition of Mussolini, but is said to be an inferior copy. Rivera has referred to Mussolini as a master of energy and patriotism, and states that when he parted with the Italian Dictator he not only shook hands with Mussolini, but gave him a heart-to-heart embrace. It is to laugh.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Among the educational institutions of Spain that have been suppressed as unnecessary by De Rivera, the Spanish Dictator, are the General Education Commission, the Nurses<sup>7</sup> Training Schools, the School for Agriculture, the Institute for Applied Mechanics, the Department of Geographic and Geological Topography, and the Industrial University for-Applied Art and Crafts. Thousands of students have thus been deprived of the opportunity of gaining an education. The Spanish Dictator seems to have concluded that brains are a detriment to the Spanish people. How much longer the Spanish people will submit to being dominated by the present combination of force and hypocrisy is hard to foretell</span></p>

<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">F</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">RANCE is trying to get under headway with a new president She now has a Protestant president; and the government is in charge of a radical Socialist by the name of Herriot, who is now the Prime Minister. A new cabinet has been formed, which will endeavor to take the iron teeth out of the laws and regulations put in motion by Poincare. As a good start Herriot has opened the Ruhr to seven thousand Germans who were exiled by Poincare. Efforts will be made to reduce the tension existing between France and Germany, also to make a reduction in the army and to bring about a general easing up of the feverish conditions that are irritating the French republic. There will also.be an effort to bring about more friendly relations with England ; for Herriot has had a personal interview with MacDonald, the British Premier, for the purpose of having a better understanding of what must be done to pacify, if possible, the whole of Europe. It is intimated that there will be an evacuation of the Ruhr, but not until after favorable action is taken on the Dawes report However, one cannot tell one day what will transpire the next.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Edward Herriot has announced that the Trench Embassy to the Vatican will be withdrawn. It is certainly a remarkable turn of affairs that leaves Protestant Britain with an Embassy at the Vatican and the Catholic France without one. - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">A French newspaper correspondent, referring to the visit of the French Prime Minister to the British Prime Minister and to the apparent success of the visit, has made the statement that &quot;both Premiers are full of confidence that-the difficulties with which they are faced can be solved. If ever there was a chance of bringing back peace to Europe, it may well be this chance, and perhaps it is the last.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The French Government has decided to recognize the Soviet Government of Russia. Thus we have the interesting spectacle of practically the whole world recognizing the Soviet Government, except the United States Government, which will have nothing to do with it. If it seems wise for Britain and France and Italy to make some kind of trading arrangement with Russia, wo are unable to see why it would not be equally wise for the United States to do the same.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">It is expected that between 4^000 and 5,000 German children will spend their summer in France, this being apart of the plan of the working people in France to show their sympathy for the poor of Germany.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">A</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> WRITER in the New York America* states that the Communistic vote in Germany, which was 589,000 in 1920, was 3,746^571 in the last Reichstag election. This indicates the swift plunge of Germany into Communism. The number of Communistic deputies has increased from three to sixty-two. This writer shows that the evident reason for this is that the net income of the average German is now calculated to bo almost exactly one-half of what it was before the war; while his cost of living is almost exactly twice as high. In other Words, the average German today can live only one-fourth as well as he did before the war. If these figures ara true, it would seem, in a world which has been made safe for democracy, that it is almost enough to drive any people into desperate experiments in government The claim is persistently made that one of the fundamental principles of Communism is the seizure of present governments by riot</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">It is said that a revolt in Germany at the present time is impossible. This statement is probably based upon a large membership in the “Republic Defence League,” which is supposed to balance the power of the Communists and to neutralize the spirit of rebellion that is smoldering beneath the surface.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Evidently the Dawes Plan for pacifying the enemies of Germany is not altogether satisfactory to Germany; a prominent naval official has made the statement that industrial Germany &quot;cannot be horsewhipped into making the payments demanded by the Dawes report; not at least until the Versailles Treaty is thoroughly observed and recognized everywhere.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ODAY in Great Britain we are witnessing the greatest change in government that has ever taken place in the history </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">of</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> the country. A party which has never before been in office now forms the administration, and what has occurred may properly be looked upon as a bloodless revolution. Many have said that the Labor Party is not capable of governing the country; but in view of recent events </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">thi*</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> opinion seems to have been modified, and the cry of “Fair Play” has taken its place. The attitude of the older parties seems truly to be:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">“Things are in ■ bad way; we have not been able to put them right The country is in a mesa With our unemployment, house shortage, and trade depression we bid fair to more serious trouble. Why not let the Labor Party, which has for so long criticized us while in opposition, have a term of government and realize more fully the magnitude of these problems ?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Still others, of the older school, say: &quot;If the Socialist Party is allowed to control the affairs of our nation, the country will go to the dogs.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The evidence before us today tells very plainly that in all countries of the world previous parties have failed to govern their respective countries successfully; L e., with a.view to the happiness of their subjects. Surely the only true proof as to whether a government is successful or not must be found in the homes of the people. If prosperity rules in a country, and if happiness, contentment, peace and love are the ruling factors in the lives of the people, then the government securing this has been successful. Who shall quarrel with us, then, when we say that on the basis of the past 6,000 years of government by men and parties of men, the Labor or Socialist Party, even if it had a working majority in the House of Commons, will fail to achieve the success indicated? We write this well knowing that the Labor Party is the only one directly aiming at the betterment of the masses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">In the Labor Party are men of outstanding character and ability, men who have not been afraid to stand for their convictions, and even to suffer imprisonment for faithfulness to their principles. -Many are rough diamonds; some are extreme in their views. The true Socialist, however, the genuine one, is striving after an ideal, is self -sacrificing, with honest desire to uplift his fellowmen and to make them happy. To him</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">his politics is his religion. But let it be clear that however sincere and honest a man or a party may be, they cannot adequately deal with the human heart, which is, in the last analysis, the real seat of the trouble. Divine intervention, and that only, can solve the world-problem of today.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The most momentous event in the world’s history is the establishing of God’s kingdom among men. Yet today one general class is opposed to this reign of equity. This class embraces all who love not the Golden Bule; but instead of loving others as themselves these are willing to see them crushed, oppressed, and denied the reasonable rewards and comforts of toil, in order that they may divert themselves in luxury. When the Lord’s kingdom is mentioned, they smile and have fear for the mentality of the .kingdom messenger. When a Labor Administration is imminent they see red flags and Bolsheviks in their sleep. “The country [which means themselves] is going to the dogs [which means the other fellow—the outsider].” They see their stocks, shares, and ill-gotten gains taken from them in taxation to pay the price of a war they fomented, which was fought for them and their commercial interests—a war which meant the death of thousands of splendid young men, and which left thousands more in a living tomb of starvation and misery. It is this class which is opposed to the kingdom, and which realizes that if such a kingdom as the Bible foretells were set up, then society would be leveled, and “they alone would eat who labor.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Truly did Burns write: “Man’s </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">inhumani</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ty to man makes countless thousands mourn.” But the poet seems to have had a glimpse of something better when he concluded: “This partial view of humankind is surely not the last . .” It is not strange, then, under such conditions that we have Socialists in dur midst, who readily grasp the fundamental principles of righteousness, recognizing man’s common brotherhood, eUi, as some of their writings so beautifully show. With the light of the dawning new day now shining, and the education and enlightenment it involves, comes a keen realization that, things are not as they should be, that there is something very wrong in a world where the natural resources and wealth are more than sufficient for the well-being.and happiness of alL</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">On Tuesday, January 15th, 1923, the Bang of the greatest empire on earth delivered a speech to his “Lords and Members of the House of Commons.” This speech was a forced one, dictated by the Prime Minister, the leader of a defeated party, and delivered before what has been called &quot;the Mother of Parliaments.” In the House of Lords the scene was brilliant—surpassed only by the coronation of a king or a pope; princes, dukes and peers in their best Sunday clothes, and their ladies lavishly dressed and bedecked with jewels of rare value, were assembled, together with a number of &quot;the faithful Commons,” Foreign Ambassadors and Representatives. The King spoke for twenty minutes and touched on various problems. He commenced : &quot;My Lords and Members of the House of Commons: My relations with Foreign Powers continue to be friendly”; and a little later on he says: “You will also be asked to assist in providing work in the ship-building industry *by the immediate construction of cruisers and auxiliary craft in anticipation of the Naval Program.” It is significant that Mr. Jack Jones, an ardent admirer of the Upper Chamber, did not add: &quot;Peace, perfect peace, in this dark world of sin.” His Majesty concluded with the words, “And I pray that the blessing of Almighty God may rest upon your deliberations.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The different clauses of the speech are vague; and it certainly would avail nothing to criticize them here. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">But one thing we would impress; viz., that here the King of the Greatest Empire on earth, speaking before the &quot;Mother of Parliaments,” amidst the assembled Princes, Dukes and Peers, and the lavish display of dress and jewels, delivers a speech containing 1,200 words, the longest on record, and yet a few days later, with an amendment containing only twenty-three words the whole thing becomes little more than a farce.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">■ In the House of Commons the position is such that no party has the power or authority to govern the country freely; and before long another general election will result</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Present Government's Aims Are Ideal</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">HE amendment was moved by the Labor</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Party, and with -the support of the Liberal Party it brought about the downfall of the Conservative Government Now that the Labor Party is in power, it is claimed by its supporters</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">74?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">that &quot;things will change” ; and that eventually, if it is given the necessary time, it will so gov-em that the people will be happy. What is its policy! In brief we would sum up the general -policy of the Labor and Socialist Party to be one that is directed against the present unevenly balanced social and economic system; a policy which' aims at altering affairs so that every man, woman and child may have equal privileges, and may enjoy those things which the earth has to give in return for honest and reasonable toil. This program aims at a government “of the people, by the people, and for the people” as a whole and not for the privileged few. To do this, without a doubt they must alter the whole structure of present-day civilization until, as they say, all will be happy and contented and enjoy to the full &quot;the sweets of life.” Mr. Philip Snowden, now Labor Chancellor of the Exchequer, picturing the end that the Socialist Party has in view, in his book, “The Christ That Is to Be,” page </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">12</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;And when this social ideal shall be universally accepted ... I see men freed from arduous toil by the gifts of nature being freely shared. . . . I see an industrial order where every man for a fair day’s work has a bountiful harvest, and abundant leisure when his necessary toil is done. ... I see our modem town swept away. ... I see everywhere a change come over the landscape; every meadow smiles with plenty, every valley blossoms as the rose, every hill is green with the glory of Lebanon. I see a revived art and a revived literature; I see a people healthy, happy, cultured, contented, whose health is life, full and free, whose ways-are ways of pleasantness, whose flowery paths are paths of peace.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Mr. Snowden is to be complimented on the knowledge he has of the kingdom of God, for the above picture is none else—the very lau- -guage-is Scriptural It brings to mind the words of the late Pastor Russell in Studies ih the Scriptures, Vol. 1, page 191:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">“Close your eyes for a moment to the scenes of misery and woe . . . and picture before your mental vision ths glory of a perfect earth. Not a stain of sin . .'. not a bitter thought . . . unkind look or word . . . love welling up from every heart meeting a kindred response in every other heart. ...” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The picture is the same; but the fundamental difference between these writers is this, that whereas the Socialist says that his Utopia will be brought about by education and governmental changes “universally accepted,” the Christian says: “Yes; the people must be educated, but-</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">this education and these governmental changes which will have power and authority to carry will be brought about, and can be brought about out its program, being able also to deal effective-only by the inauguration of Messiah's kingdom, ly with the h</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">uma</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">n heart and the wrong doer.”</span></p>

Some people believe the gold standard best; some advocate bimetallism; others a commodity dollar; still others a credit checking system; then there are those who think the Government’s fiat or decree is all that is necessary to secure paper currency. <sub>z</sub></span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">5 toney is a term applied to any currency used in buying or selling. Originally, gold and silver became valued because of their fineness of metaL Being very pliable and fusing at a low heat they could readily be hammered or molded into useful or ornamental articles; and so they have always continued to be in demand. The love of adornment has done much to keep the precious metals at a high ratio as compared to other products.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Free and unlimited coinage of gold keeps gold specie,, bar metal, and dust at par, while the price of ornaments is determined by the wage of the artificer and the profit of the jeweler. When gold is said to be at par it is in comparison to the securities by which it is purchased. The government stamp on a gold coin guarantees to its owner a legal amount of gold of a certain fineness. Additionally, the stamp on a silver dollar guarantees it to pass as legal tender in all amounts at its legal ratio with gold,'while bar silver varies much. The stamp on gold does not change it. It is still a product of value to be exchanged for other values. The value of gold is said to be stable because it is used as a standard by which to compare other values. When in the markets the parity of gold and other products varies, it is because of a change in the necessity or desire of those trading.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Suppose wheat or any other one product would have been made the world’s standard of value and legal tender in payment of all bills, the effect would have been the same as with gold. One person would have been short of wheat to meet his expenses. The elevator would have had wheat to loan on approved security at the legal - rate of increase; checks would have been given on the elevator; the parity between wheat and other products would have been guessed at or bargained; speculation and big profits would have gone on merrily, collecting the wealth into the hands of a few.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Or, instead of that, suppose the government would have printed on currency paper, “This is legal tender at face value in payment of all bills,” and passed them out in payment of expenses or otherwise without any guarantee or provision for their redemption, only that they w'ould be received in payment of taxes. Is there reason to believe that the parity with produet of such currency could be sustained? Would it command the confidence of people who in private transactions demand something of intrinsie value or paper secured by a value of a defined amount and kind? Should not a government trade with its people on the same sound basis?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">When yen accept a fiat dollar you have no assurance that it is worth anything in return, except to pay “debts; for that is all the government guarantees. A gold certificate will not only pay your debts but is the equivalent of 25.8 grains of standard gold for each dollar it represents, and at any time can be exchanged for that amount. That is the stablizing influence of the gold standard, and is good as far as it goes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">A fiat dollar could be hoarded, loaned at interest, used in speculation, gambled with, and devoted to all the devilment that could be expected of a good honest gold dollar, provided, however, that you could find anyone who wanted it It would surely be a cheap way of paying our debts. But why not also save the paper and ink and have the government decree the debts paid? This, to the writer’s understanding, would amountto practically the same thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">When gold bonds are used as a base for currency, and the government’s ability to pay is questioned, the currency depreciates to that amount The public are learning, and wisely so, to keep their eye on the security and not on the denomation of the paper. Our paper currency is simply a demand note secured by a value of a defined character. When the custom started of issuing such currency the way was opened to use any stable value as its basis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">CommotUty Dollar Favorably Seta</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">T</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">HE</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> commodity dollar is coming into favor, and rightly so. Product is the basis of all commercial exchange; and a currency representing it, and secured by it, would be an ideal medium of exchange. There is an enormous wealth of surplus product that, if used as a base for currency, would obviate the necessity of issuing bonds or any other form of interest-bearing paper.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">With standard prices based on labor cost every value in the nation could be used as a basis for paper currency; but as long as gold is used as the world’s standard for comparing other values it would be necessary to keep all currency at par therewith. This can be done by using the average labor cost of gold production as a wage basis for all production.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">When all product, including gold and silver, is produced on the same labor cost basis and priced at labor cost and relative value, the soundness or stability of a paper currency based on one product would be the same as another. Whether the government passed out a currency or issued credit as a checking account, or both, on receipt of product, would be of little consequence ; in either case the product would be the security. But if, by extending the base for currency to other products besides gold and sijver the country were put on a cash basis, and the legal bank reserves were released, and speculation was eliminated, it is probable that our present volume of currency would be ample.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">If Germany and other countries that are short of gold and silver on which to base their currency, would stabilize their other products on a parity with gold and use them as a^iasis for paper currency, it would release their gold and silver for international business. Rightly sthnd-ardizing the price of labor and product would cut out the landlord system, also the gambling profit system, and would release the energies of the people. If their wealth did for a time get into the hands of outsiders the people would be receiving the full product of their labor and could soon buy it back in their own right.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Institute such a system; and we will venture an opinion: There will be no more’wars “in the interest of democracy,” for two reasons; first, when wealth and influences find that they must pay the price of their folly they will say “No”; second, democracy will then have become an accomplished fact</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Gold is the recognized standard of value for international trade, and it will not be wise to discontinue its use until we have found something to take its place or have established business relations among nations on the . principle of an equal exchange of values. Any trade balance must be paid in something; if not in gold or other product, then whatf</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“The love of money is a root of all evil”; Le^ there is no evil but has at times been caused by the love of money. It is equally true that the generous use of money is a great blessing. Nowhere in the Bible is the proper use of money, condemned; and as far as my knowledge goes, there is no hint that its use will ever be discontinued. But that the evils arising, from the wrong use of money will be corrected, no believer in the Bible will deny.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The Bible condemns usury and increase because they cannot be practised without working injustice. Remove that principle from the workings of trade, and any system of currency secured by the value of product will work as it should. Increase could, and if allowed no doubt would, be practised the same if we had no money. We mention these things in proof of our contention that it is not the kind of money that is wrong but the way we regulate its use. The injustice in the exchange of products is in the price at which they are bartered, and any corrective measure that does not recognize thia fact will be of little avail</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Carry the Body Well </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">From the Pathfinder</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">HE right rue of the body is essential to the best health. The various organs cannot function properly unless, the body receives constant care and is carried in an upright position. The commandant of the Army War College at Washington, D. C., issued the following instructions to student officers: “Stand up, sit up, stand tall, sit tall* throw the chest out, make the waist flat, stand and walk forward on the feet, and be strong and healthy.” They apply equally well to any person who desires health and good appearance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">When the head is held up, with the chin drawn in, the blood is allowed to flow freely to the brain; as a result the wits are most keen. Breathing is easier, and the blood circulation is at its best, when the body is erect* with the chest held up. A person standing straight has much better color than when the body is drooped and the abdominal organs have a better chance to work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Both old and young should practise drawing up to their full height Draw in the chin* pull up the chest, draw in the waist, and feel the weight chiefly on the front part of the feet Feel tall and walk along as if you own the town [not proudly]; not as if you are ashamed of yourself and everything. When sitting, keep the same position as when standing. Bend the body at the hips, not at the waist line. When in bed stretch out whether lying on the back* face or side—do not buckle in the middle.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark28"></a>Woodrow Wilson, Deceased</span></h6>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">W</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">E HAVE no particular desire to magnify either the virtues or the failings of any man, especially when the man is dead; but the death of. ex-President Wilson has led some our contemporaries to such extremes of laudation over him that we feel like offering a few calm suggestions. Endeavors have been made to place </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> on a par with Jesus Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Not only have some of the clergy, with mistaken zeal, proposed to make him one with Washington and Lincoln, but one of them went so far as to quote from Hebrews 11:38, the parenthetical statement of St. Paul in his reference to the ancient worthies of Old Testament times, saying, “Of whom the world was not worthy.” One preacher said that the ideals of the former president were so lofty that they could not be comprehended by the many, and the reason given waa “because of their dwelling in lower altitudes.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The periodical which gives us the material for </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">this</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> editorial, in its laudation of the dead man seems as ambiguous in its praises as Mr. Wilson was in many of his speeches and writings. Perhaps, after all, it is the viewpoint The article starts out by saying that it is “out of the question for people to agree on the stature of a great historic figure like that of Woodrow Wilson. Passionate admirers will magnify and bitter foes will minimize that stature,” etc. And then it adds: .“AU will concede that he takes his place as one of the three greatest American immortals.” How “all will concede” to something that is “out of the question for people to agree on” is surely reasoning on a plane that is beyond us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">“Washington waa great, because he started the republic • Lincoln was great, because he saved the union; Wilson waa great, because he headed the nation during the World War, and gave the world the ideal of universal peace through international unity and unselfishness.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">We quote further, showing what ou^author means by Mr. Wilson’s unselfishness:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;Bryan resigned from the cabinet [because he and Wilson could not agree], and Wilson forced his successor, Lansing, out as well as Secretary of War Garrison, on account of radical differences. Wilson had 'a single track mind,’ as he called it; he wanted his way; he saw his course clearly; and he was convinced that everyone was wrong who did not see things as he did. ... He denounced as 'contemptible quitters' and 'pygmy-minded men’ the senators and others, of both parties, who refused to accept the League of Nations covenant which he had made. . . . When this nation refused to honor the war draft he insisted that the nation, and not he was wrong.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">It would seem from the above that Mr. Wilson was self-willed, so domineering and self-righteous that the opinion of others was not worth a whip-stitch to him. The greatness of Abraham Lincoln was in his condescension to others, his respect for the opinions and advice of his associates ; and often he traveled many miles to consult others of recognized ability.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The greatness of these two men is further shown by another sharp contrast: Lincoln was reverential, he trusted God and worshiped the Almighty, as is shown by his speeches and proclamations; while Wilson in his masterpiece, the League of Nations covenant, leaves the Almighty out of consideration, for the reason that if any one was to get the glory for establishing universal peace it was to come to him!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The Bible shows that there would be an attempt made at this time to bring in world-wide peace, without consulting the Almighty as to the ways and means by which it should be established. The Prophet says: “The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against the Lord, and against his anointed.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">How was this done! Evidently in the League -• of Nations pact It was heralded as the “political expression of the kingdom of God on earth” —without consulting God or Jesus Christ</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Jesus spoke a parable of himself as a nobleman going into a far country, receiving a kingdom, and. returning; and on his return the attitude of the self-willed, arrogant people is represented in their saying, “We will not have this man to reign over us.” (Luke'19:14) But it is said of the rightful Ruler of earth: “Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter’s vessel”—Psalm 2:2,9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The League of Nations was anticipated and warned against in the following: “Associate yourselves, O ye people, and ye shall be broken in pieces: and give ear, all ye of far [unrighteous] countries: gird yourselves, and ye shall be broken in pieces; gird yourselves, and ye shall be broken in pieces. Take counsel together, and it shall come to nought; speak the word, and it shall not stand.” But the Lord said to His people, those of the holy &quot;or righteous nation, the true Christians: “Say ye not, A confederacy, to all them to whom this people shall say, A confederacy; neither fear ye their fear, nor be afraid [of the things they are afraid of, but] sanctify the Lord of hosts </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">self; and let him be your fear, and let </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> be your dread. And he shall be [to you] for a sanctuary; but [to those who desire a confederacy or a league</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">He will be] for a stone of stumbling and for a rock of offense to both the houses of Israel.” (Isaiah 8: 9-14) The phrase, “to both the houses of Israel,” means to the nominal Israelites after the flesh at the first advent of Christ, and the nominal Israelites after the spirit (so-called Christians) at the second advent</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">So infallible was Mr. Wilson that he took his opponents to task, saying, “I have seen fools resist Providence before, and I have seen their destruction, as will come upon these again—utter destruction and contempt” We will now quote the laudation following </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">thia</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> statement from the magazine whence our information comes:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">“No one could voice such a malediction aa that </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">wnl— </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">he felt that he was an inspired.instrument of the Almighty—and that is what Wilson believed </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">him—Jf</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> to be.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The deposed Czar of Russia had an “inner” ear; the exiled Kaiser of Germany had an “inner” ear; and here is evidence that the author of the repudiated “fourteen points” had also an “inner” ear. An “inner&quot; .ear means that the source of the inspiration comes not from the God of heaven but from the “god of this world,” whose cause he was serving in trying to reestablish the old order of things upon the rotten foundation of a withering civilization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">A domineering, overriding, self-righteous, self-wise spirit among the children of men does not come from the God of heaven. The days of plenary inspiration departed with the death of the writers of the New Testament, about nineteen hundred years ago.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Mr. Wilson sallied forth to make the world safe for- democracy. Democracy means government by the people. His idea of democracy is alleged to have been: Organize the world into a league of nations; let me be its president; and safety, sanity, and spiritual health shall be yours. That this is apparently true we quote again from those who sing his praises:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">“He never for one moment believed he was wrong'-— and in that he was the ideal zealot He really believed that a majority of the American people were with him &lt;in the league issue, as he said; and even after he had appealed to the people and been rebuffed he refused to accept the verdict”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">But Mr. Wilson fooled the people with such expressions as:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">“It does not make any difference what kind of minority governs yon, if it is a minority; and the thing we must do is to see to it that no minority anywhere masters the majority*</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">His fine epigrams lulled many thousands to sleep. His “watchful waiting” policy led many to believe he would do the watching. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">Hia</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> “be neutral in thought and act” meant for everybody else to do nothing and be quiet. His “too proud to fight” was the opiate by which very . many had their senses completely dulled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">These paved the way for the war-lords to turn loose their propaganda in the 1916 election to put over the top a man who hypocritically permitted himself to be placarded upon the billboards of the nation as the savior of the men, women and children of the country, because “he kept us out of war.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">For at the same time that a committee of Wall Street financiers were formulating plans, preparing laws of espionage and secret policing * of the country, devising means by which, the war could be financed in harmony with their word of honor, which had been given to France for them to hold out a little longer and the United States would enter the war on the side of the Allies; and all of this, it is understood, was done with the knowledge and consent of Mr. Wilson.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“Peace on earth, good will to men” is not only a Christian ideal but a prophecy of a fact which will obtain under the rulership of the Prince of Peace, Jesus Christ. Mr. Wilson was an idealist; this was his ideal, but with mental reservations. If peace came, he should have the glory; if the world were made safe for democracy, he should have the praise; if a league of nations covenant were made and universally adopted, God and Christ were to be left out of consideration; he himself should sit upon the pedestal of worshipful adoration and be the prince. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">How self-willed and cocksure was Mr. Wilson that he was the vice-gerent of Jesus Christ, and the avatar of God Almighty, and that therefore he must have his way, we perceive from the following culled from a reputable source:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">“According to a letter written-by Joseph P. Tumulty, his private secretary, Woodrow Wilson had determined to resign from the presidency in 1914 unless congress would repeal the Panama canal tolls. Tumulty quoted the incident as an example of the former president’s courage. ‘I would not want to be president of a country that would violate a solemn treaty’, President Wilson told his secre</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">tary. Tn case of failure in this matter I shall go before, the country after my resignation is tendered, and ask if to say whether America is to stand before the world as-a nation that violates its contracts as a mere matter of convenience, upon a basis of expediency.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">We should not personally fault Mr. Wilson, too severely; for his long, square, prominent chin, and the boldness of his head in the region of firmness, conscientiousness, cautiousness, appro bativeness, and self-esteem indicate that he could be expected to conduct himself in the manner in which he didL</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Firmness and self-esteem are manifested in all his acts; approbativeness would prompt him to go before the people for their approval; caution was emphasized in the “watchful waiting” policy; and conscientiousness, overcharged with much learning, part of which at least was built upon a false premise, with large self-esteem and small veneration, would account for his always, thinking himself to be fight and everybody else to be wrong. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;, z &gt;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Character analyses by noted psychologists give Mr. Wilson credit for the following virtues:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">“Woodrow Wilson does not love his fellow men. . . . He does not refresh his soul by bathing it daily in the milk of human kindness. . . . His determination to pub things through in the way he has convinced himself they should be put through is not susceptible to change from influences that originate without [outside of] his own mind. ... In contact with people he gives himself the air of listening with deference, . . . but in reality it is an artifice which he puts off . . . just as he puts off his, gloves and his hat . . . Selfishness is another conspicuous deforming trait ... He is more selfish than crueL . . . Mr. Wilson is the apotheosis of selfishness because he puts .his decisions and determinations above those of any or ml others.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">“Mr. Wilson has lived too much within h</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">imself</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> He does not submit himself to the corrective processes of association, ... he believes that he cornea out ahead by following the bent of his own temperament ... If a big matter is in hand, he is so concentrated upon it that he overlooks the little matter. He has the keenest and truest sense of what is&gt;reaL Irrelevance cuts him to pieces. When he is at work on a thing that engages his interest, he is like a hound on the scent Waste of time or any kind of lost motion is like poison to him. ... He would never have listened to any tattle. In every crisis he backed his man with granite fixity. . . . There were thousands of people who did not admire him [Colonel Theodore Roosevelt], and the President [Wilson] was one of these.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">coldly intellectual process of assessment; and his conclusions wert in accordance with his judgment of what would best promote the interests of the country in the war.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">“To every one within the household, including house visitors, the President is kindness itself. Once the threshold is crossed, one becomes the trusted friend. The conversation at meals and during the little rest time that follows is easy and delightful, and every one takes part freely. There is not a trace of Presidential arrogance in the President’s manner. He and Mrs. Wilson live in an atmosphere or unaffected simplicity. When they were in Paris they declined all invitations when possible. . . . While he was traveling through the West, and speaking twice a day with a headache racking him, ... he was never a minute late on the whole trip. He is a paragon of order and punctuality. ... In what he can do well, and likes to do, Wilson is tireless; but is very indolent about what he is not proficient in. He is not a judge of men. . . . His near sight is defective; but when he looks up and out, no man sees further or more clearly. . . . He has perspective; he is always looking far ahead. He cannot see the trees for the woods. The little things by the way do not distract </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> • for they escape his attention.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Mr. Wilson’s greatness lay in his ability to pass over and not concern himself with the little things of life! One of the authorities says that Mr. Wilson loved mankind in the abstract; that he did not love his fellow men, but that he concerned himself about humanity as a whole; that tlie “predicaments, perplexities, and prostrations of the individual or groups of individuals make no appeal to him. ... He says with his lips that he loves his fellow men, but there is no accompanying emotional glow.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">So Mr. Wilson could uot see a tree; but he could see a grove. He could not see a man ‘ but the world at large he could see. How wonderful! This reminds us of the greatness of Jesus of Nazareth because it is so different. He said: “Consider the lilies, how they grow”; “are not two sparrows sold for a farthing!” &quot;the very hairs of your head are all numbered.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Did Jesus not say to the impotent man at the pool of Bethesda: “Wilt thou be made whole!” Did He not say: “He that is faithful in that which is least in faithful also in much”! Did He not say: &quot;Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child, he shall not enter therein”!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">And did Jesus not speak in parables in order that the individual, the few, might understand, while the mass of mankind might go on in darkness! “Unto you it is given to knew the mysteries of the kingdom of God; but unto them that are without, all these things are done in parables: that seeing they may see and not perceive ; and hearing they may hear and not understand.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">What is the earth from God’s viewpoint! Is God unable to see a planet, but able to see &quot;islands of stars” or constellations! God puts all the nations of the earth into a balance and weighs them, and gives his judgment: they are as nothing; they are counted to Him less than nothing, and vanity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">This earth is as a grain of sand, and God does really take notice of it.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">CANADA</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">L</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">'action Oathouquz, a Quebec newspaper which obviously is distinctly partisan along religions lines, comes out with the following interesting item:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">‘&quot;L’Harpe ds Dien [“The Harp of God”].’ Some days ago ws put our readers bn guard against a dangerous propaganda, propaganda which is not new elsewhuei</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">“It teems that periodically some men come from no* one knows where, but evidently in obedience to a power* ful and tenacious organization, offering for sale or giving away Bibles. This year the Bibles have changed into volumes of very attractive form and appearance which have the name of &quot;The Harp of God, proof conclusive that millions now living will never die,’ ‘World Distress,’ 'Can the Living Talk with the Dead? etc. The titles are exempt from comment; the works, edited at Geneve, Calvinistic Home, are but Protestant interpretations of sacred books. That is to say, the duty of those who have let themselves be deceived into buying them, or to whan they have been given, is clearly traced: It is to throw them into the fire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;If someone similarly came to offer us free some germs of the plague or cholera or the lik^ we would refuse them or would fling them into the flames. Germs of cholera or of the plague are less dangerous than errors able to kill faith. For faith is much more precious than health or life. Do not expose yourselves to it. To the fire with books like 'The Harp of God&quot; and with those resembling it”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">We desire to extend our cordial thanks to </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">L‘-action Catholique</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> for its review of these books and for &quot;calling them so prominently to the attention of the Roman Catholics of Quebec. This is advertising which we really appreciate; for it reaches a class direct that we desire to come in close contact with. What </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">L'action Catholique </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">does not get clear, however, is the truly distressing (to Rome) fact that Quebec is waking up and that the supine mass at last is questioning the ancient dogmas and their reliability. A refusal to recognize the manifestations of an awakening intelligence has ever characterized the Papal-obscured </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">min</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">d, however; so no doubt Catholic Quebec will share the fate of Catholic Germany as the light of truth searches into the dark places. The world is due for a spiritual awakening. Thank God, it has come!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">We would call to the attention of </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">L'action Catholique</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> and all who think in the terms as just expressed, the statement appearing in &quot;Le</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Mystere de Dieu Accompli” (“The Finished Mystery”), concerning a “plague”:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">“Revelation 16:12: 'And the sixth poured out his vial upon the groat river Euphrates’—Seemed to the worshipers of the beast and his image to be instituting a new and horrible thing, a people’s church, in which there is no place for clergy, colleotiona, church edifices, reverence for one day above another, or in fact any of the customs cherished in the nominal church.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">This would indeed be a ghastly thing for the Catholic Church, and the strange part is that the people seem to like the thought of release from such thralldom!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">We would further suggest a careful reading of the press report of Premier Tashereau’s attitude toward the Hierarchy and its self-arrogated power within the Province. We quote from the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Border Cities Star:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">“Referring to recent attacks made upon, him politically in </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">L'action Catholique,</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> the organ of the Rtataa Catholic hierarchy, Hon. L. A Taacherean, Premise Quebec, flung down the gage of defiance at the Liberal banquet here last night</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Stating what were the political principles of the liberal party aa laid down by its old chief he said that one of these principles was the abolition of<sup>-</sup> the monopoly which certain groups had arrogated to themodvec that the 'keys of the kingdom of heevssi' were in their pear session alone, that they had the exclusive privilege of scrutinizing the hearts of men and the power to pronounce excommunication.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">' The Edmonton </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Journal</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> reports an appeal for general intercession by the local ministerial association “for material prosperity”; also that “we may make the very best of our material provision”. It closes its petition, “That we may be delivered from materialism and selfishness,... until we shall find His perfect will and make every material blessing an instrument for tho advancement of His kingdom.” Guess the answer to that one: First pray for it, then finish your prayer by asking not to have it. We do not wish</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">-to appear irreverent, but God Himself might almost be puzzled by some of the prayers which are sent to Him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Mr. Fredrick Whelen of the League of Nations Union in Great Britain, visited Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan, recently. The </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Evening Times</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> of that city reported much interest in his observations. One of the most impressive state, merits which he made was:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;The army of Poland, a young country not yet five years old, is already larger than that of Austria-Hungary before the war. One hundred percent of the recent loan made by France to Poland was for the purchase of arms and munitions. The battle line between Poland and Russia, with its barbed wire and trenches is unbroken.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">It almost looks as though the news that the war is over has not yet reached Poland; or perhaps Poland is too wise to believe it!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The Vancouver </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Daily Province,</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> under the heading, “Signs of the Times,” examines the trend in the war-stricken countries to investigate the Christian religion as a means of relief from the intolerable pressure of post-war problems. Canada, with her problems of. unemployment, a suicidal immigration policy, and evermounting debts, faces a hopeless future, false optimism to the contrary notwithstanding. The Canadians also are turning their thoughts toward the vital message of the truth of Christianity as a relief from their problems, hut are showing a marked antipathy for the outworn and baseless platitudes of denominationalism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Possibly another reason why many Canadians are tired of the denominational church and its sanctimonious attitude toward the bitter problem of every-day living for the majority, is found in news items like the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">“Rev. Dr. C. W. Gordon, 'Ralph Connor/ of Winnipeg, was paid a total of $17,640.00 for his services as chaplain in the Canadian Expeditionary Forces. Dr. Gordon served for a little over four years. Part of this time he was engaged in delivering patriotic addresses throughout Canada and the United States.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">This information was given in the House of</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Commons (Ottawa) in answer to a question by Wm. Duff (Lib. Lunenburg). $4,400.00 a year from the Government, plus a church stipend, plus royalties from works of fiction (the product of his pen, as well as his pulpit), plus royalties from moving picture companies, plus income from dairy interests in Winnipeg, plus income from other investments, plus the glory accruing to a man occupying a bomb-proof job in the fighting forces—and all one has to do is convince the other fellow that his country needs his life for $1.10 per day!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Our local Church Union war wags along. Union is </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">to-</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> all intents and purposes an accomplished fact. But the opponents of Union still hope for some miracle to happen if the matter can be made a legal battle in the Courts, even to an appeal to the Privy Council of Great Britain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">So far, the only results seem to be an aroused state of feeling on the part of church men and apathy on the part of the general public. The usual quantity of verbal garbage has been thrown around, enunciated, we must admit, in fairly cultured tones, and clothed in well-turned sentences. “An onion by any other name,&quot; to misquote a popular bromide.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Incidentally, there have been some resonant utterances recently at the Methodist Conference, decrying war and calling on all right-thinking people to outlaw war. These last futile struggles of a dying institution, torn by. internal dissension, arouse in our hearts a feeling akin to pity—pity that the opportunity to be true to the ideals of the Christian faith has come too late. There is now reserved only a speedy dissolution of these last outposts of the old order, that the new may come in. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13" style="font-variant:small-caps;">E</span><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">xperimentation</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> has proved that paper laid on the ground through which pineapple, tobacco, tomato and strawberry plants may grow, will increase the yield from twenty-five to one hundred and sixty-eight percent, make the fruit larger and better flavored, and eliminate the heavy cost of weeding. The experiments have^been tried in Hawaii, California, and Florida.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The paper used in the pineapple fields of Hawaii is three feet wide, one-thirfy-second of an inch in thickness, and laid in long strips which extend across the field. It is of special manufacture, made of asphalt-treated felt, something like roofing paper, white in color, The paper holds the moisture in the ground, raises the temperature, protects the ground from cracking from dryness, and from packing under hard rains. Holes are made for the plants to grow through; and the paper is kept from blowing away by covering the edges with dirt. The greatest increase of yield is with tomatoes.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">T</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">HE</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> writer is a Kentucky mountaineer by birth, and has spent the major portion of his life right “in the sticks.” Occasionally, he visits relatives and friends there. On the occasion of my last visit I noted increasing activities amongst the sects to gain a foothold in that section. Particularly is this true with reference to the Christian, Presbyterian, and Methodist systems.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The first step toward enmeshing the unsophisticated mountaineer is to send a representative &quot;in there,” as the native would express it, and to hold several religious services, usually on the LB.S.A. plan of “Seats Free and No Collection.” This, of course, is merely a bait, an allurement held out to assist in the grand general scheme of entrapping the unwary, and in many respects, ignorant populace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">That the whole plan of evangelization is backed up and fostered by big business there is not the slightest doubt. That region is being developed very rapidly in this “time of the end,” or “day of his preparation” for the Golden Age. The people there are getting their eyes open, and are beginning to think in this dawn of the new era. Consequently, it should not surprise us to find Satan and his minions disturbed over the influx of knowledge in that part of his empire or kingdom. Hence he has inspired some of his trusty servants to go there and sow the seeds of error, superstition, and false doctrine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Mountaineers Detest “Trinity” Theory</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">A</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">LREADY, the people are beginning to complain about the doctrines which are promulgated. Especially do they detest the theory, or rather teaching, of a trinity of Gods; for be it said to the credit and honor of these noble people that this doctrine, which we all recognize as Satanic, has in the past had no place in their conceptions of the Creator. They do not now believe it, and tenaciously oppose its propagation in the schools. They believe that God is the One Supreme Lord of all; and the Trinitarian idea of a monstrosity of three Gods, all in one, is, to them, repugnant to the last degree.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">While it is true that these people possess very erroneous ideas in general on religious subjects, we thus see that they have gotten the highbrow, theologians beaten on this score, at least The citizens of that section are also opposed to the teaching of evolution. They have a simple faith in the whole Bible from cover to cover, as facing inspired, and unhesitatingly affirm their belief in an intelligent Creator. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">An infi</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">del </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">i«</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> regarded with horror.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Of course, everyone is a firm believer in eternal torment. We may consider them largely excusable for entertaining this conviction, however. In fact, there are portions of the Kentucky mountains where to &quot;preach agin hell” would be to court a formidable opposition, and even death. The people simply ding to the belief, regardless of logic or Scripture to the contrary; and feeling sure of the existence of “that awful place of eternal torment,” and that it is the bounden duty of all to “warn others” of what they deem a sure destiny and reward of the wicked, they quite naturally regard any teaching to the contrary with great alarm, and immediately denounce it and its apostle or exponent, as one of the false teachers forewarned of in prophecy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">To them “the Gospel” is divided into two simple parts; namely, “Do right and go to heaven, refuse to do this and go to helL” And there is the end of it. Denounce or seek to undermine this axiom; and at once “the fat is in the fire.* The one doing so is an “infidel” of the darkest color. The writer has for the past ten yearn sought to enlighten the mountain people, and stamp into their minds a knowledge of the true plan of God for the salvation of mankind and can, therefore, confidently say that nothing but the power of Christ’s kingdom can take away the vail of ignorance of the true God, which blinds the minds and beclouds the vision of an otherwise splendid people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">That the mountains of Kentucky are infested with demons there is abundant proof. The people are firm believers in “knocking spirits,* “visions,” “ghosts” and “warnings” or premonitions, dreams, etc. And in common with the rest of the world, they are convinced that these manifestations are from the departed spirits of dead relatives,, or neighbors. Here and there one may find one of those hated “infidels” who,.they say, &quot;tries” to disbelieve. But they are few and far between.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Strategy of Big Business</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ORETURN to big business: The missionary effort is financed by the big business</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">interests of Louisville and Cincinnati, chiefly. </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">7M</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">They back the church of their choice, and so the game goes oji. But why are the big corporations so deeply “het up” over the everlasting welfare of these thirty-one mountain counties f AKI there’s the point! “Big business desires a feathered nest on Easy Street,” as one writer recently remarked, and has an eagle eye on the rich natural resources of Eastern Kentucky.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The sending of preachers to convert “the heathen,” as they call the mountaineers, is the same old game or strategy “pulled off&quot; by this giant octopus in China and elsewhere. It is a cunning camouflage; and has in view not the welfare of the mountain people, but &quot;their enslavement and subjection. The educational and religious features are merely parts of a well-laid scheme to get possession of the valuable ore beds, coal </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">min</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">es, oil deposits, and timber tracts of that rich, but hitherto neglected and ignored region. Big business has been too busy elsewhere to notice the value of this attractive territory; but, moving on the assumption that the earth belongs to it and not to the Lord, it now proceeds to gobble up this portion along with the rest. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">While it may be urged, and truthfully, that educational institutions, built up and fostered in the mountains by denominationalism, aided by the commercial interests, have done and are doing a vast amount of good, it still remains true that this cleaning up and whitewashing of certain corners of Satan's empire has for its real purpose the strengthening and upbuilding of his dominion, now tottering to its fall and final ruin, in which all the false church systems, political organizations, and big business institutions will be dissolved and forever cease to be, as foretold by the apostle Peter, and as decreed by God Almighty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Some, failing to understand the plan of God, are busy upholding the Babylonish systems in the hope of securing financial reward, and will suffer a terrible punishment from the Lord for refusing to separate themselves from the unclean thing after hearing the Lord’s command: “Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues. For her sins have reached unto heaven, and God hath remembered her iniquities.”—Revelation 18:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Truth Brings Responsibility</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">M</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ANY of the mountain folks have heard the truth from the lips of the writer and others. Therefore they have a responsibility not previously existing; and, doubtless, failure to cease supporting Babylon, failure to leave her, will bring an awful retribution. The Lord, being all-wise, is not mistaken in condemning Babylon; He tells us plainly that He knows her works, and sees all her secret wickedness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Those who claim that Babylon is a righteous » institution, and who remain connected with her, thereby call God a liar, or imply by their actions either that they do not believe the Word of God, have no faith in what He says and no respect for it, or that they are wiser than Jehovah. Many are doing this to their own hurt, and when Great Babylon falls they will fall with her.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">While it is undoubtedly true that there is considerable credulity and a proneness to believe anything that seems plausible among these people, it is equally true, and indisputable, that the average person born and reared in the hills of Kentucky possesses more knowledge and a better general education than is accredited to them by outsiders. Credulity is everywhere, for that matter. The mountain people of Kentucky possess a rare thirst for knowledge, recognized and commented on by former president Wilson and many others. They are curious and full of interest. They “want to know, you know”; and while this desire is now being gratified, to a certain extent, the real work of enlightenment awaits the ushering in of the kingdom of God.— Daniel </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">2:44. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Then we may expect that these people in common with all others will joyfully avail themselves of the privileges and opportunities then afforded for all The suggestion has been made that the Kentucky mountains may produce another Lincoln. We hardly think so. And certain it is that another Lincoln would receive a cold reception from the present ruling factors, corporations and trusts whose enthronement in power Lincoln foresaw and forewarned.</span></p>

The people’s plea for an administration whose policies will make for untrainmeled justice and equality falls on ears that seem to be deeply interested in their welfare until the election season is passed. But while moons wax and wane, the gods of War, Gold and Plunder, take their heavy toll from, the people with compound interest; and the erstwhile promises of well meaning administrative officials are pleasantly forgotten in deference to the well beaten paths of privilege! .</span></p>

<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">A</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">S FOR the leaders themselves, there are a few sober-minded ones among them who permit no rosy delusions to swell their heads into thinking that all is well when it is not Their better judgment tells them of a serious situation among the perturbed and disgruntled masses, which is beyond their power to control, and for which they are unable to prescribe a panacea Such able writers of international fame as Messrs. Brisbane, Wells, Simonds, and others frankly give expressions to their fears for the outcome of present-day toboggan tendencies in matters of politics and finances, unless the turning point is soon reached and we are again on the road to normalcy. This in spite of the evolution theory concoction which they have tendered as food for the mind, elevating to the soul, and 9s a hope for better conditions by the Darwinian highway—a highway, indeed, which leads in the wrong direction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Politicians seem blindly contemptuous of their sacred responsibilities, scornfully resentful of any kindly counsel from the direction of an appealing humanity, and cruelly apathetic toward the pressing issues of the day. They strut around with glowing and fatuous promises and pretentions; but back of the scene is a merciless policy bent on complicity with finance and big business interests. These twain are one in mind, body, and strength. Even a FannerLabor candidate might become acquainted with this fact and, in time, meekly bow before this mighty giant. Occasionally one dares to inquire : “Is this combination unimpeachable!” But for all such honest inquirers, the religio-political doctors are ready with their hypodermic solution to ease and to quiet the patient quickly before others should become affected</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">'Decline and Drift of Civilization</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">I</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">N THE August, 1923, “Current History” may be found an able treatise on “The Decline of Modern Civilization,” by Wm. Dudley Foulke, President of The National Civil Service Reform League, in which he draws striking analogies of ancient Roman civilization and our modern civilization. The main points are aa follows: The loosening of family ties and discipline ; decline of religious faith; drifting of population to the cities; religious and racial intolerance and a decay of the public spirit—all evidences of a decline whose only remedy, he thinks, is a radical change of spirit But aa to the details of how the remedy should be applied, the reader is left to guess. Mr. Foulke, liko many others, has felt of society’s feverish pulse and has announced that the patient is breathing its last, but holds out little hope of a resurrection under any condition. Apologetic and explanatory eulogies of flowery eloquence and great length will not heal the people's grievances at this belated hour. If only they could see in this onward march of nations the divine hand “which shapes our ends, rough-hew them as we will.” The only adequate remedy is the on-coming kingdom of righteousnessa and peace, which will soon bid the people to halt from their madness and listen to God’s still, small voice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">But let no one construe the writings of Thb Golden Age as fomenting further strife and dissatisfaction. Surely it may be pardoned for constantly proclaiming the King and His kingdom, as all witness the precipitous state of affairs as they now exist. One need but to call to mind a few things which Mr. Foulke omitted in his “Evidences of Civilization's Decline” to further inspire the cry, “How long, O Lord, until thy reign begins to bless!” The war-ridden countries of Europe with their state of famines, pestilences, and general devastation of land area following the wake of the big war; the slum sections of our own metropolitan centers;</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">the poverty-stricken mining camps; and the overwokred, unrequited farming element in the various grain and vegetable raising sections— all elicit more than a silent yearning for the new. kingdom of righteousness and peace. No wonder the masses in exasperation find it difficult to repress their petulant and almost fiery resentment as they vainly try to liberate themselves from intolerable conditions! Truly only the callous heart could rest in a </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">spirit of</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> somnolency and wish the kingdom blessings stayed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Lord’s Kingdom Will Sanctify</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">HEREFORE det the earth awaken to the the fact that the old world has ended, and that Christ’s kingdom is now coming into power, preparing the hearts of the people, and the literal earth itself, for the realization of the “sweet bye and bye.” Soon society will comport itself with the high standards of the principles of righteousness and equity, making no longer popular, cruel discriminations between the aris* tocrat and the lowly, the rich and the poor, the weak and the strong. Soon there will be a refined universal desire to promote the welfare of all, encouraging them to go on to full restitution. Man will be blessed with a true sense of appreciation that the earth is his to'explore, subdue, and inherit, but not at the expense of his fellowman. The Bible tells us that no ravenous beast shall go up the highway of holiness (Isaiah 35:9), meaning that there will be no privileged classes which would devour the interests of others, but that all will be free and equal in the 'pursuit of happiness and everlasting life. Then supreme joy will emanate from hearts that are filled with a consciousness of divine approbation and emanate from homes perfect in conditions. An ennobling interest in the welfare of others will prevail. All this must result from the beneficent reign of the King of glory. Would that the politicians might realize the utter futility of trying to bring society back to worn-out policies and traditions!</span></p>

<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">I</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">T W</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">ILL</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> be called to </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">mind</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> that on December 17, 1919, all the planets of the solar system except the Earth were assembled in line with the Sun. These seven planets, Mercury,Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune, stood on that day in one straight line with the Sun, the Earth being the only one of the group out of line. This was so interesting and so unusual that we took some pains to discover how long it had been since the same position had existed before. If our calculations are correct, it had been 52,800,700,000,000 years since they had a similar position.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Here is a large field for speculation. I would not say, wild speculation; for many facts are so well known* to man that his reason or judgment is pretty well braced up. It is not wild speculation when sufficient facts are assembled to support a deduction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">I offer a few thoughts that suggest themselves to me, which are very interesting, and which may be considered by wiser heads, better posted than myself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">When I remember that astronomers say that none of these planets except perhaps Mars is inhabitable by such creatures as man, and when I associate this fact with another gathered from the Bible, I am led to wonder what relations exist between the Earth and her sister planets, and what in the distant future may be the out-comejOf this relationship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">It is supreme folly to suppose that our Creator made all these great rolling spheres for no purpose. It is equally foolish to suppose that they were made merely to beautify the heavens for our enjoyment. It is likewise a foolish thought that God made them to glorify or praise </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">Him</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">; for no inanimate object, sphere, rock,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">TOO mountain, river or ocean can render praise. Nothing but intelligent beings aa men or angels can do this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">From the broadest observation and investigation it is shown that none of these planets is habitable. But what may we expect in the distant future!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The question arises, Why did the. Creator pass by so many immensely greater planets than the Earth and start a kingdom of wonderfully intelligent creatures on our small planet! Jupiter, the fifth planet from the Sun, is about 1,300 times as large as the planet Earth. Others are many times larger than the Earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">From the Bible account of creation we see that God wonderfully emphasized the importance of the Earth and the creature man, to whom He delegated the right to rule the Earth and have dominion over it. In a straightforward manner the statement is made that the Sun was made to give light by day and the Moon by night. These two objects are all that He mentions at creation. Man needs these for his comfort and to help to carry on the work assigned him. The other planets God omitted to name or to mention. When we take up that book, the Bible, and see how wonderfully God has manifested His interest in the Earth and in man, we are wonder-struck and appalled at man's importance in the creative work. In the Bible, the Earth is called God’s Footstool.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Then behold God’s interest in man since he went astray displayed by the death on the cross of the Son of God for man’s redemption 1 This fact should astonish and humiliate every man; for the first man, we are told, was created a little lower than the angels. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Here is my query: I wonder whether the lining up of these planets at this time has any significance! There they stood at dress parade, as it were, while the Earth stood aloof as looking on. .Here was the completion of a great cycle of</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">BBOOK.TV. W.X.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">more than fifty-two trillion years. Does this mark a period in the Earth’s history, or the history of man in God’s great plan!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">There are many things that point to our day, the most important period' in man’s history. Look at what has transpired during the last five years. The prophecies for the past 6,000 years are focused upon this particular time of trouble now covering the whole earth. '</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">When Jesus stood on Mount Olive talking to His disciples about coming events and about the time when His kingdom would be established, He seems to have lifted His finger and pointed to this time. The events of this time verify His prophetic statements about war, famine, pestilence, etc., which shall precede the establishment of His kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">There are no less than eighty-eight prophet)* statements gathered from the Bible that point with index finger to these times. Besides, the Bible, by various figures and illustrations^ points to 1914 as the beginning of trouble. Conning back to our former suggestion and speculation, we ask again: Did the peculiar arrangements of these seven have any significance respecting man! Seven is called the perfect number. Were these seven planets witnesses to great events on our planet! How about the planets of the solar system ultimately becoming, in some way, connected by wireless telegraphy, or some other wonderful invention of communication, when they become inhabitable and thus form a great familyof worlds in unison and harmony! There are known to exist at least three hundred and seventy-five million suns, with perhaps as many planets around each aa are surrounding our luminary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Is it unreasonable to suppose our Creator will, in the myriad ages to come, bring all these into direct relation and communication! We can only wonder, and say that it is not at all improbable.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">GOVERNMENT of the people, that exercises its powers and functions unselfishly in behalf of the general welfare of all the people, has long been the desire of man. Every form of government has been tried; and none has been found satisfactory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Well-nigh a fourth of the twentieth century has passed. It has been marked by the greatest material improvement ever known to man. Great advancement in science, invention, and general information has been made; but doubtless there has never been a </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">tim</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">e when the people were so discontented with their rulers and with their governments as now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The British Empire is doubtless the most powerful nation on earth. A few rule the masses, who are seething with discontent; and the oppressed are crying for relief. Germany’s rulers are entirely unsatisfactory,jand constant turmoil exists. Mussolini, who came so rapidly to the front in Italy, and who attracted the attention of the world, is quite unsatisfactory, and is threatened with downfall France has pushed aside some of her brightest minds, and advanced the more radical element into power. Spain is ruled by a dictator, cruel and relentless, who is looking well to the selfish interest of the few. This may be said of many other nations and rulers. The people are anxious for relief.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">A National convention of a great political party assembled in Cleveland, Ohio, and nominated a candidate for the presidency ■ of the United States. Not even all the delegates of that convention were satisfied with the nomination. There was even such a dissatisfaction that on the Fourth of July a new political party assembled and nominated a candidate to oppose the Republican choice. The hosts of another great political party assembled in New York city and nominated a candidate for the presidency of the United States. These political party leaders go before the people, and try to induce them to believe that they can bring about a better condition of government. Whatever the result at the November election, it will not be satisfactory to the people. Discontent will continue to increase; and the ruler, whoever is selected, will please only a small proportion of the populace of the United States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">In every country known under the sun there is a cry of discontent The people are groaning and travailing in pain, hoping for something better, and not knowing to whom to look. There never was such an opportunity as now to call attention of the people to a new order of things that will bring blessings to them. The men who are missing this opportunity axe the theological professors and the clergymen, who stand before the people as sponsors for righteousness and truth. These, however, are repudiating the inspiration of the Scriptures, and have entirely lost sight of God’s plan to establish a kingdom of righteousness and peace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Intelligait Study tfBiblt Needed</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">rpHE purpose of the International Bible Stu--L dents is not to get converts, but to turn the minds of the people to the Bible, which not only holds the remedy to the ills of nations of earth, but points clearly to the way, so that all people may understand how these ills will be overcome. Why do not the people, without regard to ereed or denomination, turn their minds to a careful and honest consideration of the Holy Scriptures, which ate given to man for his instruction in righteousness and to point him to the way that will bring the desire of every honest heart? Surely when the great desire of mankind now is for a government that will look well to their interests, insure them freedom of speech, liberty to do what is right, full and complete opportunity to pursue a course of happiness and to reap the blessings of eternal life, every honest person should want to aid them to find out just how these blessings are going to come.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">One of the most prominent themes of the Bible is that of the kingdom of God. Jehovah, through His prophet Daniel, referring to the distressing condition which we now see upon the earth and to the perplexity amongst the people and their dissatisfaction with their rulers, said: “And in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom shall not be left to other people, but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand forever.”—Daniel 2:44. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">It is manifest from this language that Jehovah purposes to establish a kingdom; that He will not’call upon selfish men to tell Him how to</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ran it, but will establish it in His own way and see that the powers thereof are exercised for the general welfare, peace, and happiness of all mankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">About 4,000 years ago Jehovah made a promise to Abraham, and bound it with His oath, in which He said: “In thy seed shall all the nations of earth be blessed.&quot; Abraham understood that his seed would constitute the king, or ruler of the earth, would establish a righteous government; and that through it the blessings would flow out to the people. God did not tell Abraham when this promise would be fulfilled. Abraham died, not having received the promise. Then the promise was renewed to his son Isaac, who pleased Jehovah; and later it was again renewed to the grandson of Abraham, Jacob. Jacob died; and God selected from his offspring twelve tribes and organized these into a nation, to which nation God renewed again the promise. To them He said: “If ye will obey my voice indeed, and * keep my covenant, then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people; for all the earth is mine: and ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests, and an holy nation.&quot;—Exodus 19:5,6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Israel Typical of Coming Kingdom</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">S</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">AUL was the first king of this typical nation of Jehovah’s, and he proved unsatisfactory to the people.'Later the son of Jesse, David, was selected to be king and anointed to that office. God’s promise to establish in the interest of mankind a kingdom that should bless all the peoples, was narrowed down to David’s house. The people of Israel thought that David would become a universal ruler. His life was stormy, and the promised blessings did not come to the people. His son Solomon succeeded him, whose reign was marked by wealth, wisdom, peace and prosperity. Solomon’s reign, however, did not bring a fulfilment of the promise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">All the holy prophets of God taught concerning the coming kingdom of the Lord, which He would establish for the blessing of mankind. They uttered many wise sayings, which they did not understand, but which were spoken prophetically Concerning that kingdom. Some of these sayings concerning the ruler are as follows :</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“The government shall &quot;be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful,... the</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Prince of Peace. Of the increase of his government and peace there shall be' no end.&quot;—Isaiah 9:6,7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“He shall have dominion also from sea to sea.&quot; His kingdom shall bring peace to the people. “He shall judge the poor of the people, he shall save the children of the needy, and </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">shaJ]</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> break in pieces the oppressor.”—Psalm 72:8, 4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Belying upon these promises of God’s prophets, yet not understanding them, the nation of Israel expected that there would come from amongst them one who would be the ruler of the whole earth, and who would set up an earthly kingdom, through which the blessings would be given.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">When Jesus of Nazareth came to them, only a few believed Him to be sent from God; and the nation rejected Him. Those who did accept Him, He taught to pray for the coming of the kingdom which God had promised. The -chief portion of His teaching to His followers was concerning that kingdom. Jesus was crucified, arose from the dead; and thereafter His disciples were instructed of the Lord, understood God’s purposes, and proclaimed the kingdom. They taught the people according to Jesus' words, that in a time future the promised kingdom would be established and the blessings that Jehovah had - promised would come to all the nations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Church Loot Its Vision of the Kingdom</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">HE Church was established by the Lord. The term church means a called-out class of people, separate from the world. This body of Christians taught the same thing. Within a short time, however, the true light began to grow dimmer amongst those who were leaders in the Church, and they misconceived and mistaught the purposes of the Lord. Then for many centuries good, honest Christians taught that the kingdom of God is a heavenly kingdom only, and that all who will ever have any blessings whatever must die and go to heaven.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Now in modern times a new school of theological professors and teachers have taken over all ecclesiastical affairs; and they refer to the early teachings of the prophets, the Lord and the apostles as “primitive religion”. They disregard the Scriptures as God’s inspired Word; they deny that much of the Bible is the Word of God. Consequently there is a famine-in the land for</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Acccst</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> 27, 1624</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">the understanding of what the Bible really means. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;’</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Two Phtuee of the Kingdom</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">HE apostle Peter, under inspiration, described the conditions that we now see prevailing in the world, and called attention to the heavens being on fire, the elements melting with fervent heat. Then he said: “Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.”—2 Peter 3:13. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;’ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sub>z</sub></span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">It is manifest from this, and other corroborative texts, that there are two phases of God’s kingdom: The heavens represent the invisible phase, while the earth represents the visible phase. All Christians understand and believe that Jesus Christ is a spirit; that He is not visible to man, and will not be; and that the faithful, overcoming Christians, who participate with Him in the first resurrection and reign with .Him in glory, shall also be invisible to man; that no man will ever behold a divine spirit being and live, because that is God’s rule.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The Scriptures abundantly teach that there will be a visible phase of God’s kingdom. God formed the earth to be inhabited; He made it not in vain. He promised that the earth shall abide forever, and that it shall be a habitation for man. Since He so abundantly promises a righteous government we may be sure He has an arrangement by which earth’s rulers shall be righteous men, men who will look well to the general welfare and interest of the people; and this is what constitutes the new earth; meaning thereby that society will be organized upon a righteous basis, in which selfishness will not be permitted to manifest itself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Who then in all the earth could fill the requirements to rule in righteousness 1 There is not a man living on the earth-today, in any nation, whom all the people would be willing to risk as their governor and ruler. The Lord is equal to the occasion, however, and will provide rulers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Doubtless many of you have heard that the Jews shall again rule the earth. This has been much misunderstood. Not every man that is a descendant of Abraham is a Jew, by any means. Be it known once for </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> that those profiteering, conscienceless, selfish men who call themselves Jews, and who control the greater portion of the</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ro</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">finances of the world and the bumness of the world, will never be the rulers in this earth. God would not risk such selfish men with such an im» portant position. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">God Prooidea the Righteoua Rulera * </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">LET us now examine the Scriptures and find</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>1</sup> how God purposes to place in the earth righteous rulers. Remember the apostle Paul, like the other apostles, wrote under inspiration of the holy spirit In the 11th chapter of Hebrews the Apostle enumerates a list of men covering a period from Abel down to John the Baptist</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“City” is used in the Scriptures as a symbol of government Discussing the course of these men the Apostle says in that chapter that they looked for a city (government) which will have foundations, whose builder and maker is God. Then he adds: “These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of them, and embraced them, and confessed that they wen strangers and pilgrims on the earth. . . . But now they desire a better country [government], that is, an heavenly: wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God: for he hath prepared for them a city [government].” (Hebrews 11:13, 16)&quot; After naming such as Abel, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, Moses, and others, the Apostle continues: “And what shall I more sayT for the time would fail me to tell of Gideon, and of Barak, and of Samson, and of Jephthae, of David also, and Samuel, and of the prophets: who through faith subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions, quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, out of weakness were made strong, waxed valiant in fight, turned to flight the armies of the aliens. Women received their dead raised to life again: and others were tortured, not accept-ting deliverance; that they might obtain a better resurrection: and others had trial of cruel Blockings and scourgings, yea, moreover, of bonds and imprisonment: they were stoned, they were sawn asunder, were tempted, were slain with the sword: they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins; being destitute, afflicted, tormented; (of whom the world was not worthy:) they wandered in deserts, and in mountains, and in dens and caves of the earth.”—Hebrews 11:32-38.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Why should men undergo such great hardship, persecution, and faithfully endure it unto death! The answer is, They had faith in God’s promise; they fully trusted </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">Him</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> that in His due time He wpuld establish a kingdom of righteousness; and they believed that they would be resurrected from the dead and have some part in this new government; for, says the Apostle, they thus endured that “they might obtain a better resurrection.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The Scriptures abound with proof that when the heavenly phase of the kingdom is established and in full operation, the resurrection of the dead shall begin; and that these faithful men of old, who died, shall be the first that shall be resurrected on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“No Mm Hath Attended to Heaven**</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">M</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ANY Christians have believed and taught that these faithful men, from Abel to John the Baptist, all died and went heaven; but that cannot possibly be true. Long after all of them had died, and even after the beheading of John the Baptist, Jesus of Nazareth, who spoke with absolute authority, said: “No man hath ascended up to heaven, but-he that came down from heaven.”—John 3:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">After that, the apostle Peter, under inspiration, speaking specifically of David, who had long been dead at that time and who is mentioned in the Scriptures as one of the approved of God, said: “For David is not ascended into the heavens.”—Acts 2:34.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">John the Baptist was one of the last of these prophets; and of him Jesus said: “Among them that are born of women there hath not risen a greater than John the Baptist; notwithstanding, he that is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he [John].”—Matthew 11: IL</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">It is manifest from this statement that neither John the Baptist, nor David, nor any other of the men who died before our Lord’s death will be in the invisible kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Again, concerning these faithful men enumerated by the Apostle, Jesus said: “Many shall come from the east and west, and shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven.” (Matthew 8:11) It is quite certain that these will not sit down in the invisible part, but will sit down on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Referring again to Hebrews 11, concerning</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">these men the apostle Paul said: “And these all, having obtained a good report through faith,, received not the promise; God having provided &lt;&nbsp;some better thing for us [the church], that they ; without us should not be made perfect”—He-brews 11:39, 40. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sub>f</sub></span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">It is clear from these Scriptures that these ' faithful men of old, who were tried and ap- ; proved, who were true and faithful to God and . to righteousness, are to have a resurrection better than the people generally; that they are to be seen amongst men on earth; and that the peo-pie shall come from the east and the west and from all quarters of the earth and sit down with them. What, then, shall be their position f</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Rlghteout Rulert* Petition on Earth &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">D</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">URING the whole period of Israel’s history i these faithful men were called the fathers in Israel; and from then till now Christians have spoken of them as the fathers in Israel^as Indeed they were. From the words of the Apostle just mentioned, they without the Christ could not be made perfect It is manifest that when the invisible part of Christ’s kingdom, the hear-ly phase, is completed, these faithful men of old would be perfected. We h^ve, then, the dear statement of the Prophet as to what shall be their position. He says: ‘Instead of thy fathers shall be thy children, whom thon [the Christ] mayest make princes in all the earth.”—Psalm &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">45:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">A prince is a ruler. These men, when raised * from the dead perfect in body, perfect in the sense of justice, having no selfish interests to serve, and being the direct representatives of j the Lord, shall constitute the rulers of the earth. The word “children” means offspring, or ones ■ ’ who get their life from a common father. Christ I will grant life to them under the terms of the &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">new covenant, and then they will indeed be the &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">children of the Christ They will receive their instruction from the Lord, and will carry it out in the earth. The new heavens will be the new spiritual ruling powers, Christ and His bride, the Church invisible, directing the affairs of the earth; whereas the new earth will be a new order of society, managed and directed by these faithful men of old, resurrected as perfect human beings. Upon these the people can rely and trust absolutely to look well to their interests.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">When the people have absolute confidence in the honesty, integrity and the power for good of their rulers, then they will settle down and be quiet and pursue a course that will lead to happiness. The affairs of earth will become stable, and gradually selfishness will fade away.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Just at this time the people of earth are greatly agitated as to how they can prevent war, how they may establish a World Court that would hear the differences between men and settle them aright; but they have no confidence in the schemes offered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">But there shall be a new World Court which shall be established by divine appointment. It will judge in righteousness, and decide equitably all questions and controversies that are brought before it. For this we have often prayed: “Thy kingdom come, thy will be done on earth.’*</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark43"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark44"></a>Am I My Brother’s Keeper? </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">By Chas. w. Apgar</span></h6>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">HE question,&quot;Am I my brother’s keeper!” by Cain in the early history of the human race, has never been settled satisfactorily in the minds of the majority. It seems all right in theory, but not in practice. So it is still the rule to care for Number One first The god of this world (Satan) would have us ignore all responsibilities toward our fellow citizens. This disposition seems to have carried some still further - and to have caused them to resent any manifestation of interest in their behalf by friends or neighbors, making it very hard for those having the spirit of brotherly love and neighborly interest</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Inasmuch as we naturally desire to be entirely independent of the remainder of the human family, the spirit or disposition “to get and to hold” for the future for ourselves and dependents, makes it so much the harder for our brother to keep himself, to say nothing of being his brother’s keeper.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The argument of the Socialists for the betterment of Society seems logical and sound.. Although they must wait until the Golden Age is more thoroughly established before they see this rule of brotherly love in operation, where the comforts and necessities of life shall be more evenly distributed, yet it will come on a larger and grander scale than their fondest expectation. God’s plan as typified by the dividing of the land by tribes when the Israelites entered Canaan, and by the further division by the tribes into families, and God’s system of Jubilees to restore to the original owner any lost estate, are sufficient to suggest what will happen early . in the Golden Age.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The disposition of Cain to shirk and deny any responsibility toward our brother has prospered and grown until human life is almost outside of our considerations. For this reason poison is easily procured by those who would suicide or murder; revolvers may be had by anyone to rob or to murder. The bootlegger and the dope peddlers ply their trade among the unfortunate's, knowing of course that they are hastening the demise of their victims, and so on. And why! Just because they can make an easy living; and then, of course, they are not their brother** keepers. They will not assume any responsibiB-ty for the damage of poison, guns, and dope.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">There is a reason for this. Did not the preacher and priest ignore the welfare of our young men so as to preach millions of them into a premature death in the trenches! Must we not put them into the same list witlrthose who are not their brother’s keeper! We wonder whether -they realize that it was the spirit of Satan that Cain manifested when he uttered these words. We wonder whether they can see any resemblance between their own warblings (especially since 1917) and Cain’s excuses. </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">H God</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> should ask those preachers and priests: Where are the six million brothers who failed to return from the battle front! we wonder whether they would say: “Am I my brother’s keeper!*</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Young Mr. Rockefeller gave the following reply to those that inquired about the welfare of his employes in his mines and smelting-works in the West (where his profits were immense): that he would not be responsible for the welfare of employes. This reply is just a sample of all of capitalism. The politicians likewise, fail in their responsibilities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Rules for the Christian</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">HE Christian (one having the spirit of the ’ Master) is exhorted to follow'in His steps; and He laid down His life for </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">Hia</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> brethren.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“Hereby know we love, because he [Jesus] laid down his life for us; and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren. But whoso hath the world’s goods, and beholdeth his brother in need, and shutteth up his compassion from </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">him,</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> how doth the love of God abide in him!&quot; (1 John 3: 16,17. R. V.) The principle of gaining life was laid down by our Lord—“He that findeth his life shall lose it: and he that loseth his life for my sake, shall find it” (Matthew 10:39) “Whosoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it; and whosoever shall lose his life shall preserve it.” (Luke 17:33) Expressed in our own words these texts would convey a thought like this: “The best way to gain life is to help others to live.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The spirit of Cain would have us kill our enemies for fear that they may kill us through jealousy. Thus during the World War nearly one-half of the world tried to kill ofikthe. other half. About twelve </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">milli</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ons died in this way, releasing such an amount of nitrogen gas from ’ their decaying bodies that we had of necessity to breathe harder if we would get our needed supply of oxygen. This made possible the easier conveying of disease germs and resulted in ' twenty million deaths by the &quot;flu.” Pestilences have always followed wars, the out-working of God’s law of retribution, which is sure and invincible. The war also upset our economic arrangement to such an extent that nine times the war victims were claimed by famine. So can we not see that when one sends others forth to destroy he kills himself! Any exercise of hate or extreme passion toward our fellows breeds disease in ourselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;When anyone is truly exercised by love, he will desire to make the world a safe place for the other fellow to live in, and the other fellow will reciprocate. Then we shall have more plowshares and fewer swords. Not only is this true . of all classes or nations toward one another, but it is true of families. The same principle also applies to animals which, originally tame, have received from us our beastly spirit, and have become dangerous companions for us. Many of us have no time for flowers, but God says that the whole earth shall blossom as the rose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Flowers give to the air a proper balance, and thus increase our health and vigor. Flowers take up the carbon dioxide and throw off oxygen. We want the oxygen, but have no need of nitro</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">gen. The air is now over seventy percent nitrogen ; so over two-thirds of the air we breathe is inhaled and expelled from our lungs without any benefit Not only that, but it is harmful; for our vitality is less by reason of less oxygen. When the people learn this simple truth, we shall have more flowers. Oh, hasten the day, the Golden Age when this earth will become a paradise and mankind will have the “more abundant life”!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">God’s Wayi Are Equal</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">TF MEN still desire to. shirk their responsibilt-*• ties toward others or to repel those who are pleased to render service, read the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come,, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world. For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in: Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me. Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, and fed thee! or thirsty, and gave thee drink When saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in! or na- <sub>z </sub>ked, and clothed thee! Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee! And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into* everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels : For I was an hungred, and ye gave me no meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me not in: naked, and ye clothed me not: sick, and in prison, and ye visited me not. Then shall they also answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister unto thee! Then he shall answer them, saying, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these, ye did it not to me. And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life eternal.”—Matthew 25:34-46.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Now answer our question: &quot;Am I my brother’s keeper!”</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“‘Jesus said: “No man can come to me, except the Father which hath sent me draw him.” (John 6:44) The man now is drawn to Jesna by what he learns o£ Jesus, what Jesus has done for </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">him,</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> and by his own desire to follow a different course. When one ceases to approve the worldly course and begins to seek after the Lord, he is in that condition mentioned by the Apostle as seeking God, “if haply they might feel after him, and find him.” (Acts 17:27) When he is drawn to Jesus, seeking God, then he is converted. He is now in the condition spoken of by the Apostle when he said: “Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out.” (Acts 3:19) Repentance means a change of mind respecting one's relationship to evil; and conversion means a change of one’s course. But neither repentance nor conversion, nor both together, brings the individual into relationship with God. Being drawn to Jesus, he must exercise faith. Faith means </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">first </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">to understand and believe that God exists; that He is the great rewarder of them that diligently seek </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">Him</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">; that the Bible is.His Word of truth; that Jesus is His beloved Son and our Redeemer ; and </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">then</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> to rely confidently upon these things and prove this reliance by his action. —Hebrews 11:1,6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“’He now needs information to increase his faith, and the Prophet has written: “The testimony of the Lord is sure, making wise ,the simple.” (Psalm 19:7) To such now as are feeling after God, through Christ Jesus this message comes: “Come unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.” (Matthew 11:28) Heavy laden means to be weary of the sinful course of the world and to have a desire to be relieved of this burden. Such a one says: 1 am tired of the wrongful course. I want to follow the right course, to know God, and to do His will.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“‘Now being drawn to Jesus, he learns through the Word that he must do something. Te him Jesus says: &quot;I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.&quot; (John l4: 6) What can one who is now repentant and changing his course, but still a sinner, do to come into harmony with</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">God? He is informed that it will cost him much. So Jesus says to him: ‘Sit down and count the cost’ (Luke 14:28) He learns that it will cost him all he has, namely, the surrender of himself to the Lord. The next step for one, then, to become a Christian is to make a consecration; that is to say, to commit himself to the Lord and His arrangements. And this he may do by saying in substance: 'Blessed Lord, I commit myself to thy arrangements; here I am. Do unto me according to thy holy will. I desire to do thy will.’ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“•Neither the Lord Jesus nor the heavenly Father coerces any one, but we must come to the Lord voluntarily, seeking His aid. This is clearly indicated as necessary to become the follower of Jesus by the words the Master used: ‘If you will be my disciple, you must deny yourself, then take up your cross, and follow me.’ (Matthew 16:24) Self-denial means an agreement, to abandon one’s selfish course and to agree to do the will of the Lord. It means a full and complete surrender of oneself to the Lord. And this is consecration, the setting aside of oneself to do the Lord’s will &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">. Controversy continues to widen the breach among the sects of Christendom. A discussion that engenders no little distrust in all the orthodox beliefs is going on. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&gt;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">To most observers the views of both sides seem amiss. Sorely the leaders of Christendom, if they are right, ought to find some fundamental doctrines, at least, upon which they can agree. But they have not done so. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/ <sup>;</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Perhaps they fear that such' a course would require a too thorough abandoning of their man-made doctrines and 'dogmas and a consequent loss of prestige. Their widely-divergent interpretations have already accomplished this, however. ,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">With this discussion persisting, one cannot avoid taking sides—but there is the disposition to dogmatism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>

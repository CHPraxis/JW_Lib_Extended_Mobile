<h3><a name="bookmark30"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark31"></a>A Glance at the Census of Manufactures</span></h3>
<p><span class="font11">T</span><span class="font6">HERE is always something of interest to be learned from the United States Census. We present herewith a table, which took us a considerable amount of time and energy to compile, and which accumulates in concrete form the principal data obtained by the United States Government in its census of manufactures in 1909 and in 1919.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The table shows merely the totals of the sums expended for labor and materials, and in an adjoining column the sums obtained for the product thus manufactured. It affords a partial key to the industries of the country, indicating which are the most profitable^ It cannot show this positively; for there are various ways of hiding profits. For example slaughtering and packing appear at the bottom of the list; but the profits are diverted into switching, icing and other charges, so that they can be ascertained only by great effort. They are actually much greater than they appear. The packers pay their bookkeepers well.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The table tells its own story so well that comments are superfluous. It is easy to see why the liquor interests did not wish to go out of business. Business was not so good for them in 1919 as in 1909. They had to expend more for labor and materials than they did ten years before, and they got less for their product. But even as it was, when they sold their goods they received $2.09 for every dollar expended in their manufacture; or, in other words, they made an increase of 109% on funds actually employed in manufacture. ,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The drug business comes next. It also is a very profitable business, running in the neighborhood of 100%; and, as in the case of liquor, we have The testimony of eminent physicians to the effect that if all the drugs in the world were sunk to the bottom of the sea the human family as a whole would be in better shape than it is with their use.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is no surprise to find the ice business so profitable. Every winter in the ice lakes on the top of Mount Pocono, along the line of the Lackawanna Railroad, by modern methods of harvesting .a few men gather thousands of tons of purest ice in, a few days, and without any danger or expense worth mentioning. A few months later they sell it at the price which only a brief time ago was considered a good price for coal, obtained at a much greater outlay from every point of view.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Turpentine and rosin are profitable; just why this is we do not know. Paper is in the hands of a few great concerns, virtually a trust. The tobacco profits go to the manufacturers, it will be observed; those who raise it do not get any such profits as those shown.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Salt is profitable. In Western New </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">York, at </span><span class="font6">Retsof, salt is mined at no more than the </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">cost </span><span class="font6">of mining coal, probably much less, and is sold for about $20 a ton. It stands to reason that somebody must make money out of such an arrangement. We do not know the actual selling price per ton, but judge from the </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">prices </span><span class="font6">charged for the pulverized product.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Typewriter manufacture is profitable. </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The </span><span class="font6">typewriter manufacturers are hooked </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">up in a </span><span class="font6">trust, and are charging for typewriters </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">about </span><span class="font6">twice what they should charge. The big increase in the amount of explosives made and sold is attributable in part to the World War. A glimpse at the profits in gas shows plainly why the financiers that own the big newspapers are very much opposed to public ownership of gas works. The profits would then go to the people, and this the financiers do not wish.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We do not proceed further with the discussion of the table, but prefer to let it tell its own story. As we were finishing it, we chanced to have an interview with a gentleman in the lumber business. To test it out, we said to him: &quot;If you do as others in your line, when you sell </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">your</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark32"></a>International Convention of Truth Lovers</span></h4>
<p><span class="font11">T</span><span class="font6">HE Golden Age takes pleasure in announcing that a convention of international interest to truth lovers, to Bible Students, to those who love righteousness and peace, wiU be held this year at Columbus, Ohio, July 20 to 27, inclusive, under the auspices of the International Bible Students Association.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">That it will be of international interest is evident from the fact that many speakers from all parts of the world will be present, and each nationaUty shall have the privilege of listening to speakers of its own tongue. Every reader of The Golden Age is especially invited to attend.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The main meeting hall for the conventioners will be the Coliseum, which has a seating capacity of 14,000. Connected with the Coliseum, and all under roof, are seven other h</span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">alls</span><span class="font6">, which will accommodate meetings for the various languages. All these buildings are located at the Ohio State Exposition Grounds, which are practically in the center of the city of Columbus. The grounds are private, with a grove, lakes, beautiful place for resting; and there those who attend can be entirely isolated from the public.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In addition to this is Memorial Hall, with a capacity of 4,000, which will be in use each evening for a public meeting and which maybe used in the daytime if required for other meetings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is the intention to have a large, well-advertised public meeting on Sunday, July 27, in the Stadium of the Ohio State University, the seating capacity of which is 72,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Columbus, Ohio, is located in the center of a very populous district, including Michigan, Wisconsin, </span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">Illin</span><span class="font6">ois, Tennessee, Kentucky, North and South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, New York and Ontario. It has the best interurban railway system of any city in the country, and is easy of access. The highways leading into it are of the very best, and great numbers of friends will be expected to come by automobile.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Within five blocks of the meeting place there are rooming accommodations for 60,000 people. There are thirty large hotels and a large number of dormitories. We suggest that all who can arrange for a little vacation from the daily routine of life will find this a most helpful and satisfactory way to find recreation, and to engage in a mental, spiritual and social treat.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark33"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark34"></a>Reduced Railroad Rates</span></h5>
<p><span class="font11">A</span><span class="font6">LL the railroads in the United States and</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">- Canada have granted a special rate for this convention of one and one-half fare for the round trip, tickets to be obtained upon the identification certificate plan. These certificates will be furnished by the Convention Committee. Address: R. A. Johnson, Secretary, 52% North Front Street, Columbus, Ohio.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">One identification certificate will do for an entire family. Where one person travels alone one certificate is required. It is better to order more blank certificates than actually are needed; for at the last moment somebody else may wish one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The date of the convention is July 20 to 27 inclusive. Beginning July 15th and until the 22:id for the going trip,.tirkets will be on sale at all railway stations. No tickets can be obtained for the going trip, on the certificate plan, after July 22nd. When purchasing your ticket, present your identification certificate to the ticket agent and ask for a </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">return</span><span class="font6"> ticket. To protect oneself in case of a lost ticket, it will be advantageous at the time of purchasing ticket to make a memorandum of the time bought, amount paid, and the number on the ticket The tickets should read from starting point to Columbus, Ohio, and return.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The highways in Ohio and adjoining places are in fine condition, and many will be expected to come in their automobiles. Thejre is a covered building near the Coliseum that will accommodate five hundred machines. Other garage and parking spaces will be available in the city at reasonable rates^</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark35"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark36"></a>Accommodations and Reservations &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></h5>
<p><span class="font11">C</span><span class="font6">OLUMBUS has thirty hotels with a rate of’ $1.00 per day and up, all of which are within fifteen minutes street-car ride of the Coliseum. Adjoining the grounds where the convention is to be held are private rooms which will accommodate 10,000 or more, all of which are within walking distance of the Coliseum. The rates for these rooms will be fifty cents, seventy-five cents, and one dollar for each person, according to accommodations; and also a rate will be made for room and breakfast. It is expected that this latter rate will be one dollar a day. It is the purpose now to have a cafeteria on the grounds serving meals at noon and evening at very reasonable rates. A person therefore may figure on an expense of not to exceed two dollars a day for a room and meals. If it is possible to make the rate less it will be done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Those attending the convention will have access to the Ohio State Fair Grounds. The grounds contain many shade trees, plenty of pure water, comfort stations, emergency hospital, children's playgrounds, barber shop, dairy buildings which supply fresh milk and icecream, all of which will be for the exclusive use of those attending the convention during the dates of the convention. Some one will be put in charge of the children, and thus an opportunity will be afforded for their mothers to attend the meetings when desired.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Coliseum, where the meetings in English will be held, has a capacity of 14,000 seats. An* electric loud-speaker will be installed so that every person in the auditorium can hear with perfect ease without extra effort being put forth by the speaker.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">For the Sunday meeting an electric loudspeaker will be installed in the Stadium so that every person in the Stadium (which has a capacity of 72,000) can hear. Judge Rutherford, President of the International Bible Students Association, will be The speaker at the Stadium.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">I</span><span class="font6">T IS said that everything improves but government. The great discoveries of fifty years, with increasing light on the Bible, show that progress and improvement is the divine program. The failure of present governments to keep pace in the administration of human rights and proper privileges shows that these institutions are not progressive, not the “last word” by any means. The constant progress referred to, in contrast to the stale and stagnant, milk-and-watery systems, shows that the divine mind is not directing these, but has left them mainly to take their own course, interfering only in the execution of retributive justice, where iniquity comes to the full, and where human activity might encroach somewhat upon the divine plan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Yet the wisdom that has revealed to mankind the arts and sciences, the printing press, the typewriter, the sewing-machine, the railway and marine engines, the auto and the airplane, the telephone and the radio, and thousands of labor-saving devices, such as electric, steam, gas, compressed air and others, will yet establish that form of government which will apply those blessings for the good of all and for the aggrandizement of none!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Judgment also will I lay to the line, and righteousness to the plummet.” “And they shall say, This land that was desolate is become like the garden of Eden.”—Isa. 28:17; Ezek. 36:35.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark39"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark40"></a>Type and Typography </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">By c. J.Fekei</span></h4>
<p><span class="font11">P</span><span class="font6">RINTING bears about the same relation to writing as a shout does to a whisper. What would the world have been without these two methods of expression? We can hardly imagine the situation. It certainly would have hindered progress in civilization. There could now be no typewriters, typesetting machines, printing industry, stationery stores, or post offices. We would have neither folders, catalogues, time tables, menus, posters, handbills, advertising signs, letters, stationery, books, magazines, or newspapers. The world would be submerged in illiteracy. Writing and printing are almost the only mediums by which we retain valuable and trustworthy records. Without these two means, about all of the knowledge we would possess would be either tradition or rumor and hearsay.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Of what value is tradition ? The various heathen religions trace their origin to legends delivered from one generation to another. But to be merely tradition, whether believed by one or a hundred persons, does not prove the truthfulness of any proposition. Long before Columbus was born it was generally believed that the earth is flat. And credulity was no doubt stimulated by tradition. But added to the fact that such information is likely to be untrue at the start, is the strong probability that it will become distorted and colored before reaching the one considering it</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">For instance: How many of us could repeat in every detail a simple story that we heard a year or two ago? Very few, I am sure. Certainly further evidence to demonstrate the uncertainty of tradition is not necessary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Of course, the mere fact that a thing is printed does not prove its truthfulness. Its intrinsic value must be examined; it must be reasoned upon, and compared with other reliable facts before its truth can be established. But it has this advantage, that whereas tradition is often held but by a few, that which is printed is generally accessible to all, and therefore subject to the most widespread criticism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The great God of the universe, who declares the end from the beginning, foreknew of this condition,'and so caused the message of holy men of old-to be retained by writing in a permanent and reliable form. Thus Moses wrote all the words of the Lord. (Exodus 24:4) But lest any one should think that he wrote them with a hammer and chisel on a block of stone, we note that it is recorded: &quot;And the Lord said unto Moses, Write this for a memorial in a book, and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua.&quot; (Exodus 17:14) Joshua also recorded Israel’s covenant with their God (Joshua 24:26); and Samuel told the manner of the kingdom in a book.— 1 Samuel 10:25.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark41"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark42"></a>First Results of Printing</span></h5>

<p><span class="font6">RINTING has been called &quot;the mother of progress.” It unquestionably contributed greatly to the Reformation movement. It is doubtful whether the Reformation could have been carried on without printing. From the time of its invention printing has been used to circulate the Word of God. It was as though Jehovah had placed His finger on an electric switch and said: “Let there be light,” and light flooded the earth. It came, not as a brilliant flare, such as would be caused by a skyrocket bursting over your head, or by a flash of lightning suddenly illuminating all of the landscape, but rather like the removal of thick, impenetrable clouds, thereby revealing a brilliantly illuminated, starlit sky. It did not daze those that beheld it, but rather gave them beams of hope and rays of life and joy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We might compare it to the successor of the old village pump, which is almost altogether out of date now. But possibly in some backward community you may see one standing, kept as a relic for its former service. The well was usually deep, therefore the pump was reliable; and here would gather the little neighborhood to get their daily supply of water. Back and forth .the bucket brigade would go. But suppose, if your imagination will stretch that far, that a change came over this community; and that from the sink in each kitchen of every home, there should spring forth an artesian well. You would not even need a receptacle with which to drink. By lowering your lips you could partake of the refreshing overflow. Water? Streams of it! As clear as crystal! Coming forth endlessly! It was just as the prophet Malachi foretold: “Prove me now herewith, saith the Lord of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive* it.”—Malachi 3:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">So, after the Bible was printed, each family could study their Bible at home. No longer </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">was</span></p>

The two witnesses which had prophesied under sackcloth came to life. (Revelation 11:11) The power of the great Antichrist was broken, foreshadowing that sooner or later ignorance and superstition would be crushed to earth. Just as in the days of Jesus, the people which sat in darkness saw great light (Matthew 4:16), so now too, priesthood, creeds and religious ceremonies would be exposed by “that which is written.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- - - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark43"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark44"></a>The Origin of Printing</span></h5>
<p><span class="font6">ROM our schoolbooks we learned that printing was invented by Johann Gutenberg, of</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19240716_files/g_E_19240716-3.png" alt="" style="width:14pt;height:17pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6">Germany, in the year 1440. More correctly speaking, the invention of printing from movable type took place at that time. Printing means to make copies by impression. Typography means to* take impressions from ink-covered type. Whenever we leave our finger impression on any article, we print, - though we may be entirely ignorant of the art of typography. The earliest date of printing in this sense is not known. -</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Writing preceded printing; and this was carried on in Egypt, Babylon, and China. From the Bible we learn that over 2,400 years elapsed from Adam’s creation to Moses. As Adam lived 930 years, there remain about 1,500 years between them. This period was spanned by five intermediaries, and to Moses was given the first divine commission to write.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As the art of writing is not mentioned previously, it must have been either gradually developed or revealed by Jehovah to His servant Moses. From an early date some of the patriarchs erected stones to commemorate certain occasions. What would be more natural than for men so to inscribe their monuments that they would bring to mind the event or deed that they commemorated? But it is foolish for men to suppose that similarly man evolved the marvel of speech, and brought the incoherent cries of joy and pain, as expressed by the lower animals, under such control as to make them the servants o£ thought. •</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Bible tells us that there were but seven generations? from the perfect man Adam to Jubal, whose musical talent was so developed as to make him the inventor of the harp and the organ. (Genesis 4:21) It may be that the formerly perfect human voice was losing its charm, and therefore the substitution of a mechanical instrument suggested itself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">' The art of printing and writing is closely associated with the development of paper or other writing material. In Egypt the papyrus plant was converted into papyrus writing material. In China a kind of silk was used. In Babylon inscriptions were stamped into soft clay tablets, and these were baked. As a result, in the ruins of Babylon, nearly every kiln-burnt brick has its inscriptions. These tablets are of various shapes—oblongs, cones, and cylinders. They vary from one inch to a foot or more in length.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There are vast libraries containing legal, mathematical and geographical treatises, historical and mythological documents, poetical compositions, and works on astronomy, astrology and religion. One may find lists of stones, birds and beasts, as well as petitions and royal proclamations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In a few words, it is a vast amount of useless reading matter compared to the clear, brief record of the children of Israel found in the Bible, God’s Word of Truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Shortly thereafter parchment, made of sheep skin polished with pumice stone, was used, as well as the skins of other animals. A fine grade of parchment made from the skins of calves is called vellum. It is upon parchment that the oldest manuscripts of the Bible are written.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">FIERCE controversy has raged over who first gave the world a knowledge of typography. This honor is claimed by Italy, Holland, and Germany; but the weight of the evidence is is favor of Johann Gutenberg, a printer of Mainz. He was born about 1397, and is known to have been at work before 1439 in Strassburg, endeavoring to perfect his art. Like that of most inventors, his path was strewn with difficulties. From Strassburg he went to Mainz, where his name appears in a record of legal contract dated 1448. In 1450 he entered a partnership with a wealthy money lender by the name of Johann Fust, or Faust, who furnished the means needed to set up a printing press. In 1455 Fust brought a law suit against Gutenberg to recover the money he had advanced. The verdict was in Fust's favor, nnd the printing press passed out of Gutenberg’s hands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Although sixty years of age Gutenberg did not despair. He determined to found another office. He had some of his printing material, with which he could again make his movable type; and the town clerk provided him with money. He continued his work for some years; but in 1462 all printing in Mainz was interrupted by the sacking of the town during a quarrel of the archbishops. Such events were not unusual at that time, nor should we be surprised at them today.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It happened in this way: The archbishopric of Mainz was claimed by Adolph II, Count of Nassau, who was supported by Pope Pius H. In 1462 he attacked and captured the town because it took sides with Diether, then archbishop and elector of the place. Many citizens were murdered, and the town was sacked. All of its industry was destroyed </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">f</span><span class="font6">thereby the workmen of the printing offices were compelled to flee to other places, carrying their art with them. For three years after the capture of Mainz, nothing of value was printed there. Gutenberg died about February, 1468.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Two friends of Gutenberg, who probably knew of his invention, erected tablets to his memory. One of these was erected in the church at Mainz shortly after his death, and the other in the year 1508 in a law school in that city. The inscriptions speak of him as the inventor of printing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Dutch claim that a Koster, Laurens Jans-zoon, who lived between 1420 and 1440, was the inventor of type. This claim is referred to as the Koster Legend. It did not become public until 1588, or a century and a half after 'Gutenberg began his work. Like all legends, it claims to come from a trustworthy source. According to this account, Koster walked into the woods in 1440, and in the ■ bark of a beech tree cut letters, which he printed on paper for the amusement of some children. Later he printed whole sheets from pictures, later still, from leaden letters, and then from tin type.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In 1441*«ne of Koster’s workmen is supposed to have stolen his type and fled to Mainz, where he opened a workshop, and published two works from Koster’s type in the year 1442. Until 1499 no one seemed to doubt that movable type were first used in Strassburg by Johann Gutenberg, who afterward went to Mainz, as tl*3 Cologne </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Chronicle,</span><span class="font6"> published in 1499, declared. The most severe assault on the claims of Koster </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">was by </span><span class="font6">a Dutchman, Dr. Van der Linde. In a series of articles called the “Koster Legend” he accused as being false the documents that were intended to prove that his countryman was the inventor of typography. So incensed became some of </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font6">Dutch that Dr. Van der Linde deemed it advisable to leave his native land. Today the Koster theory has been abandoned everywhere except in Holland.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark47"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark48"></a>Early Specimens of Printing</span></h5>
<p><span class="font11">T</span><span class="font6">HE earliest specimen of printing from type existing today is the famous Letter of Indulgence of Pope Nicholas V to such persons as should contribute money to help the King of Cyprus against the Turks. A copy of this Indulgence is now preserved in the Meerznan-Wes-treenen Museum at the Hague. It bears the earliest authentic date of a document printed from type—November 15,1454. It declares that a plenary indulgence of three years is granted by Pope Nicholas V on the twelfth of April, 1451, to all persons who from May 1, 1455, should contribute money to aid the King of Cyprus, then threatened by the Turks. (Pope Nicholas proclaimed a Jubilee in 1450; and while it was in progress at Rome, a plague broke out. (Will there be a final and more effective plague at the coming Jubilee in 19251) The Turks took Constantinople during his reign, and his effort to unite Christendom against the Moslems was of no avail.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Other early works are Gutenberg’s Bibles. On these his fame as a great printer rests. There are two editions of the Holy Bible in Latin. They are referred to as the Bible of forty-two and thirty-six lines respectively. These figures refer to the number of lines to the page, in a column. The forty-two line is supposed to be the earlier. It was discovered in 1760, in the library of Cardinal Mazarin at Paris, and is therefore called the Mazarin Bible, or </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Guten</span><span class="font6">berg’s first Bible. The Earl of Ashburnham's copy of the Mazarin Bible on vellum was sold in 1897 for about $20,000. It was probably </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">not </span><span class="font6">begun before 1450, and was finished in 1455. The Paris copy contains'the rubricator's inscription, which shows that the work </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">was com</span><span class="font6">pleted before August 15, 1456.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The thirty-six-line Bible is called the Pfister's or Bamberg Bible, because the type used in it was once owned by Albrecht Pfister of Bamberg. A copy of this Bible was discovered in 1728 in the library of a monastery near Mainz. </span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">A</span><span class="font6"> note found in the manuscript catalogue of the library states that the Bible was given to the monastery by Johann Gutenberg and his associates. The date 1461 is written on a copy of the last leaf of this book. These4<sup>w</sup>&lt;&gt; editions of the Bible, like all of Gutenberg’s works, are without the name and place of the printer, due probably to his fear of lawsuits, which had already caused him great expense.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Other works ascribed to Gutenberg are the Calendar of 1457, the Catholicon of 1460, and a Letter of Indulgence of 1461. Indulgences are hot popular in the United States today because intelligent people will not believe that God has reposed the sole and complete power of designating punishment and forgiveness of sins, in the hands of priests. The favor of God cannot </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">be </span><span class="font6">purchased with money. * The Bible tells us that if we confess our sins to God in the name </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font6">Jesus Christ, then He is faithful and just to <sup>1</sup> forgive us our sins, and that the blood of Jesus Christ will cleanse us from all unrighteousness. —1 John 1:9; 2:1,2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Our Lord taught us to pray, saying, &quot;And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.” (Matthew 6:12) There is abundant further evidence on this point. (Ephesians 4:32; Colossians 2:13; Matthew 18:35; Acts 13:38) There is no need for a priest or father on earth to forgive us our sins, when we have a Father and ever faithful High Priest in heaven. The confessional still prospers, but thank God the day is near when the knowledge of God will cover the earth as the waters cover the deep.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark49"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark50"></a>The </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Progress of Printing</span></h5>
<p><span class="font11">I</span><span class="font6">T IS said that William the Conqueror could not write his name; and that therefore he had &quot;William” engraved on a bit of wood, and approved documents by pressing his stamp first on an ink pad and then on his paper. But when once printing on paper in a commercial way started, it progressed rapidly. The art carried on at Mainz soon spread to other cities and countries, as traveler* were constantly passing through this town to the Netherlands, France, Italy, and Switzerland. Just as by divine providence, the persecution of the early Christians in Palestine scattered them over Europe and disseminated their doctrine, so the quarrel of the archbishops in 1462 dispersed the printers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Presses were soon set up in other cities; by the end of the fifteenth century more than one hundred and fifty towns were practising the art. Three printers from Germany established a press in Paris in 1470, and in 1477 England took up the art In France, Germany, and Italy typography was practised most extensively, and here the greatest improvements were made. Before the year 1500, over two hundred printers practised the art in Venice, and it is to Italy that we are indebted for the Italic and the Roman type. The latter is the most extensively used today. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Among the printers of Venice was Aldus Ma-nutius, who began his work in 1494. He was . a man of great learning and industry, and exercised extreme care in his work. His press became celebrated for its Greek and Latin classics, He introduced the Italic type and probably devised the present system of punctuation; for before his time but few marks were used, and their use was not well regulated. This knowledge should lead us to understand that the translators of the so-called “Authorized Version” were not infallible in the punctuation of their translation of the Holy Scriptures. As a matter of fact the work on this version was not begun until between 1604 and 1607, or over a hundred years after the origin of punctuation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The translators were unfortunate enough to misplace a comma in Luke 23:43, and thereby changed a simple,' reasonable text of Scripture into a puzzle that for a long time no one could solve. Properly punctuated the passage reads, &quot;And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee today, Thou shalt be with me in paradise.” In due time the thief will be with Jesus in the kingdom, which we see now in process of establishment in the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Contrast, for a moment, printing as it was after its invention with what it is today. With painstaking care the printer would set up every letter of his type, place it in a form, and by a slow and laborious method repeatedly ink his type and take impressions on his sheets. The wealthy looked at the new art as an inartistic trade, and so compelled the printer to copy the characters of contemporary manuscripts in order to sell his work. Today typesetting machines rapidly assemble the letters, and many speedy presses turn out a printed sheet every second. In addition we have typewriters. There are over 500,000 Corona typewriters in use, beside greater numbers of Remington, Underwood, Oliver, Royal, and machines of other manufacture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Within the last forty years the printing industry in America has jumped from practically nowhere to the rank of sixth in size among our industries. Toward the close of the last century, there were but four newspapers in India, all printed in the English language; whereas today there are two hundred thirty-two printed in the native tongue of Hindustani, besides others in English and the various vernaculars.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark51"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark52"></a>Pamphlets, Magazines, Newspapers, Etc.</span></h5>
<p><span class="font11">W</span><span class="font6">ITH the invention of the printing press, the tract and pamphlet came into existence. With the possibility of indefinitely multiplying copies, it became true as never before that “the pen is mightier than the sword.” In 1915 Great Britain made one of its ablest men, Lord Northcliffe, a Minister of State, with the assigned duty of Minister of Propaganda. So Lord Northciffe began scattering pamphlets over the nations of earth. Further propaganda through newspapers and books was carried on by all of the nations in the great World War.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the early days, when Rome was still in power, heralds were stent forth who read to the people what the government wished them to believe. After the invention of printing, Venice endeavored to tell the people certain facts; and so a sheet was published called the “Gazetta,” out of which has grown the modern magazine. In writing for a magazine one may take ample time to express his real belief rather than merely a passing thought, as in a newspaper. A magazine should be worth keeping, a newspaper only worth reading.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">While the “Gazetta” flourished in Italy, the “News Letter” was being printed in Germany, France, and England. This developed into the daily newspaper. Napoleon III said that he received all his knowledge from the two sources: His mother, who taught him to read; and his newspaper, which supplied the rest. Some one has said: “If we can get truth and cleanness of soul, ideals that are honest and worth while, before the eyes of all men in books, and let this vaccine seep into their natures, then we have saved mankind.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But anyone who looks inside of our big metropolitan dailies knows how impossible such a task really is. These papers are of the sensational type. They devote a large percentage of their space to playing up what is abnormal and unusual in daily city and country life. They deal with the famous and the </span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">infam</span><span class="font6">ous, with that which is deserving of public admiration or public scorn. The average reader briefly reviews the fires, collisions, murders, suicides, and other similar abnormalties, hoping to derive a thrill from the recital of some gruesome incident, but finds that it always leaves a feeling of disappointment. Practically all modern newspapers and magazines could be very well dispensed with. They have deteriorated from news organs to propaganda mediums.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But the strangest thing of all is that people will actually pay to have their minds swayed, prejudiced and blinded by this means. I am glad that The Golden Age is not of this character. Nearly everybody knows that it is next to impossible for the average editor to tell the truth, to publish the facts in every case, or to express his own convictions. Yet you will find a newspaper in every nook and cranny of the civilized earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Take a stroll on a lonely lane, or a crosscountry hike through the woods, and see if you can get very far without a piece of newspaper catching your eye. This organ of worldly wisdom appealing to the simple reminds one by contrast with true wisdom's call: “Doth not wisdom cry? and understanding put forth her voice? She standeth in the top of high places, by the way in the places of the paths. She crieth at the gates, at the entry of the city, at the coming in at the doors. Unto you, O men, I call; and my voice is to the sons of man.—Prov. 8:1-4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">What do we find in our daily sheets? Some papers dare to assume the motto, “All the news that's fit to print.” Others, “The truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.”. But one is more inclined to believe the saying,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">&quot;Here’s to the news that lies in daily sheets, That lies, and lies, and lie#.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">How newspapers grope for the sensational, the scandalous, the malicious, the filth of families and society! How they laud the spectacular, the daring plots and intrigues of men! How faithfully they promote foolishness and evil sur-</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">misings! Through the funny sheet they</span><span class="font6"> inculcate the spirit of laughter at another's misfortune, and the practice of daily deception. Where is the community that is elevated by their influence! What beneficial reform have they instituted! There is none. “For a dog to bite a man is nothing, but for a man to bite a dog is news. It is new, it is startling.&quot; So says Mr. Brisbane, of the New York </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">American.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">From start to finish, the metropolitan papers of today are sensual, devilish. One is almost prone to ask, “Have the honest, the noble, the pure, the good, the just, the virtuous, the lovers of truth, the merciful, and the holy perished from the earth 7” They have, as far as the newspaper is concerned. It is just as prophecy foretold. “This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come. For men shall be lovers of their own selves; covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, . . . truce breakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good, traitors, heady, highminded, . lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God; having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away.”—2 Timothy 3:1-5; Romans 1: 21-32.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But, thank God, the end is near! Very soon the hail shall sweep away the refuge of lies, and the waters shall overflow the hiding places. (Isaiah 28:17; 11: 9) Then it will be true that this evil influence heretofore exerted will compare to drops of water dancing on top of a red-hot stove. The activity of these drops is great for a short time, but all their liveliness and sputtering finally end in evaporation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Occasionally singular things are said in type. </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">'A Chinese </span><span class="font6">editor, on returning a contribution, enclosed a rejection slip that read as follows: “We have read your manuscript with infinite delight. Never before have we reveled in such </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">masterpiece. If we printed it, the authorities would take jt for a model, and henceforth would never permit anything inferior to it. As it would be impossible to find its equal within ten thousand years, we are compelled, though shaken with sorrow, to return your divine manuscript; and for </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">so</span><span class="font6"> doing we beg ten thousand pardons.&quot;</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark53"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark54"></a>The Individuality of Type</span></h5>
<p><span class="font11">W</span><span class="font6">HAT inanimate thing fulfils the following description! “Each object has a </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">face, shatdder, body and feet.</span><span class="font6"> Some have </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">beards,</span><span class="font6"> and under certain conditions a </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">widow</span><span class="font6"> is produced. In addition some may </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">get off their feet,</span><span class="font6"> even though none are addicted to the liquor habit. They may at this time </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">be locked up in a form. </span><span class="font6">As in every family there is an occasional black sheep, so here too, once in a while, one needs </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">bringing up.</span><span class="font6"> Sometimes they are engaged </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">in a chase,</span><span class="font6"> and if well </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">dressed</span><span class="font6"> will remain quite </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">composed.</span><span class="font6"> They exist in </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">families,</span><span class="font6"> always leave an </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">impression,</span><span class="font6"> and eventually reach a box called </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Hell.&quot;</span><span class="font6"> Of course there is no fire in it. It would be easy enough- to name the animate being that fulfils this description, but the more difficult inanimate thing is type. This shows that there is something human about type; for the above terms are just a few of everyday occurrence in the printing office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">While type has been used for an evil purpose, it has also done untold good. What Robert H. Davis said of the printing press is even more true of type:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“I sing the songs of the world, the oratories of history, the symphonies of all time. I am the voice of today, the herald of tomorrow. I weave into the warp of the past the woof of the future. I tell the stories of peace and war alike. I make the human heart beat with passion and tenderness. I stir the pulse of nations and make them do braver deeds, and soldiers die. I inspire the midnight toiler, weary at his loom, to lift his head again and gaze with fearlessness into the vast beyond, seeking the consolation of a hope eternal. When I speak, a million people listen to my voice. The Saxon, the Latin; the Celt, the Hun, the Slav, the Hindu, all comprehend me. I'cry the joys and sorrows of every hour. I fill the dullard's mind with thoughts uplifting. I am Light, Knowledge, Power. I epitomize the conquests of mind over matter. I am the recorder of all things that mankind has achieved. My offspring comes to you in the candle’s glow, amid the dim lamps of poverty, the splendor of riches; at sunrise, at high noon, and in the waning evening. I am the laughter and the tears of the world, and I shall never die until all things return to the immutable dust.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But what is it that makes a piece of printed matter appeal to a person, while another will be given but passing attention! It is not always the curiosity or the question aroused, nor the fact that the subject matter is the hobby of the one concerned. It may be the quality of the work and the workmanship. In America, where there is so much competitive printing, this matter should not be overlooked. The paper on which the message is printed should create respect for the message. It has been wisely said that printed matter for public distribution should not be smaller than 10 point To violate this rule, makes it more difficult to read; and some people will be prevented from reading it altogether.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But it is not enough that printing be legible. There is an elusive thing called grace, which comes from using well that apparel of words called type. As a person's demeanor may leave the opposite impression from his words, so also with that which is printed. Either it may suggest dignity, character, strength, and delicacy, or it may show weakness or lack of personality. The printed salesman may be well dressed and courteous, or slovenly attired and inconsiderate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There are many f</span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">amili</span><span class="font6">es of type, each having its peculiar characteristics. Many readers would be able to recognize Script, Old English, Gothic, Roman, or Italic. Type is also classified as condensed, extra condensed, expanded, bold, bold condensed, bold Italic, etc. '</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark55"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark56"></a>Methods of Printing</span></h5>
<p><span class="font11">S</span><span class="font6">O FAR, printing from an elevated surface (letterpress printing) alone has been considered. But there are two other principal .ways: First, from an indented surface; and second, from a plane surface. In the first method from an indented surface, called copperplate printing, the whole surface is first inked. The flat surface is then cleaned, leaving ink only in the incision or trenches cut by the engraver, so that when dampened paper is laid over the plate and pressure is applied, the paper sinks into the incision, and takes up the ink, making impressions in lines on the paper. This method is also called the Intaglio, or Gravure, etc., and is the exact reverse of the letterpress or half-tone process.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The other method is the Planographic, or plane surface. Here the design is in the same plane as the surrounding surface (neither above nor below, as in the previous methods). By chemical treatment, the design is made to attract ink while the surrounding surface repels it. In this case when the irfk roller passes over the plate, the ink will adhere only to the design., This inked plate will either print directly on the paper, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">aa </span><span class="font6">in Lithography, or first transfer the design to a rubber blanket and from this to the paper, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">as </span><span class="font6">in the Offset Process. Experiments have been made along other Enes of printing, such as by Photography, etc.,with some commercial results.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">These varied methods have had a marvelous effect on human history. By scattering knowledge printing causes people to think. Barbarian tribes became civilized under its influence, and narrow, winding paths through dense' forests gave way to paved highways. It broke the barriers of isolation and distance. It raised the standard of Eving. PracticaUy all inventions date after the birth of printing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The prophecy of Daniel declares: “Many </span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">shall </span><span class="font6">run to and fro, and knowledge shall be increased.” (Daniel 12:4) Printing stimulated manufacturing, buying and selling. At first it was considered a luxury, just as electric Eghts, gas stoves, rocking chairs, washing machines, and automobiles were considered. Today it is a present need. It has the power of making people realize vividly the comforts we enjoy from the luxuries of today. Whenever the </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">crav</span><span class="font6">ings of natural men so appealed to cannot </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">be </span><span class="font6">satisfied, discontent and dissatisfaction are sure to foUow. It is thus preparing for the Great Day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The effect of printing is weE iUustrated by the foUowing chart:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Bate of</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">While from 1870 to 1923 the population of the United States increased almost threefold, the people’s wants and needs as expressed in manufactured articles increased over eighteen times.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">What a blessing printing will be in the age to come! It will breathe holy thoughts, convey sweet messages, and keep on record permanent friendships. As long as reliable records will be treasured, it will hold its own, always attesting God's wisdom, justice, love, and power. It will please the eye with scenes from lands afar off, and fill the mind with wisdom from above.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Thousands of farms are lying idle, and the farmers with their sons and daughters who recently invaded the ranks of city labor only augment the likelihood of deeper distress </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">q</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> a wave length of 273 meters, by the Editor) </span><span class="font6">amongst the unemployed. Many places are showing less activity in the construction of new residences, and city property is lagging. There is a slight increase in dealing in farm lands in a few communities. But, withal, it seems that we are on the verge of a let-up in business which spells hard times.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Printing conditions in New York city have gotten so bad from the publishers' point of view that during the past eighteen months nine magazines have moved to other points. “Collier's/' with a weekly circulation of 1,250,000 copies, was.the latest to move. “Hearst's,&quot; “Harper's,&quot; “McCall's,&quot; and others have moved away. It is thought that the MacFadden publications, twelve magazines with a combined circulation in excess of four millions monthly, may be the next to seek the way of least resistance. Everything, practically, in New York is operated on the “closed shop” plan, with wages high. Most of the printing concerns which move away resume publication on the “open shop” plan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">New Era in Industry '</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">I</span><span class="font6">N THE Baltimore and Ohio Railroad shops the lamb and the lion seem at present to be lying down together, and for once the lamb is not inside the lion. The so-called Glenwood Plan of railroad shop cooperation was designed by the president of the International Association of Machinists, and is now in force throughout the shops of the Baltimore and Ohio system with the result that 3,500 more shopmen are at work on the B. &amp;&nbsp;O. than during previous years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At a recent convention of the shopmen mention was made of 4,000 items of improvement in working, safety, and sanitary conditions around shops, yards and roundhouses. The statement is made that things which it used to take months or years to accomplish are now accomplished almost instantaneously; such as improvements in the heating, lighting and ventilation of shops, the drainage of engine pits, the repair of shop flooring, etc. The President of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad is reported as being as enthusiastic about the plan as are the shopmen themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Mr. Herbert Hoover, Secretary of Commerce, believes that the nation is moving toward some sort of industrial democracy. He said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">&quot;I believe we are in the presence of a new era in the organization of industry and commerce in which, if properly directed, lie forces pregnant with infinite possibilities of moral progress. I believe that we are, almost unnoticed, in the midst of a great revolution or—perhaps a better word—a transformation in the whole super-organization of our economic life. We are passing from a period of extremely individualistic action into a period of associational activities.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Our thought is that we are passing through the birthpangs not only of a new industrial arrangement, but also of a new financial, social, religious and political one. The old system is passing away in its entirety, and it is dying hard. The new era into which the world will soon find itself is the Golden Age of prophecy. This momentous change not only is taking place in America, but is world-wide. It is for all to take hope, to be encouraged, to trust in the Lord, and to await the full inauguration of the new day; for surely it is dawning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The enormous rents in.Washington, D. C., and some other cities, are- said to be caused by real estate owners mortgaging their properties in excess of the sale prices. In Washington thirty-two of the larger apartment houses are mortgaged nine million dollars more than the amount paid for them. Mortgage investment companies are doing a thriving business. It often occurs that these money sharks are sharper than the bankers; for some banks have been stung by being overloaded with these inflated mortgages.</span></p>

The most dangerous cities in the United States from the standpoint of murder were, in the order named: Memphis, Nashville, New Orleans, Louisville, St. Louis, Cincinnati, Washington, D.

<p><span class="font11">T</span><span class="font6">HE city of Los Angeles is stirred because </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">teacher, Professor Willis T. Nt-wton, instructor in history and economics at one of the high schools, made the statement in an address before the teachers that “we cannot get rid of war unless we teach peace?’ In the eyes of some 100-percent-profiteer Americans, this was a terrible thing for a teacher to say; and Professor Newton should be hanged immediately, while the subject is being discussed over his remains.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">One of the physicians of the city, defending Professor Newton, sent a letter to the Los Angeles </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Record</span><span class="font6"> in which he said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“The object of teaching is to provoke thought in </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font4">pupiL It has been the devotion of </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font4">benighted </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">clergy </span><span class="font4">during the dark ages to prevent thought.

<p><span class="font6">The boys of the country have lost a good friend. Samuel C. Dyke, the first American manufacturer of boys’ marbles, is dead. One thing that interests us is as to why every boy begins to play marbles in the spring as soon as the frost is out of the ground; but the girls never play marbles, although they do play jacks. Perhaps they do not like to get down into the mud; or perhaps they cannot shoot straight!</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">T</span><span class="font6">HE United States Chamber of Commerce has been holding its annual convention in Cleveland. As might be expected from those who covet all the revenues of the country, it is opposed to lower freight rates, is opposed to making income tax returns public, is opposed to the soldiers’ bonus, is opposed to governmental aid in the marketing of agricultural products, is opposed to limiting the Supreme Court in its encroachments upon the powers of the people, is opposed to government regulation of business, is opposed to the government's going into any kind of business, is opposed to interfering with the packers, is opposed to oil investigations ; and- it warns against the activities of radicals, that is, of people who think. The United States Chamber of Commerce is a great institution, but it is covered with moss a foot thick. It needs to punch itself and to awake to a realization that we are not living in the year 1492.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Senator Henrik Shipstead of Minnesota, referring to the Federal Reserve Banks’ discounting of $5,000,000 of European&quot; paper, declared that the man who is responsible for this new adventure into Europe is the same man, Paul M. Warburg, who is responsible for the Federal Reserve system. Senator Shipstead is reported as sayingt</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">the international bankers in complete control of the money and credit of the country, they can do to the people precisely what the b</span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">ank</span><span class="font4">ers of Germany did to the people there. It is said that the reason for this new policy is the desire to stimulate exports financed by American credit. We have had experiences along these lines, but we seem to have forgotten the terrible price we paid for financing European purchases in America. We had a perfectly jolly time doing it during the.war. We extended credit to Europe, and Europe bought goods of all kinds in our markets and paid any price we asked. We did a tremendous business on our own money and credit. The American bankers are gambling with trust funds belonging to other people. They did it before, and lost; and the American people are now paying the price. The first result of this new scheme will be artificial stimulation of exports and business. It may start an artificial business boom that will carry us until after election. It is also evident that it is going to be used as a club to force the acceptance by Europe of the Dawes Plan, and to compel the American producer to carry more of the European debt than he is already carrying. We have ’already sent too much credit to Europe. The continued squandering of bank credits as is now proposed by the Federal Reserve Board controlled by the international banking group, will inevitably pauperize the people of this nation just as the bankers have done in Germany ind other countries where credit and money have been manipulated in the interest of the few at the expense of the many.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Within the past two years, despite the existence of the Federal Reserve colossus that is supposed to prevent such things, there have been over six hundred bank failures in Montana, North and South Dakota, and Minnesota. Banks are failing now at the rate of nine each week. Some time ago, because of bank failures, many depositors were withdrawing their money from the banks, and buying postal savings and government bonds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A sample of a good job of self-whitewashing done by one of our modern financiers is seen in the recent contribution of the Dohenys of $600,-000 toward the building of a “church.” This sum is probably considered enough for one family to buy absolution from all past sins and to get a certificate of indulgences for all time to come.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark67"></a>The Profits of Patriotism</span></h5>
<p><span class="font11">T</span><span class="font6">HE House Committee which is investigating the Shipping Board is finding another easy way by which fortunes are made. The Shipping Board, it seems, necessarily has large sums of money in its possession for carrying on its work. These sums run into </span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">milli</span><span class="font6">ons of dollars. They are placed on deposit with certain banks, where in some instances it requires four or five men to see to their proper investment. The government receives no interest on these huge sums, but meantime is itself a borrower, paying about five percent for the use of money. The bank makes about twelve percent on the money which it gets from the government for nothing. It has been observed that the banks which are chiefly favored by this nice little arrangement, by which they make seventeen percent at the expense of the American people, generally have on their board of directors people who contributed heavily to the 1920 Republican campaign fund.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Teapot Dome Oil Magnate Sinclair is reported as having tried to borrow $27,000,000 from the Shipping Board in 1920, for the purpose of carrying on oil developments in Mexico. The Board rejected the proposition; and Mr. Fall, our late Secretary of the Interior, canceled a contract which the Interior Department had with the Shipping Board, causing a loss to the Merchant Marine of $6,000,000 annually. As a result the Shipping Board was compelled to buy oil in the open market.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">These transactions at the time received but very slight notice in the big dailies. The present disclosures tell of an arrangement between Fall and Sinclair which was to extend over a period of five years and in which Sinclair was to get the needed $27,000,000 anyhow, keep the profits, build up a big business; and if any complications arose with Mexico, the United States was to fight the battle. It was proposed to return the principal in instalments—maybe.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">ORMER Vice-President Thomas R. Marshall, in a recent speech at Chicago, said ironically: “The model citizen today is the man who can successfully evade the laws.” We have not his entire speech before us; but he was talking of the troubles and distress in America, which included the scandals in official circles, the corrupt politics, and preachers* dabbling in politics.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">According to this popular view, which Mr. Marshall properly scored with his sarcasm, the model man is the rich man who can buy immunity in the courts, bribe his way through, keep his skirts clean, steal railroads, oil and coal reserves, monopolize the medium of exchange, raise and lower prices at will, rob the people through profiteering and taxation, and otherwise hold the masses in subjection to a system of bewhiskered, strutting hypocrisy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Mr. Marshall further said: “You send your fools to Washington, and keep the wise men at home to whitewash the fences.” We suppose Mr. Marshall covertly meant to say that the legislators are sent to Washington to do the dirty work, and that the real rulers, the financiers, whitewash their acts, so that not one of them is punished.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">A</span><span class="font6">FTER the passage of the Bonus Bill, stocks - fell a few points because many persons had been deceived into thinking that this Bonus Bill would be injurious to the interests of big business. However, the stock market has since recuperated. *Moreover, in view of the fact that big^ business will have the custody of these bonus funds (and that most of the soldiers will never get anything unless they die or commit suicide because of inability to gain employment!) it is evident that the financiers have nothing to fear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Carrying out of the Bonus Law has resulted in a call fo^3,500 now clerks at Washington and the printing of 30,000 application and instruction forms. It is estimated that 3,033,283 veterans will be paid by the insurance policy method; while 389,583 will be paid in cash of $50 or less. One of the nice jobs which confront the clerks is that among the 6,893,000 names which must be checked, there are 50,000 persons named Smith; and they must decide which of these are entitled to insurance or cash and for how much.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">T</span><span class="font6">HE Federal prisons are being filled to more than capacity. New laws are making this possible. In 1913, a law making it a felony to steal from an interstate shipment gave the Federal courts many cases; in 1914, the Harrison Anti-Drug Act took another large field of crime into the Federal courts; in 1919, the Dyer Act (governing the interstate transportation of -stolen automobiles) was adopted, widening still further the mouth of the criminal river that empties into Federal prisons. So great has become the business on this river that bills are now pending in Congress for the appointment of additional Federal judges in various districts of the country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The fact that it is dangerous to go to war is emphasized by statistics furnished by the “American Legion Weekly.” It points out that 125,000 war veterans have died since July 30, 1919. It is estimated that 26,000 will die during 1924, or at the rate of seventy-two a day. Poison gas and exposure are not good for anyone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">If the governments of this world are pari and parcel of Christ’s kingdom, then the United States government will come in for an unusual lot of praise, having just completed a bomb which weighs 4,300 pounds.

<p><span class="font6">ity. The New York papers on May 20 published six pictures, all of which were very good. An actual experiment shows that a period of only thirty-three minutes was required between the click of the camera in Cleveland and the turning out of a completed negative of the picture in New York. The actual sending of the pictures by wire required four and one-half minutes. The basis for the transmission of the pictures is the fact that by means of the photo-electric cell every variation of a beam of light can be translated into a variation of electric current ' which can again be translated into a variation of light. A small spot of light is passed through a lens and directed upon the photograph to be transmitted. The photographic film is on a cylinder; as the cylinder revolves, the point of light passes through it and falls upon a potassium pencil. The fluctuations of current in the <sub>e</sub> pencil are then imposed on the current which flows through the telephone wires. The photographs to be transmitted are traced in lines one-sixty-fifth of an inch apart, that distance havingbeen found to be the best for newspaper purposes.</span></p>

For example, the New Hampshire Congregational Conference on the closing day of its 123rd session passed resolutions withdrawing all support from any future war in which the United States might engage. The resolution denounces war as &quot;the most colossal and ruinous collective sin on earth ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Board of Bishops of the Methodist Episcopal Church, chiefest of all the shouters for war in the crazy days of the reign of the one who “kept us out of war,” have issued an address in which they have termed war a &quot;monstrosity of the Pagan past” and “a law of the jungle.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Can we really hope that these bishops have learned all this in seven years? It seems too much for them to have absorbed in that time. We fear that if another war starta it will be found that they have really not teamed this lesson at all; indeed, it seems that after fourteen days of discussion of the above recommendations the general conference at Springfield, Mass., was not able on May 19 to decide wholly in favor of these expressions of protest against war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Catholic Church also, which has had a hand in every war that has been fought in the last thousand years, has had a meeting at Washington in which its representatives have adopted resolutions urging the necessity of work for world peace.

Coining out of meeting on Sunday evening last, I was introduced to a Roman Catholic ^ho that evening had heard the “truth” for the first time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This man had only recently arrived from England, having been advised verbally by agents in England, and assured by advertisements in English papers, and by streamers strung along the streets, that in Canada there is plenty of work to be had. He was told: &quot;Oh, yes! There are some unemployed, but they are those who won't work.” On the strength of these promises he came to Canada, and up to the time of writing he is still out of work. Hia case is typical of thousands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">And yet, from the Imperialists’ point of view, it is a pretty good scheme to have plenty of men on the market. Not with reference to the economic phase of the question—the wages are, of <sup>4 </sup>course, affected—but with another war in sight, what is better than to have plenty of malcontents! &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">We asked him: “After such experiences in the army, and after all you have suffered, what would be your attitude should another war break out!” “Well,” he replied without hesita« tion, “I’d do the same as I did before. I have nothing to lose but my life, and I might as well die suddenly as die by degrees.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">So there you have it. Given thousands of men in that state of mind, the world leaders would have no difficulty in finding fodder for their next war.</span></p>

I'm only a tenant here. I’m hungry. I haven’t had anything to eat for days. I have three children here; and my wife is in bed, sick.

<p><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">This</span><span class="font6"> story may seem far-fetched; but it is an actual occurrence and, we believe, only one of many that are not generally known. Oh, yes, we have “charitable” institutions; but “charity,” like “Christianity,” is a very much misunderstood term.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A case in point was related in a local paper recently. A man selling goods from door to door to </span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">mak</span><span class="font6">e sufficient to keep him out of the workhouse, was told by a good church woman that he was a nuisance. She warned him to keep away, or she would have him arrested. Further, she informed </span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font6"> that he had no right to be selling goods in that manner. There were merchants, reputable men, who attended to her wants. “But,” she vouchsafed, “if it’s a case of charity, then you should make your wants known to the proper authorities so that they might be attended to in a business-like way.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There’s the rub: “In a business-like way.” “Charity” and “Christianity” indeed! Have your wants attended to in a business-like way, feed your hungry children and your sick wife, and clothe them, in a business-like way. Then come to church on Sunday; and we’ll save your soul in a business-like way. Oh, for a world with true charity, with true Christianity; where every man is brother, and every woman sister, and where, indeed, an onlooker might truthfully say, as they said in the early days: “How they love one another!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Catholic Church in Quebec has had a tiff with the Catholic Government of that Province. The Premier got sore, and would not attend the blessing of the Church bells. Of course, it will be patched up, and the bells will be blessed in due time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Some months ago the Premier had a tiff with the Cardinal. Just previous to the provincial election the Premier had an editor arrested; and, as there was no law on the statute under which the editor could be jailed, the Premier had a law made to order. The Cardinal stated in his paper that he did not like this sort of thing. Perhaps he saw a vision of impending events. In any case, the Premier warned him to keep quiet, or he would not get any more government support The gift of $15,000,000 referred to in a previous report was subsequent to this warning of the Premier; so we assume that the Cardinal took the Premiers advice and kept quiet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In any case, events are quiet at present Whether or not the calm presages an immediate storm is uncertain. Many serious things are pending. To mention only three: Church Union is still before Parliament; the Home Bank case is how in the hands of the lawyers; and the Ontario government officials connected with the bond deals are under arrest, awaiting their trials. These will be subjects for future letters.</span></p>

Everything is stolen that is not nailed fast. The occupation officers are seizing whole house furnishings, for military men who are sending the valuable pieces and rugs to France, although they are the property of the German rich. We are absolutely powerless, and victims of French wantonness and force. There is no law whatever in the occupied territory. He who has to face a court is convicted a priori.

Close attention is being paid to the development of water power. In the north, the snow-clad Alps furnish a perpetual stream, while the Apennines, stretching from north to south, contain innumerable sites for waterpower projects that will supply power during the winter months. Italy now has nearly a hundred great reservoirs beautifully constructed, and so situated with respect to one another that it is possible to link, them into one great hydroelectric system.

This is a remarkable exhibition of brotherly love. In many respects, life in prison is worse than death itself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Socialists claim that in the elections in Italy there were hundreds of cases of frauds, terrorisms, beatings, and even killings by the Fascisti at the polls. They claim that although the law provides for secret voting, yet in thousands of polling places, the booths were wide open and Fascisti gunmen were in them to see that all the voters voted the black-shirt ticket. In a Naples polling place, a man who dared to protest against the irregularities had his head crushed; and in Molinella a Socialist who disobeyed the command that he must not vote the Socialist ticket was killed on the streets as he left the polling place. In Milan, which went heavily Socialistic, as soon as the result was known the Fascisti wrecked nearly all the opposition newspaper offices and more than fifty cooperative stores.</span></p>

Mussolini ordered everybody, including the Socialists, to appear in full evening dress, although the session opened in the morning. Several of the Socialists could not come because they didn’t have any evening clothes. The king and the queen of Italy drove to the Parliament in coaches covered with gilt paint. Drivers of the coaches were dressed to suit The coaches were preceded and followed by men with shining breastplates and plumed helmets, wearing black-topped boots and white breeches. The throne was under a canopy of red velvet, decorated with the royal arms in gold. One of the deputies who obeyed Mussolini’s command came in full evening dress, and wore yellow shoes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">After the performance Mussolini and his friends sang the Fascist war song. Mussolini took occasion to say that the whole world was , watching the experiment of a Fascist Parliament.

<h4><a name="bookmark25"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark106"></a>The Earth To Be Made Glorious</span></h4>
<p><span class="font11">T</span><span class="font6">HE earth is declared to be God’s footstool;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">and the Bible says that God will make the place of His feet glorious. (Isaiah 60:13) A footstool seems to signify a place of rest. For ages God had been creating, forming and bringing to perfection His universe. He had gotten as far as the earth, bringing it through six epochs of development, and had crowned it with man made in His mental and moral image. He had prepared a beautiful, life-giving garden for man's sustenance and happiness; and after creating Adam and Eve He rested from further creative work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Had man remained in harmony with the law of his nature (for God’s law of perfection was written in man’s physical organism) he would have continued to live on into the illimitable ages of eternity. But disobedience marred it all; the threatened death sentence was inflicted; man begali to die; and in the dying state he brought forth his children below the plane of perfection. Therefore, also, his children must die—the sin of the father being visited upon the children.—Romans 5:12. *</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But God had purposed to have this earth a glorious place. The garden of Eden, prepared for the infant race, was a sample of what the earth was to be. Thorns, thistles and briars, and destroying and disease-carrying insects were to be man’s friends while he is a convict laborer. Winning his bread by sweat of face would give him something to do to keep'him measurably out of mischief.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Knowing man’s inability, and letting man take a course which should teach him to know his own inability, God in mercy and longsuffering has sent help. Man cannot redeem his brother, nor give to God a ransom for him; so God sent forth His Son, the Logos, known to man as Jesus, to redeem and to restore humanity to that perfection which was in Adam before sin came into the world. Jesus Himself declared that He came to seek and to save that which was lost. Human perfection, life rights, an Edenic home, and world, dominion had been lost.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jesus, by keeping the divine law inviolate, demonstrated that He had a right to perpetuate forever His human life, which included the earth to live upon. He surrendered these in a sacrificial death in the interest of Adam and his children, and was raised in His resurrection to the highest spirit nature, as a reward for His proven loyalty to God, and in order not to prevent these rights from going to the world at large. He had forfeited nothing. These human rights are still His; and since He has no personal use for them, they are to be bestowed upon those for whom Christ died.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">God has a plan; and that plan includes the reign of Christ over the earth for one thousand years as sole Monarch, as the only Law-giver, the only Teacher, the only Physician, the only Ruler. Associated with Him will be the glorified. Church in the spiritual realm, and the holy prophets of the pre-Christ days will be in the visible or earthly realm. Satan and every evil influence will be restrained during'lhose thousand years, in order that </span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">man</span><span class="font6"> shall not be harassed or embarrassed from any outside force while having the privilege of regaining what was lost in Adam—mental, moral, and physical at-one-ment with God.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">O</span><span class="font6">UR conception of the perfect man and woman is very meager, and falls far short of the reality. Mother Eve was not painted nor &quot;dolled up”; father Adam was not groomed. The beauty of women and the handsomeness of men, even in the best specimens of our race today, are often marred with coarse texture of skin, with an ill-shaped chin or nose or ear, or with wrinkles or warts or moles or care-worn expressions. Even in otherwise beautiful children is often found the thin, -weak and badly formed upper lip or the large, protruding voluptuous lips and rows of uneven teeth. Bat the greatest weaknesses are perhaps intangible; for they belong to mental imperfection. Some may excel along a particular line. They may shine in music, or in mathematics, or in spelling, or in writing, or in athletics; but they are deficient in almost all other lines. Not a person exists but that is mentally and morally and physically imbalanced to some extent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The glorious equipoise and excellence of </span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">min</span><span class="font6">d •and heart, the beauty of form, the grace of carriage, of the first pair are not discerned. It is only theoretically conceived in the mind of the truly professional phrenologist and those who understand the characteristics of Jesus Christy the Man of Galilee.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The restoration of humanity to the original Godlikeness of Adam and Eve is the glorious portion of our race after Christ shall have taken to Himself His great power and shall have begun His reign for the blessing of all earth's poor, groaning creation. This is in harmony with the covenant God made with the patriarch Abraham when He said: <sup>tr</sup>tn thee and in thy seed shall all families of the earth be blessed.&quot; Pastor Russell in his book, “The Divine Plan of the Ages&quot; written in 1886, said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Close your eyes for a moment to the scenes of misery and woe, degradation and sorrow that yet prevail on account of sin, and picture before your mental vision the glory of the perfect earth. Not a stain of sin mars the harmony and peace of a perfect society; not a bitter thought, not an </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">unkin</span><span class="font4">d look or word; love, welling up from every heart, meets a kindred response in every other heart, and benevolence marks every act. There sickness shall be no more; not an ache nor a pain, nor any evidence of decay—not even the fear of such things. Think of all the pictures of comparative health and beauty of h</span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">uman</span><span class="font4"> form and feature that you have ever seen, and know that perfect humanity will be of still surpassing loveliness. The inward purity and mental and moral perfection will stamp and glorify every radiant countenance. Such will earth's society be; and weeping bereaved ones will have their tears all wiped away, when thus they realize the resurrection work complete.&quot;</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Word. After saying that the Lord is our Judge and Law-giver and King, and that He will save us, Isaiah, the Prophet of the Lord, says (33:24): “The inhabitant shall not say, I am sick; the people that dwell therein [in the earth] shall be forgiven their iniquity.&quot; This text links together, as we should expect, the curing of all the diseases of humanity with the time when they shall be forgiven for their misdeeds. The Prophet, in the chapter following, tells that the race is to be humbled by a period of world-wide bloodshed, to make them ready for the blessings God has in store for them. The Lord will bring destruction to the armies of<sup>v</sup> the nations. This means that the governments of earth shall be swallowed up by the Lord's kingdom, which will take possession and bring in world-wide peace and good-will to man. The land becoming burning pitch and brimst jne means that the destruction of the old order of things will be complete. This old order will not be patched up and restored; for it is to lie waste from generation to generation, and the smoke (which symbolizes the memory of the destruction) shall go up forever, that is, it shall never be forgotten.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Isaiah 35 is the great Messianic chapter. The strengthening the weak hands and confirming the feeble knees mean that the people will take comfort in the message and rest in hope. The “Gentile times”—that period in which the nations of earth have dominated in the affairs of men, claiming that they were r</span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">ulin</span><span class="font6">g as God’s representatives, from 606 B. C. to 1914 A. D. —having now become a thing of the past in God’s plan, the Lord in His overruling providence is permitting the kingdoms of this world to be dashed to pieces in order that a rule of righteousness may be set up. We are, therefore, in the days of God’s vengeance; for He has a controversy with the rulers of earth. The statement that the Lord comes with vengeance is followed with the assuring words, “He will come and save you.” So Jesus said that the great tribulation would be stopped short of the destruction of the race, saying, “Except those days [the period of tribulation] should be shortened, there should no flesh be saved” (Matthew 24: 22) The preceding verse shows that this present distress upon the nations is the last that will ever be.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Then will come the opening of the blind eyes, the unstopping of the deaf ears, the curing of cripples, the singing of those who were dumb; and in the desert and waste places streams shall break out and copious rains shall eventually make the whole earth to bud and blossom and yield her increase. Man will then cooperate with God for the blessing of all; profiteering and gouging and cheating shall disappear from off the earth forever. God will furnish the land and water and climate conditions; and man will be given the opportunity to exercise his mind and body in digging artesian wells, in constructing dams and waterways for irrigation; and cultivation will be done in the future by the farmer sitting beside a push-button or a control lever. In fact, a similar cultivator is already in existence that, in a field where there are no stumps or other objects to avoid, will make its furrows deep and even, back and forth, day and night, unguided and unwatched.

<h5><a name="bookmark111"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark112"></a>Morning of Joy at Hand</span></h5>
<p><span class="font11">T</span><span class="font6">HE Bible is not only a book’ which records the doings of the servants of the Lord, but much more. It is a book of prophecy. Prophecy is history recorded in advance. So we must not think these things have already had fulfilment; for God sometimes speaks of things that are not as though they were. Paradise is to be restored and made world-wide; for the prophet Isaiah (51: 3) says: “For the Lord shall comfort Zion [antitypical Zion is the Church of Jesus Christ, which has been gathered out of the </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">entire </span><span class="font6">world]: He will comfort all her waste places, and he will make her wilderness like Eden, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font6">her desert like the garden of the Lord; joy and gladness shall be found therein [on the earth], thanksgiving, and the voice of melody.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Prophet (Isaiah 35:10) again declares: “The ransomed of the Lord shall return, and come to Zion [the world shall come into harmony with the glorified Church of Jesus Christ, and come] with songs and everlasting joy upon their heads: they shall obtain joy and gladness, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away.” This agrees perfectly with Revelation </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">21:4, which </span><span class="font6">says: “God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain-: for the former things are passed away.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The mistake we have been making was in' thinking that this scripture would become true when we got into heaven. But the context shows that it will take place upon this earth at the establishment of Christs kingdom, when the New Jerusalem, which symbolizes a righteous government, shall have taken possession of earth and its affairs; for it is the new order, the new heavens and the new earth, that is to bring the blessings, and in that new arrangement God will dwell with the children of men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Perhaps the prayer of the future will he something like this: “Blessed be thou, Lord God of Israel our father, for ever and ever. Thine, O Lord, is the greatness, and the power, and the glory, and the victory, and the majesty: for all that is in the heaven and in the earth is thine; thine is the kingdom, 0 Lord, and thou art exalted as head above all. Both riches and honor</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font6">there will be a rapid and wholesome exodus from the crowded, stuffy, undesirable cities to the plains and hills, which are to become Eden-like for beauty and health. When the chinch bugs and mosquitoes are dead; when the weeds and thorns and thistles are obliterated; when there will be no more stock-market manipulation; when every one may and will have his own home, his own automobile and truck, his own labor-saving machinery, his own radio; and when the earth will yield naturally and bountifully her fruits without frosts or destructive windstorms to blight them, what then will hold the people back from enjoying rural life!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Ignorance, superstition, and selfishness have dominated the race. We have been influenced by the foolish notions of others; we have been hoodooed by the “god of this world,” Satam . We have dressed and undressed according to Paris. We have been slaves to false appetites and billboard advertising. We have paid toll to the trusts by the score, and otherwise been robbed and beaten and maltreated. What £ relief it will be to find out what ails us! What surcease from toil and worry will be the heritage of those who seek the country life and get back to nature!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">That there is to be a restoration and blessing for the peoples of earth the prophet Joel (2:21-26) says: &quot;Fear not, 0 land; be glad and rejoice : for the Lord will do great things. Be no afraid, ye beasts of the field: for the pastures of the wilderness do spring, for the tree beareth her fruit, the fig tree and the vine do yield their strength. Be glad then, ye children of Zion, and rejoice in the Lord your God: for he hath given yon the former rain moderately, and he will cause to come down for you the rain, the former rain, and the latter rain in the first month. And the floors shall be full of wheat, and the fats shall overflow with wine and oil. And I will restore to you the years that the locust hath eaten, the cankerworm, and the caterpillar, and the palmerworm, my great army which I sent among you. And ye shall eat in plenty, and be satisfied, arid praise the name of the Lord your</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">come of thee, and thou reignest over all; and in thine hand is power and might; and in thine hand it is to make great, and to give strength unto all. Now therefore, our God, we thank thee, and praise thy glorious name”—1 Chron-, ides 29:10-13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Man's labor in sweat of face was to obtain while he was being turned into the ground— while he was dying; but in the resurrection and recovery of the race the necessity of laborious toil is to be eliminated The wonderful laborsaving devices and conveniences, the general education, the means of locomotion and communication, are but the advance steppings of Jehovah God, heralding forth the fact that the time of blessings is at the very door. The psalmist David said: “Weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning&quot; (Psalm 30:5) The night has been the six thousand years of sin, sickness, sorrow and death; the morning of joy cotnes in the seventh millennium; and Bible chronology shows us that we are passing over the threshold into the kingdom for which the Christian has so long prayed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Surely, when the Lord's will is perfectly done on the earth, there will be no cause for death; for “the wages of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">sin</span><span class="font6"> is death.&quot; So death, Adamic death, is to be destroyed; and in its destruction will come the opportunity for every person to return to that perfection of mind and. heart and physical form with which God endowed Adam and Eve in the beginning. What a wonderful thing it will be to see the earth in Edenic beauty, mankind in paradisaic loveliness, and every heart lifted to God Almighty voicing His praise in sweetest melody! In the past it has been impossible to do the things we wanted to do; but in Christ's kingdom the ability will be given to each to do His will perfectly, and the commandments of the Lord will be found to be true and righteous altogether. Jesus said (John 8:51): “Verily, verily, I say unto you, If a man keep my saying, he shall never see death.&quot; To show that the blessing is to be an earthly one for the people at large the Lord says through the Psalmist (37:29): “The righteous shall inherit the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">land,</span><span class="font6"> and dwell therein for ever.&quot;</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark113"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark114"></a>Heard in the. Office—No. 13 </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">By C. E. Guiver (London)</span></h4>
<p><span class="font11">T</span><span class="font6">HE young men in the office had been quieter of late, and this was particularly true of Mr. Tyler. One night he and Mr. Palmer were at their work a bit late. Mr. Tyler had finished and was preparing to depart, but seemed to be in no hurry to do so; it appeared as though he had something on his mind. Presently he said: “Palmer, have you nearly finished</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“I can leave off at any time,&quot; Mr. Palmer answered cheerfully; “but why do you ask?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“I would like to have a little chat with you, if I may; for I have several questions to ask.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">With this Mr. P</span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">alm</span><span class="font6">er hurriedly put away his things and closed his desk. “What is it, old chap?” he inquired. “You look very serious.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Well, it is like this: I have been reading the books you gave to me; and in thinking over these and the talks we have had together, I feel somehow that I am not so good as I ought to be. Life seelns to be empty; there is no purpose in it. I want to make it better; and I think you can help me.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“I am very glad to hear you say-this, Tyler. I have thought all along that you were capable ef something better, and that you were not getting the best out of life.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Yes, I have felt that, too; but I don't know just how to begin. I am not good enough to go to God, and I want to make myself more presentable. You see, I have been brought up to sneer at religion. My father is an atheist; and I have always looked upon religion as a weak sort of thing or something by which people are kept in bondage. One writer calls it ‘the paralyzed hand of the dead past upon the living present.' But my view on this is changing. I can now see that there is a religious life we all ought to live, and that what has been wrong is not the fact of religion, but its form.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Do you know that for some time now I have been trying to live a better life? But I do not seem to make much progress. I have heard you speak of consecration, but I ,am not quite sure what it means. God is perfect, we are imperfect, and I know that I am not good enough to be acceptable to God.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“You rightly say that God is perfect and that , we are imperfect. When do you expect to be in o </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">A</span><span class="font6"> condition fit to be accepted of God? Do you expect by your own effort to reach perfection!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“That is the difficulty I have,” replied Tyler; “and I feel that I shall never reach the mark of perfection.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“The position of acceptance is not so difficult of attainment as you imagine, if the way is only known; and that is God’s way. The great Creator knows quite well that we cannot reach perfection of ourselves. His Word says: ‘All have sinned and come short of the glory of God’; none can reach His standard. Do you know that our own righteousness is but as filthy rags in His sight? Salvation is not by works, lest anyone should boast. It is by faith. The Scripture says: ‘Blessed is the man whose sins are forgiven, and whose iniquities are covered?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Everything connected with God’s dealings is reasonable, but there are some things in which faith is absolutely necessary. The apostle Paul says: ‘Without faith it is impossible to please* God: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.’ This is not contrary to reason; for, as you have before acknowledged, it is reasonable to believe in the existence of God; and since He is good, it is reasonable to believe that He will reward those who diligently seek Him. If God had decreed that none could have His favor except one who is absolutely perfect, then He would have made it impossible for any man to come to Him; for the experience of all proves that no matter how hard we try we cannot reach the mark of perfection. It is here that God has been gracious, in that when there was none to save, by His own arm He brought salvation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Many turn from the thought of a sacrifice for sin; but actually it is the only hope of acceptance. None but the perfect can be accepted at God’s throne. We are imperfect; therefore what we need is a covering. The blood of bulls and goats cannot take away sin; but when He who is sinless dies for the sinner, when the Blameless stands for the blemished, and life is given for life, justice<sup>v</sup>can acknowledge the one in the place of the othen Jesus the Son of God has died, the ' Just for the unjust; and what God says is this:' *1 am aware that no man can by his own achievement attain perfection, but I am willing to receive all who come unto me through Jesus. In other words, all those who, exercising faith, accept my provision in the Son as a covering for sin and will give themselves to do my will? ‘My son, give me thine heart?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“This is where faith comes in and is necessary, if in this age we would please God. We may agonize and cry, may punish and mortify ourselves without stint, as some of the heathen do; yet we cannot commend ourselves to God. Faith must be more than a mental assent to a truth; it must be a moving power in the heart. Faith must lead to consecration.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“What do you mean by consecration?” broke in Tyler.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Consecration is the giving of oneself without reservation to do the will of another.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“That is a hard thing; that is reducing one to slavery.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Yes, it is a hard thing; and we should all hesitate if it meant giving ourselves to a tyrant, for our lives would then be a misery. But when we recognize the gracious character of the One who invites us to this, when we think of His power, His infinite wisdom and marvelous love, and that He wishes only the very best for those who give themselves to Him, and that all His powers are pledged to bring us to the desired end, who would not gladly place </span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">hims</span><span class="font6">elf </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font6">his future in God’s hands?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“As for slavery, all are slaves; and not the least he who imagines himself to be free. AH are slaves to sin dud Satan. Where is the man who is not a slave to selfishness? How many must say in words similar to those of the Scripture : T cannot do the things I would; and the things I would not do, those I do’! [Romans 7:19] Then, on the other hand, think of the position of the one who has given himself entirely to the Lord. He desires righteousness. He wants to serve God and to serve his fellows, and he is in the best position to do this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Bondage, you say? Yes; but it is the greatest liberty. To know God is to love Him. To love Him is to want to serve Him. And to serve Him we must be devoted to His will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“The faithful follower of Jesus is not left to himself to struggle on to glory; for God grants His holy spirit, so that the heart is continually refreshed and the will is strengthened. </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Above </span><span class="font6">all we can always remember that He who is for us is more than all that can be against </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">us, so </span><span class="font6">that final victory is assured.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">&lt;4</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">T</span><span class="font6">HAT meek and lowly follower of• </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">the lowly </span><span class="font6">Nazarene, Dean Inge of St. Paul’s Cathedral, London, is reported in the Buffalo </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Evening News</span><span class="font6"> as much disturbed because Labor has come into control of the British government, with a consequent possibility of affecting unfavorably a number of “superior persons,” to use the Dean’s own words.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Dean, speaking of the rise to power of such persons as carpenters, with consequent possible damage to such persons as chief priests, political rulers, etc., says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“It is not a question of punishment, but of the right of the gardener to weed his garden. If, as I believe, these persons are actually contagious, it is justifiable to kill the infected like mad dogs, unless we prefer the more expensive and less safe way of imprisonment.” <sub>z</sub></span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Before we turn anybody loose at the business of killing human beings because they are like dogs we ought solemnly to consider who are the dogs and who is the gardener. As usual we go to the Bible, and there we find it all set forth nicely. The dogs are the D. D’s. Nothing could be plainer. We quote:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“His watchmen are blind; they are all ignorant, they are all D— D—’s, they cannot bark; sleeping, lying down, loving to slumber. Yea, they are greedy dogs which can never have enough, and they are shepherds that cannot understand; they all look to their own way, every one for &quot;his gain from his quarter.”— Isaiah 56:10,11.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Superior” Persons Getting Peevkn</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6">However, these dogs seem not to have the best reputation, in the Scriptures. “Beware of dogs,” says the Apostle (Philippians 3:2); and when it comes to their chances of getting within the pearly gates we read further that “without are dogs.”—Revelation 22:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">And then again how can we be sure that these persons are superior! They say that they are, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">i,e&gt;.</span><span class="font6"> they say it of themselves; but are they! But a little while ago Air. Fall, as Secretary of the Interior, would have said that he was a superior person; Mr. Daugherty, Attorney General, might have said so, if he had the nerve; Mr. Denby, Secretary of the Navy, might have said so, and Mr. Coolidge as Vice President might have said so before the Teapot Dome came bursting into print. But now, behold, the smell of oil is on their garments! Must common -people hold their noses in the presence of the superior!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">And now about the gardener of Dean Inge’s parable. There the carpenters and others have the best of it. Mary supposed that Jesus, the ex-carpenter, was the gardener, when she hailed him first on the resurrection morning. Perhaps the modern carpenters will be more quick to greet earth’s new King than the superior persons, the D. D’s. Who knows?</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">I</span><span class="font6"> CAN see a </span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">milli</span><span class="font6">on years ahead, and this rule will never change in so many as half a dozen instances. The loud little handful, as usual, will shout for the war. The pulpit will, warily and cautiously—object—at first; the great, big, dull bulk of the nation will rub its sleepy eyes and try to make out why there should he a war, and will say, earnestly and indignantly: “It is unjust and dishonorable, and there is no necessity for it.” Then the handful will shout louder.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A few fair men on the other side will argue and reaspn against the war with speech and pen, and.pt first will have a hearing and be applauded. But it will not last long. Those others will outshout them, and presently the anti-war audiences will thin out and lose popularity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Before long you will see this curious thing: The speakers stoned from the platform, and free speech strangled by hordes of furious men who in their secret hearts are still at one with those stoned speakers—as earlier—but who do not dare to say so. And now the whole nation, pulpit and all, will take up the war cry, and shout itself hoarse, and mob any honest man who ventures to open his mouth; and presently such mouths will cease to open.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Next the statesmen will invent cheap lies, putting the blame upon the nation that is attacked; and every man will be glad of those conscience-soothing falsities, and will </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">diligently </span><span class="font6">study them, and refuse to examine any refutations of them.

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">STUDIES IN THE “HARP OF GOD” </span><span class="font8">(^££F<sup>1</sup>8&amp;<sup>RD</sup>'<sup>S</sup>)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">With issue Number 60 we began running Judge Rutherford’s new book, “The Harp of God”, with accompanying questions, taking the place of both Advanced and Juvenile Bible Studies which have been hitherto published.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>312</sup>In due time Saul of Tarsus, who afterward was named St. Paul, was illuminated and understood. And then he wrote: “Who now rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body’s sake, which is the church; whereof I am made a minister, according to the dispensation of God which is given to me for you, to fulfil .the word of God; even the mystery which hath been hid from ages and from generations, but now is made manifest to his saints: to whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the 'Gentiles; which [mystery] is Christ in you, the hope of glory.” (Colossians 1:24-27) The Apostle here emphasizes the fact that this mystery of God is now made known only to the saints. Saints means purified ones, which purification comes through receiving the merit of Christ’s sacrifice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>313</sup>The word Christ signifies anointed. Anointing means designation to official position in God’s arrangement. The Christ is the instrument or channel for the blessing of mankind. The Christ is composed of Jesus, the great and mighty Head, and 144,000 members. (Revelation 7:4) Christ Jesus is the Head and the Church His body. We ofttimes hear the expression, A body of men with a general at their head. Of the Christ the Apostle says: “And he [Christ Jesus] is before all things, and by him all things consist. And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have the preeminence. For it pleased the Father that in him should all fulness dwell.”—Col. 1:17-19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">'“The apostle Paul uses a human body to illustrate the Christ, the great mystery-class; the head representing Jesus, and the other members of the body those who are of His Church. “For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body; so also is Christ. . . .^Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular.”—1 Cor. 12:12,27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">’“The Christ is also designated in the Scriptures as the seed of Abraham according to the promise. “Now to Abraham and his- seed were the promises made. He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ.” (Galatians 3:16) Addressing himself to the Church, the Christians, the followers of Jesus, the Apostle further said: “For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus. For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ, have put on Christ. . . . And if ye be-Christ’s, then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise.” (Galatians 3:26,27,29) This is the seed, then, through whom the blessings will come to all,the families of the earth. Church means a gathered out class; and so the Gospel age, that is to say, the period from Jesus' first coming until His second coming, is employed by Jehovah for the selection of the Church, the seed of Abraham, through which blessings will come to all the remainder of mankind in God’s due time. ' '“This same class is called the elect of God, according to His foreknowledge.—1 Peter 1:2.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">A NeW Radio Station</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">T</span><span class="font7">HE International Bible Students Association (L B. S. A.), with main office at 124 ^Columbia Heights, Brooklyn, New York, for ■' some time has had in course of construction a radio broadcasting station. It is installing two sets of broadcasting equipment, the smaller radiating 500 watts, and now licensed as Class A equipment to operate on 244-meter wave length, using the call letters WBBR. The larger set is expected to be ready for operation in the near future. It is believed from experiments that there will be less interference on this wave length than a higher one. The apparatus has been tested for several nights; and reports indicate that listeners have heard very distinctly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The </span><span class="font7">masts for the antenna are constructed of wood, which will e</span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">limi</span><span class="font7">nate much </span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">diffi</span><span class="font7">culty that would result from a steel tower's absorbing of electricity. The masts of this station are 200 feet high, and set 300 feet apart. Mr. Ralph H. Leffler, radio engineer, will be in charge of the station. Mr. L. T. Cohen will be manager of broadcasting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The purpose of this station is entirely educational. It will broadcast scientific news, news of inventions, matters of political interest, musical programs, both instrumental and vocal, readings on diet, health, hygiene, etc., general reports of world news, Bible instruction, Bible questions and answers, and featuring especially Bible lectures by Judge Rutherford, the Presi-^dent of the Association, and a number of his &quot;associates, who for some time have been lectur-* ers of the International Bible Students Association.</span></p>

<p><span class="font15">I</span><span class="font7">N THE. year 1866 Mahlon Lewis, a Washington dentist, sent up kites from two mountain peaks in Virginia twenty miles apart, and sent messages from aerials on the l&lt;ites. During the next four years ho had a little financial , assistance from friends; but Congress laughed * at the proposal to give him $50,000 with which * to develop his invention. He died in 1886, unrewarded and unknown except by a few, but ? confident that his discovery would one day be of great value to the race.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">&quot; The father of wireless, Signor Guglielmo Marconi, is even now less than fifty years of age. In 1896, on his father's farm in Italy, he sent his first signal for 100 yards. In July,</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">1898, he signalled twenty miles. In 1901 his signals crossed the Atlantic. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The first broadcasting of music occurred in the spring of 1909, from the top of the Metropolitan Opera House, at which time the great tenor Caruso sang a portion of the opera &quot;Cavalleria Rusticana.” This was heard by several ships in the harbor. From 1910 to 1916 the only broadcasting done in the United States was done in California.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Bell system transmitted speech by wireless from Arlington, Va., to Paris and to Honolulu in the autumn of 1915; but the Bell people have had so much to db to care for their great and growing wire systems, and have such confidence in them, and such a good knowledge of the difficulties of wireless work, that they have not pushed into the wireless field.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7"><sub>;</sub> Broadcasting in a commercial way was begun by the Westinghouse Company at Newark, N. J., in the fall of 1920. In </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">The Goldex Age No.</span><span class="font7"> 69,</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">May 10, 1922, the leading article is a comprehensive review of the progress made in radio up to that time. The progress since then has been so rapid that we are constrained to present .another summary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It i&gt; believed that at this time there are in the Unifed States from 3,000,000 to 5,000,000 &gt;&nbsp;homes which ore equipped to receive radio messages; it is believed that there are at least 100,000 such homes in New York city alone. ;Antennse cover the roofs. In other instances the ,antenn® consist of insulated wires dropped out </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">tof</span><span class="font7"> windows, or are arranged within the apnrt-'ments in a great variety of ways. •</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Many of the new apartments which are being zbtrilt'in New York are being fitted with radio uk.*‘&lt;** &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">outfits, and a radio operator is in charge in each.' building. This operator does alf the tuning in for the entire house. All the residents have to do is to press a button to turn the music on or to shut it off. These apartments are sold or rented before completed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'/</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In the suburbs it is now difficult to sell prop-; erty if there is anything around that tends to<sub>[ </sub>interfere with the radio connections. A gas tank in the vicinity is very disturbing to a radio set. In full many an American home, perhaps* several times in a week, the neighbors come in^ the rugs are rolled up, and the guests dance to. music originating hundreds of miles away. .</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Broadcasting Items</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">S LATE as a year ago there were 607 licensed broadcasting stations in the United States, of which forty-four are west of the Rocky Mountains. One of these, the WJZ broadcasting station at Newark, N. J., operated jointly by the Radio Corporation of America and the Westinghouse Company, is the pioneer. From the time it was first opened, at an installation expense of $50,000, it has been giving free nightly concerts, from 7:00 p. m. to midnight, at an annual expense of $50,000, receiving its compensation in profits on sales of radio apparatus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">With the pouring forth of 607 broadcasting stations into the one medium, the ether, which must be used by all, to say nothing of the 21,000 other sending-stations in the country, the Government was forced in May, 1923, to make allotments of wave lengths to many of the large stations which have heretofore operated on 360 or 400 meter wave lengths. The allotments thus given were respectively 244, 263, 273, 278, 380, 405, 411, 429, 435, 447, 455, 476, 484, 492, and 546 meter wave lengths for certain of these large stations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There has been a general complaint of the use of the radio for broadcasting baseball</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">scores, cheap humor, and phonograph records. A grocer, in Des Moines has been using it for talking to his customers by radiophone, giving them prices on staple goods and advertising special sales. Such usages for radio will probably be interdicted soon, in the general intereete of the public. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">■^against their being broadcasted—a very foolish ’ protest, we think. It seems to us that the broadcasters were right in their answer that by broadcasting the songs they were giving them /an advertisement not otherwise possible to be obtained, and thus creating a demand for them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">'■ . The possibility that a single broadcasting program may be duplicated at the same time over : all the country was shown in June, 1923, when songs and addresses in Carnegie Hall, New . York city, were broadcasted at the same mo-Lment from stations in New York city, Schenectady, Pittsburgh, and Chicago, all of these stations being connected by direct telephone wires with the stage. The address which. President Harding was to have given at San Francisco, .but which was prevented by his death, was to have been thus broadcasted at the same instant V , in all parts of the United States.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">In some places mountain tops are used as broadcasting locations. The Brazilians have a powerful station fitted up on a mountain overlooking Rio Janeiro. The Germans have stretched their antonure between the tops of two mountains in the Bavarian Alps. These mountain peaks are G,000 feet high, with almost perpendicular sides where they face each other. The power will be obtained from the river beneath.</span></p>

There are features- ' about this plan that are desirable. The ether is . ■ kept freer from a bedlam of conflicting waves. ■</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But reports indicate much difficulty in carrying out the plans. In April, 1923, there had, been 122,946 licenses issued; but it was esti- &gt;&nbsp;mated that fully 200,000 persons had sets of their own design or assembly,, and could listen / in if they desired. It is claimed that licenses .. cannot be obtained for these pirate sets; also <sup>; </sup>that the government broadcasting news service ' • contains too many society items and too little -real news. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Southport, England, has a wireless theatre, where the audience may listen in on concerts, ■ the news of the day, and other features which are being broadcasted. A London organ-grinder gives a similar service in the open; the receiving equipment has a loud speaker attachment, ■ making it possible to hear everything received when the device is standing 200 yards away.

<p><span class="font7">Six great radio stations reach all parts of the British Empire; one each in England, Canada, Jamaica, West Africa, India, and Australia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When wireless instruments were first installed in Darkest Africa they brought terror to the natives, who supposed that the new instru- </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">i </span><span class="font7">ments, fitted as they were with searchlights, / were a new kind of witchcraft by which the allwise white men could see and hear everything ' that went on in the huts of the natives.

<p><span class="font7">The French Government requires a license fee „ ' from each receiving set, demands that all inter-ceptcd messages be kept secret, and that operation of the set shall cease whenever the Government so orders.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Holland has a station at Kootwyk, which is one of the most powerful sending and receiving stations in the world. It covers 750 acres, has five masts 700 feet high, and was designed to send and receive messages from Java, 7,500</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Trans-Oceanic Efficiency</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">TN </span><span class="font7">THE course of an address before the New -1*; York Electrical Society, Mr. David Sarnoff, Vice President of the Radio Corporation of America, in order to demonstrate the efficiency of radio service, sent from the speaker's platform four messages to Europe asking the question, &quot;How is the weather </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">V<sup>3</sup></span><span class="font7"> In forty-five seconds England reported rainy; in fifty-five seconds Norway reported mild, overcast; in one minute and fifteen seconds France reported lovely; and in two minutes and forty seconds Germany reported gloomy and cold.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In regular practice messages filed in New York at a stated time are delivered in Europe within about two minutes, and vice versa. The American troops at Coblenz on the Rhine were summoned by radio, and in twelve minutes the reply came from the commander that they were on their way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Within two years' time the Radio Corporation of/Amcrica, from its six transmitting stations at Marion, Mass., Rocky Point, L. I., New Brunswick, N. J., and Tuckerton, N. J., was handling twenty-five to thirty percent of the entire volume of telegraphic messages between America dnd Europe. Week-end radio letter service to Europe is only six cents a word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The effort to get as much as possible out of the expensive radio installations has resulted in on improved telegraphic alphabet, the invention of General George O. Squier, chief signal officer</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">BltOOKlTV, X. Y. ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">of the army. The new invention </span><span class="font7">follows the. fundamental principles of speech and music/ It </span><span class="font6">is claimed </span><span class="font7">that this new alphabet caiT be soot 2.65 times faster than the Morse code, invented eighty years ago.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It lias been found possible to send 100 words<sup>4 </sup>per minute and to operate duplex, which means sending and receiving at the same time. It is expected that the time will come when the radio' apparatus will be able to send and receive </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">at </span><span class="font7">the rate of a thousand words per minute. ;</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The method by which messages are sent by radio is as follows: They are first written on a machine that looks like an ordinary typewriter-This punctures a tape, and the tape controls the radio sending apparatus much as a punctured reel controls a player piano. The same, device has been used in sending radio messages from airplanes. These messages are sent at such high speeds that eavesdropping is well nigh impossible; they can he received only on high-speed receiving apparatus. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>

Imagine the satisfaction to the passengers of being able to communicate at any time with their loved ones thousands of miles away across thei trackless deep!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The ships have great satisfaction in communicating with each other. Instances are on record where concerts have been sent by wireless from one ship to another, 125 miles apart at' sea; also of a radio chess game between contending teams on the steamers Western World and American Legion, until the steamers, one going north and the othei’ south, were twelve hundred miles apart.</span></p>

<p><span class="font15">R</span><span class="font7">ADIO received a great impetus when the Republic was rammed by the Florida off the coast of Nantucket in 1910 and went down, but not until the wireless operator had sent out the S. 0. S. signals which made Jack Binns a hero in every American home. Binns is still a young man. Indeed, that is one of the most interesting things about radio; it seems to be almost wholly in the hands of young men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">. Another wonderful illustration of the value .of wireless was demonstrated at the time the </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">steamer </span><span class="font7">City of Honolulu was burned and aban</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">doned </span><span class="font7">700 miles off the California coast on Thursday, October 12, 1922. As soon as the </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">ship was </span><span class="font7">found to be in dames, the operator on </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">board </span><span class="font7">broadcasted the ship's position. Within </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">five </span><span class="font7">minutes acknowledgment of the message </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">was </span><span class="font7">received from one station on shore and </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">three </span><span class="font7">steamers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">After the lapse of two hours the ship's condition was recognized as hopeloss, and the S. 0. S. call was sent out. This was also immediately acknowledged by one land station and by one ship coming ahead full speed to the rescue. Thirty minutes later the information was broadcasted that all were off the boat except the capfedn, chief engineer, first officer, fourth officer, and first radio operator. Forty minutes later a final message was received from shore, an answer was sent with difficulty, and the ship was abandoned. All of the 263 persons on board </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">were </span><span class="font7">saved^and landed at Los Angeles four days later.</span></p>

Six stations heard the call, the lights were provided, and the crew and mail were landed in safety/ whereas death would have been the almost certain result otherwise.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">OR several years the Bell </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">system has been </span><span class="font7">-L maintaining a wireless telephone service between Catalina Island and Los Angeles, by ‘ which any subscriber in Catalina can at any time call any subscriber in Los Angeles. This line has been maintained by wireless largely because it provided an ideal place to test ’out-wireless service. From Catalina, in 1921, speech was transmitted to the S. S. Gloucester in the; Atlantic ocean. In order' to accomplish this feat use was made of land wire systems on Catalina-and across the mainland of the continent, and. wireless across portions of the Pacific and the* Atlantic, making four sections in all. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In January, 1923, wireless telephone conversation was carried on from New York to Southgate Station, London. The conversation could be carried in but one direction, owing to thi development of British radio enterprise as a government monopoly; but the British heard</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Wireless telephony between America and Europe is possible right now, but it would require such high electric power as to make it very expensive.

<p><span class="font7">7 It is freely predicted that within two years business men in New York or Chicago can converse freely with business men in London or Paris, using wires part of the way and wireless across the ocean. Nikola Tesla, the electrical wizard, adds to this his expectation that with television apparatus each will be able to see the other as the conversation is carried on.

An amateur message sent from Hartford, Connecticut, received an answer from Hawaii in four minutes' time. Radio concerts in Philadelphia have been heard in Paris so clearly that the conversations of the operators in Philadelphia were overheard. Wireless stations in Germany picked up the voice of a young woman singing in a department store in Newark, N. J. ‘Both the vocal and the instrumental tones were perfectly audible.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Messages are now sent from London to Australia by radio, twelve thousand miles; but whether they are relayed at India, as we think likely, is not ascertainable from the data in hand. A station working on 8,400 meters at Hillside, Oregon, is being heard regularly at Shanghai. The company operating plans a series of stations in China.</span></p>

<p><span class="font15">S</span><span class="font7">EVERAL American Pullman trains have been fitted with radio apparatus for the entertainment of passengers enroute. Among these are the Lackawanna; Lehigh Valley; Pennsylvania; Chicago, Milwaukee and SU Paul; Chicago and Alton; and Frisco systems. These radio receiving sets have been applied to only a few of the trains on these roads and not continuously.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Lehigh Valley found upon trial that they could receive perfectly while passing through tunnels, could receive well while passing any body of water, either still or running, but had difficulty in receiving when passing between an avenue of trees on a level stretch of country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Interborough Rapid Transit Company, of New York city, permitted the use of a rear platform of one of their trains for the temporary installation of a receiving apparatus; and it was found that the messages could be received clearly underground, even when the train was rushing through the iron tubes far beneath the waters of the East River. There was found to be considerable interference by induction from passing trains.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In May, 1923, experiments conducted on a New York city trolley car showed that by radio it was quite possible for the car to keep in constant telephonic communication with the power ... house. It may therefore be expected soon to<sup>1</sup>.</span></p>

<p><span class="font15">T</span><span class="font7">HERE are two general methods of transmitting pictures, the first of which is a modification of a method which has been used more or less for a generation. The picture to be photographed is graduated into seventeen shades of light These gradations, expressed in letters of the Morse code, are automatically transferred from the photograph to the telegraph key. On arrival on the other side of the world, a typewriter is operated, fitted with seventeen kinds of dots, corresponding to a keyboard bearing the letters A to P, with the result that all the essentials of the picture emerge, ready for the finishing touches of the artist. Fingerprints can be sent by this same method.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A more startling and almost unbelievable invention is that of C. Francis Jenkins, of Washington. For more than a year he has been able to send still pictures a distance of 140 miles, and now has perfected the device so as to allow of the sending of motion pictures a like distance. In this case the picture is broken up into thousands of flashes by the revolving of a polished mirror of graduated thickness, and is reproduced by the reverse operation of a similar instrument, called a radio eye. The picture may be sent or received either by wire or by radio.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">More wonderful still, if such a thing be possible, is the palliophotophone, by means of which the human voice can be so perfectly photographed that when reproduced from the film upon which itjs represented by a waving streak of light, it cannot be distinguished from the original voice of the person making the record. By means of this instrument it is possible by radio to make, at any reasonable distance, a permanent record of audible speech uttered anywhere. •</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">I</span><span class="font7">T IS now two years since the battleship.Taws^ with its fires lighted, but without a.man'onl board, was propelled hither and thither byriis radio operator on the battleship Ohio five milesk away. The guns of the Iowa were not fired, but; the naval engineers stated at the time that </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">they, </span><span class="font7">could have been fired by the same methods bjj was started and stopped entirely by radio. </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The* </span><span class="font7">same has been done with an automobile,! </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">the’ </span><span class="font7">latter feat having been performed at an </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">elec-;<sup>1 </sup></span><span class="font7">trical exhibit in New York city. In these feats<sup>1</sup> the radio did not supply the haulage power, but; merely the starting and stopping and guiding’ impulses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In the latter part of July, 1923, a despatch;; from France reported an airplane as traveling.-away from and being guided back to a radio station, steered only by wireless. But the des-, patch indicated that the plane had an aviator aboard, and the sense in which the radio </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">steer</span><span class="font7">ing was done is not sufficiently shown to btf clear to the reader. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;, .</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The series of 200 inventions by John' Hays Hammond, Jr., have for their object the complete guidance of airplanes, submarines, torpedoes, free balloons, motor cars, land torpedoes, and battleships, all by wireless, without any pilots or operators aboard. The speed can be regulated, the altitude, and the discharge of cargo, all by wireless. These inventions have J been sufficiently tested out to insure that in case , of a war a wireless operator perhaps hundreds ; of miles away could destroy an enemy .city or J army so. that not a vestige of life would- be left <sup>3 </sup>in it, and all without the risk of a single life to the attacking party.

<p><span class="font7">Nikola Tesla is said to believe that in the future it will be possible to cause rain to fall by radio, to drive vehicles of all lands by its ■ power, and to light houses, no matter how far £they are from an electric wire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">During the World War the Government, ' which has by now issued over a thousand wireless patents and has three thousand more pending, got the big electrical concerns of the coun' try together, so that their patents could be used together in radio work. The Radio Corporation of America thus gained a virtual monopoly of radio work in America, not only because of • the patents, but by exclusive traffic agreements,</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">ferring exclusive rights to valuable wave band . lengths. The inventions of Mr. John Hays Hammond, Jr., some two hundred in number, upon which he has been at work for fourteen years, constituted an important part of this arrangement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">•• Discoveries multiply. Methods of transmission have so changed that a single bottle, a vacuum tube, does the work that but a little time ago was done by $50,000 worth of heavy electrical machinery. This invention, the work of Lee DeForest, consisting of a single tube of glass and copper three feet in length by five inches in diameter, does the work of a high frequency alternator weighing several tons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Radio signals have been transmitted over an electric wire, without the slightest interference to the lighting circuit, and have been made to turn ,on and off street lights at a distance of four miles, near Lynn, Mass., merely by the pressing of a button. The invention of B. F. Mieffner makes it possible to use electric light wires as antenna for a receiving station, and to use the electric light current instead of storage battery for lighting the filaments of the electron tubes. In this operation the current is stepped down from 110 volts to six volts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Marconi has discovered a method of shooting * radio waves out in a given direction, somewhat ■ after the manndr of a search-light. Ue has also discovered a new wave, not previously used for long-distance wireless, which transmits a message 2,600 miles with much less power and energy and much faster and cheaper than has hitherto been possible. Mr. Marconi makes the J cheerful prediction that inside of ten years the very best radio apparatus now in use will be -J completely obsolete.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In the s</span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">umm</span><span class="font7">er of 1922 there were 202 con- -cerns in America engaged in the manufacture ’■ of radio apparatus. It is safe to say that some ' of their apparatus was obsolete before it left ‘ <sup>: </sup>the factory.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark43"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark44"></a>Receiving Sets</span></h6>
<p><span class="font15">R</span><span class="font7">OUGHLY speaking, the cost of a receiving set is about $1 per mile for every mile of distance from the broadcasting station. There are four general types. A simple crystal set, ■ costing $15 to $40, can receive from broadcasting stations up to twenty-five miles distance. A single vacuum tube detector and receiver, cost- ’ ’ miles. A vacuum tube detector and amplifying receiver, costing $100 to $250, will receive well up to a hundred miles, and under favorable conditions up to a thousand miles. The most elaborate instruments for home use combine radio and audio frequency amplification and loop reception, and cost $300 to $500.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The department stores alone are selling about a million sets annually. No radio set is fit to purchase unless all the connections have been soldered; otherwise the wires become loose, and reception is impossible. Further, if paste or acid is spread over the wiring, or if there is dirt in the receiving box, there will be trouble.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Many unique ways have been contrived to receive by wireless. In the Western states, in not -a few places, a barbed wire fence functions as an aerial; while at Hammond, Oregon, the lumberjacks have their antennae swinging from the tops of trees three hundred feet in height.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At a convention of electrical men in Chicago Mr. F. W. Dunmore, of the United States Bureau of Standards, walked around the lobby of the hotel, carrying in his hands a small suitcase out of which came a stream of market reports, interspersed with music, much to the mystification of some of the guests. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sub>;</sub></span></p>
<p><span class="font7">On the beaches at New York in the Rummer of 1923 there were boys with wireless sets rigged up in their straw hats. Others have made re- <sup>1 </sup>ceiving sets out of bill folders, cigar boxes, reading lamps, dinner pails, pocket-books, safety-razor boxes, and match boxes. A lad in Knoxville, Tennessee, made an instrument slightly less than an inch square which worked perfectly over a distance of fifteen miles.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Static, Fading, and Other Troubles</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">T</span><span class="font7">HE Winter atmosphere is relatively free _ from the charges of electricity which set up electromagnetic waves competing with those of the transmitting radio stations.. In the Summer the static charges wandering around in the atmosphere become so bothersome, and are so bothersome at all times in the tropics, that the operation of a receiving set is difficult. Also, there are more interfering noises in the Summer than in the Winter. Sunlight has a dampening effect on radio signals, so that the night is the best time for operation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There are pockets in the atmosphere where signals fade and become entirely unreadable. These are offset by regions where the signals are specially clear. A ship may enter a fading pocket, and be out of touch for as many as twelve hours. It may then emerge from the pocket and, although going away from the sending station, may hear even better than before the pocket was entered. There are such pockets in the Pacific ocean; there is also a pocket between New York and Boston, supposedly caused in the latter case by a large body of low-grade iron ore lying between the two cities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">These and other troubles are receiving constant attention at the hands of experts, and considerable has been accomplished in reducing them. Radio is not to be condemned because of them. It is of greatest possible benefit as a supplement to wire and cable service, doing many •things that they cannot do; but it is entirely ' unlikely that it will ever displace them. If radio had been discovered first, and the use of wires next, the radio people would now be worrying, and have reason to worry, lest the wires, giving direct and secret service from point to point, would eliminate them from the field.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A very efficient radio receiver will now bring in all sorts of hums and buzzes from electric light and power lines, trolley car motors, automobile magnetos, violet ray apparatus, and thunder storms; and all these must be tuned</span></p>

Thus, theoretically, it ia possible for forty-nine broadcasting stations to operate in the same community at the </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">same </span><span class="font7">time without producing confusion; but in </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">prac-. </span><span class="font7">tice!

<p><span class="font7">One of the inventions of John Hays Hammond, Jr., whose inventions have several </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">times *' </span><span class="font7">been mentioned in this article, </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">has </span><span class="font7">had </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">in view </span><span class="font7">the promotion of secrecy. It enables the </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">scram- ‘ </span><span class="font7">bling of radio-telephonic messages which </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">can be * </span><span class="font7">unscrambled only by the person at the other end ' with certain special apparatus designed </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">with ' </span><span class="font7">that end in view. Such messages cannot </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">be </span><span class="font7">understood by others, even though they </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">may </span><span class="font7">hear the sounds. The new scrambling and </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">un</span><span class="font7">scrambling device is in use between </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Catalina </span><span class="font7">t Island and Los Angeles.

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">been </span><span class="font7">in use about five years; but there has &quot;been no privacy in the messages until now. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Radio sending has been greatly improved by </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font7">invention of a perfect microphone, not made of any tangible materials, but of what can be <sub>r</sub> compared' to a sheet of electricity. The thinnest ^and most flexible of metals is not sufficiently ■^ sensitive to reflect properly the tones of music, ? although it does very well for the human voice in speaking.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark45"></a>, Radio In Governmental Use</span></h6>
<p><span class="font15">P</span><span class="font7">IS more than a year since Senator Harry S. New, of Indiana, addressed thousands of his constituents through the powerful station at Arlington. Since then the Government has decided not to let government stations be used for broadcasting appeals for votes, even though the service is paid for.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Congressional halls have been fitted with microphone apparatus which enables every whisper to be heard; and it would be a very easy matter now for everything that is said in ■ those halls to be broadcasted, if there was any reason for doing so. It would be possible to broadcast similarly the deliberations of diplomats, courts, and conferences. It was planned that the address which President Harding was to have delivered iff San Francisco, should be actually heard by about five million persons. If their awakening should occur, the new statesmen, Joseph, Moses, David, Daniel, and others, could , even now, by the relay method, literally speed their messages through the air to all the nations of the earth, without visiting them at alh Inter? esting things in this line are just ahead. These inventions are all part of the Lord’s plans for <sub>;</sub> bringing in-the kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Police authorities are now broadcasting descriptions ox criminals. News of a crime is . -flashed in every direction, and the criminal has no way .to flee. The eight high-powered bandit ■ cars of the Chicago police force are equipped ‘/-with both sending and receiving outfits; it’is even planned to equip every policeman with a ■ receiving set, thus to keep every patrolman in / the city constantly in touch with the crime situ-Ration, no flatter where he may be.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is also anticipated that shortly, through a ■-../combination of </span><span class="font6">radio apparatus and phono-</span><span class="font7">// •'graph,' the recording </span><span class="font6">of court proceedings will </span><span class="font7">/;&lt;be conducted mechanically, and the court re-/'/porter will be a thing of the past.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Education and the Press</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">T</span><span class="font7">UFTS COLLEGE and several of the uni- . / versities, namely, those of Wisconsin, lowtu . and Nebraska, arc engaged in broadcasting lec- ’ tures on economics, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">engineering, atliletics,</span><span class="font7"> the drama, and other subjects of a popular nature, ' not beyond the understanding of boys fifteen to ; twenty-five years of age. It is thus apparent ' how the farmers'’ boys can all be given liberal<sub>f</sub> । educations without leaving home. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Radio can be the transformation of school life. One skilled lecturer in history or gcog- W raphy or hygiene can -now deliver his lecture to the children in a thousand schools. In New York city a number of high schools were recently given a joint examination in accountancy. A -single instructor broadcasted the problems, which were answered simultaneously by the pupils at their desks. Courses in radio have been inaugurated in English schools.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Government is not only broadcasting news of the markets, weather, and general news, but is also giving talks on education twice a week. In Lewiston, Ohio, a radio set installed in the high school is equipped -with a magnavox, . with the result that farmers and other persons within a radius of a mile and a quarter can hear market reports and news items and listen to music while going about their daily tasks. One can but wonder what is to become of the local purveyors of advertisements and propaganda when the cream of the news has been skimmed off hours before their papers could be printed and distributed. At present the newspapers themselves are receiving seventy percent of their news by wireless. Uninterrupted communication everywhere is evidently to be the order of things in the new age. Under such circumstances fraud and oppression become increasingly difficult.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Radio and Religion</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">W</span><span class="font7">E HAVE reason to believe that the cause of true religion will be helped by radio, and our reason for thinking so appears in this issue, *on page 355. But we foresee that it will be the death of many an institution which calls itself a church but which' is merely -a commer* cial institution or a club.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The </span><span class="font6">London </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Herald</span><span class="font7"> says of radio: </span><span class="font6">“This will tend </span><span class="font7">to divert attention </span><span class="font6">more </span><span class="font7">and more from matters of which there can be no exact knowledge and to bestow it upon enlarg-</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">ing our acquaintance with nature/'’ This is , ■ another way of saying that with this new and interesting field of human interest opening before them many people will pay less and less .7 attention to religion; and we think that this is ’ true. From this aspect alone the denominational churches would have reason to fear jadio.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But they have more reason. The country church has been hit hard both by the automobile, which takes the attendants to the more ’ elaborate buildings and services in the cities or takes them away from service altogether, and by the radio, which takes the place of either. It is true that a few churches have installed receiving sets, so as to get sermons and music ____, from outside, and other churches have broadcasted sermons and tried to secure membership and money by interest thus created; but any one can see that the plan is impractical.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The truth can be broadcasted; but error can be broadcasted, too. A hypnotist in Ridgewood, N. by a prearranged plan broadcasted instructions to a young man in New York to fix his mind upon the hypnotist. In a few seconds he became rigid, his eyes wide open and staring. While hypnotized his body was pierced with a needle and otherwise maltreated, as usual He came to himself when a lighted match was held within a half inch of his eyes, causing them to blink and relax, but with apparent difficulty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The demons are doing what they can to abuse the use of radio. Edward Berthold, Jr., of Newark, N. J., besides receiving the usual messages by radio which others could hear, was troubled with demons, who shot into his mind messages which none but himself could hear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">. These messages were not carried by radio, or all would have been able to hear them. He became crazed, and killed himself and two others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">For a long time it was supposed that the planet Mars was trying to get in touch with our earth. . Marconi had detected wave lengths of 150,000 iheters, and did not know any way by which such wave lengths could be produced on earth. He subsequently laughed heartily when he was shown in the laboratories of the General Electric Company, at Schenectady, the source from which these mysterious waves proceeded.</span></p>

A navigator passing through the water at full speed can tell at all times the depth of the water through which he is passing. The contour of the ocean bottom is being charted anew, and accurately. It is believed that by this means a way may be found to ascertain the depth of Sigsbee's Deep, off the coast of Yucatan, a place never yet fathomed. ' In measuring the length of time from the sending forth of the sound waves to the bottom of the ocean, and their return to the surface, the time is measured to less than the thousandth part of a second. By the same method by which the depth, of the ocean bed is measured, the - location of masses of ice is determined, enabling, the ice patrol to notify steamers in the vicinity.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“The average man of today, even the unimaginative <sup>1 </sup>will agree with me when I say that the 'age' of our children will be the 'age of radio/ or the age of 'impoa-sibility made possible.' &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;£</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“And what is the age of radio? What are its possi- ' bilities? I claim without reservation that it will be man's supreme age, the last. It will be the Utopia which dreamers and scientists have seen through the curtain ’ of disbelief and ignorance. Radio will tear aside that curtain, and we shall enter and live a life far beyond the wildest dreams of a century ago. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“How? To answer in a practical way, we will compare with the past All motor vehicles will ran noise- . lessly, deriving their power from radio energy stations situated at our greatest water-power sources. Streets and homes will be lighted by heatless, everburning lamps, drawing their energy from the air. Heat of the greatest intensity will warm not only our dwellings, but . our great outdoors as well. Climate will be controlled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“Telephones and telegraphy will become obsolete. We will talk across the continent on waves of radio. Liners and passenger airplanes will not only be driven by radio, but will be in constant communication with the shores. <sup>1 </sup>The news of the world, its dramas and finest musicales will be enjoyed in the most humble of homes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“And not merely the voice, or sound, but the living, breathing picture will speed on wings of radio, and unfold miles away in all Its brilliancy. You will talk by radio to some distant loved one, and constantly before you that faco will smile and answer as if you sat side by side.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“Hydrogen, which heretofore has been obtainable only in limited quantities, will be released by radio vibration, . and drench the starving lands of our civilised world. Fruit and flowers will run riot.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“Receivers of wonderful delicacy will record every I® human emotion, love, hate, etc. Crime will become impossible. Divorce and scandals will cease. Disease will ' wither and die. Plagues will be swept from the earth. How? by*radio vibrations streaming across the earth of such infinite strength that they will kill and shatter . germ life. The air we breathe will be teeming with health. We all know how clear and invigorating the air is after an electric storm.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“If one increases the health, intelligence, and happiness of a community, he increases civilization and democracy. He causes Christianity to flourish, where ain</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">&lt;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">and vice ran rampant. Kadio activity will do all that and mere. Radio will become the sword arm of Christianity, of democracy, of life itself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“All religions are united in saying that we are in the latter days. Its prophecies are fuliilled. Sorrow, pain and sin shall be swept from the earth. The wings of radio are, materially speaking, the wings of the Recording Angel. We are on the threshold. The Radio age will be life's fulfilment, earth's supreme result, and the heaven we are all blindly groping for.** *</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark48"></a><span class="font11"><a name="bookmark49"></a>Reports From Foreign Correspondents</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">FROM SPAIN &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">FN </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font7"> for November 7, 1923, -L is a reference to the recent uprising in Spain; but if any may have drawn from that article the conclusion that the uprising was an aet ou the part of the common soldiers of Spain, this is to correct any such inference. As a . matter of fact, the common soldiers knew nothing of the matter until the new order of things had been estab</span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">lish</span><span class="font7">ed by certain high officers, who had revolted and enthroned themselves over all the people, as did Mussolini in Italy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The sources of news from Spain are almost entirely under the control of the financiers and the clergy, who cooperate in their efforts to make it seem that things are going well for the people, and that they are satisfied; but this is far from the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As an evidence that the recent uprising in Spain is a purely Mussolini movement, let me draw attention to the fact that when our “Ex-celentissimo senor Marques de Estella primo de Rivera&quot; first came put of Barcelona to take possession of the government at Madrid, the Bishop of Barcelona blessed him as he departed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">I do not mean to say that Primo de Rivera might not have taken possession of the ship of stale with first-class intentions, and with finest desires to do the b&lt;<sup>i</sup>st he could for the people. But it makes little difference what are the intentions of a good captain when the sea is full of pirates, sea-wolves: and the Spanish capital is full ofMergy and church-goers who are just that, who “devour widows' houses, and for a pretence make long prayer.&quot;—Matthew 23:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">. Evidently the Lord must have had these in mind when Ue spoke of some who ‘’are within full of dead iqcn’s bones, and of all uncleanness&quot; (Matthew 23:27); for they arc still engaged in the work of taking dead men out of an imaginary purgatory into a heaven over which they have no control, and into which they themselves will never enter. They arc asleep as to the times in which we are living, and know not that the thief is entering their house; but thanks be </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font7">the Lord, they shall soon see and know </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font7">understand.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark50"></a>High-handed Rulership in Spain <sup>1</sup> ■</span></h6>
<p><span class="font15">O</span><span class="font7">VER a month-ago the Speaker of the House* of Congress, Senior Melquiades Alvarez (elected by the people), and the Speaker of .the Senate, Conde de Romanones (not. elected hys the people), sent a note to the king, reminding him of his violation of the constitution.in not opening Congress, a thing that he.promised toi do, under oath, with his hands on the Gospels^</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But what are the Gospels to a worldly king?' So it transpired that on the following day our Spanish Mussolini, Primo.de Rivera, </span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">had</span><span class="font7"> a de-: cree signed by the king which eliminated these<sup>j </sup>gentlemen from the speakerships, and at the same time notified them that Spain needs nei-. ther congress nor senate to rule. Therefore no one knows when they will open ag</span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">ain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As for me, I think that these Houses will never again be opexi. If they never were of any real benefit to the common people, and if we now have an autocratic government which is shortly,to be followed by the ‘Tron Rule&quot; of Christ, which will be still more autocratic, T fail to see where there is more need of “Houses&quot; which are largely given over to foolish talking. These legislators, who have hitherto done so ' little for the common people, may as well keep quiet. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Things are going from bad to worse for the-i common people. They can hardly get enough to ; eat, but they must not protest. If they do pro-'J test they get free lodgings, behind bars, and<sup>7</sup>-without any notice of when they may go out again. Under those conditions some might think this to be a good time to he a well-fed priest; ; but there arc plenty of indications that the time is near when the priests, too, will be in for </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">their </span><span class="font7">share of gnashing of,teeth and will realize that J</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">' it would have been much better for them to be cow-keepers.~Zechariah 13:5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Many seem to think that as the people are in silence they , approve of the way things are going; but I get around among them and know that they are nearly at the breaking point, and that the “night wherein no man can work&quot; is already settling down in Spain. Not only is this ■ the case in Spain, but the whole world is with one accord crying out for the need of a wise - and strong one to put its affairs in fetter order, and no man is to be found who can meet the requirements of the case. ■</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">, Greece is busy putting out old kings and putting in new ones, occasionally changing a king for a plain man like Venizelos; but no common man is enough for the stupendous job of ruling - the'people with justice in this day of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">gigantic </span><span class="font7">and world-wide money power. What the Greeks need, and what all nations need, is God. They do not yet know it; but Jehovah will permit them to suffer until they humble themselves sufficiently to acknowledge their need of the Messiah He has, in His great love, provided. When the world becomes hopeless, then Jehovah will say to His Christ, “Go ahead! The world is now in such miserable condition that it is only too glad that all of its* affairs should be placed in your hands.&quot; ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">FROM CANADA</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">T</span><span class="font7">WENTY years ago, an aggressive campaign was started in the older lands of Europe to bring out immigrants to our fair land. Sixteen years ago it reached considerable proportions, and many thousands of Britain’s younger sons and daughters made the journey to the Land of Promise. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;y</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">All was activity and bustle. The real estate dealer, with a zeal and energy which had its source in unbounded optimism, surveyed his building.lots and small farm acreages from the depths of the sea to the tops of the highest mountains. On the prairies the homesteader gambled his ten dollars against the Government's one hundred and sixty acres, that he would not starve to death in three years. Some. times he thought he won.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Upon the promise of new railroad branches and extension lines, he hewed his way into the wilderness, emulated the gopher (always his nearest neighbor), and built himself a shack,</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">usually called a </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“dugout”</span><span class="font7"> because it was con- . ' J structed half underground and half above, of ? sod and earth. He fought his fight against sick- j.: ness, starvation, and loneliness; and if his health ; was good and his mentality stood the test, he finally triumphed to the extent of becoming the ' <sub>; </sub>proud possessor of his little &quot;quarter section&quot;; &gt;&nbsp;or thought he did. * &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One style of architecture, however, that has flourished on . the prairies is that which delineates the chaste outline of a lunatic asylum. Behind the gloomy walls of the several institutions of that nature which Western Canada has built, are buried the records of scores of tragedies when the prairie won the gamble. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">However, in a general way, the work of subdoing the Last Great West went on apace, in the years that intervened, until the Great War engrossed the attention of the world and the tide of emigration flowed eastward. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When Canada heard the &quot;Fall In” played on the bugles of England's “Contemptible” Anny, she considered herself fairly prosperous. Her farms covered a wide strip of prairie north of the American boundary line. Her </span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">min</span><span class="font7">es were busy. Her real estate speculators frenziedly ' built, on paper, great industrial centers, with little regard, it must be admitted, to the possibility of markets. Money was plentiful; politicians and captains of industry rubbed their unctuous hands as the tide of unskilled labor flowed in from Central Europe. Farm lands changed hands briskly, and wheat sold for a dollar a bushel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Then came the War.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Four- Year Delirium</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">T</span><span class="font7">HE events of the next four years were much the same in Canada as in some other conn-tries. First came the call for men, then for money, then for munitions; then for money, men and munitions, but always the demand for the human sacrifice. From Canada’s nine millions of population, eight hundred thousand men from her farms and factories threw down their tools and took up rifles. The inflow from _ Europe slowed down, the exodus to Europe increased. Prices of commodities rose, as in all other countries. Factories that formerly made bicycles and typewriters began to make shellfuses and such. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Next succeeded the Great Peace, and the wonderful times of prosperity promised by all the profiteers. We have experienced this great prosperity for five years now, as a nation, as provinces, as cities, and as individuals. The results are wonderful! For instance, in these times of prosperity our national debt amounts-to Five Billion Dollars! This is on the authority of Mr. W. R. Morson in his annual business review of Industrial Canada.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This debt of $5,000,000,000 at five percent interest calls for $250,000,000 per annum; and it causes the Toronto </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Globe</span><span class="font7"> some concern. It pauses the average citizen some concern, too, when he realizes that the country's income from foreign sales, exports, is less than $100,000,000, which means that the country plunges each year more than $150,000,000 further into debt. This is a very exhilarating national outlook, especially when the detail of this enormous burden is given some consideration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The per capita tax is about $450. But as not every man, woman and child is a producing unit, therefore not a wage earner, approximately but one-fifth of the population can be so considered; so it amounts to about $2,250 per head for the wage earner. Now, gentle reader (as the older school of novelist fondly addressed you), when are you going to pay your Two Thousand Two Hundred and Fifty Dollars? Possibly you are not feeling so gentle by this time.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark51"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark52"></a>The National Debt Ballooning</span></h6>
<p><span class="font15">I</span><span class="font7">T WILL be advisable to pay this amount quickly; for at the present rate of progress it will soon be Three Thousand Dollars. Canada increased the national debt last year by Fifty Million Dollars!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Where did this increase come from?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In 1921-22 there was an apparent surplus of income over ordinary expenditure of $1G,59G,-752; but by advances to railroads, etc., this was Ichanged into an addition to the public debt of $81,25$,000. In 1922-23 the ordinary revenue was $393;619,000 and the ordinary expenditure was $331,750,000. Here is a surplus; but again a paternal government hands the railways and the merchant marine a nice little sum which shows an addition again to the debt of $49,293,-P 086, or almost fifty millions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">For 1924 Mr. Fielding, our national Wizard I of Finance, computes ordinary revenue at $372,-<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;517,000 and expenditure at $339,000,000; so we</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">rejoice at a possible surplus of $33,517,000. But just as our rejoicer gets to working well, lie blandly tells us that there will be a capital expenditure of $23,415,000 and that the dear old railroads will need $74,500,000. So our surplus becomes a further deficit of $64,398,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Already our Federal taxes are taking ofir money at the rate of $40,000 per hour, and our Provincial taxes are additional at the rate of $500 per year for each wage earner. And then there are the Municipal or City taxes; and, for some of us who like to perpetrate jokes on the laws of Canada, the addition of a few dmes. And to sum up the matter completely, .we add the tax on our sense of humor as we contemplate the situation in all its beauty and clarity.: ...</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark53"></a>Exodus from Canada Significant</span></h6>
<p><span class="font15">W</span><span class="font7">E ARE a great nation. That is, some of us are</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">; for we</span><span class="font7"> can smilingly delude ourselves into thinking that Canada is still solvent, and can pay her debts. We can still do this, despite other little evidences to the contrary; for instance:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">During 1923 we lost double the number of people in emigration that we gained by immigration. This was no inconsiderable financial -■ loss; and this is still more evident when we consider that the majority of those who left us were our highly trained mechanics and agriculturists—men hard to replace. This makes ns * only smile still more broadly, however, because few of us realize the cost of immigration today. We forget that the present-day immigrants come to us from countries where there is a debased currency. They are a financial risk as soon as they land. The majority are without any capital, and might better be described as refugees than as immigrants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Then what is to become of them when they are here? Our national answer is as of yore: “Put them on the land.&quot; So on the land they ' </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">go,</span><span class="font7"> to face the same fate as thousands of other citizens who have wrestled.with Canadian conditions for many years. Let us assume they go to Alberta. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Sunny Alberta, where the Prince of Wales 5 and Prince Eric of Denmark have their ranches —surely this is the Land of Promise! It is— of Promise to Pay I</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Alberta government recently got tired of the constant pleas of the farmers that they could not meet their tax payments; so they put through legislation called the Tax Recovery '</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Act, designed to bring, about an adjustment of the situation. It did. It resulted in 43.2S0 parcels of farm lauds, each of approximately 160 acres in extent, some much larger; 64.946 parcels of town and village property; and 14,751 parcels of city property, passing from private <sup>K</sup> to public ownership.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">To put the matter more clearly, the Govern-■ ment takes from the struggling agriculturist 6,924,600 acres.of farm lands, which at a conservative valuation of $10 per acre amounts to Seventy Million Dollars! Or, to make it still more clear, the area confiscated‘is one and one-half million acres more than the total wheat acreage of the whole province of Alberta for 1923! In the case of the town and village property, putting each parcel at the extremely low valuation of $25, the total value amounts to / more than Three Million Dollars.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In addition is the city property and other revertible property which, added to the foregoing, gives us a staggering grand total of Seventy-five Million Dollars 1 Alberta is no / doubt a splendid place to send destitute immigrants. And Alberta was settled, to a great degree, by the intrepid homesteader who gambled with the Government and, for a few short years, thought that he had won.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark54"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark55"></a>Ruinous Land-Grab Act</span></h6>
<p><span class="font15">T</span><span class="font7">HERE is another aspect to the Alberta Land Grab that needs to be mentioned. The Tax Recovery Act is so worded that it amounts to &quot;Government takes all.” The man who has a first mortgage on the land is not considered. Neither is the machine company that holds notes and liens against the property as security for farm machinery sold to the landholder.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Government or the municipality, as the case may be, is only concerned with its tax arrears. Once the title passes, redemption within one<sub>f</sub> year is allowed, if all taxes are paid; otherwise the land becomes the absolute prqp-erty of the Government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Very naturally, the loan and mortgage companies are desirous of getting out. Also very naturally^ no one wants to risk his capital in any enterprise which is subject not only to such seasonal hazards as is farming, but also to a . law which destroys all ordinary financial protection. ' Alberta looks like facing some hard -’years; or else there will be an exodus of its _ already none too large population. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">BWM5KX.TR, N. T. ,</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One section of its population already cries q loudly for secession from the East, a cry that has been heard from other Western provinces ’ not so very long ago. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■■</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Manitoba might seem to offer a good field for . the immigrant, were it not for the confessed failure of Premier Bracken to carry on rcspon- <sub>; </sub>sible government. Premier Bracken and his parliament inherited much grief when he as- -sumed office, and not very much public confi- ■ deuce. After struggling along for a time he has at last tacitly admitted defeat and ha^ft called in a committee of business men from all’* over the province in an endeavor to find a soln-tion of Manitoba's problem; and she has one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In the course of the inquiry a beautiful situation was uncovered: Against a revenue of $26,280,000, from Manitoba’s basic and practically only industry, farming, is a tax burden of $52,000,000; and this indebtedness (for it has not been paid) must be increased in 1924. Drastic cuts in appropriations for education were prepared; and in point of fact many schools are already closed on account of no funds wherewith to pay teachers and to keep up buildings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Manitoba crop was not good in 1923. Rust and weeds have ruined a large number of farmers, and many are quitting. Possibly the inadequately capitalized immigrant would like to assume a large slice of this kind of obligation. Not that we desire in the slightest degree ; to discourage immigration, far from it; on the contrary, we would like to see several thousand worthy colonists come into Canada and gal- <sup>1 </sup>lantly assume (and pay) their proportion of our national debt, say, $3,000 each. According to our generally admitted to be sound ideas of finance someone must pay it; bnt who will it be?</span></p>

<p><span class="font15">T</span><span class="font7">H E Archbishop of Canterbury recently sprang a surprise on the country with his statement that during the past three years he ; and sdme others had, unofficially, been talking ‘ with a Belgian Cardinal of the Roman Catholic Church on the question of unity of the Church of England with Rome.

Contrary to general opinion, the party is able to put apparently competent men into the very many ministerial positions; at any rate they proclaim that they are ready to carry on the ■ government &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>:</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But while the majority of the Labor members of Parliament are moderate men, it has a “left,” chiefly the representatives from Glasgow and district, who are not at all moderate, but who seek a complete change in the order and form of goveniment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Whether or not Mr. Ramsay MacDonald will be able to keep his team in hand is uncertain;</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">. for this minority rather fears that the leaders of the party have too much of the intellectual and not enough of the real labor view. They fear that the forward movement will be too</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">^low or be ineffectual, and that the much-needed readjustment of the social life will not be gained.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Considerable doubt exists in the minds of many concerning the relationship of the Labor Party with the “Third International.” It is feared that even Air. MacDonald himself is under some sort of obligation to it, and therefore to tho, leaders of the Russian revolution. This gives considerable concern to religious ' people, because Bolshevism or Soviet rule is so definitely anti-religious: it hates the teachings and worship of Jesus Christ. Many of the Brit-</span></p>

<p><span class="font15">I</span><span class="font7">T IS now a week since Ramsay MacDonald was sent for by the King, and kissed the</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">King's hand on acceptance of office. And </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">as </span><span class="font7">yet the sides have made no intimation of having noticed any change; the heavens have not fallen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Some panicky persons have bought </span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">Am</span><span class="font7">eriean dollars, believing that they would do well to themselves by doing so. &quot;Patriotism,&quot; that strange thing of which the same people make • so much, is forgotten when self-interests are touched. But the country is not moved; there is no noticeable singing of the “Red Flag,&quot; but there is a disposition to give the Government a chance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. :</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Conservative party which, by throwing the country into a general election in order to strengthen itself, opened the door to this “visi- ' tation,” now blames the Liberal party for not helping it to shut the door in the face of the Labor party. There are now just the right num- ....</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">3</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">her of parties necessary to bring confusion on the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">country;</span><span class="font7"> and the situation is exactly suited for trouble. At present they have no ear for the announcement that the kingdom of heaven is being set up; but when the caldron lias boiled / and fallen over, some at least will believe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">How different things could yet be if these men would stop and listen to the Bible message, - and to the voice of God! They would lose confidence in Shakespeare's &quot;there's a divinity which shapes our ends, rough hew them as we will,” a word which was never . true except to those who sought to be conformed to the will of God j and they would see that God is proving the wisdom of the world to be a fruitless tree. He is confounding the wisdom of the worldly-wise, and bringing to nought the understanding of its prudent men.—1 Corinthians 1:19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There seems to be no i</span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">mm</span><span class="font7">ediate danger of Britain's being subjected to a capital levy. No doubt there are bank balances and large estates which could be tapped without hurt to their . owners. But the gain got from a levy and applied to the reduction of the war debt and - taxation would be more than offset by the seizure of the money now available for trade. Trade would be hampered by the loss of its currency, and there would be still, more unemployment than now. The country is in too tight a comer for this heroic measure, many years ago enforced in Israel—2 Kings 23:35.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There are many in Britain who very much regret the action of the unscrupulous persons who are making money out of the rum-running in Rum Row, seeking to sell their vile stuff contrary to the law of the United States and the wishes of its people; and they agree with the Editor's remarks about the detestableness of the whole business.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But the implied idea that the Government of Britain is responsible raises another question. If thShsituation were reversed and the bootleggers of America were to compass &quot;dry” Britain with whisky ships, would the United States Government take action against ships flying the American flag engaged in the trade?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Probably the new Labor government is whol-,. ly against this detestably vicious trading; but lie world being constituted as it is, even it ' could not order its warships out as patrolling . vessels to destroy the commonly accepted rights </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">, o£</span><span class="font7"> mem</span></p>

<p><span class="font15">A</span><span class="font7">BOUT 50,000 locomotive drivers and firemen have now been on strike more than . a week. They have succeeded in bringing a . great amount of discomfort upon the people,/ '.’ and much commotion in trade; and in alien— <sub>g </sub>ating sympathy from trades unionism wheq^J badly handled. The wages award, which they^ said they would accept and then would not do^-g so, brought a reduction to 2,400 men, but not • such a one as to entail suffering. The leader cjL the union has thrown the whole country intJRj trouble, and scores of thousands into distress, * because he believes that the railways can afford ; to pay the present wage. Perhaps they can &lt;&nbsp;afford it; but the action in its way seems as &lt;&nbsp;heartless as a declaration of war merely for balance of power, so often given as the only ■ reason. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■ ■&lt;</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Although thers was much speculation as to the effects the ascendancy of the Labor Party ■ would have upon the markets and business in general, hardly a ripple stirred the economic situation after the first quiver in the money market subsided. The pound sterling dropped, but it is regaining its vigor. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The &quot;scare” is wearing off and &quot;normalcy” is being restored. The Labor parties are largely . theoretical; and not being cocksure that their . conception of government is workable there is a hesitancy about putting their theories into operation. The financial interests are powerful, and they have a way of their own in intimidating others; they have the medium of exchange mastered so well that the fluctuations, up or down, will instantly respond to their wishes. This time money was depreciated. It was up to Labor to stabilize the currency, of the country. Labor did so through its leaders hastily declaring a conformity to the old order of things.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">’ Brooklyn, N. Y., January 16,1924.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Prof. James Warren Johnson,</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">- Press Club of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">J/y </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Dear Sir:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Touts of January 8 to hand. I thank you for your frankness of speech. Your difficulty lies in the fact that you do not believe the Bible, and* of course do not understand it. If you understood it you would see that it proves itself </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">as </span><span class="font7">of divine origin; for no human mind could construct such a tremendous and far-reaching plan as is there outlined, and which has been in process of development during the past six thousand years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">I note that you question the existence of Jesus. This matter is not open to argument. The fact that Jesus lived on’earth, taught in Jerusalem, was crucified and died, and was raised from the dead, is so fully and completely established that I would not indulge in a serious discussion of the proposition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">I presume that you doubt also Saul of Tarsus, whose name was afterward changed to Paul. The wisdom of this world, I know, now rejects |thc Bible, rejects the Lord Jesus, and hangs its hope&quot; upon evolution. This is indeed a flimsy thing upon which to base a hope. I am reminded of the words of St. Paul when he said: “Where z. -is the disputer of this world? hath not God made fqolish the wisdom of this world? For after th^t in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God.&quot;—1 Corinthians 1:20,21. , I note what you say about the Jew. Your definition of a Jew and mine differ entirely. Every man who is a natural descendant of Abraham is not a Jew within the meaning of the Scriptures. The profiteering class that go about in America (to quote your language) to “skin&quot; and exploit the people are not Jews. A Jew, in the Biblical meaning of that word, is one who has faith in the promise that God made to Abrahm when He said: “In thy seed all the nations of the earth shall be blessed.&quot; (Genesis 22:18) There are not many of these at this time. Id) not think that the so-called American <sub>t</sub>Jew will go to Palestine, or even care to go.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But the time will come when the Jews </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">will get </span><span class="font7">their eyes opened to the fact that He whom their ancestors after the flesh crucified is really the Savior of the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">I do not give much, weight to </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Mr. Zangwill's . </span><span class="font7">opinion concerning the Jews, </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">because- confess^ </span><span class="font7">edly he is not a Jew himself. ' &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">You ask me about Emerson's essays on religion, and Thomas Paine's “Age of Beason.” These gentlemen were not Christians. They did not believe in the Bible, nor in the Lord Jesus Christ, and knew no</span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">thin</span><span class="font7">g about God's plan of salvation. They were men of splendid mental capacity, but that is not all that is </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">re</span><span class="font7">quired. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sub>; 4</sub></span></p>
<p><span class="font7">I am familiar with </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Mark Twain's writings, </span><span class="font7">was born and reared in the same </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">state from </span><span class="font7">which he came, and know much about him. </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">And </span><span class="font7">while I agree with some of the things he said about eternal torture and the damnation infants, I do not agree with </span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font7"> that there is no personal devil The devil by his seductive power has overreached the minds of the majority of peoples of earth today and is driving the nations and peoples headlong into a terrible time of trouble such as has never been known, and which is just ahead, and which statesmen of the world can see and freely mention, but to avert which they know no adequate remedy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As to logic and reason, the greatest logic, the most profound reasoning to be found in any literature on earth, is that found in the Scriptures. As a lawyer I long ago learned that the very foundation of the laws of civilized nations is taken from the law that God gave to Moses. . The wisdom expressed by Solomon and the logic of St. Paul are unequaled in any literature known to man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">I have no doubt that your letter and this answer will be published in </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">The Golden Agb </span><span class="font7">in due course. I assure you of my best wishes.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">[Robert G. Ingersoll is only a name to the present, generation, but he was a power while he lived. We print ' below a famous reply to his charges against Christianity. This little pamphlet, long since</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">out of print, will be new to most of our readers.—Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">M</span><span class="font7">R. </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Robert Ingersoll,</span><span class="font7"> in his now celebrated . &quot;Christmas Sermon,” took Christianity 'severely to<sup>:</sup> task, and awakened considerable 'excitement in religious circles. The Rev. Buck-ley, D. D., of the Methodist Episcopal Church, New York city, declares that the pith of Mr. Ingersoll’s &quot;Christmas Sermon” is found in three charges which he makes against Christianity, and which Dr. Buckley denominates &quot;three gigantic falsehoods.” They are as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">7 First: &quot;Christianity did not come with tidings of great joy, but with a message of eternal grief.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Second: &quot;It [Christianity] has filled the future with fear and flame, and made God the keeper of an eternal penitentiary destined to be the home of nearly all the sons of men.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Third: &quot;Not satisfied with that it [Christianity] has deprived God of the pardoning power.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Some of the friends of Christ, of the Bible and of true Christianity urge that this modern Goliath be answered by some pebbles of truth from our sling, directed not against a great and seemingly honest man, but at the system of errors which he, no doubt honestly, supports; and in defense of the truth and of the timid and doubting </span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">chil</span><span class="font7">dren of Zion, &quot;Israelites indeed.”</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark57"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark58"></a>Charge I Examined</span></h6>
<p><span class="font15">W</span><span class="font7">E REPLY to the first charge that, whilst the name Christianity stands for much that is spurious both in doctrine and in practice today, Mr. Ingersoll’s arraignment relieves us from the necessity of examining these; for his remarks apply only to the inception of the Christian system, the message with which it </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">came.</span><span class="font7"> The issue is a fair one. Christianity could not be judged more fairly than by the doctrines of its founders.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Reversing the order of the statement, we will demonstrate (1) that Christianity did not </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">come </span><span class="font7">with a message of eternal grief, and (2) that it </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">did come</span><span class="font7"> with good tidings of great joy which shall be to $11 people.—Luke 2:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The New Testament embodies a statement of all the doctrines and teachings of primitive -Christianity, and neither the term </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;eternal ~grief’</span><span class="font7"> nor any equivalent term is to be found</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">a: therein. Grief is indeed implied in the statements which predict some serious disappointments among church people in the’ end of the , present age (Matthew 8:11,12; 25:30: Luke 13: 2S); but none of these say one word about an eternity of grief and pain. It’ is true also that a certain parable (Luke 16:19) represents the downfall of tlie Jewish polity from divined favor; and that, as a &quot;rich man faring sump-' tuously,” etc., represented that system, so the trouble into which that people then passed (and in which they confess that they have been since) is represented by the symbols of fire and torment; and the simultaneous acceptance to divine favor of the humble of the poor Gentiles, previously outcasts'from special divine favor, is represented by the carrying of Lazarus to Abraham's bosom, the bringing of those hitherto aliens into the family of God as children and heirs of the Abrahamic promises and blessings. The fire and the torment are as truly * symbolic as the other features of the parable. And even then, there is no threat that the rich man's grief and torment shall be &quot;'fitenwzZ.” On the contrary, tlie apostle Paul shows most pointedly that the heart-blindness to the truth which led to the rejection of that nation, and which has ever since stood more or less related to all their trouble, is to pass away shortly, during the period of the second presence of our Lord. The Apostle concludes the subject in any but a mournful and grievous, strain, saying, &quot;0 the depth of the riches, both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his righteous acts and his plans past [man’s] conception.”;—Romans 11:25-33.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We do not forget, either, that other parable of the Sheep and the Goats, and the concluding . sentence relative to the goat class: &quot;These shall go away into </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">everlasting punishment:</span><span class="font7"> but the righteous into </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">life eternal.”</span><span class="font7"> We acknowledge freely that the words </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">everlasting</span><span class="font7"> and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">eternal </span><span class="font7">here used are translations of the same Greek word, and that they evidently mean </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">without eud. </span><span class="font7">But we call attention to the fact that the penalty named upon oven the wilfully wicked does not read </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">grief</span><span class="font7"> without end, nor </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">torment</span><span class="font7"> without end, as many seem to suppose; but </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">punishment</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">o</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">without end.</span><span class="font7"> It is a mistake to suppose, as some • do, that </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">punish me n-t</span><span class="font7"> necessarily implies pain, torture, or any conscious suffering. On the contrary, &quot;Capital punishment” among civilized nations means </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">death</span><span class="font7"> inflicted in as painless a man-‘ ner as may be.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">True, everlasting torment by burning or by freezing would be an everlasting punishAent as truly as everlasting death would be; and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">vice versa,</span><span class="font7"> an everlasting death wherein is no consciousness of either pain or pleasure would also ™ an everlasting punishment. Hence we see ' that the mere statement &quot;everlasting punishment” proves nothing as to the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">kind</span><span class="font7"> of the punishment. But other scriptures make the subject quite plain by telling us in just what the punishment, which will be everlasting, will consist, saying, &quot;The wages [or punishment] of sin is </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">death&quot;</span><span class="font7"> (Romans 6:23) Hence the everlasting punishment declared to be the just merit of wilful sin will be everlasting death, a death which will never end, from which there will be no resurrection, and consequently not endless torment and grief.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">• But let us look closer at this text: &quot;These shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life everlasting.” We note that &quot;life” is put as the opposite or antithesis of the word &quot;punishment,” as though the inference should be that the punishment is death. Let us look at the Greek word rendered &quot;punishment.” If it were intended to represent torment it would be </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">basanos;</span><span class="font7"> but no I it is </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">kolasin,</span><span class="font7"> the primary significance of which, according to the best Greek scholarship, is </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">To cut off,</span><span class="font7"> as when useless or dead branches are cut off or pruned .■ off from a tree or vine. Here, then, the antith-' esis is seen: The righteous at the end of the trial referred to in this parable (which trial ■will last during the Millennial age) will enter J*pon a state of everlasting life, while the wicked &quot;will be cut off (from life) everlastingly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">• Nor need we pass by the statement of verse ’ 41/‘Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlast-• ing fire, prepared for the devil and his angels.” * Here the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">fire</span><span class="font7"> is as much a symbol as the sheep and the goats of the preceding verses arc symbols. As sfipep represent an obedient class and ■ goats a wayward class, so fire represents some&gt; thing. It never represents preservation, but al-‘ ways represents </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">destruction</span><span class="font7"> to whatever comes . under its power. And. elsewhere, the same New Testament writers declare, both </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">with:an3\.with* </span><span class="font7">out symbols, that the devil is to be </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">destroyed! </span><span class="font7">—See Hebrews 2:14; Bomans 16:20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Next we examine briefly our Lord's </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">references </span><span class="font7">to Gehenna fire, in which He mentions the </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">worm </span><span class="font7">that die th not and the fire that is not quenched^ But even here not a word about endless grief </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">or </span><span class="font7">endless torment. Indeed, the reference is clearly not to fire and worms in some other world, but to fire and worms which the people addressed, knew of and could see. Outside the south wall of Jerusalem is the Valley of Hinnom or: GFa» </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">henna,</span><span class="font7"> once quite deep but </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">now much filled with </span><span class="font7">debris and soil. In the days of our Lord this valley was used as a place for destroying the-garbage of the city and the dead carcasses of animals; and to insure quick destruction a</span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">nd </span><span class="font7">thorough disinfection brimstone is said to </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">have </span><span class="font7">been freely used. .No one quenched those fires and those carcasses which lodged upon </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">rocks//' </span><span class="font7">and did not reach the fire, the worms consumed* j without hindrance. But no living </span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">thin</span><span class="font7">g </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">was ever ? </span><span class="font7">cast into this valley, the Jewish </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">laws governing </span><span class="font7">even the lower animals being most humane. And , our Lord's remarks furnish no </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">suggestion of \ </span><span class="font7">casting living beings into this or any </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">similar </span><span class="font7">place—or of torment at all </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font7">similar </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">expres- 7 </span><span class="font7">rion, doubtless based on the same facts, is used . by the prophet Isaiah; and he specifies that the.. fire and worms feed not upon living </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">creatures, </span><span class="font7">but upon &quot;carcasses.”—Isaiah 66:</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">24. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. =•.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Jews had a custom, however, of refusing, the usual burial to some of the very vilest crim- -inals; and, instead, they cast their </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">dead</span><span class="font7"> bodies* into this valley with the filth of the city, thus implying that such a one should be esteemed * as of the offscourings of society, and that his . ; memory should rot; and furthermore that in their estimation he had no hope of a resurrec-tion—a tomb being to them an emblem of a. resurrection, of a hope of future life. Our Lord •expounded the Law of God in a much more foil and heart-searching manner than the ordinary teachers, and illustrated by His teachings- (Mat-. . thew 5:21-35) that the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">tJcoughts</span><span class="font7"> are to be con-' ’.i sidcred as well as the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">deeds.</span><span class="font7"> The Law said: -&quot;Thou shalt not kill,” and &quot;Thou shalt not com- ■ mit adultery” and prescribed penalties for ■ these misdeeds. But said the Great Teacher, magnifying the Law and making it still more to be reverenced (Matthew 5: 21-28): I put the matter more searchingly, and assure you that</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">878 , &gt;&lt;;-&gt;■ • &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;' &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">TU</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">to have murder or adultery in the heart is to be a murderer or an adulterer—a violator of the Law, whose violation forfeited all right to life under the Jewish covenant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">• It is while thus emphasizing the Law that our Lord says: Whosoever shall be angry with his 5 brother and call him </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">apostate wretch</span><span class="font7"> shall be in • danger of (or liable to) Gehenna. Just as we might say today: The person who gets passionately angry with his brother or neighbor, and speaks and acts violently, is in danger of or liable to yet end his life on the gallows; for he has a murderous disposition in his heart.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">■ Probably only the leading features of this S»at discourse are given; but following on’ in</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">s </span><span class="font7">train of thought the Teacher passes from the literal Gehenna and its destruction of offal and filth, to represent by it the ultimate end of wilful sin before the higher tribunal, the Judge )of all the earth. He urges all who would have </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">^everlasting life</span><span class="font7"> that although a pleasure or ‘ habit contrary to God's law be as precious to them as a right eye or a right hand, they should gladly part with it and submit themselves to God's plan of holiness. Then He reasons on the matter thus: Would it not be more profitable *to cut off these depraved pleasures of the present brief life and bfe accounted worthy of an endless life of felicity and perfection which God has prepared for those who love Him, than to hold and enjoy all the sinful pleasures for the present brief life and be accounted of God as the filth and offscouring of His universe, to be disposed of in an antitypical Gehenna—the second death 1</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Admitting, as all scholars must, that the literal valley of Gehenna formed the basis of our Lord's remarks, it must be admitted also that that which it was used to typify was </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">somewhat like it.</span><span class="font7"> And as the literal Gehenna was not a place pf torment or grief, but represented the utter destruction and hopelessness of those (already dead) cast into it, so must its antitype teach the same lesson. And so it does. The second death is brought to our attention (Revelation 21*8) as the hopeless destruction of all the finallyrimpenitent, the wilfully wicked, who, in spite of the knowledge and grace to be abundantly supplied to all “in due time,&quot; will still choose sin and spufn God's righteous way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Not only have we seen that the expression </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">eternal grief</span><span class="font7"> is not used in the Scriptures, nor</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Bbooklyv,</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> M. x ;</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">any equivalent expression, but we have exam* ined every text of the New Testament outside of the symbols of the Book of Revelation in which some such </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">thought</span><span class="font7"> might be supposed to ; lie concealed, and find that Mr. Ingersoll is mis* taken in his assumption. And if we now glance at a few isolated verses in the Book of Revela- ' tion, supposed by many to teach everlasting torment, and hence everlasting grief, we shall find these to be </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">symbols,</span><span class="font7"> like all the other fea- . tures of that book of symbols.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Revelation 20:9,10: These verses represent-J a scene at the close of the Millennial age, when, under the reign of the glorified Redeemer and His glorified bride, the church, all the world ’ shall have been blessed with full release from error and superstition; when all shall have been brought to an accurate knowledge of the truth and ability to obey it; when the final test as to \ love and loyalty to God shall have been applied to all the world, then as numerous as the sand . of the seashore; and when this test shall have separated the unfaithful, wilful &quot;goats&quot; from the trusting, obedient &quot;sheep.&quot; Verse 9 shows the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">destruction of</span><span class="font7"> all the disobedient, the &quot;goats,&quot; just as did Matthew 25:46. Verse 10 speaks of the devil; and whether it refers to a ‘ </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">system of evil,</span><span class="font7"> a form of sin, or whether to the literal devil, matters not to our argument. (We are not called upon to discuss whether or not the devil will have some torment. We are plainly assured that he shall ultimately be </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">destroyed.) </span><span class="font7">We notice, however, that the verse is highly . symbolic; for &quot;the beast and the false prophet&quot; : mentioned are symbols, and hence the torment . of those symbols must be figurative or symbolic \ torments. And at all events it has nothing what*- , ever to do with men, the evilly disposed of ‘ whom, verse 9 distinctly states, are to be destroyed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Verse 15 of the same chapter, foretelling the same judgment at the end of the Millennium of favor, declares: &quot;Whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.&quot; This might indeed imply torment<sub>r</sub>were it— not that the proceeding clause distinctly explains ' that the lake of fire signifies the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">second death, </span><span class="font7">as also does verse S of the next chapter, speak-' ing of the destruction awaiting the same class.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Revelation 19: 3 speaks of symbolic Babylon; her &quot;smoke [remembrance] rose up for ever.&quot; But it is to a symbolic woman and not a literal •'</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark59"></a><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;"><sup><a name="bookmark60"></a>sQaOTi2</sup>’<sup>iK;&lt;</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;qolden aqe &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>871</sup></span></h4>
<p><span class="font7">one that this statement applies. The symbol refers to a great </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">system</span><span class="font7"> whose fall from vast power misused is graphically portrayed in symbol in chapter IS. We </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">aviII</span><span class="font7"> not here identify this '‘woman/’ “Babylon/’ as it is not pertinent to this discussion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Revelation 14:8-11 is the only remaining passage to examine, and it is by far fhe most difficult to make plain; because the average reader has no adequate conception of the sig-ipification of the connecting symbols, the beast and his image of the preceding chapter. These represent great religious systems which already exist and have millions of devotees among Christian peoples; and one of these, the &quot;image/’ will yet, by closer federation of smaller religious systems, become much more influential and arbitrary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This will be in the end or &quot;harvest&quot; of this age and the dawn of the new Millennial age, which the Scriptures deciare will be introduced, not by peace, but by a time of trouble such as was not since there was a nation. It will be in the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">presence</span><span class="font7"> of the Lamb, i. e., “in the days of the Son of man” (Luke 17:26)—in the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">parousia (presence) of</span><span class="font7"> the Son of man (a spirit being, unseen by natural sight), while the world in general is proceeding with its usual affairs— eating, drinking, planting, building, etc. (Matthew 24:37, 38) The thought here is beclouded to the English reader by the mistranslation of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">parousia,</span><span class="font7"> which is rendered </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">coming</span><span class="font7"> instead of presence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It will be during this period of the Lord’s presence, and before He shall have put down all opposing authority and power, and while intelligence will be spreading over the world, that the great religious systems referred to in Revelation 13 will exercise their power and authority to hinder increasing light; and by them the doctrine of eternal torment will be enunciated afresh and impressed; and all who reverence these systems will be tormented by </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">their doctrines of fire and brimstone</span><span class="font7"> and by fear for friends whose eyes have been opened so that they deny the reasonableness of such a belief. (Cotupare Isaiah 29:13.14) Thus these will be in''torment so long as they worship (reverence) these human institutions and their doctrines more than and instead of the Word of the Lord. But that this torment will be in the present life is ns evident as that it will come as a natural result of disregarding the Lord's ■* way and following instead the traditions of ■: men; for the “beast and his image&quot; and their ‘ worship surely belong to this world; and that it will be before the present age is fully ended is shown by the succeeding verses.—Revelation 13:12,13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Before leaving this side of this question it will strengthen it if we shall notice that </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">tte </span><span class="font7">apostles Peter, Paul, James, and John—aside from the Founder of Christianity certainly the greatest theologians of the Christian chureh, and the only ones whose teachings can be recog* ' nized as of plenary inspiration—have not one word to say relative to the‘punishment for sin being eternal grief or eternal torment On the contrary, every one of them declares in unequivocal terms that life everlasting will be the reward of all who -will return through Christ to acceptance and fellowship with God;, and that </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">destruction</span><span class="font7"> everlasting will be the ultimate fate _ of all who, after full knowledge and blessing under Christ’s kingdom, wilfully reject righteousness and practise sin. For these testimonies as to the reward being life, see John 3:16 ; 5:24; 6: 54; 10:23; Romans 2:7; 6:23; James ' 1:12; 1 Timothy 1:16; Acts 11:18; 1 Peter 1: 4,5,9; Uohn 2:25. For their testimonies as to the penalty of wilful sin being death, destruc* -tion, see Plulippians 3:19; 2 Thessalonians 1: 9; 2 Peter 2:1; Acts 3:23; James 4:12; 1:13; 1 John 5:16; John 3:36; Matthew 10:28. And if the scope of investigation be extended to the Old Testament, the same will be found to be the testimony of all the holy prophets since the world began.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The-word </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">hell</span><span class="font7"> in our common version of the Bible is very misleading in this connection, implying as it does to the majority of readers a place of consciousness, of fire and pain. Nothing could be further from the real meaning of the word </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">hell,</span><span class="font7"> as may be seen by consulting . Webster’s “Unabridged Dictionary&quot; where the . primary meaning is shown to be &quot;the place of the dead”—&quot;or the grave; called in Hebrew </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">shcol,</span><span class="font7"> and by the Greeks </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">hades</span><span class="font7"> ” Webster tells /' us further that this word </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">hell</span><span class="font7"> comes from the ' old word </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“hele—</span><span class="font7">to hide, to conceal, to cover, to roof.” And so we find it used in old English literature in referring to the putting of potatoes into nits and in speaking of thatching or covering a house. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■ &lt;&nbsp;-■ . Turning to the Hebrew and Greek of the ong-inal Scriptures, we find the.corresponding words </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">sheet</span><span class="font7"> and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">hades</span><span class="font7"> to have a corresponding meaning, as Webster avers. These original Hebrew and Greek words occur in all seventy-six times in the common version English Bible, and are 'forty-one times translated </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">hell,</span><span class="font7"> three times ^ translated </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">pit,</span><span class="font7"> and thirty-two times translated </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">&lt;&nbsp;grave.</span><span class="font7"> The difficulty is not so much in the trans&gt; lation—if the word </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">hell</span><span class="font7"> be given its primary meaning: &quot;The place of the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">dead,&quot;</span><span class="font7"> &quot;the grave” —but in the fact that for several centuries past a </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">theological,</span><span class="font7"> secondary definition has been attached to the word </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">hell</span><span class="font7"> which makes it mean a place’of torment for the living, the very reverse of the original or primary meaning of the <sub>(</sub>word, as all scholars know or should know.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">\ We, therefore, call upon Mr. Ingersoll to concede that he erred in saying that Christianity </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">came</span><span class="font7"> with a message of eternal grief; or else ' that he specify, giving chapter and verse, not overlooking our citations and explanations above.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">’ (2) Let us now examine the other side of this first charge, and see if Mr. Ingersoll was</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">' correct in cl</span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">aimin</span><span class="font7">g that Christianity did not </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">come</span><span class="font7"> with tidings of great joy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">: It was when the babe Jesus was bom that the multitude of angels, inspired from above, sang, &quot;Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men!” It was the angel sent to tell the shepherds of the same great event who said unto them: &quot;Fear not: for, behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people. For unto you is</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">' born ... a </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Savior</span><span class="font7"> [Syriac, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Life-giver] ”— </span><span class="font7">„ Luke 2:8-14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This is the message with which Christianity </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">came;</span><span class="font7"> and this, not what it now variously declares, is our topic. Men realized that they were dying, and they desired </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">life.</span><span class="font7"> God had offered life to the Jewish nation if they would keep perfectly the Law given on Sinai. God we’ll ; knew that fallen, imperfect men could not keep that Law, and therefore could not secure everlasting lif$ under it; and the Israelites soon found how^true this was as one by one they died, and thus proved that by the deeds of the Law none of them were justified in God’s sight.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">- (JRomans 3:20) But God's plan was to teach -them, and through them to teach all men, the need of a </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Savior,</span><span class="font7"> a Life-giver, who should </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">redeem</span><span class="font7"> all from the original sentence of death and restore to perfection of life and being all who would accept His covenant of life. Long centuries had faithful Jews waited and looked for the promised Messiah, who should be their Redeemer and Life-giver. And no wonder, then, that His birth was announced as good tidings, .</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">True, the Jews overlooked the part which said that these good tidings should yet be unto </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">all people,</span><span class="font7"> and supposed that it would be only to the Jews. True, also, the civilized few whey*^ have yet heard the message of God's favor tcT^ men through this Life-giver have framed creeds and theories which virtually declare this angelic message a falsehood by teaching that all hope of hearing about and believing on Jesus is limited to the few years and accidental circumstances of this present life. Let us, nevertheless, stick to our text and acknowledge that, • whatever be the tidings of today, Christianity ■ did </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">come</span><span class="font7"> with a message of &quot;good tidings of great joy, which shall be [made known] </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">unto all people&quot;'—</span><span class="font7">not only to those who since </span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">Hig </span><span class="font7">birth and death have died in ignorance of the. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">only name</span><span class="font7"> whereby we must be saved, but also to the billions who had died before God's salvation was brought to light in the gospeh Does this imply the awakening of the dead! Even so. It is provided that </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“all</span><span class="font7"> that are in the graves shall hear [obey] his [the Son of man's] voice, and shall come forth”; and then, as the testimony of these glad tidings shall reach </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">aU people,</span><span class="font7"> the message further is that &quot;they that hear [obey] shall </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">live”</span><span class="font7">—live everlastingly—while such as will not obey will be destroyed from among His people.—John 5:28,25; Acts 3:23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When it is remembered that the apostle Paul was a most logical and truthful writer, that his writings cover all subjects connected with the gospel and constitute a large portion of the New Testament, and when we hear </span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font7"> say, &quot;I have^X not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of God” (Acts 20:27), and yet withal find not one syllable about eternal grief, we begin to understand why he could so heroically defend the gospel which he preached. And we can then • appreciate his exclamation, &quot;I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ; for it is the power of <sub>( </sub>God unto salvation to every one that believeth!&quot; Ah, yes I The reason that so many Christian ministers today are ashamed of the gospel they preach is that to a great extent they preach</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">Paul did not believe and did not preach. But, examining the evidences, we are fully assured that Christianity did not </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">come</span><span class="font7"> with the message . of grief, but with tidings of great joy which shall be made known unto all people. Ah, yes! exclaims Brother Paul, quoting from the prophet Isaiah, 'How beautiful are those proclaiming good tidings of good </span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">thin</span><span class="font7">gs?—Romans 10:15; Isaiah 52:7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Hear the apostle Paul again, preaching this message even when his life was threatened. He says: “And we declare unto you </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">glad tidings, </span><span class="font7">how that the promise [of a Messiah, a Lifegiver] which was made unto the fathers, God hath fulfilled the same unto us their children.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">. . Be it known unto you, therefore, men and brethren, that through this man is preached unto you [not a message of eternal grief, but] the . forgiveness of sins; and by him all that believe are justified [cleared, freed] from all things.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This would indeed be glad tidings to all who understand the message. Indeed, the objection ' urged against that early gospel was that it was too good to be true. They could not conceive of any better message than their Law, which offered </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">everlasting life</span><span class="font7"> to all who would obey it perfectly. (Romans 10:5; Galatians 3:12) Bat this gospel with which Christianity </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">came </span><span class="font7">to them declared that they could never merit everlasting life under the covenant of works, because all are fallen from perfection and hence from ability to do perfect works. And the glad tidings of the gospel of Christ consisted in showing that, in Christ, God had provided for all men a </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">way of obtaining everlasting life; </span><span class="font7">ithat as all mankind fell under condemnation </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">to \leuth</span><span class="font7"> (not to eternal torment and grief), and into mental, moral and physical imperfection, by Adam's disobedience (they, being in his loins, iinherited in a most natural way all the effects of his fall), and thus lost with him all right to life, so God had provided that Christ should </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">- -purchase</span><span class="font7"> the life of Adam (and of the race which lost life through him) by the sacrifice of His own life as a </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">sin-offering</span><span class="font7"> on their behalf. This provision was made in order that through this Redeemer (in due time) the offer of life everlasting might be granted to each member of the race upon condition of obedience to Ills laws. And. better than the Jewish Law (which really justified none—Hebrews 10: 4; Galatians</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">each should be judged, not by his actual works, but by his intentions and efforts—the sin-offer* ing of Christ compensating for all unintentional weaknesses and errors, to every one that believ-eth. The Jews thought these tidings too good to be true, and clung to the Law. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(</span></p>
<p><span class="font7"><sub>c</sub> Who can read the New Testament epistles and not be struck with the joyous spirit of the writers, even while they were enduring afflictions for the preaching of these good tidings of which they were not and had no need to be ashamed? Judge of the contrast: How many' thousand dollars a year would it take to hire a man of the apostle Paul’s ability to preaeh the message of eternal grief one hour each week? But note that Brother Paul was so enthusiastic with his message of the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">grace of-</span><span class="font7"> God through Christ, the &quot;good tidings of great joy, which shall [yet] be [made known] unto all people,” that he forsook an honorable, influential and lucrative position among men and spent his life, in the service of these &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">tidings,</span><span class="font7"> often suffer</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">ing imprisonment and stripes, and even with </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font7">lacerated back in prison singing praise fb God, because he was accounted </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">worthy</span><span class="font7"> to suffer in the service of such a Master and such a gospel • of which he was not ashamed. But his gospel had no element of eternal grief in it. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">So, then, it is not true that Christianity </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">come , </span><span class="font7">with a message of eternal grief ; but the con- . trary is proven: That it brought good tidings of great joy of which no sensible </span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">m*™</span><span class="font7"> needed to be ashamed.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark61"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark62"></a>Charge II Examined</span></h6>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">D</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">octor Buckley</span><span class="font7"> points out, as the second gigantic falsehood of Mr. Ingersoll’s discourse, liis statement that “it [Christianity] • has filled the future with fear and flame, and made God the keeper of an eternal penitentiary destined to be the home of nearly all the </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">sons . </span><span class="font7">of men.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">a</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We presume that Dr. Buckley’s objection is/ that not Christianity, but God, has filled the ' future with fear and flame. But on this point , we must agree with Mr. Ingersoll. The fact cannot bo disputed that the future is full of fear to the civilized world—fear either for them- • selves or for their friends. And after examining ■ the Scriptures, as above, we find that God is not ' responsible for this fear, nor did Christianity </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">come 'with a</span><span class="font7"> message to produce such fears. And the pages of history clearly show that the doctrines which produce these fears began to be introduced in the third century, when the church . (nominal) began to fall away from the simplicity of the faith of Christ and the apostles, giv-J ing heed to the seducing influences of Pagan • philosophy and to &quot;doctrines of devils”—devil-. iah doctrines indeed, blasphemies upon the divine plan and character. (This was clearly predicted by the Apostle. See 1 Timothy 4:1; 2 Thessalonians 2:3.) And the Bible, in so many words, asserts that these fearful doctrines . are of human fabrication, saying, “Their </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">fear </span><span class="font7">toward me is taught by the precept of men.” —Isaiah 29:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We see but one exception that can justly be taken to Mr. Ingersoll's statement in this case; namely, his charge that Christianity makes God the keeper of an eternal penitentiary. We object to the word </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">penitentiary.</span><span class="font7"> A penitentiary ■ is a </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">reformatory</span><span class="font7"> institution, more nearly corresponding to the &quot;purgatory” of Roman Catholicism; but the “hell” claimed by both Romanists and Protestants, but which we have found to be without authorization in God’s Word and taught only “by the precept of men,” is not a penitentiary, but a </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">hopeless</span><span class="font7"> prison of despair, described by that admired but greatly mistaken good man, Dr. Isaac Watts, thus:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;Tempests of angry fire shall roll To blast the rebel worm, And beat upon the naked soul In one eternal storm.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There could be no objection made to a penitentiary with </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">jiist</span><span class="font7"> restraints and retributions for sins. And indeed the Bible does teach that the entire earth will shortly be turned into a vast penitentiary (during the Millennial reign of Christ) in which not only will all mankind be under the restraint of an iron rule, with righteousness laid to the line and justice to tho-plummet, but that then all shall also be brought to dn accurate knowledge of the truth, that they may be saved. (See 1 Timothy 2:4) But this divinely arranged penitentiary of the next age is not to be an </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">eternal one.</span><span class="font7"> No, thank God. it shall accomplish its designed object by bringing to perfection and harmony with God all who, after full knowledge, shall demonstrate their love of righteousness and truth; and by cutting off from life and hope, in the second death, all those who, after full knowledge, love sin. (Revelation 21:7,8) Then will come the time when God will have a clean universe, free from sin and free from penitentiaries. And then there shall be no more death, neither sorrow nor crying; for the former things [associated with sin] shall then have passed away (Revelation 21:4), and heaven and earth shall be filled with the glory of the Lord.</span></p>

<h5><a name="bookmark63"></a><span class="font11"><a name="bookmark64"></a>Child Slavery Increasing </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">By Alice Park</span></h5>
<p><span class="font15">C</span><span class="font7">HILD labor of forty-eight varieties continues in the forty-eight states of the United States. Child labor does not mean selling newspapers after school nor working a few hours on holidays. It means toiling long hours at machines in factories and fields, excessive tasks at low pay, and no time for education, play, or healthy growth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A federal amendment is a necessity. Congress might easily have passed a new child labor amendment to take the place of the one eliminated by the Supreme Court in May, 1922; but it has not done so. It has lost more time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Children less than six years old are sometimes discovered to be daily child laborers. Children less than twelve years old are working by thousands. Sixteen is the age of protection already secured in several countries; and it is the aim of our National Child Labor Co</span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">mmi</span><span class="font7">ttea</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Counting only the children between ten and fifteen years, 1,OGO,853 is the census figure of, 1920; but child labor is increasing. Unemployment of men and women is increasing. Children are shoving men and women out of jobs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There are states that have enacted and enforced good laws against child labor. But even the people who live in model states—and such states are rare—use goods produced in all the states. So all people who use food, clothes, tools, toys and newspapers are’using articles produced in part by child labor. All states </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">are </span><span class="font7">fully responsible.</span></p>

<h5><a name="bookmark29"></a><span class="font11"><a name="bookmark65"></a>STUDIES IN THE “HARP OF GOD” (</span></h5>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">With Issue Number 60 we beyan running Judge Rutherford’s new book, “The Harp of God”, with accompanying questions, taking the place of both Advanced and Juvenile Hints Studies which have been hitherto published.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">”’St John, subsequently writing concerning the Lord, emphasizes the fact that they saw with their own eyes, saying, “That whichg was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked, upon, and our hands have handled, of the Word jof life; (for the life was manifested, and we have seen it, and bear witness, and show unto you that eternal life, which was with the Father, and was manifested unto us;) that which we have seen and heard declare we unto you, that ye also may have fellowship with us: and truly our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ. And these things write we unto you, that your joy may be fulL”—1 John 1:1-4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">&quot;&quot;Thus we see there were more than five hundred witnesses who testified to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus. This alone should establish the fact beyond any question of a doubt; but when we see the reason for the Lord's resurrection, the whole matter not only becomes clear but brings great joy to the heart of one who sees it. We must furthermore consider that these faithful witnesses of the Lord did not go to some isolated place to give their testimony concerning II is resurrection, but they gave it openly before the tribunals, before Jews and heathen philosophers, courtiers, lawyers, as well as the common people. They did not wait until years afterward to begin to give their testimony concerning His resurrection, but did so immediately after the great event took place. They were so bold in declaring it that had there been a possibility of refuting their testimony we may be sure that the Pharisees would have attempted it They did not give this testimony for the ‘purposo,of gaining fame, glory, or riches. But, on the contrary, they knew that they would bring upon themselves the indignation of the Pharisees and rulers and would expose themselves to suffering and death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">, <sup>aT4</sup>At Pentecost, only fifty days after the resurrection of the Lord, the apostle Peter stood forth before the multitude and proclaimed to the men of Judea and all that dwelt in Jerusalem concerning the resurrection of </span><span class="font6">the Lord. In </span><span class="font7">his eloquence he exclaimed: 'Therefore let all iy the house of Israel know assuredly, that God ’ hath made that same Jesus, whom ye have H crucified, both Lord and Christ” (Acta 2:36) .</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">So persuasive and convincing was the Apostle’s argument that the Jews who had participated in having the Lord put to death “were pricked in their heart, and said unto Peter and to the </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">rest </span><span class="font7">of the apostles, Men and brethren, what shall we do!” Some of them suffered death, and martyrdom because they preached Christ and his resurrection. (Acts 7:1-9) The apostles and early Christians received much persecution-because they testified boldly that Jesus </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">was? ' </span><span class="font7">raised from the dead. They would not have done V--. this had they been trying to carry out some -* fraudulent imposition. Their motive tin preaching these doctrines was to be witnesses for the Lord concerning the f</span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">ulfilm</span><span class="font7">ent of </span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">His</span><span class="font7"> great plan: ’ for the redemption and deliverance of mankind* x.</span></p>

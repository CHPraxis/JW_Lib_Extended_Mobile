<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">States Double Their Debts</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">A</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">NYBODY can get into debt, but it takes a wise man to get out and to stay out. From 1915 to 1922, the net debt for the states of the United States more than doubled, and is now close to $1,000,000,000; while the per capita net debt advanced from $4.31 in 1915 to $8.12 in 1922.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">150-Year-Old Grape-Vine Bears 600 Bunches</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">A</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"> GRAPE-VINE in Hampton Court, England, planted in the reign of George II, produced 600 bunches of magnificent hot-house grapes this season, some of the bunches weighing more than two pounds apiece. Constant pruning of the vine is necessary in order to prevent it from exhausting itself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Zionism to Have a Steamship Line</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">HE Zionists have purchased the liner, President Arthur, and in March will begin a regular steamer service between New York and Palestine. At that time the President Arthur expects to sail from this port with over 600 prominent Jews. It is expected that other vessels will be added to the fleet.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Longest Bridge Span Just Connected</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">HE highway bridge across the Hudson River at Peekskill is not fully completed, and will not be,.open for traffic until next summer; but the span, 1623 feet in length, has been connected. The bridge is 2,350 feet long, and is 155 feet above the river at its center. It carries two roadways, and a sidewalk at each side.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">How the Cost of House Construction is Divided</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">A</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">FTER a Study covering the entire country, the Department of Commerce announces that in the construction of a home the average :</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">cost is distributed as follows: Architect and real estate fees, 6.4 percent; financing, 6.7 percent; contractor, 12.6 percent; land, 19 percent; labor, 26 percent; building material, 29.3 parcent</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Fatal Accidents in the Highway Increase</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">HE Department of Commerce has finished a study of fatal accidents on the public highways, and reports a total for the year 1923 of 22,621 killed. It estimates that eighty-three percent of these highway fatalities, or 18,788, involve automobiles. This is at the rate of over fifty deaths a day, and means that every year, in every unit of 5,000 people, one person is killed by automobiles sometime during the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Horse-Chestnuts with a Sting in Them</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">A MOUNT VERNON, N. Y., lad had a new kind of experience with horse-chestnuts. He climbed a tree for some. Electrical construction was in progress in the neighborhood. By some accident the tree suddenly became charged while the lad was in its branches; and he found himself fastened to a limb, unable to move. However, when the current was shut off he was able to climb down unharmed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Two Worst Enemies of Beautiful Teeth</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">THE two worst enemies of teeth are white bread, which denies the teeth the minerals they need, and the nice, soft, creamy dentifrices, which make an ideal vehicle for carrying germs, giving them a soil in which they can multiply between the teeth. If you want to preserve your teeth indefinitely, brush them daily with baking soda, 15c worth of which will do you more good than all the dentifrices you can buy in a lifetime.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Mirage DU Not Do At Promised</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">O</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">N OCTOBER 5, Cape May had a beautiful mirage, in which conditions were so perfect that with the aid of a glass directed toward the heavens people could be seen walking on the streets of Rehoboth, Delaware, twenty miles away, and vessels and tugs could be seen which had passed out of sight on the seas. Navigators predicted a great storm, to follow; but the storm did not come, the succeeding week being a period of ideally perfect weather. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">2Vew </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">York to Peking in Sixty Hours</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">G</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">ENERAL William Mitchell, with the U. S.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Air Service, in an address before military men in Milwaukee stated that the difficulties of sustained flight are being rapidly mastered. Much to the surprise of some of his hearers, he also stated that conditions in the arctic regions are extremely favorable for flying, and that the flight from New York to Peking via the North Pole is only a matter of 6,300 miles. He thinks that in a short time such a flight may be possible, taking only sixty hours.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">America and Britain Slowly Changing Places</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">E</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">NGLAND has not been able to recover the position in world trade which she held prior to the war. Much of what she lost seems to have fallen permanently to the United States. At the outbreak of the. World War, America's share of the world’s trade was one-tenth; now it is one-sixth and growing. When the world trade of the United States during the past ten years is compared with what it was during the previous ten years, it is found to be over four times as much. • ' &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Snowfall Defeated Everest Expedition</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">HE story of Mr. N. E. Odell, who reached a height of 26,000 feet on Mount Everest last spring, and who was the last to see Mr. Mallory and Mr. Irvine alive, shows that these two men when last seen were within 800 feet of the summit, but w£re two hours and fifty minutes be? hind their schedule. It is supposed that they went onward to the summit and may actually have reached it; but that on the way back they were overtaken by nightfall and perished in the cold. The British will make another attempt to c</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">limb</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"> Mount Everest in the spring oft 1926.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">German Bonds Go with a Rush</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">I</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">N THE international loan made to Germany the United States was allotted $110,000,000. 1100 banks and bond dealers began the sale at 10 o’clock on the morning of October 14. The books remained open only fifteen minutes, but in that time the loan was over-subscribed five times. It is taken for granted among financiers that this loan assures the success of the. Dawes Plan. It is expected that a loan to France as large or larger than the one to Germany will be floated in the American market at once.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Salaries of League Officials -</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">U</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">NDER this heading, most Americana would expect us to discuss the phenomenal </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">sal</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">aries paid to officials in the National League^ </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">American League, or some other </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">association of </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">ball players. But no, we are speaking of </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">League of Nations. For instance, </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Mr. Thomas, </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">head of the League of Nations labor </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">office^ re</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">ceives a salary of $25,000 a year, free </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">at</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"> income tax; and besides this </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">he </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">receives </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">great traveling </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">allowances.

Nowadays a large percentage of our children live in a place which has not much space between its four walls. They come in at evening time. Mother kills a couple of cans, and they have dinner. A door is opened, and a bed drops down. Father and mother go out for recreation, and the children hunt theirs.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">York harbor, is no more. It has been replaced by a remarkably powerful and efficient suction pump, which removes the contents of a sand-bar in much the same way that a girl with a straw in her mouth removes the contents of a glass of soda water. The suction device is so rapid and successful in its work that the dredges have to proceed three times a day to the dumping •rounds, thirty miles out at sea. The quantity of material being thus carried out from New York harbor is so great that the dumping grounds are required to be changed frequently.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">THE Vancouver Trades Council is stirred by the discovery that during the past year five child </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">immi</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">grants to Canada have committed suicide because they found the conditions of life too hard to be borne. Canada is not the only place where those in the prime of life are cruel to those whose powers are not fully developed or those whose powers have begun to fail. It was but two days ago that we heard a contractor cursing the day laborer. When he had discharged a poor man and it had been explained to him in a kind way that the workman was 75 years of age, and that he ought not expect too much, he turned again to the man and cursing him yet once again said: T did not know you were 75 years of age. You ought to be dead.” Let us have hope. The Bible shows that some time Christianity, real, true Christianity, will spread until it shall take in both Canada and the United States.</span></p>

During the journey the ship encountered two storms, which it negotiated with complete success. The designer of this zeppelin states that he could easily design a ship five or six times the size of the ZR-3, capable of carrying perhaps 500 persons at a time, and able to cross the ocean in three days. One of the United States naval officers who made the trip from Germany states that at all times the vessel rode so smoothly that there was nothing to indicate to those aboard that they were moving. Everything about the car, when it arrived, was luxurious, neat and orderly. There is considerable discussion in the papers of the possibility of zeppelin routes between New York and London, New York and Los Angeles, and Los Angeles and Honolulu.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Henry Ford offered to take over the Government's water-power project at Muscle Shoals with the avowed intention of manufacturing fertilizers out of the nitrogen in the atmosphere at a fraction of what the farmers are now paying for this necessity of life. At the time he made the proposition, the Government held</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">y </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">the Muscle Shoals plant in light esteem; but immediately after receipt of Mr. Ford’s letter, the politicians hailed the plant as one of the country’s greatest assets and began to quarrel over it As a consequence, Mr. Ford, after having waited over three years for an answer to his letter, has withdrawn his offer, and the Govern- &gt;&nbsp;ment is where it was in the first place. It has at Muscle Shoals the best water power project possible in America, one which could be made ’ immensely valuable to the people. Now we shall , have to wait to see whether anything will be done with it, or whether it will become one of ' those items of public interest which are never ' finally solved but remain from generation to generation, as one wit has expressed the matter, “a thing of duty and a jaw forever.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Pile Up Great Stacks of Gold </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">By B. Horton Cofyrove. (Dedicated to the Profiteer)</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">What is success? The sordid man will claim It is the piling up of all the gold you can; Let great possessions be your constant aim, E’en though compelled to rob your brother man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Get gold 1 Pile up the coin in shining stacks 1 Grab every dollar that your hands can seizes E’en though you have to break some human backs And many plodding toilers starve and freeze.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Let not the children in the grinding mills, With faces blanched an&lt;f wrinkled from their task. Nor women’s hearts, that crushing labor chills, Deter your purpose. Get gold is all I ask.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">’Tis true your yean are short upon this earth;</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Old Sheriff Time will soon his writ unfold;</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">And yet I can accord to you but little worth , Unless you pile great stacks of shining gold.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Pile up the gold f Seek millions to possess, Though meantime rags and hunger you behold. </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">If</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> yon would reach the summit of success I say to.you, Pile up great stacks of gold.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">And while you’re piling, wear a pious TXlldl* Attend the church and sing a sacred song, In order that your villainies you may screen, And make folks think in heaven you belong.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Pile up the gold, and on a granite pillar write: “Here lies a man who great success achieved; He robbed his neighbors, filched the widow’s mite, And at his death left not one soul bereaved.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">“A chance for gain this sordid man ne’er missed; He was in life what people call a Profiteer, And so, lest no one know he ever did exist, This granite pillar hath been erected here.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">His bust will not adorn the Hall of Fame, Nor will this pillar much attention hold;</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The only fleeting notice it can claim: Who sleepeth here piled up great stacks of gold.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">And now at last where are those millions won? Perhaps his daughter married a foreign lord. The lord, mayhap, quick through his millions run; And thus the dead man reaped his rich reward.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark33"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark34"></a>Political and Industrial Unrest—A Suggested Cure</span></h6>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">By Howard S. Ross, of the Montreal Bar</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">M</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">OST students of economics feel that the pressing need is'an economic plan under •which we may all (by applying our energy to the natural resources under conditions of equal freedom and opportunity) easily get food, clothing and shelter, and material wants generally, so that we may have ample leisure to develop our intellectual and spiritual powers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">We have conquered production, and must now master the problem of the equitable distribution of nature’s bounty. How disappointing that the wonderful inventions and discoveries of science have not given us an age of plenty for all! How tragic that many inventions and discoveries are too often used for other purposes than the building up of a worthy civilization! .We have the opportunity of abolishing overwork, overcrowding, and underfeeding. But we must see that we cannot save what we call wealth and at the same time live upon it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Savings at interest is wealth to the individual owner, but a lien upon industry generally.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">How pitiful that unemployment comes when there is a superabundance of goods! When the world is “wealthy”, the people starve. But this is unavoidable in face of the profit obsession, and our unfortunate condition will continue while we work under a system which causes each of us to do what we can to make commodities we deal in scarce so they will be expensive to others. We wish the ultimate consumer to get them; but if it is too easy, that is bad for business. And the greater the people’s need the more (as a rule) they pay. That is the cruel law of supply and demand which presupposes a victor and a vanquished in most transactions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">It is not at the point of production that our troubles arise, but at the point of exchange; hence the importance of more and intensive, disinterested study of the money question so that it may be made clear that while money gives the power to'buy goods it also has the power of preventing others from buying them even though the warehouses and elevators of the world are glutted. Surely we shall not consider this maladjustment, as on a par with catastrophe, famine, and pestilence, and despair of finding a better way of life in which we will work to live rather than live to work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Our enlightened self-interest should, and will, urge us to adopt a plan under which none will be at a disadvantage, because until then there will be wasteful conflict between nations, groups, and individuals. A small part of this waste, avoidable under a sane economic system, would make us all comfortable and show how true a prophet was Benjamin Franklin when he said that if everyone would do his share of useful work, a few hours each day, our conflict would cease and we would not quarrel over material possessions, which would be as plentiful as water, that priceless gift of Nature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Profit Incentive is Destructive</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">W</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">E ARE beginning to see that the underlying cause of war is the same as that of unemployment and poverty. While w» should do all we can to give immediate relief in pressing cases calling for our sympathy and help, we should distinguish more clearly between real solutions and mere palliatives. This is asking much of a busy, fearful people who must perforce do the immediate tasks and spend long hours each day working to make up the waste.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">The League of Nations, the World Court, world-wide labor organizations, and the many splendid and helpful religious and moral movements will be inadequate if we fail to find a method of accurately measuring our services ; and also if we fail to find a better incentive than the cruel profit incentive, while at the same time planning for a world both generous and wealthy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">How many, in addition to Davies the Welsh nature poet, are asking, plaintively and poignantly:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">“What is this life if, full of care, ~ We have no time to stand and stare;</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">. No time to stand beneath the boughs And stare aa long as sheep and cows; No time to turn at Beauty’s glance, And watch her feet, how they can dance. A poor life this if, full of care, We have no time to stand and stare.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">It is not my thought that anyone should sacrifice for others, be pulled down (materially or spiritually), but rather that all should be lifted up. Think what the removal of fear would mean to all of us. Physicians tell us a great part of our diseases is the result of fear; and it—the fear of destitution—no doubt is the-source of most of the constant conflict between individuals, groups, and nations. With the suggested remedy we would live a less hectic life and have more leisure for meditation.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">13S</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">In such social order as most persons long for, art and science would not so frequently be prostituted to commerce and war; and, freed from the struggle (except a few hours each day) for material needs, we humans would rise to the heights of which we are clearly capable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Gradually we are coming to have more harmony of aim, but we cannot as yet say the same for our identity of conclusion. We are apt to spend too much time in elaborating the obvious faults ef our present system—or lack of system —and too little time en constructive plans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Probably we have dwelt over long in the philosophic or wisdom stage, and so the world is anxious that wo should now advance to the science stage—of how to do it The virtue stage —doing it—how far off it is! While working for and hoping for the better days we can be as those “who, rowing hard against the stream, see distant gates of Eden gleam.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">What stands in the way!</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Equitist Plan Recommended</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">A</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">N INCREASING number of persons believe that our present inequitable medium of exchange is the key to our difficulties; and there is steadily a growing interest in the United States and Canada in what is called the Equitist Plan, the basis of which are cooperation and indi-. vidualism. Experience has surely taught us that less, rather than more, government is desirable; and that we should depend less on acts of legis-. latures, which are for the most part substitutes for work and too often woefully unscientific. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">It does seem clear that we should encourage individual initiative, and preserve private property, the latter to' be used upon acts of production, accurately measured, rather than upon acts of legislatures. And in order to- be effective, the plan should make it not only possible but easy and natural for groups, individuals, and nations to cooperate and to attain that priceless state— self-government [We have one thousand years to wait for this.—Ed.] We are fond of saying, “It is results we wish.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Let us see what results consist of. There, are two classes of things: There are those which exist through the exertion of persons, and those which exist regardless of the exertion of persons. The latter we call &quot;natural resources”, normally the gift of nature to all of us—not to any one or any few of us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">“Results” are combinations of the two, human work and natural resources. The work is stored in the resources; but that does not alter the fact that resources belong to no one. No one creates them or contributes anything but the work—the human exertion. That is all anyone can give to or do for any one else.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">We-exchange, only because we wish to get the benefit of the division of labor—because we wish to get more of the natural resources with less work. Who would claim that he wishes to get more work from others for less of their workf</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">If you can get in one way more from nature than can your neighbor, and he in another way can get more from nature than you with equal, effort, then, by exchanging (and this is a voluntary choice under the Equitist Plan) equitably ' —hour for hour of time worked—you both get. more from nature than either can by not exchanging. That is the essence of equitable exchange of our services or work, and all economists agree that the whole object of trade and business is to exchange services.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">But if we exchange on the basis of quantity, or quality, or any other than time worked, one . or both will charge for the natural resources in which their labor is stored.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">For instance: If a man works half of his time on each of two locations, growing corn, produo-ing fifty bushels on one and one hundred on the &quot;&nbsp;other, and sells both in the result-unit market, * he gets the same for his work on each; and, in addition, he gets as much more for the extra-yield of nature on the latter location; And this is the basis of Ground Rent, the great privilege which always takes up the slack.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">But if one sells on the work-unit basis, he gets the same for his work, and nothing for nature’s extra yield, which goes to consumers as the free gift it really is, from, nature. So each one pays for the work of production—in the price of the product—but nothing for the natural resources in which the work is stored. But under the result-unit basis, each one pays —gives work— not only for the work, but also for the natural resources in which the work is stored.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">When we adopt a work-unit money (that is, agree that every dollar issued be issued solely for an hour’s adult human work), and promise that it will be accepted in return for an hour’s adult human work, no one could receive money for anything but human work, and no one would have to pay money for anything but human work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">It being easy for all, and as easy for one as for another, to get the material things we naturally crave for, our strife, incident to our struggle to get special privileges so that we may exact tribute, would cease. Fortunately we do not fight about the things easily attainable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">And if such a plan is sound, when may we expect its adoption ! When people generally have acquired sufficient knowledge. Much preliminary work must be done—the educational work. Human association (in such a chaotic condition as at present) cannot be soon put on an equitable foundation. Misconceptions must first he crowded out by knowledge of nature’s laws. Correct thinking must precede correct action.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">[Note: The Lord’s kingdom is absolutely essential first, to break the money power' and bring those in control to their knees. We are able to see the possibilities, however, and the better day is not far off.—Ed.]</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Spanish romance, where the word is used to refer to a mythical island “on the right hand of the Indies, very near the Terrestrial Paradise.” Plenty of California people, and plenty of other people who have visited the state, think this reference to California as being very near to Paradise is not at all a bad idea.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">California is a curious land. It has the tallest trees and the shortest grass, the highest waterfalls and the widest valleys, the coldest summers and the hottest winters, the highest mountains and the deepest depressions, the richest soil and the most barren deserts. There the railroads turn around in spirals to come down the mountains; and in one place, within a tunnel, there is a railroad bridge over a chasm of unknown depth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">The -upper three-fourths of the state has a much heavier rainfall than the lower portion, and hence has larger streams and greater forests. San Francisco Bay, next to Sydney, is reckoned the world’s best harbor. It has a shore line of 300 miles, and receives the drainage of the vast interior valleys of Sacramento and San Joaquin, which virtually comprise the upper three-fourths of the state. Its Golden Gate into the Pacific is only a mile wide.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">In nearly all parts of California the nights are so cool as to necessitate the use of blankets. In San Francisco in midsummer it will be noticeably cold in the shade while it is very warm in the sun. In San Jose in the fall one may shiver under a half dozen blankets, although the thermometer is not down to freezing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">In Los Angeles, in midsummer, it may get to 125° in the shade; but within an hour or so one may, for a few cents, ride to the summit of Mount Lowe, where it is always cooL Los Angeles, and even San Diego, are accounted favorably as summer resorts as well as winter resorts, on account of the surrounding snowclad mountains.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Certain types of diseases are conspicious in California by their absence; namely, typhoid, malaria, fevers of all sorts, and summer dis-. eases of children.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">The summers of California are so dry that for six months after May 1 there is practically no rain. During the winter the snows fall in the mountains 30 to 50 feet deep; and as they thaw out in the summer, they keep the valleys, below supplied with perpetual streams for irrigation purposes. The Sierra Nevada mountain range, which shuts off California from Nevada, is the largest and most interesting chain of mountains in the United States. At the snow line this chain of mountains is thirty miles wide, and almost a hundred at the base. There are about 1,500 glacial lakes in the state.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">From the highest peak, Mount Whitney, 14,-522 feet (the highest mountain in the. United States), one looks down into Death Valley, 200 feet below sea level. In the Sierra Nevada* there are 172 mountains over 8,000 feet in height; and in the same territory is the highest waterfall in the world, the Pioneer, 3,270 feet</span></p>

<div><img src="g_E_19241203_files/g_E_19241203-3.png" alt="" style="width:16pt;height:18pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">VER since the United States seized California from Mexico almost without resistance, in 1845, the state has had aa exciting history. It started with the discovery of gold I by J. W. Marshall, of New Jersey, while enraged in digging a mil] race for a Swiss settler. Efforts were made to suppress the news, hut it spread like wildfire, and the East went mad.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Within a year 42,000 persons had made their way across the vast plains, and the rush continued for years. Communication with the East was maintained by the Pony Express. On one occasion the Pony Express covered the' 1,950 miles from the Missouri River to San Francisco in 7 days and 17 hours. The riders pressed forward in relays day and night at top speed. The postage on the letters was $5 per half ounce.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Following the gold excitement came the silver ’discoveries in Nevada, with an era of stock gambling the like of which was never know before nor since. In 1867 the Union Pacific was completed, and San Francisco was brought within four days of New York. In 1874, with less than 200,000 population, San Francisco had one hundred millionaires.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">In 1886 the Santa F4 line was completed into southern California; and a boom of a different sort occurred, which is still on. Without any sly dig at this part of the world, we think we may safely class this boom as one in real estate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">As California has thus been filled up, the natives and other living creatures have died off. There are still 15,377 Indians in the state; and if the natives of any country have ever been worse treated than these poor creatures who have been despoiled of their lands, we wonder where they are.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">The elks, which used to roam the hills by thousands, are no more. The bears once common are exceedingly scarce. There are few antelope; and few beavers where once there were many.

<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">A</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">NYTHING that will grow anywhere will grow in California. It is the leading fruit state in the Union, producing two-fifths of the world’s oranges. Practically the entire orange output of the state is traceable to two seedless orange trees from Brazil, sent by the government to Riverside in 1873, although there were other varieties of oranges in the state before that time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">California is also the banner state for walnuts, almonds, and garden vegetables. Solid transcontinental trainloads of canteloupes, lettuce and other garden truck in season, are as common as the great shipments of oranges, pears, lemons, prunes, and raisins continually made to Eastern markets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">The largest big trees reach over 325 feet in height and are up to 38 feet in diameter, with an age of 5,000 years. The state is fifth in area of forests, but second in stand of lumber, being exceeded only by Oregon. Many of the streets of the southern part of the state are lined with palms, pepper trees from Peru, and eucalyptus from Australia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">California is a large producer of gold, silver, borax, soda, petroleum, salt, and asphaltum. It exceeds every other state in the average money deposited in savings banks per depositor. It leads the Union in enrollment of college students, 1 out of every 419 of the population being in college. San Francisco is the leading whaling port of the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">California has such a variety of scenery and such clear air that it has become the accepted center for the making of moving pictures. The California pictures have a sharpness of outline not obtainable elsewhere. A sad feature of the business is that the thousands of girls who become movie-struck, and land in Los Angeles without money and without friends, find it difficult to obtain employment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">The banner days of the state are January to March, inclusive, when the oranges are ripe and the trees are in bloom for the next succeeding crop. Then there is plenty of rain, and southern California is as near a paradise on earth as one could hope to find. It looks dust-bedraggled in the autumn; but one can hardly expect to have his best clothes on all the time!</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Californians who live there all the.time are so jealous about their state that we expect nothing from them in repayment of this friendly boost, nothing but their customary savage reward to all persons outside their boundaries who have the hardihood even to mention their wonderful state. And yet we call the attention of all our readers to the fact that we have not said one word about fleas—a subject they never like io have mentioned I</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">By Theodore Cocheu (</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">A</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">T PRESENT the world is like a sick man, and the cause of its sickness must be determined before a proper remedy can be applied.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">We are living in a preeminently commercial age, just recovering from the shock of the greatest war of history and groping in darkness, seeking some plan of readjustment, confronted on every side and in every country by financial disturbance, until it seems certain that the first and greatest problem before us is that of Exchange.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">How can obligations be exchanged for compensation?. How can the debts of nations to each other be liquidated? And how can exchanges between individuals be adjusted to the satisfaction of all parties? - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">As the first step toward that world peace for which every right-minded person prays, these questions must be correctly answered; and until they are correctly answered no real peace can be attained, however many prizes may be offered or what number of leagues' may be suggested.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">To secure a real and lasting peace, we must begin by committing to memory the following words:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">“Whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Any successful plan must have this sentiment for its foundation; for without such a foundation failure is inevitable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Just here it may be proper to say that no criticism is intended nor fault found with our banks or the banking system, if they are confined strictly to the banking business; but with respect to their issue of our money or acting as fiscal agents representing this government in any manner, that is an evil which must be speedily ended. The banking business is as legitimate and necessary as that of building, carpentry, mason work, tailoring, or any other branch of industry; but the banks should have ho more connection with the government than has any other trade or calling.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">The all-important question of exchange of values has for ages been left entirely in the hands of so-called financiers. In law-making bodies, finance committees are always made up of bankers, and all financial laws are formulated by them, and their plans invariably prove ex-</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">travagantly expensive to the people and correspondingly profitable to themselves. So they cannot escape responsibility for the present chaotic condition of the financial world, culminating in the great fiasco of the German mark issued in amounts running into billions and trillions uncountable by any human being and unredeemable by any human agency.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">It is said-that money is the life-blood of commerce. Now human blood must be pure and function regularly, or the whole system becomes out of adjustment. So with the commercial body: If its money be unsound, the entire system is paralyzed or worse. Therefore in commercial affairs the paramount need is unimpeachable. money. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The PligK . of Germany</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">L</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">ISTEN to the babble of the financiers </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">or </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">near financiers in the affairs of Germany. Having made Germany ridiculous in the </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">eyes </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">of the world, these financiers or near financiers propose that a gold mark be issued, apparently forgetting the bales of marks already issued, whose only value is in the promise to pay written on them. Will the promise to pay written on the face of a gold mark be any more sacred or binding than that on the mark now in </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">usef </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Certainly not; and this is evidenced by the fact that outside parties are called in to underwrite the gold mark, and incidently to be well paid for such underwriting from taxes levied on the helpless people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Poor Germany! A nation of scholars, scientists, skilled mechanics, and busy workmen, </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">nation having within itself all the elements of prosperity and happiness, yet it has been and is still being made the victim of ridiculous folly, </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">laughing stock to the whole world, were it not for the terrible tragedy of it all. Yet the men who have fooled and misled the people in the past continue to push themselves to the front, with nothing to justify their leadership but their incomparable gall or the simplicity of their victims. If this bunch of confidence men could </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">be </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">relegated to the rear, it would mean a long stride toward a sound and lasting world peace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Today American money is the soundest and most stable in the world, because it is the obligation of this government Yet see what these</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">’ </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">financial</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"> quacks would do to it, A presumably iwise professor of one of our leading colleges proposes to stabilize the American dollar. How! j Twenty-three grains of gold being considered <sup>1</sup> the basis of the dollar, he would have the government issue frequent bulletins giving the market price of gold, and announce that twenty-two grains would constitute a dollar if gold increased in price to that extent, or twenty-four grains if such a decrease in price took place. That is substantially his plan to stabilize our good dollar! Under that plan the dollar would chase the changes in gold up and down. It is as though a surgeon, about to perform a serious operation requiring a base of great stability, should select a light canoe anchored in a choppy sea for such base. But everything goes—if you own sufficient titles. So this eminent professor was quoted and copied by the public press.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Impossibility of Gold Payments</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">W</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">HILE</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"> on this phase of the subject, let us refer to the recent foolish sayings of an </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">emin</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">ent foreign statesman. There will be found in the &quot;Literary Digest” of February 9,1924, an article entitled, &quot;When War Debts are not War Debts,” a speech delivered to the Belgian Senate by its Vice-President, Henri La Fontain, who among other things said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;The losses of Europe caused by the late war were 1,065,000,000,000 gold francs. The United States share of this debt is 440,000,000,000 gold francs.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">If we put these gold francs into gold dollars, they will equal 213 billion dollars. Now the United States Assay Office reports tell us that the total commercial gold of the whole world is less than ten billion dollars; but assuming </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">Hint</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"> it is ten billion, which could all be mobilized to pay these debts, and divide the whole pro rata, each real gold dollar would have to pay twenty-one dollars of the debt. Scientific bankers have said that one gold dollar is good for a credit of five gold dollars. But I wonder if they would accept one gold dollar in payment of a debt of twenty-one gold dollars! Yet this is the way that finance is talked to the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Let us-yefer to one more of the people’s bumptious bosses, a man who poses as a financier, a former president of one of our largest banks, a man whose alleged financial articles have occupied many columns of space in the newspa* ers, until the present oil scandal in Washington rather crowded </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"> out of the limelight, and who to resurrect himself instinctively descended to his normal condition of a common gossip. It would be well if that man in his next newspaper story were to relate the circumstances which made </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"> president of that bank, why he was employed less than two years, and why <sup>1 </sup>he was retired. If the whole story were told, undoubtedly the “Teapot Dome” would not seem so much of a muchness, after alL The mouth-ings of such men tend only to keep the world in a state of turmoil and tumult.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Manipulation try Bankers</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">HE whole subject of finance has been so misrepresented to the people that they are confused by the apparent immensity of it, and consequently balk at its simplest problems. Surely there is no great mystery in having a bank account upon which one may draw checks and transfer to the butcher, the baker, and the candlestick maker, the various amounts due to them. Yet that is fundamentally the whole money question in a nutshell.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Cheeks are the medium through which ninety-nine percent of all commerce is transacted. To ; t understand a simple financial question, we must first divest our minds of the what we might call superstition and fairy tales which have become rooted there, the result of generations of false teachings by conscienceless Shylocks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">It has already been said that American money is the best in the world, because every note is the obligation of a government which has never failed to pay its obligations when due. Its present circulating notes are less than one percent of its total wealth; but the professional financier has caused the people to question even this excellent money by having a law passed which binds the government to issue first its almost ideal note to the banks without interest, and the banks then pass on such note to the people who may be able to make a good note, give collateral, and pay six percent interest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Even the government itself cannot use its own money without first giving to the bank its four percent or four and a half percent interestbearing bonds I Often even then the bonds are subject to a discount, while the stocks of New York city banks are at an average premium of <sub>t </sub>at least two hundred percent. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">It should, be remembered that the law makes these same banks the financial agents of the government ; and it is hard to believe that any sane man would employ an agent whose assets were far less than the employer’s, but whose management would give his own financial paper a market value one hundred times greater than that of the employer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Government Pays Unjust Interest</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">A</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">LREADY the government has thus purchased more than five billions of its own non-interest-bearingmoney, paying therefor not less than two hundred million dollars in interest per annum! In face of such unnecessary losses, the same law in Section 16 says: “The Federal Reserve Board shall have power to issue Federal Reserve notes at its discretion.” That is exactly what has been done with the German mark; but our bankers, being a little wiser than the Germans, have not yet killed the goose which so liberally is laying the golden eggs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Section 14 of the same law says: &quot;Every Federal Reserve Bank shall have power to exchange Federal Reserve Notes for gold, gold coin, or gold certificates.” Under that law the banks began systematically to appropriate gold certificates coming in for deposit, replacing them with Federal Reserve Notes; and in less than thirty months, between April, 1917, and August, 1919, the gold certificates thus appropriated were presented at the Treasury for redemption to the amount of nearly two billion dollars. Thus three-quarters of the gold belonging to the government was transferred to the ownership of the bank, and no human being knows how much since that time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">The Treasurer’s report makes it appear as though this gold is still in the Treasury, but a note says that it is held for note redemption. This was mentioned to the head of a department in a large book store, and he replied: “What does it matter whether the gold is owned by the banks or by the government?” If that man owned a thousand dollars in gold, and a hold-up man should blackjack him and take his gold, would it make any difference to him who owned it!</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">But we must pass on and find what we believe to be the only proper foundation for money, and then propose an issue practically identical with that now in circulation; except, that it</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">be issued by the government direct to its creditors without any interest charge, instead of being given to the banks and then bought back before going to the creditors. This little change in procedure would have saved the taxpayers about half a billion dollars.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Howl of Wall Street</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">A</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">S A practical example of sound money, it may be said that during the war of the .. Rebellion there was a gold market established in Wall Street, by which the relative value of greenbacks and gold was advertised daily. Greatly to -the injury of the United States, the greenbacks sank as low as forty cents to. the dollar; and for what reason?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Secretary Chase first issued a.government note which stated on its face: &quot;This note is redeemable for all public and private debts.” But their issue brought the whole Wall Street fraternity to Washington, with the inquiry, “How will you obtain gold for foreign purposes ? You must make your notes receivable for all debts except payment of duties, and collect duties in gold.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Then the so-called greenbacks were issued, with the fatal words: &quot;Except in payment of duties.” And being interchangeable with gold they sank, as before stated, to forty cents, it taking two and a half dollars of such currency to make one dollar of gold. The few remaining original notes without the word &quot;Except” always stayed at par with gold even during the wildest gambling in that metal, though those notes had behind them security only identical with that of the greenbacks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">The few evils already mentioned have probably focused our minds on the real center of disturbance and unrest; and we shall now proceed to ascertain what will remove the source of trouble and bring peace to </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">this</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"> disturbed world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Sound and Convenient Money Needed</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">S</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">OCIETY requires first of all a sound and convenient money for the proper exchange of service and the products of service. But what constitutes a sound and convenient money? Checks have all the elements of money save one. Though they may pass through the hands of several neighbors and be endorsed by them before reaching the bank, they have </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">limi</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">ted circulation; and because of the limited</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">circulation they will not pass current, as money should do. We must therefore find some channel with an unquestioned store of assets and </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">an </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">integrity never violated or questioned as a medium of intercourse. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">The United States has more assets or larger credit basis than all the Rockefellers, Morgans, and the combined banks of this country. It has more gold, more real estate, more buildings, more vessels, besides the unlimited power of taxing the whole people. Therefore </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">its</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"> checks or circulating notes are the very best that can be devised or </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">imag</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">ined, and the only ones which should be used .by this people; and these notes should be put into circulation </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">only</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"> in payment for service received ty the government and in the exact amount of the service received.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">That the people have confidence in the notes of this government has been demonstrated through a period of more than sixty years, during which time they have steadily deposited gold with the government, jsccepting in exchange paper certificates to a value of two and one-half billion dollars, weighing more than four thousand tons; and in all those years not a single dollar has been lost by anyone through such exchanges, while meantime hundreds of banks have gone into bankruptcy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Then let us see what is the real basis of sound money, and how may money and goods be equitably exchanged. All human values are the product of human effort, represented in every variety of human activity. When effort is used in the interest of another, it becomes service, and creates an obligation for a return of a like amount of service to the party who has rendered it A written or printed promise to pay a certain sum to bearer on demand means that the writer has received that amount of service and will return it as specified. The material upon which the promise is written does not in any way affect the obligation. It is a mere matter of convenience. Therefore, paper being the most convenient material for such purpose, it is gen-. erally used; and the paper is sound if the maker </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">has </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">sufficient assets to back up his promise to pay and has honesty to redeem his obligation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">We are.all fairly familiar with the present banking and checking system. For instance, when we give Mr. Jones our check for ten dollars, it is an acknowledgment that Jones had rendered- service to that amount, and it is an order to the bank to redeem our obligation to Jones by delivering to </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"> that amount of cred-it to be taken from our account. When Jones has given the bank evidence of credit to his butcher and has received its full value in meat, Jones has been fully paid for his service; and our obligation to </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"> is canceled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Hand of Financiers Shown</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">HE word money means worth or value, and man has devised a system of measures by which the amount and value of everything exchanged by him may be determined exactly, and each of these measures has a legal unit to begin counting at Some American measures are </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">as </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Long measure^ with the yard u its wait Weight measure, with the pound as its unit Time measure^ with the hour as its unit Value measure, with the dollar as its unit</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">None of these established measures or their units may be departed from or changed </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">in any </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">way without committing </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">crime subject to penalty except only in the case of the last and </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">most </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">important of all—the dollar.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">On April 2, 1792, the Congress of the United States decreed that the term dollar should express the American unit of value, but failed to provide a penalty for its violation; and by re&gt;» son of such failure, that law seems to be more honored in its breach than in its observance. Not so, however, with the other measures. Anyone violating by increase or decrease their proscribed and established units is subject to quick and serious punishment In the case of the dollar unit, professional financiers have succeeded in making it &quot;elastic”; and it is in the power of the Federal Reserve Bank managers to increase or decrease our circulating money at their discretion. (See Section 16, Federal Reserve Law.) So both inflation and deflation bring revenue to the banks with corresponding loss to all others, with a constant incentive to the financier to keep his scheme going.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Suppose that the leading dry goods dealers were authorized by law to make the standard yard “elastic”. They could then use an India-rubber tape and make the yard longer when purchasing and shorter when selling, thus skinning the people both ways. This is precisely as the bankers do now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">During many years we have maintained that “once a dollar, always a dollar?’ But of course that was only the opinion of dreamers. But now comes one of the most learned and conservative bodies in the world, the German Court, which rules that “a mark is a mark, no matter what exchange may be.” Under that ruling, the only logical thing to do with their uncountable trillions of marks now in circulation is to repudiate them, as it is impossible to redeem them. The creation of these marks by the financiers was an evidence of either their stupidity or dishonesty—possibly both. Will the schemes of such people ever bring peace to the world?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Remedy for Financial Ilie</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">HE writer’s plan to “Attain and Maintain a World Peace,” is as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Let Congress be directed to pass a law substantially reading:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">“All sections and parts of sections of the Federal Reserve Banking and Currency Law passed by the House December 22, 1913, and by the Senate December 23,1913, relatin'' to or authorizing the issue, receipt, or paying out or exchange of circulating notes by the Federal Reserve Banks, also their authority to act as fiscal agents or in any other business capacity for the United States, are hereby repealed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">“All sections and parts of sections of an Act to provide a national currency, passed February 25, 1863,relating to the issue, receipt, or paying out or in exchange of circulating notes, be and are hereby repealed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">“The United States shall issue its own notes for service received, payable on demand, in the amount of four billion dollars; and all Federal</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Reserve Bank notei, Federal Bank notes, National Bank notes, greenbacks, and other United States notes now existing, be retired as the new service notes are issued,</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">“Be it enacted that the four billion dollars of sendee notes provided for in the preceding sections shall be issued only to persons giving service or the product of service, and in exact amount of the service or product of service received therefor by the United States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">“Said service notes shall be legal tender for all debts, public and private.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">“Any person who by any method whatsoever shall cause the value of these notes to be increased or decreased from that stated on their face shall be subject to a fine of five thousand dollars, or one year in prison, or both upon conviction.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;' &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">The notes just described would average about forty dollars per capita of the population. They would always represent an exact amount of service, -and have as collateral security the whole resources of the United States with its unlimited power of taxation. There is not </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">civilized nation in the whole world that could not issue perfectly sound notes at forty dollars per capita of its population; and in such case circulating money might be made international, and a universal world money would surely draw nations and individuals doser together than even a universal language, for they would then be held in bonds of interest as well as convenience, and in such bonds the whole world could sing these words from an old Russian hymn:</span></p>

<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Reports from Foreign Correspondents</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">FROM INDiA</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">HE monsoon, which usually sets in on the west coast in the early part of June, was somewhat delayed this year; but when it started, rains accompanied by strong winds began to pour in torrents and continued for days together. Consequently water in all the rivers of the west coast, and those of South India which have their sourefes in the Western Ghats, rose to heights never known to have risen, and overflowed the banks and spread in all directions, submerging a very large part of South India, Malabar, South Canara, and the states of Travancore, Cochin, and Mysore. There were strong currents which carried off everything found in their way. A large number of lives are said to be lost; accurate figures are not available now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">A few very important bridges and a </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">very </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">large number of culverts and bunds in the different railway lines and trunk roads in South India were destroyed. Hence all kinds </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">e£</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">IM</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">traffic was suspended for days, cutting </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">off</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"> South India from the outside world for two weeks. Owing to the breakdown of telegraph wires, no telegraph messages could be sent or received from station to station for several days. We could not get out mails for nearly two weeks. Now mails are being carried by men who cross the rivers in boats, and so we get the mails though after much delay.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Not only has there been extensive damage to property, but also considerable loss of life. 'A wide area has been devastated. Appalling conditions are prevailing in South India, especially the west coast. The destruction committed by the flood extends over a wide area and affects thousands of people. The people of the submerged districts had to flee for their lives to higher levels, leaving their things behind. Thousands of refugees, especially the poor classes, had to be fed by public charity. The Government and other public bodies took active steps </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">to</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"> concert relief measures by starting a relief fund. But such relief can be only temporary. It would take many years and millions of dollars to effect a complete restoration to normal conditions, humanly speaking.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Those who have visited the flood-affected areas for investigating the real conditions report the number of houses destroyed to be very large. The Malabar collector's report of fifty thousand houses as destroyed by the flood in Malabar district alone, is declared to be too conservative an estimate, according to the Madras Y. M. C. A. secretary, who personally inspected the devastated areas of Malabar. Thousands are rendered homeless.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Vast areas of rice fields are buried under sand and silt In some places courses of rivers have changed. Large stores of rice paddy and other food grains were under water for several days, and have decayed and thus have been rendered useless. The seed grains for the next sowing are wet. So seed grains have to be obtained from outside.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">As a result of the flood, prices of all articles of food have risen considerably. Famine conditions are prevailing throughout Thousands are actually starving. The distress in affected areas has been acute, and those that have been left destitute are undergoing untold misery. Bice, the chief article of food, is sold at an abnormal price of 2% measures per rupee—an</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">BMOXUW. M.T.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">indication of the degree of distress in these parts. The price of rice is steadily going up. Rice is getting scarce. In the absence of rice, and on account of the high prices, people in some parts subsist on the flour manufactured out of the palmyra tree.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">In a few places the hungry mob began to be violent, and attempted to attack and loot the rich ,* and sufficient police force had to be called in to put down the rebellion. There is much discontent among the people, as the Government is not taking active steps to stop profiteering.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">In the wake of these disasters come those diseases which complete the picture of the misery. Starvation and exposure to wet, and the eating of unwholesome food, cause the outbreak of cholera and other epidemics. In several o£ the flood-affected areas such epidemics are prevailing. There is considerable increase in the number of deaths.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">While the southern districts are suffering from excessive rain and flood, in many other districts people are suffering from want of rain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">The political situation in India is very acute. The people of India are losing their confidence in the British rule. The relations between the people of India and the English* are very' much strained. A high court decision in England by a British judge against a prominent Indian, a member of the Viceroy's Council, for criticizing the action of a British governor of a province in India for his rule of terror and the methods approved by him for recruiting by threats and intimidation during the war, is an additional cause for aggravating the bitter feelings of the people of India against the English*</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Another high court decision by a British judge in Bombay against an Indian editor of a popular Indian paper for commenting on the biased attitude of British judges against Indians in cases that come before them for decision, has also embittered the Indians very much. The English are not liked by the Indians. They generally treat the Indians as their slaves, while they are acquiring their wealth in India.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Distrust and disaffection are growing. Secret anarchistic societies are said to be existing in different parts of India. Were' it not for the presence of a saintly leader, Mahatma Gandhi, India would have revolted in a body. His methods axe peaceful and non-violent. Revolution in India will be only a bloodless one, as the masses are being educated to follow peaceful methods of non-cobperation. Thus conditions in India are not desirable. India badly needs the desirable government of the Messiah. These things indicate that the kingdom is imminent Let us pray for that kingdom. Let us not be discouraged, but go forward with unabating zeal, proclaiming the kingdom message which comforts the broken-hearted.</span></p>

There have been much hail, some frost, and a good deal of drouth, to such an extent in fact that many farmers have been forced to quit and abandon their farms. However, a wheat crop between two and three hundred million bushels, at the prevailing prices, which range between one and a half and two dollars per bushel, the highest since the war, will do much to speed up the sales of automobiles, radio sets, and the products of the mail order house, even if it does little to reduce taxation or pay off mortgages. As to whether it will slow up the emigration figures remains to be seen. It has not done so yet; neither has it to any extent stimulated general business, though there are a few seasonal signs of advance in some businesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">The Moose Jaw </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"> gives some space to a consideration of the national immigration policy. In the broadness of its review it wipes out any argument of party propaganda; for its indictment is against all governments since Confederation. Its figures are interesting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;Canadians have been Piously troubled of late years by the continuing exodus from this country to the United States. It ia estimated that from Confederation until 1920, no less than 1,650,000 </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Canadian-born </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">citizens emigrated permanently to that country. A statement was issued in the United States by the National Bureau of Economic Research which is not reassuring. Omitting from their calculations the movements in both directions of American citizens, but including both Canadian and immigrants from overseas (through Canada), they </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">ann</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">ounced that the net loss of population to Canada by southward immigration from 1920 to 1923.had been 366,611.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;Many will no doubt heartily agree with J. S. Woods-worth, M. P. (Labor), when he stated to the International Conference of Social Service Workers that since Confederation we have spent $30,000,000 in securing immigrants and have little or nothing to show for it.* </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">The </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"> goes on to deprecate a further indulgence—as is now projected—in the policy of spending Canadian money in Europe to interest emigrants, only to have them leave after a short sojourn in Canada for the wider field of opportunity to the south.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Mr. G. G. Coate, one of the Alberta representatives in the Dominion Legislature, has a few words to say about Canada’s debt burden. As reported in the Moose Jaw </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Times,</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"> whose editorials on such matters are always worthy of consideration at least, he says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;The outstanding problem of the farmers in Western Canada is the enormous debt burden they have to carry. As far as Western Canada is concerned, we can only guess at the number of farmers who have become bankrupt, or who are remaining on the property merely through the leniency of their creditors, but I think it is quite safe to say that propably more than </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">one-third </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">at </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">the farmers are retaining their property under these conditions.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Farman in Bad Condition</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">FTER a discussion of some proposed </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">reme-</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">dies, especially amendments to the </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Bank- -</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">ruptcy Act to permit of farmers securing </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">discharge after going through the bankruptcy court—a thing virtually impossible under the present act—and also the restriction of the legal rate of interest payable by the fanner, Mr. Coate says;</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;If such a remedy is not provided a larger number of farmers are going to be driven </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">oft</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> their farms and will emigrate to the United States.... Under present conditions everything these farmers produce over bare cost of living is being taken to pay lawyers’ </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">ieea, </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">sheriffs’ fees, court charges, and excessive interest rates. ... If the number of bankruptcies reported is not larger, it is not due to the fact that this unfortunate condition does not exist, but that there is not the machinery for disclosing it.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">The British Columbia </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Federationist</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"> devotes part of a column to the presentation of the facta concerning a &quot;Red” riot at the unveiling recently of a cenotaph in honor of the fallen soldiers* Some widows of soldiers whose bodies lie &quot;in Flanders Field” were at the unveiling with banners upon which appeared the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">“Ye hypocrites, are these your pranks, To murder men and give God thanks? Desist for shame; proceed no further, God won’t accept your thanks for murder I*</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Not particularly interesting reading for the functionaries and church dignitaries putting their sanctmonious Messing on the stone memorial. Then another widow appeared with Ralph Chaplin's poem similarly displayed:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;Mourn not the dead that in the cool earth lie Dust unto dust,</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The calm, sweet earth that mothers all who die, As all men must;</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">But rather mourn the apathetic throng, The cowed, the meek,</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Who see the world’s great anguish and its wrong, And dare not speak I”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">This so aroused the wrath of a cultured member of the L O. D. E. that the police were summoned to disperse the war widows. . This was done, </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">that dignity and humbug might not suffer. </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">If war widows are not competent to evaluate a cenotaph erected to their own men, who are the right and proper judges of these public monuments !</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">The. “Western Home Monthly” has something to say about the Modernist trend in theology. It says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">“The net impression ooe gains from many liberal sermana is that it is th* function of ths ministry to harmonize Christianity year by year with the transient doubts of succeeding crops of college graduates, to harmonize Christianity with whatever happens to be the current mode in politics, economics, science or philosophy. There is a type of Modernist who spends so much time adjusting his religion that he has no energy left to apply it.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Very true; and after he has adjusted it, he 'discovers that the pattern is all changed again and that a further adjustment is necessary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">What Gain</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"> is </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">War?</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">T</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">HE,</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"> paltry and maudlin opinions of the world’s great thinkers and newspaper editors are being splendidly revealed in the canvass that was recently made of the world's prominent men concerning what the world gained by the war. One editor suggests:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;Among the hopeful signs is the larger interest taken by the United. States in international affairs.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">That surely was worth wrecking the world for, and spilling the blood of twenty-five million men. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Sir Arthur Currie’s answer has already been quoted in these columns, but some others are illuminating: M</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">aximi</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">lian Harden says that war</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;has lost its glowing charm of chivalry, and it has become an endless war of industrial masses and chemical devil’s work”; while John Maynard Keyes, English economist and author of “Economic Consequences of the Peace”, says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">“I don’t know.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">It takes our Canadian little guns, canons, eta, to loudly prate opposite views after the &quot;big guns” get through.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;The Maritime Baptist Convention brought in a resolution recently against war </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">as</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> 'anti-Christian and futile*. On motion of Col. Dr. J. H. Macdonald and Capt. White the objectionable phrase was deleted. One clergyman who had been decorated for conspicuous bravery made a threat previous to the meeting that be would resign from the ministry unless the phrase was removed,” says the Halifax </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Morning Chronicle. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">It seems that the ministry is still thoroughly under the thumb of the </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">militar</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">y </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">inn of Satan’s </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">empire, and just as ready to </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">kowtow </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">fawn </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">on them as ever. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">The Montreal </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Daily Star</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"> in an editorial on </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;The Church and Peace” </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">“With preparedness war will not cease. Our yeOo* leopards will still gambol in conflict, and the room ta our shield will be further stained with the Wood of battles. As a matter of fact a nation has nothing to do with peace until she is ready to forego some advantage whidi she has power to seize and to &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bat</span></p>

The </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Pathfinder, </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">of Washington, in its issue of October 4th, 192^ gives the facts in the case, as follows:</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">In the first six months of 1934 the Detroit, Toledo and Ironton railroad, owned by Henry Ford, cleared $1,000,000 more than in the same period of the previous year. Its total income was over $6,000,000. 'Hj* auto manufacturer bought it for $5,000,000.</span></p>

The lower jaw is in two parts, divided at the chin; and the throat stretches around the food. Digestion sometimes requires weeks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">The snakes that have Chinese eyes are the 'dangerous ones; i. e., if the snake’s eye has a circular pupil it is non-poisonous; but if the pupil of the eye is elliptical, look out for it. Its bite is dangerous.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">There are turtles in the Galapagos Islands, </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">off</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"> the coast of Ecuador, that weigh as much as 400 lbs., and that live for hundreds of years. One of these left in the Tonga Islands by Captain Cook, the English mariner, in 1773, was found there in 1923. Captain Pollock, of the U. S. Navy Department, who found the turtle, stated that it is blind and that when it walks creaks like an ox-cart. Milford, N. J., has a turtle which once a year visits a certain tomato patch, where he enjoys an annual feast.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">The lion, so-called king of beasts, is admitted by hunters to be one of the greatest of cowards, seldom attacking unless pressed by hunger or inflamed by injury. Of the two the lioness is the braver. She will come to the assistance of her mate when he is attacked; but when the lioness is attacked, the lion lets her fight her own battles.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">The World War presented the remarkable phenomenon in Africa of thousands of wild beasts crashing through the underbrush in the effort to get as far away as possible from the savage twq-legged animals that were shooting at one another. It was a great procession, lions, leopards, buffalo, antelope, giraffes, rhinoceri and elephants, alThurrying to get away. Four years later they came smashing through the underbrush again, back to theix usual haunts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">People with hearts are concerned over the fact that six million traps are sold annually in America, which means that, if they catch one animal apiece, there are six million cases of prolonged agony. Often the poor creatures are eaten alive by other beasts. Sometimes they gnaw their own legs off. Animals have been trapped at last by the one remaining leg, after having previously gnawed off their three other legs. Most of this trapping is done in Canada, but much was and still is done in the United States. The world is rapidly being swept clear of its fur-bearing animals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Solomon says: “A righteous man considereth the life of his beast.* The Scriptures require him to do so. He must let the beast of burden rest one day in seven. He may not muzzle the ox when threshing. He may not even rob the birds of their nests. He must be humane.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Whaling is still an important industry. There are said to be a thousand men located on South Georgia Island, near the South Pole, engaged in the production of 240,000 barrels of whale oil annually. Most of this oil is used for lubricating machinery.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">There are no oceans and no depths that do not produce their own living creatures. The Marquis de Folin tells of deep-sea creatures brought to the surface, which glowed so brightly that while at their best one could read by their light the finest newspaper print at a distance of six feet. The pervading color was greenish, fading minute by minute as the animal died.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Evolutionists engaged in studying apes in Bronx Park taught an ape how to wash its bands, and were just beginning to flatter themselves on the . close connection which existed between themselves and the ape family when the ape in question wound up the performance by</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">■ Wolves are multiplying in Europe, and have . even been seen in the streets of Rome. The increase is laid to the World War. Those hitherto engaged in hunting wild animals were hunting each other. It is doubted whether wolves ever attack human* in any live stock country.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">In the forests of Canada, when timber wolves mate, the female hunts a cavern with a roof that slopes downward to meet the floor in a V-shape. She pushes her young far back into the V. This keeps the male wolf from eating his family. The mother wolf, having a. smaller body, is able to reach her young ones easily. _</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Dr. Hornaday writes in the New York Times that there is no danger of a crime wave among animals in their native state, for they have absolutely no criminal instinct, and acquire it only in captivity and after association with man; that animals in their wild state kill for their daily food only, but never murder for revenge. He added: “Many a king sits upon his throne and is worshiped by his people, compared tu whom the grizzly bear is a model citizen.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">We have heard of one naughty bear, however. He lives in Yellowstone Park, and in some way has found out that if he sits on his haunches in a narrow place in the road and refuses to leave until fed by the autoists who want to pass him, he can get along in life very well. In one season this bear has been known to hold up 100 autoists. The Park guides have warned autoists what to expect, and they go prepared to divide up.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">The race is on between the automobile and the deer; or perhaps we should say the fight is on. In Mongolia, on the desert sands, an automobile going 60 miles an hour was not able to catch an antelope. But in Massachusetts a deer squared the''account by bucking an automobile oft the road.. The giant buck (head of a herd of eight deer) attacked the automobile, smashed both headlights and got a bad bump himself, but after a jiffy jumped up and led the herd back into the woods.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Government in Alaska are said to be multiplying at a tremendous rate. The food there is just to their liking. They have been known to . seriously interfere with the progress of river steamers, so many of them crossing the stream at once as to hold up navigation. Wild deer can be domesticated, but are extremely shy by, nature. •</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">The eyes of the giraffe are protrusive, so that it can see in every direction without turning its head. A giraffe fourteen feet hi</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">gh</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"> is reported as still growing at the rate of a foot a year. The modern method of keeping giraffes and other wild animals from diseases in menageries is to treat their bodies with poison gas from time to time, only the head remaining outside.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">The destruction of fur-bearing animals </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">has </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">progressed to such an extent that it is profit- ; able now to raise for their fur foxes and other ; animals which otherwise have no value. A fox/ however, may be worth as much as $2,000 for f his fur alone. The United States Department of Agriculture employs one specialist </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">who. </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">gives all his time to the study of fur-bearing animals and their development. Several islands along the Alaskan coast are now devoted to the raising of blue and silver foxes for their pelts. &lt;&nbsp;$3,300,000 worth of such pelts were shipped out of Alaska in 1922. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">It is believed that in South America, possibly in the Amazon basin, but more likely in the wild lake region of Patagonia, there may still exist some specimens of the Plesiosaurus, fossils of which have been found in various parts of the world. For fifty years there have been periodic reports of such a creature, a marine reptile, feeding on shellfish, and coming ashore only by pulling itself along by its flippers. The Plesiosaurus may be described as a gigantic crocodile with a swan’s neck.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">South America has another strange animal, the armadillo. This animal, when attacked, rolls itself into a ball; and as its skeleton is on the outside, instead of the inside of its body, it presents an armor plate shell which is almost inpenetrable.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">One of the most useful of animals is the much 'despised toad, which specializes on caterpillars. One toad under observation was seen to eat twenty-four gypsy-moth caterpillars in one morning, another ate thirty celery caterpillars in three hours, another ate eighty-six houseflies in ten minutes, and a fourth ate ninety rosebugs at one meal. A toad in a garden is estimated to be worth $19.44 to the owner during the season.

In the Pelican Lake district the lizards were everywhere. At the Ninette Sanatorium two thousand were shoveled out of one basement window-shaft. For a time it was difficult to walk about Automobilists passing through the district were obliged to use skid chains while the pest was at its height. The lizards are said to have been four to eighteen inches in length.</span></p>

<h6><a name="bookmark43"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark44"></a>Where Are We Going?</span></h6>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">HE great question in the minds of the people since 1914 seems to be: &quot;Where are we going, and how soon shall we get there 1” Many and varied have been the answers. Time passes at a dizzy pace, and Society is a very sick man. His bootstraps are about worn out, while every day that passes sees him deeper in the mire of his own traditions and vain speculations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">This question was prophetically recorded three thousand years ago: &quot;Why do the heathen rage, and the people imagine a vain thing?” (Psalm 2:1) To our understanding a “heathen” is one who is a stranger to God or out of harmony with Him, regardless of whether that one claims New York or Borneo as his birthplace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">To rage is to admit impotence, violently or suppressedly in the presence of difficulty; and the “vain thing&quot; which the people imagine is that by their various schemes, such as Unions, Combinations, Trusts, Socialism, Nihilism, Anarchism, etc., the old system can be bolstered up or a new one erected outside of the provisions of thedivine plan, long since decided upon by the Creator.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">This is a great mistake. Anyone who has taken the time to investigate the matter knows that the bursting of the holocaust in 1914 occurred on schedule time; and that despite the vocifera-</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">By H. N. Tyson (.Honolulu) </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">tions of a divinely unauthorized clergy class, that the war would result in a “great spiritual . uplift” (1), the Bible prophecies to the contrary have gone into effect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Who is there but rejoices at the thought that sin and death are soon to be abolished, and their author, Satan, restrained at the time the human race is being restored to perfection, during the thousand years of Christs reignf (The individual answer to this question will demonstrate to the reader which side his sympathies are on, God’s or Satan’s.) The destiny of those who successfully pass the test at the end of the Millennium is eternity, in a perfect, world-wide Paradise restored. That is the consummation . of the divine plan relative to </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Chronology showed that in 1914 Satan’s lease of power over the nations had expired This lease covered a period of 2520 years or seven symbolic “times” of 360 years each. The ejectment proceedings immediately began, and will continue until the complete fall of mystic Babylon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">In a time prophecy a fulfilment or antitype must be reached at the end of the prophetic period. The thirty-five-hundred-year period of jubilee cycles, which began in 1575 B. C. and ends in 1925, marks the end of the type of the</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Jewish jubilee system which, foreshadows the ''restitution of all things*. Therefore where the type ends, the thing forshadowed begins. The Fifth Universal Empire of Earth will be ushered in with power and great glory. He “whose right it is* will speak peace to the peoples, and then they shall not learn war any more.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">The abortive efforts of the Inter-Church World Movement; the Paris, Washington, Geneva, Hague, and other conferences to create a counterfeit of Christ’s kingdom, have all failed, and were but the dying gasps of a Satanic order upon whose tomb is being indelibly engraved</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Pardon ma for taking this much of your time on what may be so aimpie a matter; but I was approached about going into a dub to get a certain book called, “Angels and Women”. I made acme inquiries, and was told that it wm a book that a fallen angel dictated to a woman, showing a desire to come back into harmonj with God; and that Pastor Russell approved of the book. I had never heard of the book before; and as we are to ahun anything akin to spiritism I should like to know positively whether the book has your approval before buying one; so if it is not asking too much would like a reply.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">(Mrs.) W. 9. Davis, </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Los Angelos, CaL</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">To Tss Goldht Aon:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">With much pleasure and profit has the book, “Angeli and Women” been read by many Truth friehda. It </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">fating</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> so much to encourage one to loyalty and faith in God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Do you .think that it would be a real service to purchase these books in quantities of ten or more copies at a time so as to get the special &lt;1 per copy rate, which you have </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">ao kindly</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> secured </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">for</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> us, and thus to have them on hand aa Christmas and birthday presents or for other gift occasions to give to our relatives and friends, whom we may have been unable to otherwise interest in Present Truth or only slightly so ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Would not some be disposed to read a fascinating novel of this kind, who might not be able to get first interested in “The Harp” or Studies?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Would this not be considered one way of instructing the people about matters concerning which there is ao much ignorance, and direct them to the real Bible Keys, the Watch Town publications?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Should we send such orders to Tecs Gowks Ask?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">If not, will you kindly give us the complete address of the A B. Abac Company? There are many who would like to get a little more information regarding these items. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An Appreciative Beadsv</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Reply</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">rpo </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">BOTH above letters we reply </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">as </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">follows;</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">When Pastor Bussell was here, he read </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">book dealing with conditions that obtained prior, to the Flood. He requested some other brethren to read it. It was so much in harmony with the Bible account of the fallen angels that he regarded the book as remarkable. Under his supervision it was revised, and later published by one who was formerly his confidential associate. The new book is published under the title “Angels and Women”. Scriptural citations are given. An appendix is added. Pastor Bussell remarked that at some opportune time the book, revised, should be published.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">As to its being a violation of the Vow to read this book, such idea is not worthy consideration. It would be no more wrong to read it </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">than</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"> to read “What Say the Scriptures about Spiritism” or “Talking with the Dead”; for both these books quote much as to what the evil spirits do. Many have derived much benefit from reading “Angels and Women” because it aids in getting a clearer vision of how Satas overreached the angels and overreached the human race, and caused all the havoc amongst men and the angels. It helps one to a better understanding of the devil’s organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">L The book is published by the A. B. Abac Company, Madison Square, P. 0. Box 101, New York City, N. Y.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“And it shall be, that whoso will not come up of all the families of the earth unto ’Jerusalem</span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"> for </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">worship the King, the Lord of hosts, even upon them shall be no rain.&quot;—Zechariah 14:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">O</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">N MAY 6th the Spanish Government refused permission to Judge Rutherford to speak in Madrid in support of his belief, and our belief, that we have come to the time of the establishment of the Lord’s kingdom in the earth—an event described in the Revelation of St. John as “the new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Now whether or not others can see in it what we see in it, nevertheless a most unusual item of information comes to us in a report from our correspondent in Switzerland. The gentleman in question knew of the Spanish Government’s action in refusing permission to have the truth regarding the Lord’s kingdom presented to the Spanish people, and in a report to us dated August 23rd says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">“We herewith beg to enclose a copy of the </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Zuridute Zeitung</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> of August 21 in which you will find a report, marked in blue pencil, that while the whole of Central Europe is complaining about a miserable summer, no rain has fallen in Madrid, the capital of Spain, since May 6. As this was the date upon which Judge Rutherford was refused permission to lecture in that city, we feel that the matter will be of interest to you. May we assume that there is a connection between the two things?”</span></p>

<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">HE latest superstition of Greater Papacy now is the blessing of automobiles, said to have begun at Pittsburgh. Labels are placed on the machine head, and holy water applied with a pronouncement of Latin to the God of Rome. This insures from accident and the jam of Protestant aggression.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">We remember in 1799 how the Pope himself blessed Napoleon. But at that time the Most High saw fit to visit judgment on the system, which had reached a crisis in its abominations. Instead, therefore, of the Pope’s receiving worship, Napoleon exactetT a lump sum from the “Vicar of Christ” and he too went along as prisoner of France. Indeed, “his highness” died in solitude after this blessing. Likewise, we remember, how a later pontiff blessed the Spanish pavy at the instant when the United States entered into war with Spain. Evidently at that time the infallibility invoked failed of operation on account of certain other forces blocking the spiritual headship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Soon, thank God! a further blessing is to be enjoyed when this symbolical “beast” passes away with its earthly pomp and mouthiness. Then the peoples will taste of the liberty with which Christ makes free. History tells of the long train of Jesuit priestcraft in the way of life, liberty, and happiness, not the least of which can be read off during the war on slavery while Lincoln was in office. Conspiracy among Lincoln’s Catholic generals more than once threatened the disruption of the Lincolnian forces. Therefore, this boastful tyrant must go down in ignominy and chaos, as the prophet of the Lord of hosts has foretold. True religion will then spring from the efforts of the New Zionism, now bestirring itself toward the promised land of Abraham.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">All hail such a prospect and token from the true Lord of lords and Decider of sovereignty rights, in behalf of a restored race, from the deceptions of Satan, forced on mankind in the name of.truth! The bandages must all be torn loose ere this sunlight reaches the eyes of human understanding.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">U</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">NDER the above heading </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Catholic Herald,</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"> of London, discussing the Pope’s political sermons of September 21st, and admitting that in England at present the Catholics do not know whether to stick to the Tories or to throw in their lot with the Laborites, has the following interesting paragraphs. These paragraphs make the “principles&quot; of the Papacy entirely clear:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">“There is no infallible authority to tell us what will be the certain result to the Catholic Church in future years of any particular action taken here and now. *</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">“The history of the Popes during the long centuries in which they were temporal rulers shows that in dealing with these affairs—that is to say, with political affairs—they sometimes took one course and sometimes another, and that their actions were sometimes advantageous to and sometimes very injurious to the temporal interests of the Holy See and even to its moral interests as well They took part in politics sometimes from very human motives.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">“When the Catholic German Emperor Charles V. sacked Rome and took prisoner Pope Clement Vil, he as least alleged that he was acting in the interests of reform of the Church and of Catholicity in general. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">“The Pope, dragged in different directions by his hopes and his fears, had actually treaties, offensive and defensive at one and the same time,- with the Emperor and with Francis I of France, who were engaging in deadly struggle!</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">“The Pope did not know which side to take for the best; so he took both, a piece of statecraft which does not stand alone, but which has been severely commented upon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">“If Catholics had only to decide in their political action on rigid lines of scientific exactitude they would indeed have an easy task.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">“But what is presented to them is mostly a choice of evils; and while they must not, of course, choose anything that is distinctly evil or immoral in itself, they are forced, whether they like it or not, to make some choice while fully recognizing that whatever they may do there will be dangers ahead. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">“ *Let justice be. done though the heavens should fall,’ is a principle more easy of utterance than of observance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">“When God informed Moses that He was going to'strike the name of His chosen people out of the book of life, Moses asked if that were to be done that his name also should be struck out! An example, we are told, to be admired, but not imitated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">“It is much easier to admire the clarity and sublimity of a statement of altruistic principles than </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">it</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"> is to acquiesce in them and carry them out.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">The Lantern </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">By Don Marquis</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Copyright, 1924, New York </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Herald Tribune</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"> Inc., Courtesy New York </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Herald Tribune.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">HE spread of the Christian religion resulted in the subversion of the calm tolerance of ancient civilization. Under the Romans the various pagan systems got along very well with one another; the priests of Rome did not use their political influence to persecute the devotees of Isis, nor was there any serious attempt in any province of the Roman dominions to destroy an old faith or impose a new one. This tolerance was very largely due, no doubt, to the fact that many of the leading men of Rome, lessoned by the Greek philosophers, had no very warm attachment for any of the pagan faiths, considering them good enough for common people and slaves but as superstitions unworthy the the credence of enlightened minds. As a matter of policy, however, they publicly acquiesced, and even participated, in various formal religious rites to which they were secretly indifferent</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">The amazingly rapid spread of Christianity —rapid because it was of a character which appealed to the slaves, the oppressed, the outcast all those without any worldly hopes or prospects—forced the governors of the Roman world to abandon their attitude of easy toleration, based on indifference and contempt -</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">So far as the supernatural aspects of Christianity were concerned, there is no evidence that the Romans were particularly impressed. Antiquity was used to reports of signs and wonders, miracles and marvels, claims of supernatural origin and supernatural power; that sort of </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">thin</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">g was precisely what the philosophic Greeks and Romans had turned away from, in their skepticism and rationalism, the thing which they tolerated and despised.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">It was the practical aspects of Christianity which led to the ?rious conflicts between its followers and the Roman state. For, in spite of the frequently quoted “Render unto Csesar that which is CaesaPs,” etc., the general drift of the teachings of Jesus is necessarily subversive of an imperial state. The governors of the Roman Empire found themselves confronted by a republic eii sting within the empire and opposed to the very.,foundations upon which the empire rested. For what they considered the religious superstition of the&quot; Christians they had very lit-, tie real care; that they could have tolerated, for they considered themselves intellectually superior to it; but the thing they could not tolerate was the flaming doctrine aimed directly at all forms of injustice, oppression and slavery on earth and at all systems which permit them. The rulers pretended to be shocked at what they considered the atheism of the new sect, which denied the old gods; and the superstitious populace, believing all sorts of calumnies against the Christians, really were shocked; but what impelled the rulers to persecution was not really their horror of atheism so much as their dread of anarchy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">* • • •</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Jesus would undoubtedly be considered an anarchist today if He were alive; and any person who attempts to apply His principles in a thoroughgoing, uncompromising manner to a political situation in any modern state is suppressed. There is still precisely the same doubt and fear of the practical application of the teachings of Jesus that there was 1900 yean ago. The fact that the Christian religion became, under Constantine, the official religion of the empire means nothing in this relation; for this was not a triumph for the doctrines of Jesus, but a compromise on the part of His followers, which resulted in centering the essential struggle within the churches themselves. *</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">There never has been, on any large, extended scale, a real test of the political opinions of Jesus; they have never been applied; current governments are still of the opinion of the ancient Romans; the mystical and supernatural symbolism of Christianity is firmly established in the world, but the application of its spiritual content to the general affairs of men has never been tried.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">The fears of the modern world are as well justified, no doubt, as the fears of the ancient world; the uncompromising practice of the doctrines of Jesus would undoubtedly blow all the established systems to flinders. But people who </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;text-decoration:underline;">caII</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"> themselves Christians will be able to prevent this catastrophe for a good many years, we dare say.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">' • • •</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Real Christianity is necessarily intolerant of fraud, injustice and oppression; and while its ultimate aim is peace, it is obvious that them can be no peace where it exists until it has achieved its ultimate triumph. The moment it abates, by one whisper, its intolerant idealism, it ceases to exist; it becomes something else; it is absolute, or it is nothing; it cannot make terms, or it defeats itself; it can pardon all sinners, but never any sin; its most mild-seeming precepts are really explosive parodoxes; it is nothing to be trifled with; eventually the human race, as it finds itself on this planet, must either extirpate it completely or practise it sincerely if it wants any rest; it is impossible to live near it without taking some attitude toward it. Most of the troubles of the world, since it appeared, have been stirred up in one way or another by the action of this idealism on the human spirit; people who are touched with it may and do compromise, but the thing itself does not compromise.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">IN &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">We wonder what we would have done if we had been a Boman emperor, 1700 years ago, and reports had been brought to ns of the spread of the new sect. We would probably have said to ourself: “Shall we order another persecution f Or will it do any goodf It is a pity that the calm temper of the philosophers can not gradually spread over all the Roman world, fostering toleration and gradually banishing all these superstitions, unchallenged by any new sect of fanatics and absolutists who insist on a superhuman conduct. If I were to tolerate them, still their doctrines will not tolerate me— so how can I afford to tolerate themf No; there can be no peace until they are wiped out.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">So, conceivably, we might order the persecution to begin. Perhaps you wouldn’t You say you wouldn’t But let’s see what you do the next time one of the genuine ones—who are the same now as they were then—takes a stand subversive of the social order from which you derive your wealth, your comfort, your importance, or your safety. For the real thing doesn’t change; it is still in the world, struggling, active, practical, uncompromising, oppressed, dangerous, spiritual.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark56"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark57"></a>Who Pays the Debt?</span></h6>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">HERE is a question raised over a statement in </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">The Golden Age, No.</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"> 110, page 145. The statement is: “When Adam died there was a debt; Jesus died to provide an asset that balanced the account.” The questioner asks: What is this debt; who owes it; how and when did the one or ones who owe it get in debt; to whom is it owed; and how does Jesus’ death cancel this debt, or balance the account 1”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">God created Adam a free moral agent; but 'Adam’s existence was conditional, as the requirements were just and loving and for the creature's own everlasting good. Adam was indebted to God for his life, his home, and all that he had. Through disobedience he lost the life which God had prepared for him. Adam got into debt when he transgressed the divine law; he owed Divine Justice. When Adam died, his debt was canceled as far as he himself was concerned. The debt was an eternal death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">But God had planned to rescue Adam (and the race that had lost life in him) by having some one redeem him. In due time, Jesus came as a man and laid down in sacrificial death the perfection of His human organism as a corresponding price, a ransom, for the perfect human organism of the man Adam. When Jesus was raised from the dead, He was raised a divine being; and as His life was not a forfeited life, He had the value of His perfect human organism as an asset (John 6:51) to present to Divine Justice on behalf of Adam and his posterity. To make the transaction efficacious Jesus will never live again as a </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">man;</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"> else the purchase price will have been taken back. But Jesus has no personal use now for His human organism; hence He has not been injured; but having been given a divine body He is greatly blessed and benefited.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Jesus ascended to heaven and laid down, or deposited, His ransom sacrifice in the hands of Justice (Hebrews 9:24-26), which has been the </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">basis</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"> for God’s dealings with the Church of the Gospel Age. When the Church is glorified with divine bodies (2 Peter 1:4), the ransom asset will be fully released or paid over; and as a result the world of mankind will come into possession of perfect human bodies, just the thing the ransom sacrifice calls for; and the earth shall be brought to paradisaic conditions as a suitable dwelling place for humanity in perfection.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark58"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark59"></a>God’s Chosen People</span></h6>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">[Radiocast from WATCHTOWER WBBR on a wave length of 273 meter*, by J. F. Rntherford]</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">'But you are a chosen Race, a Royal Priesthood, a holy Nation, a People for a purpose, that you may declare the perfections of Him who called You from darkness into His Wonderful Light.”— 1 Peter 2:9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">M</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">ANY have laid claim to the title of “God’s chosen people&quot;, basing their claim upon this text. They can not all be right, because they differ and are opposed to each other. How may we know who are the chosen people of Godt The answer is, God has provided two primary ways by which He instructs those who wish to be instructed: first, through His Word; and second, by His manner of dealing with each.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">For a time the Jews were God’s chosen people. But the words here written by St. Peter could not apply to the Jews, because prior thereto the Jews had been cast off by the specific words of our Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">The Catholic, being the oldest church organization on earth, has claimed that that organization is the one here meant. But this could not be true, for the reason that the Apostle states that the one mentioned is a holy nation. Holy means pure and blameless, and not even the Catholics themselves will </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">aImth</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"> that their organization is pure and blameless; and we all know that that organization is largely concerned with the politics of this world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">The various Protestant denominations claim to be the &quot;chosen people of God.” But their c</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">laim</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"> is unfounded, for the reason that all these organizations join hands with the political and financial powers of this world, and are far from holy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">St Peter, writing under inspiration of the holy spirit, in the context gives us the key by which we can conclusively determine who are the &quot;chosen ones of God”. He says: &quot;Wherefore also it .is contained in the scripture, Behold, I lay in Zion a chief corner stone, elect, precious ; and he that believeth on </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"> shall not be confounded. Ye also, as living stones, are built up a spiritual house, to be an holy priesthood, to offer up sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.”— 1 Peter 2:6,5. </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">R. V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">By this we see that Christ Jesus is the Head of this body of chosen people of Jehovah; and that those who are really His, constituting the members of His body, are the others. Concerning this St. Paul said: “He [Jesus] is the head of the body, the church, who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have the preeminence.&quot; (Colossians 1:18) It follows, then, that there must be others associated with Him. In order to understand this wonderful class chosen by the Lord, it is necessary to have some Scriptural reason why the Lord Jehovah should choose them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">The perfect man Adam and Eve his wife, being sentenced to death and expelled from Eden, while undergoing the process of the death judgment brought forth their children. AH of these were born in sin and shapen in iniquity. Even so has it been with all of the human family?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">God promised to redeem man from death and restore him. He promised to select a certain class that He would use as His instruments in the performance of this work. To Abraham Ha said: &quot;In thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed.” The apostle Paul definitely locates this seed when he says in Galatians 3: 16,29,27, that Christ Jesus is the Head of the seed, and that as many as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ and that those who are Christ’s constitute the seed of promise. The term “seed of promise” is another name for the chosen people of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Rules of Acceptance with God</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">DE IT noted that there is no earthly body or organization with a membership roll with fixed rules and regulations that constitutes the chosen people of the Lord. God </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">hims</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">elf selects them. He has laid down the rules. It is an individual matter with each one conforming to these rules as to whether or not he will be approved of Jehovah. The Lord Jesus, His beloved Son, first was required to meet these rules. We shall briefly note the steps that He took.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Our Lord’s life was transferred from the spirit to the human plane. He was made flesh and dwelt amongst men. He grew to manhood’s estate. He was required to be thirty years of age before He was qualified, under the Law, to be a priest At that time He was perfect in every respect as a man. As a perfect man, keeping God’s Law, He had a right to life on : the earth. It was the Law of God that man should be redeemed and that this redemption should come through the voluntary sacrifice of another perfect man. Jesus was the only perfeet man ever on earth since Adam. As a perfect man exercising His selfish will, He could have enjoyed the blessings of this earth and have been the most honored man that lived on earth, as indeed He was the greatest. But He said: “I came... not to do mine own will, but the will of </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"> [my Father] that sent me.” (John 6:38) This was the first rule, and He complied with every part of it</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Jesus consecrated himself wholly to do God’s wilL Three and one-half years thereafter He was crucified upon the cross. This was for the purpose of providing the great ransom sacrifice, that the people might have life through the merit of His sacrifice. This Jesus plainly stated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Our Lord was raised from the dead and ascended into heaven a divine being. There He presented to Jehovah the value of His human sacrifice, which is the exact off-set, corresponding to the perfect human life which Adam forfeited by reason of his disobedience. The Scriptures show that this sacrifice was at that time, and since has been, used for the purpose of furnishing a basis for justification of those who come to the Lord in His appointed way; and that later it will be used as a basis for bringing the entire human race into harmony with Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">t The Apostle shows that each one who becomes a member of this chosen class, the holy nation of Jehovah, must follow in the footsteps of Je-</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">I</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"> sus. He plainly thus states in these words: “For <sup>1</sup> even hereunto were ye called; because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps.”— 1 Peter 2: 2L</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">I The steps that any man must take in order to become a true Christian are to believe that he was born\a sinner and needs a Savior; that Jesus Christis the Savior of men; and.that the only way to life is to accept Him as such. This is properly called repentance, which means a change of mind. His next step is to consecrate ..imself to the Lord, which means a change of course of action and is therefore properly willed conversion. Consecration means a full and complete submission of oneself unto God, agreeing to do the will of God and not be governed by the will of man. The few during the past 1900 years who have taken this step, and who have received the imputation of the merit of Christ Jesus, have been justified by Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Justification means to be made right with God. The three necessary steps to justification are: (1) Faith on our part; (2) the imputation of Christ’s merit; and (3) the judicial determination by Jehovah that we are justified, or made right with Him. God has justified such for one purpose only, and that is that they might become the true footstep followers of Jesus and participate in His sacrifice. The sacrifice consists of willingly giving up the prospect and hope of ourselves being restored to eternal life on the earth. When thus justified, one is begotten by Jehovah to the new or divine nature. This is the beginning of a new creature. Such an one now is holy, not within himself^ but through the merit of Christ Jesus. His hopes and prospects now are that he may see the Lord and be forever with Him in heaven, participating in the first resurrection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">The JFftaeM of Acceptance</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">TVTANY have asked themselves: “How </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">may </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">I know that I am a new creature in Christ, a real Christian? Doubt comes into my mind.” The Lord has given us the measuring rod </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">by </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">which we can measure ourselves and determine, and each one must determine for himself. God never clothed any man, whether he be preacher or otherwise, with authority to say to another person: “You are going to heaven.” The individual may know whether or not he is a new creature in Christ; and then he can determine whether or not he himself is living up to his agreement to do God’s wilL , &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">The apostle Paul, speaking to such, says: “The spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God: and if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and jointheirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">him,</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"> that we may be also glorified together.”— Bomans 8:16,17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">The word “spirit” here means the invisible power and influence of Jehovah operating upon the mind of the Christian, testifying to him and proving to him whether or not he belongs to the Lord. Jehovah has provided two separate and distinct lines of testimony to establish this fact: First, the plain statement of His Word; and second, His manner of dealing with the Christian. We first consider some of the scriptures. In 1 Corinthians 2:14 we are advised that the natural </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">man</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"> cannot understand the deep things of God’s Word, but that the new creature in Christ can understand them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">The fact that a man is a graduate of a theological seminary, learned in the Greek and the Hebrew, and in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, would in no wise mean that he is a Christian; nor would it mean that he could understand the Bible. The deep things of God’s Word are spiritually discerned. Now if one is able to understand these deep truths, that is one of the first testimonies that he is begotten as a new creature in Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">One of these great truths is the mystery of God which the apostle Paul tells us (Colossians 1:26,27) has been hid from all mankind of the world and is revealed only to those who are in Christ. This mystery is the Christ, the new creation, which is made up of Jesus the Head and His body members, and which is another name for “God’s chosen people”. One who understands and appreciates this fact is anxious to adhere to the rules of the Lord and to keep away from contamination of the things of this world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Those who are true Christians are indeed a secret association amongst themselves, who can tell all their secrets publicly, from the house tops, and the natural man of the world cannot understand anything about them. The reason for this is that such truths are spiritually discerned. This is the reason why so few people on earth really appreciate God’s wonderful plan and His love manifested toward man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Again the.Apostle says: &quot;Knowing, brethren beloved, your election of God. For our gospel came not unto you in word only, but also in power, and in the holy spirit, and in much assurance ; as ye know what manner of men we were among you for your sake.” (1 Thessalonians 1: 4, 5) The gospel of truth makes a man a power for good in the hands of the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Again says the Apostle: “We know that we have passed from death unto life, because we love the brethren.” (1 John 3:14) Love for the brethren means an </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">uns</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">elfish devotion to the cause of the brethren, anxious to do what we can to help them along in the narrow way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Again says the Apostle, every Christian is fearful of nothing, because love casts out fear. (1 John 4:17,18) This means that he is not fearful of losing his reputation amongst men. He does not fear to tell the truth in the love of the truth. He is indifferent to the approval or disapproval of worldly organizations. He is not seeking the plaudits of men, but seeking the approval of God. ■ . ■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Lord Jeeue ‘ dully Treated</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">A</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">S FOB some of God's dealings with His people, another manner of testifying that they are His: We know that Jesus, the Head of this royal line, was not popular with men in the world. The religionists of His time despised Him. The Pharisees and scribes claimed to be the representatives of God, and yet they willingly and boldly joined forces with the politicians of the world at that time,and did not faithfully represent Jehovah. They hated the Lord Jesus. They slandered Him. They told all manner of lies concerning Him. They accused Him of almost every crime known to the calendar. Yet He was holy and harmless, and without sin. They conspired to kill Him. They called Him the chief of devils. Jesus said to His followers, who are members of the new creation: &quot;If the world hate you, ye know that it hated me before it hated you. If ye were of the world, the world would love his own; but because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you. Remember the word that I said unto you, The servant is not greater than his Lord. If they have persecuted me, they will also perse-. cute you; if they have kept my saying, they will keep yours also.”—John 15:18-20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">It would be well for everyone who claims to - be a Christian, whether he be clergyman or layman, to ask himself: Do I come within thio definition given by the Lord? A true Christian</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">IM</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">is not popular with the world, because his interests are not worldly. The world does not understand </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">him,</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"> even as it did not understand Jesus. The world means the organized condition of society of which Satan is the god, or invisible ruler. Any class of religionists who willingly join hands with profiteers and politicians to control the affairs of this evil world can not lay claim to the title, &quot;God’s Chosen People.* Any individual who is really devoted to the Lord, and who is faithfully serving the Lord, having the witness of the spirit that he is the Lord's, may lay claim to the title, as one of &quot;God’s Chosen People.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">The Lord Jesus, the Head of this chosen class, was always loyal to the Father. Loyalty means to do what the divine law requires. He was always faithful to His Father. Faithfulness means fidelity in representing Jehovah and His cause. Each member of this chosen class of Jehovah must likewise be loyal and faithfuL To these, St Paul says that the reasonable service of the Christian is to devote his all to the cause of God in Christ Jesus. Then he adds: &quot;Be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.” (Romans 12:2) Those who are members of this class do not need to have their names written on any earthly church books. No one has authority to put any name on an earthly church book. Christians are they who have their names written in heaven. The Lord alone keeps the membership roll, and He does not commit this to man or to organizations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">The faithfulness of this class must be con-tinous even unto the end. To the faithful alone is the promise of the reward of joint-heirship with Christ Jesus in His kingdom. To them Jesus said: &quot;Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life” (Revelation 2: 10); again! “To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne.” (Revelation 3:21) And again, He said that they who shall share the victory and glory of the Lord are the </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">called,</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"> the </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">chosen</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"> and the </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">faithful.</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"> (Revelation 17:14) These are promised that they shall participate with the Lord in His resurrection and reign with </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">Him.</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">— Revelation 20:6.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Purpose of the Choosing</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">^PHE Apostle, speaking of </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">this</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"> class, says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">“Ye are a people for a purpose.” What purpose then has God in choosing this class 1 The answer is, That they may constitute the seed of promise through whom blessings shall flow out to all the families of the earth. Again the Apostle speaks of them as a royal priesthood. The word “royal” means reigning. “Priesthood” means a body that </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">mini</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">sters unto others, that teaches and helps others. This means then that this people, thus chosen, when glorified, will constitute a reigning, kingly class, that will at the same time minister unto the people. For this reason the Christ is spoken of as Prophet, Priest, and King. Prophet, to teach the people; Priest, to minister unto them; </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">King</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">, to rule over them and bless them. This is the purpose of choosing the people of God. These duties, however, shall be performed for the benefit of man while </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">this</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"> royal family is invisible to inan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Earthly Work</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">B</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">UT while in course of training, and while on earth, is there anything that this class should do? The Apostle answers in this text, that they might show forth the praises of </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">Him </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">who hath called them out of darkness into His marvelous light. It is a part of the duty of such as Christians, true followers of the Lord Jesus, to show forth the praises of Jehovah and the praises of the Lord Jesus, by being true and faithful witnesses concerning God, that He is Jehovah; concerning Jesus, that He is the Redeemer and Deliverer of mankind; and that His kingdom is the channel of blessings for the human race. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">For this reason the true Christian, one of the “chosen people of God”, with malice toward none and with love toward all must take a stand firmly on the side of the Lord and consistently refuse to participate in any of the unrighteous things of this world. He must content himself with looking forward to that time when by the grace of God, clothed with power and authority from the Lord, he may participate in the reformation of the human family by uplifting and blessing mankind according to the will of Jehovah.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Advanced and Juvenile biOla Studies which have been hitherto published.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">“’But the student is not left to theory or conjecture. The Scriptural evidence is given in such abundance that all doubt is forever removed. God’s prophet long ago foretold the coining of a Mighty One and said that this Mighty One should have a government of righteousness; that “his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace; of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end.” (Isaiah 9:6,7) An “everlasting Father” presumes that there shall be some ofif-spring who will have everlasting life. Hence this promise indicated that a government would be established wherein man would be granted the privilege of life everlasting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">“•As we have heretofore observed, Jehovah made a covenant with the nation of Israel, to the exclusion of all other nations. He gave them a law to shield them from the influences and machinations of the adversary and to lead them to Christ, their great Messiah. The Jews as a nation did not keep this law, because they were imperfect; but some of their rulers were especially wicked. The time came when God said concerning Zedekiah, the last king of Israel: “And thou, profane wicked prince of Israel, whose day is come, when iniquity shall have an end, thus saith the Lord God: Remove the diadem, and take off the crown; this shall not be the same: exalt him that is low, and abase </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"> that is high. I will overturn, overturn, overturn it: and it shall be no more, until he come whose right it is; and I will give it him.”—Ezekiel 21:25-27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">•&quot;It follows that at some future time there would come a mighty one who would establish a kingdom of righteousness, having full authority and right thus to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;•At the overthrow of Zedekiah God permitted the Gentiles to establish a universal dominion in the earth. The Lord through the prophet Daniel pictured the development of four world empires or^kingdoms, which would exist for a certain period of time, and which would continue until He should come whose right it is; and then He, the Righteous One, should take possession of earth’s affairs and rule. It is to be expected, of course, that the unrighteous governments would hold on to their power in earth as long as possible, and that they would still be thus doing at the coming of the great King, and that He would oust these earthly kingdoms of unrighteousness and establish </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">righteous government. Thus says the Lord through the prophet Daniel: “In the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">kingdom, which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom shall not be left to other people, but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever.* (Daniel 2:44) It follows, then, that this </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">right</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">eous King must be present before He breaks to pieces and consumes the other kingdoms. The Scriptures speak of the righteous kingdom </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">as </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">the kingdom of heaven, because it is in accord with the heavenly Father’s will and ruled by the invisible power of the great </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Messiah.</span></p>

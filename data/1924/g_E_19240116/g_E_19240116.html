<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">An Analysis of the President’s Message</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">P</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">bestdekt Cooudgb ostensibly is against America’s joining the League of Nations;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">so is Wall Street. This is because the American people are definitely set against it Sour grapes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">He is for the World Court, the back-door entrance into the League; so is Wall Street</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">He is against the recognition of the government of Soviet Russia; so is Wall Street</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">He wants Europe to pay back the money it has borrowed here; so does Wall Street</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">He wants a reduction in the income taxes paid by the wealthy, so that a larger proportion of taxes may fall on those whose earnings are smaller; so does Wall Street</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">He is opposed to the levying of excess profits ? taxes; so is Wall Street</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">He is opposed to the issuance of any more tax free securities; so is Wall Street, now, after all these securities are safely lodged in their bank vaults to the tune of billions of dollars. This is locking the stable door when the stolen horse is twenty miles away.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">He wants the tariff let alone; so does Wall Street, and everybody else with any dollars or sense. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">He wants America’s four billion dollar merchant marine surrendered to private interests; so does Wall Street</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">He wants the Supreme Court virtually to * have the power to fix railroad profits; so does Wall Street</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">He sees the necessity of a revision of freight rates, but he wants the railroads let alone; so does Wall Street.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">He wants the procedure in Federal courts to be regulated by the courts rather than by statutes made by the people; so does Wall Street.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">He wants prohibition enforced; so does Wall Street It has wet goods laid up for many years and it does not wish the people at large to have such goods. Wet goods make them dangerous.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">He wants Northern industrial centers made more hospitable places for Negroes; so does Wall Street, because it has found Negroes much easier to handle than whites.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">He wants the Federal Government, when it employs women, to see to it that there is a minimum wage below which the Government shall not fall; so does Wall Street, which, now that it has been freed of this burden by decree of the Supreme Court, can pay the women as it pleases in every other part of the Union.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">He wants the immediate registration of all aliens; so does Wall Street. It hopes thus to be able to keep out Bolshevism. <sub>x</sub></span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">He is opposed to granting the soldiers a bonus; so is Wall Street.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">He is opposed to government ownership or operation of coal mines; so is Wall Street.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">He is opposed to regulating profits in coal at the mines; so is Wall Street. •</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">He wants &quot;greater unity of ownership* of the,, soft coal fields and &quot;common selling agents* for the product; so does Wall Street.'</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">He is opposed to any plan for aiding the farmer that would be in any way akin to the plan that has been used for aiding the railroads to make their huge profits; so is Wall Street.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">He wants Congress to hamper him by wholly needless restrictions as to how he may dispose of Muscle Shoals to Henry Ford; so does Wall Street</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">He wants good roads for the automobiles; so does Wall Street &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">It seems to us that President Coolidge is the Republican party's logical candidate for President, and that he probably stands well with the papacy; we shall be surprised if he is not nominated this coming June. But whether he would be elected may depend on how much the people as a whole see in his message and his close alliance with the superinvisible government</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark32"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark33"></a>Reports from Foreign Correspondents</span></h3>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Report from Canada &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">C</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ANADA has received one good financial “earthquake” in the past few months, and the money satraps fear another one. That it will com# seems to be a foregone conclusion. The devastating failure of the Home Bank of Canada has caused the small depositors first to quake, then to get mad; and now they are combining into quite a formidable union for purposes of compelling investigation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Simultaneously three investigations are going on: The authorities are taking criminal proceedings against the Directors; the Government is investigating the internal affairs of the-Bank, and discovering a condition so putrid that it almost calls for the use of gas masks; and the depositors are demanding that the Government make up any deficit, because the Finance Minister was warned by officers of the Bank years ago that its investments were.unsound and that it should be checked up.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Nothing was done at the time, seemingly; and upon the bare assurance of the management that everything was in good shape the matter was dropped. Now the depositors are invoking the Bank Act, and declaring that as the Government controls a large staff of bank examiners, this implies a direct responsibility with regard to the soundness of the Canadian Banks, and therefore the Government must make good its protege’s losses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">What the outcome will be remains to be seen. In the meantime the aroused state of public opinion bodes ill for the directorate if evidence of crooked dealing is exhumed, as seems highly probable. The fact that the Home Bank is practically a Boman Catholic institution, having been founded by a Bishop (Fallon) and supported by the Catholic institutions generally, does not increase the public confidence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Church union affecting the Methodist, Presbyterian, an&lt;^ Congregational Churches continues prominent in the press. Much bitterness is being stirred up and factional vituperation is much in evidence. The old adage that &quot;when thieves fall out honest men get their due” may be true in this case; and no doubt as the fight waxes more fierce, many interesting truths will come to light.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Paralleling the already published statement that immense sums of money have been wasted annually by the three denominations in duplication of efforts in the communities where three full-time ministers are needed to do the work that one able-bodied man could do in his spare time, is the growing conviction in the minds of the people that the salaried minister is an anachronism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Already the Southern Saskatchewan Conference of the Mennonite Church has cut off its salaried ministry because “a certain sect is widely advertising ‘Free Minister Service' [Seats Free and No Collection]*’; and they cannot compete. Some able-bodied ministers are now more closely emulating St Paul and working for a living whilst they preach.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Farming conditions are as one would expect, and as was predicted in the columns of Ths Goldbw Aon some months ago. When the tremendous wheat harvest of the “golden” West commenced to flow eastward to the markets, all' the newspapers joined in a chorus of praise of the “productivity of our wonderful Prairie Provinces.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Today they are silent. The crop was big enough, but in many parts of the West the farmers cannot get enough money for the wheat to pay haulage to the railroad. There is again a despondency, a sullen hatred of conditions that make a year's labor of no avail.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Your correspondent hopes in his next report to give with some detail a report of the government action against the Alberta district farmers under the Tax Act It should be interesting reading whilst Canada is so “prosperous.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">One flourishing business, however, which seems to gain momentum with every passing month is the bootleg traffic to the U. S. A. The Belleville (Ontario) rum fleet still busily ships its spiritous cargoes to Cuba and Mexico in twenty-ton launches, returning in twenty-four hours for another load. There is much activity just now in fear of a freeze-up of Lake Ontario. An examination of the Mexico shipping records should be interesting, with all the names of Canadian lake craft that must appear thereon I</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Labor conditions are deplorable. The Toronto </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Telegram</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> reports that twenty-five thousand Canadians are crossing the American boundary line each week because of the slackness of business in Canada. Many of them are discouraged farmers. Many are unemployed artisans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Many are immigrants who see a brighter prospect for steady employment south of the line, and thus hold up to ridicule both the Canadian </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">Immi</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">gration activities in their attempt to get settlers, and the American law which tries to restrict their entry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">. During the “prosperous” years that followed the war which made Canada safe for democracy, the Government statistics of immigration and emigration are as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">■' &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To Canada From Canada</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Total 486,401 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;383,945</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">This gives the total immigration from all countries for these years, and the emigration to the United States only. There was also a large loss to England, South Africa, Australia, and * other countries. Seemingly there is something radically wrong with Canada’s immigration . policy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">f</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Report from England</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">B</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">RITAIN at the present time is in the midst of the excitement which always aceompan-ies a general election. The Prime Minister, Mr. Stanley Baldwin, known to Americans because he was Britain's financial emissary, dissolved Parliament in order that he could go to the country for authority to introduce measures for protection; this because Mr. Bonar Law, whose place he took, had promised that the present government would make no attempt to introduce such legislation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">, Mr. Baldwin and his supporters say that this was a most honorable proceeding on his part, whereas the Liberal leaders say that he has prostituted the privileges of his office and thrown the country into confusion in order to get a party advantage. For, say they, the country has already many times expressed itself on this question; and the late government was expected to proceed with the legislation for the amendment of the country's affairs, without touching the principles upon which it lives, and to try to bring about such relationships with the country's European neighbors as would help to settle the distracted nations and thus bring peace in Europe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">When elected, the Conservatives got a much greater proportion of seats in Parliament than votes in the country; for they polled only about seventy-five percent of votes- in the constituencies. Their opponents are divided; and the only hope the Conservatives have at this time is that, the same conditions prevailing, they expect to do as well or better than before and to have freedom to go their own way. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">In the meantime the government of Britain has little weight in the counsels of the European politicians—which may be all the better for everybody; but Europe is going from bad to worse. At home unemployment is the giant stalking through the land, and it is this that has precipitated the Prime Minister’s action. The politicians are divided; at the best they do not know what to do to amend the weakness of the country's industrial situation. '</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Some apparently genuinely believe that duties levied on all imports will serve to keep goods out of the country and so provide work at home by safeguarding the home manufacturer from foreign competition, thought it is also expected that the duties which will be levied (on the goods which are to be kept out!) will help to pay the taxation of the country and so relieve its burdens; also the shipping countries hope to continue to fill their ships with the goods and to satisfy their shareholders with the carrying profits on the goods which the protectionist hopes to keep out of the country. Whichever party is in the ascendancy the opposition can always point to failures; and in any case the public are the sufferers at the hands of those who hold the reins, power and money.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The profiteer is still abroad in the land, not only the one who openly takes advantage of a fellow citizen in his need, but the ordinary commercial profiteer. A short time ago it was pointed out that two Yorkshire firms, in the wool trade, revealed by their figures that each had made an average of £140 ($700) profit per year per employA Perhaps there is no more shameful fleecing of the public than in some departments of the wool trade. One buys some underclothing which is said to be good or best value in woolen wear, only to find that when the storekeeper sold the goods the customer was also “sold.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The general condition of the country shows up as usual. The people are very patient under the heavy burdens which they must bear. The richer people are feeling the pinch of things; but things do not pinch so hard when a person has only some thousands of pounds less in income. Lord Derby of Knowsley, near Liverpool, the present representative of the well-established family of the Stanleys, said the other day that he was approaching the point where he might have to consider the giving up of his ancestral home. But worry with scores of thousands of .pounds a year income can hardly be the same as when there is worry as to how many loaves can be bought with the wage of the home provider.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The late Lord Chancellor has been shocking the country by his outspoken paganism. He will not tolerate the idea that there can be a time when war will be no more, and he laughs to scorn those who carry such an idea. He will have nothing to do with any notion of such a league of nations as at present exists, and expects to see things go on as always. If he lives a little longer he will see something which will shake his paganism. In any case Isaiah is to be believed rather than the Earl of Birkenhead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">There is little doing amongst the churches. A great meeting is called for the Royal Albert hall by some earnest Christians, when they are going to declare their faith in the Bible as the Word of God. There are many who deplore the falling away from the faith of their fathers. To our regret we have to say that these apparently sincere persons refuse to be released from the bondage which their creeds have bound around them, and decline to have the plan of God set before them. We have no doubt that soon they will see that faith in the Bible as the Word of God is not enough; and that none can continue to hold faith who does not understand the Bible, which, admittedly, they do not.-</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark3"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark34"></a>Here and There Throughout the World</span></h3>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">U</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">NEMPLOYMENT in England is increasing, and is already in the dreadful condition that seven million workers and their dependents are forced to apply for public relief. In some of the cities there are skilled workers who have not done a stroke of work in three years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">These men are quiet, but are broken in spirit; and their value as workers is diminishing. They are showing plainly the signs of hunger in their faces, They are clamoring for work, preferring to work at anything rather than to be idle, even though they may be paid something for it</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The British Government is putting out two million pounds sterling per week for the maintenance of the unemployed, and an equal amount is being contributed by the local Poor Law authorities. The Labor Party sees no solution of the problem which Britain faces except the immediate cancellation of all war debts, including Britain's debt to the United States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">heretofore Britain has done an enormous business with all other European countries; but Europe can no longer buy, and the British dominions cannot take care of the surplus goods which British mills can produce. The British outlook is dark indeed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">A joint meeting of representatives of all the principal churches of England has just beefl held in London, at which resolutions were passed . * calling upon the Government to “institute a searching inquiry into the fundamental causes of the persistent unemployment which has sapped the life of the people for so many years,^with a view to large and radical measures being speedily taken to deal with the evil”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">One of the bishops of the Church of England present said that the clergy were at this conference &quot;to give voice to a profoundly uneasy conscience.” We can see why, as a result of their always championing the cause of war whenever the opportunity arises, they should have just that kind of conscience.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Where unemployment is so widespread, there is a natural tendency for wages to go down. The condition of cinema workers in London has just come to light, showing that one of these men, working from nine in the morning until ten-thirty at night every day in the week, receives as compensation only two pounds sterling per week, barely enough for a single man to exist upon. Another operator, showing pictures for seven and one-half hours daily, received only one pound three shillings per week.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Dole* to Babylonian*</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">B</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">RITISH labor men, confronted with their own miseries, are giving some attention to the doles that are passed out to others. Millions of dollars are paid out every year to persons whose only claim to the money is that for some vague reason or other they are “distinguished.'* This is on the same general level with the payment of $20,000 a year to Chauncey M. Depew out of the funds of one of the great life . </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">inan</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ranna companies. On the witness stand Chauncey seemed unable to find any reason why he should get those $20,000 except for his “genoral s</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">tandin</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">g^ in the community.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The labor people just now are pointing out that while he lived, Lord Nelson received his pay as a naval officer, plus $15,000 prize money for the Battle of the Nile alone, plus $15,000 a year from the King of Naples, plus a gift of ' = $50,000 from the East India Company, and received a pension during the latter part of his life of $20,000 per year from the British Government; and*that since his death, up to 1913, his relatives, moststf them entirely unknown to the public, have ceileeted an additional $2,500,. . \ 000, all because they happened to be Nelsons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">~' This same miserable policy of sustaining distinguished men and families long after the work ' for which they were duly paid at the time has been finished, continues to be a British policy. The judiciary are paid amply while in office, &gt;. *- and paid after they are out of office. The same is true of the peers and of royalty in general</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">In the face of such conditions, an account of a royal wedding, such as that of the Crown Prince of Sweden to one of the British royalty, recently celebrated in London is nonsense.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The newspaper stories give us our fill of , information about “magnificent gold plate,&quot; ' .“scarlet and blue uniforms adorned with decorations and gold lace,” “gorgeous copes’* of the Bishop of London and the Archbishop of Canterbury, the “crimson and lace costumes” of the choir, etc.; and we. may add that it does not take long to give us our fill, either. A little of it goes a long way. Britain is paying well for a lot of tomfoolery it could do without</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Entertaining the Premier*</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">F</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">OR the entertainment of the Premiers </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">et </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Canada, South Africa, India, Australia, and New Zealand the British Navy has just had a parade of its fleet off Spithead, England. ' Of the eighty-two vessels in the armada not a single ship was commissioned in 1914. The number of battleships is now but eighteen, whereas in 1914 there were fifty-five.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The battleship has had its day, and it was an expensive day. The Hood, England's greatest battleship, carries eight fifteen-inch guns at a speed of thirty-one knoth an hour. The Angus, airship carrier, has no funnels, but ejects its smoke from behind, like an automobile.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Reports from India are that for the first time in years it is expected that the 1923 budget will be balanced. The Indian Premier says, in explanation of the means by which this fiscal result was accomplished:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“Taxation [of the poor Hindus] has been increased to an extent which a few yean ago would not have been thought possible. Nevertheless for five yean in cneeea ■ion we wen unable to balance our budgets. The aggregate deficits indeed in these five yean amounted to moce than sixty million pounds sterling, a gigantic sum for so poor a country.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Both the premiers of India and South Africa want a “tariff preference to goods from within the Empire.&quot; In other words, they want pro- . tection instead of free trade; and it seems likely to us that economic necessity will virtually^ force consent to their wishes. However, there is a great body of public opinion in England that will always be for free trade and against protection in any form.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Ireland, Australia, Jamaica</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">1</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">~RF/LAND maintains its reputation for being always in trouble. The Irish Republic is now mostly in jail, prisoners of the Irish Free State, and is engaged in a hunger strike to bring about either liberty or death. At last account five hundred of the fifteen thousand prisoners were still on strike, with several of them in a dangerous condition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Melbourne has been having a police strike with results somewhat like those which accompanied Boston's similar strike some years ago. Rowdies took advantage of the situation to overturn cars, smash windows, and rob stores. Part of the force stayed on the job, and the places of the strikers were temporarily filled by special constables who aided in restoring order. The strike was due to the refusal of the police commissioners to dismiss a patrolman for what</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">the commissioners regarded as inadequate reasons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The Jamaican Government has been investigating the question of how to best develop the island’s transportation facilities. The expert appointed to the job, in his report to the Duke of Devonshire, advised against State ownership or control.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">It is a safe bet that the Duke has a good personal financial reason why the railways should be left in his hands, if they are there now. We have no knowledge on the subject, but can guess. Generally, in America, when we find experts telling financiers that a certain enterprise ought not to be undertaken by the public, we know in advance why the report was framed that way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Think what a crime against the financiers it would be if some of the really good and profitable things of this world should actually get into the hands of the common people. In a little while they would want something more; and after a while the people would want to run all their own businesses; and what a terrible thing that would be, wouldn’t itf &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Excitement in Egypt</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">TT’GYPT has had the excitement of anelec-•I-i tion. Adley Bey, British candidate for the premiership, according to the London </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Daily Herald,</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> received three votes. The </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Herald</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> says that he was so sure of election that he neglected to go to the polls h</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">ims</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">elf; otherwise he might have had four votes. Some of the ministers received no votes at all, not a single one. This would seem io indicate that if the Egyptians do not know what they want they at least know what they do not want</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Ninety percent of the inhabitants of Egypt are engaged in agriculture; but the same conditions are developing there as elsewhere over the earth. The land is getting into the hands of the few, with a consequence of strikes and other labor troubles, which before the World War were never heard of. There has also been a rapid rise in the cost of living.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The Valley of Kings, within which lie the now famous remains of King Tut-ankh-Amen, has been connected with the outside world by long distance telephone. The use of the telephone is spreading greatly. England notices a rapid increase in the number of instruments in use since the war.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">tinent sets a pretty good example of sanity as compared with the rest of the world, but of late | is growing somewhat restless. The three great- i est countries of South America, Argentine, ; Brazil and Chile (co me times called the ABC j countries), determine South American destinies. ;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">None of the other South American countries j would be able to contend seriously with any one of these, but it becomes a different matter when i they face each other. Argentine has been expanding its military administration, most un- ' wisely, we think. This has made Chile anxious; and now, although Chile is peaceably disposed, the probabilities are that it will follow Argantine’s bad example.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The present Chilean government is enlightened and progressive. It is organizing cooper- • ative workingmen’s banks in the industrial centers, with a view to the social betterment and ' uplift of the workers. That is the kind of work in which a government shftul'd be engaged, rather than in the evil work oFmultiplying arms with which to force its will upon others. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Cuba would like to be progressive, but is handicapped. In the interests of economy and efficiency the Cuban legislature passed a bill consolidating the railroads of the country, an eminently sensible thing to do; but they did not reckon with the fact that some of the Cuban * railroads belong to American financiers. At present the financiers have blocked the way of . the Cubans by throwing their great power into an effort to have our State Department take a hand in the matter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">In the midst of the general Asiatic melefi China has developed a real statesman in the person of General Yen Hsi-shan, governor of &quot;&nbsp;the province of Shansi. In the eleven years during which he has been administering the province he has reduced the soldiers from 50,000 to 20,000, has put a complete end to banditry and the opium traffic, has built modern roads, has begun reforestation on a large scale, and has introduced sheep suitable to the climate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Early in November, Japan was the scene of one of the greatest ovations ever given any person on the other side of the world. It was a spontaneous expression on the part of all Japan in honor of the American Ambassador, as he</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">left for a visit home, following the relief work in which </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">Am</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">pri^a played the principal part. The ship on which he sailed was converted into a huge conservatory of flowers which came from all parts of Japan. This expression of gratitude is encouraging from every point of view. It shows <sup>f</sup>hat, whatever may have been the case in the past, the Japanese people at this time are genuinely friendly to the American people. Newspaper reports show that in Japan, when ' conditions were at the worst, people committed suicide in preference to facing starvation.</span></p>

The president of Yale University says that the present situation is most disheartening. He sees in European affairs increased evidences of jealousy, fear, hatred, suspicion, greed, and the disposition of the strong to bully the weak.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The president of Princeton University does not see that the nations are any closer together than five years ago, or that there is any sign of their coming closer together. He </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">thinka</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> tEe best </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">' f</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> thing for the United States to do is to join the League of Nations. In our opinion President Hibben is barking up the wrong tree. President Hibben is a D. D^ and engaged in the work of making other D. Ds. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Robert E. Speer, president of the Federal Council of Churches, says that there is a deepening conviction that all the people want peace, that the whole trouble is in bad leaders, that the mass of the people are convinced that they have been misused to their own destruction, and that they are not in the mood to be thus misused much longer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Dr. William T. Ellis, the magazine writer, ‘says that &quot;most of the penetrating Old World observers with whom I have talked (in an eight months’ trip to the Near East) have reached the conclusion that unless there is a general return to an observance of the principles of Christianity there is no hope for civilization.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">During the lifetime of Pastor Russell, William T. Ellis devoted his talents to ridiculing the efforts of that godly man to establish true Christianity in the earth. The Presbyterian Church, of which Dr. Ellis is a spokesman, served faithfully as a slave at the beck and </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">ca</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ll . of the war god in 1917 and 1913.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Having done what he could to destroy true Christianity in the earth, and to uphold false Christianity, it strikes us as interesting at thia juncture to have </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> say that unless mankind comes to an observance of true Christianity there is no hope for civilization. If civilization perishes, William T. Ellis will be as largely responsible for it as any man we know.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Oscar S. Straus, former ambassador to Turkey, says that the world conditions since the armistice have been ruinous alike to both the victor and the vanquished, and that the reason for the unparalleled disastrous result is because the peace terms were forged in revenge and not in justice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Senator Borah of Idaho thinks that up to the time of the armistice the Allies were carrying on war against governments; and that since that time they have been carrying on war against men, women and children who were not responsible for the war, and who are being punished in peace as no human beings were ever punished before. The situation in Germany con- . firms this. Every effort is being made to destroy the German population.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Opinions of the Europeans &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">I</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">srakt. Zangwill, the novelist, says of Europe that it has no statesman, but a succession of. . gamblers; and that the people of Europe are like passengers in a train driven by a mad engineer. He is of the opinion that the men in • power all over Europe have forgotten much and learned nothing; and that if the press had not aided the politicians it would not have been possible to engulf the whole world in a whirlpool of hatred and falsehood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Dr. Fridtjof Nansen, the scientist and explorer, declares that in his opinion Europe, five years after the armistice, is in a worse condition than it was in 1918 at the end of the war; and that the present crisis is greater than any that arose during the war itself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Cardinal Mercier says that the rulers of Europe are filled with distrust, and that there is anxiety everywhere. The cardinal is right; and the reason for this distressing situation is that Europe has drunk too long and too deeply of Roman Catholic doctrines. It is Babylon’s mixed wine that has made Europe a madhouse. The Cardinal should chuck up his job.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Lloyd George, at the conclusion of his recent tour of America, made the statement that unless America joins with England to settle the present European unrest, &quot;civilization is doomed within this generation to a catastrophe such as the world has never seen.&quot; He wants a policeman with a long pocketbook.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The President of Czecho-Slovakia says that the first requirement of Europe is authority. This is our opinion exactly; and in our judgment this authority can come from but one place. It can certainly never come from any earthly source; all such sources have been discredited long ago.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Francesco Nitti, ex-Premier of Italy, says that Europe is now in a far worse condition than at the close of the war, that all solemn pledges made during the war have been violated, that conquered nations have been disarmed, that France and her dependent states have doubled their armaments, and that every effort is being made to suffocate Germany and to destroy her economically. He anticipates that Germany will be broken up, and that her dissolution will bring irreparable disaster to France.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">G</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">kefusl Smuts, Premier of South Africa, says of the Treaty of Versailles, which brought about present conditions in Europe:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;The responsibility for what </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">wm</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> done at Paris for the settlement contained in the peace treaty, weighs heavily on my conscience in spite of the fact that I signed it only under protest, and under a sense of foreboding of future calamities which have come only too true.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">He sees the economic and industrial structure of Europe cracking in all directions, unable to bear the weight of the vast hordes of black troops that have been poured into’ Europe by France in her effort to maintain her supremacy by force rather than by reason.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">General Smuts, like most European statesmen, sees hope only if </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">Am</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">erind reenters European affairs. But Uncle Sam is chary of acting as Britain’s paymaster and sheriff; and most Americans see little else to be gained by America’s undertaking greater participation in the troubles overseas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">But Europeans have no right to feel that </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">Ame</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">rica has shown no interest in their troubles. The following is a statement, in millions of dollars, of the amounts that the United States Government has advanced to various European countries.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Aos are aware that the United States' proposals to France and other countries that an unbiased inquiry be made into Germany's ability to pay the reparations indemnities have fallen to the ground.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The French Premier, although understanding distinctly that these experts would be acting wholly in an advisory capacity, made such restrictions respecting the inquiry that it was not found feasible to go on with them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">, Senator McCormick voices the general opinion of Premier Poincar£ in America in the following statement:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“The contemptuous condescension with which JI. PoincarS conditions his acceptance of the proposed conference shove that he has not learned anything,, or, if he has, that he will not </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">confess</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> it. He originally proposed and promised the impossible to his own people, and so overthrew and succeeded in office a man of great ability, who had won from England a guarantee of French security which Af. Poincartf promptly repudiated. M. Poincare's policy has reduced the total of German reparations recoverable by France, has added enormously to the French national debt, has prolonged and increased unemployment in England, has added to the number of children in central Europe dead or dying of slow starvation, has multiplied the number of those whom Mr. Coolidge believes must be fed by the charity of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">Amp</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">tican taxpayer, has made more remote the payment of the Allied debt to us, and has hurt immeasurably the American farmer and manufacturer.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">But conference or no conference France is inevitably nearing the end of her course of force and selfishness. There has been no unemployment there yet, but there soon will be^ for the wbrk of reconstruction, now about two-thirds completed, will be stopped by lack of funds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">France has advanced eighty billion francs to the people in the war-devastated areas, and has set this huge sum aside in a special budget charged to Germany. If she drives Germany to dissolution and destruction, as she seems determined to do, Germany will never pay any of this; and the result will be what all leading economists see ahead for France—sure bankruptcy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">France, however, is largely an agricultural nation, and with eighty-five percent of the farina owned by the people living upon them, can manage to get along after, a fashion, even if the franc does go the way of the mark But she will have to stop* all industrial progress, and even military expense, if the franc continues to depreciate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">France Outkaisering the Kaiser</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">A</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">T PRESENT the French military machine</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">&gt; is worse than the German machine ever was, even in the palmiest days of the Kaiser. France has a million men under arms, and five airplanes to England's one. True democracy shudders at this new form of ruthless force.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">For permitting, in the town of Leveque, an inscription stating that the World War was a war to end war, the French Government has ordered the mayor to stand trial for non-observance of a ministerial order. This shows that the present French ministry never had any such Wilsonian idea. The farther we go in chasing Mr. Wilson's rainbow phrases the more fatigued we get.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">There is a pronounced antagonism in Franco against America. In September a young, man who stole $30,000 from the American Express Company, and who admitted that he had spent it in furnishing an apartment for an unmarried</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Parisienne, was acquitted by a jury after only five minutes deliberation. The ground of the acquittal was that the American concern was American, that it was rich, and that it had made millions through exchange speculations in the franc. On any such basis a crime becomes a joke.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Doctor </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Uillu in the Ruhr *</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">HE Reverend Dr. Newell Dwight Hillis, of</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Brooklyn, who won undying fame during the World* War by his &quot;sermons” of hate for the Germans, is back from a visit to the Ruhr valley, where for eight months, he says, the German Government paid the workers to remain idle, so as to try to force better terms from the French. He describes the German civilization entertainingly, and contrasts it with Britain and </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">Ame</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">rica. In trying to prove that the Germans can well afford to pay reparations in full he said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;Tenement houses are not permitted in the Ruhr valley. Ton can find tens of thousands of rotting old rookeries in the cotton cities of central England, and miserable shacks in the coal, iron and steel towns of the United States. But you shall not find one single such structure in the entire Ruhr valley—not one I One day, passing through the outskirts of Essen, I noticed at a distance what looked like a splendid villa, singularly like one of the finest houses on a certain estate in Greenwich, Conn. Driving up a little later to the front of this home, to my amazement I found it was an apartment building. The central portion was three stories high, the two wings at either end were two stories. The building contained fourteen apartments. In the rear were many little gardens. Knowing that the turnover, through discontent on the part of the workingmen, was about six months in certain factories in Detroit and Pittsburgh, inquiry showed that the workers in thia particular plant remained for life, and that practically there was no turnover. The German employers have been very wise. The apartment for the family was full of air and sunshine, had all the conveniences of sanitation, opened out upon a little garden, in which the workingman's wife and children had their vegetables, their flowers, a few currant bushes and gooseberry, raspberry and blackberry vines, a few cherry trees, and a grape vine.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">During the war to end war, and to make the world safe for democracy, Dr. Hillis was one of the chief rooters for war; and as we understood his program at that time one of the principal things for which he was contending was the release of the German people from the above conditions. If what he says is true it is scant wonder that these &quot;barbarous Huns,” as the Germans were called during the war, did not want to exchange their civilization for ours. I Maybe the &quot;Huns&quot; wanted to show us how to live!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Stoning in a Palaeo</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">B</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">UT it is possible to starve in a palace, and that is what is happening in Germany.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Newspaper despatches show that a census of school children in Berlin, taken without warning by social welfare workers, revealed the fact that thousands of school children come to school in the morning without breakfast, and that many of them collapse in the class rooms because they have had no food.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Moreover, these same children are without adequate clothing, and some of them have neither shoes nor stockings. In some places in Germany the old folks have committed suicide, with the avowed object of saving the food supplies for the younger and more vigorous, so that something might be saved out of the wreck.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Dr. Nansen, the Norwegian explorer and diplomat, states that in one German town which he visited the people of the town had invaded the surrounding farms and dug up the potato crops at night The police arrested three hundred of these marauders in a single night, but the numbers finally became so great that they were forced to abandon the attempt to preserve order.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">In terms of American money a mail carrier gets $5 a month, a railway engineer $7, and a railway superintendent </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">$2T.</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> These men must pay $1 a pound for meat and twenty cents a loaf for bread, with everything else- in proper-tion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">One hundred thousand Czecho-Slovakians living&quot; in Germany have begged their own government to take them home because they have found the conditions under which they must live in Germany are intolerable. The United States contemplates a gift of 50,000,000 bushels of wheat to Germany.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Many </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">famili</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">es are unable to buy even two loaves of bread as their supply for an entire week. In one instance five hundred desperate men rushed the bread wagons in a factory dia» trict Sleeping cars are attached to freight trains, to save fueL</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Germany Is in Chaos</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">HE fuel situation is so desperate that college trained men and highly educated and intelligent women are going out of Berlin in tiie fourth class railway carriages and returning with tightly packed loads of wood that represent the uttermost limits of their strength to carry to and from the cars.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">They carry as much as possible on each trip because they cannot afford to make more than the fewest possible number of trips. In Berlin itself children crawl around the city parks with sacks, gathering every fallen twig or leaf or bit of bark that can be used for fueL</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Politically Germany is in chaos, as it is financially. The people have lost confidence in the Reichstag and are unable to agree on any plan; indeed, the demands of France are such that is is impossible to have a plan. One cabinet after another goes down, and one uprising after another occurs. The central government continues to function, after a fashion, hoping against hope to find a way out of the impassA</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">There has been some mild excitement because the Crown Prince wished to return from his ' } exile in Holland, to rejoin his family in Silesia. Holland has no law which could prevent his return to Germany; and Germany is willing that he should return, as a private citizen. It is doubtful whether any Hohenzollern could ' regain the throne of Germany, and there would be little to fear from any activities of the Crown Prince.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">In Bavaria, which has been under the rule of * a dictator, there has been an outbreak of antiSemitism. Dr. von Kahr, the dictator, ordered the expulsion of three hundred Jews who had not established the right of domicile. They were deported to Vienna, and all their property was ■ &quot;confiscated. Their houses were turned over to German refugees driven penniless from the Ruhr by the French military machine. Bavaria is the Roman Catholic stronghold of what was once the German empire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Austria, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Czechoslovakia, Holland</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">HE recovery of Austria, as a result of the loan arranged a year ago, is said to be remarkable. Unemployment is now only half what it was at the beginning of last year, and deposits in savings banks have grown to three times what they were. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Vienna claims to have regained control of all her old markets and to have regained her position as the financial center of the neighboring states. For many of these she now does the whole money exchange business. A few years ago Vienna's condition seemed hopeless.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The &quot;Christian Socialists&quot; are in control of the Austrian Government. This is a Roman Catholic movement, and has the great power of the Church back of it. No doubt the Papacy has made it its special business to show that where it is given a free hand it can bring order out of chaos. It might be able to do it in a strictly Boman Catholic country like Austria, but to do it in a Protestant country like Germany is quite another matter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Between Germany and Austria lies the new country of Czecho-Slovakia, of which Prague is the capital. This is the ancient Bohemia, made illustrious by the reformer John Huss. Czechoslovakia has been trying woman suffrage for three years and is well pleased with the result.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The women have elected about five percent of the members of both the House and the Senate, and have definitely influenced the making of new laws which are working out well for the interests of the country as a whole.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">These laws have to do with the organization of women's technical, industrial and domestic schools, and the establishment of child welfare centers in each city. The women have also rendered valuable assistance regarding food shortage problems.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">In the midst of European confusion it is refreshing to find the' government of Holland showing a cool head under circumstances where an opposite course would have been excusable. Britain's great new $55,000,000 naval base at Singapore lies just in the northern center of Holland's choicest possessions—the East Indies, Java. Sumatra, Celebes, etc., from which are imported rice, coffee, sugar, indigo, pepper, dyestuffs, pearls, and other valuable articles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Some Hollanders began to feel alarm, and urged that Holland should also build a great naval base somewhere in the vicinity. Wiser counsels prevailed: and out of G,700,000 persons in Holland 2,000,000 signed a petition urging the Government not to undertake such a work of folly; and the scare passed. For this act of sanity Holland deserves the thanks of all good men and women everywhere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Items Respecting Russia</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">I</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">N RUSSIA the farmers are reported as taking a great interest in the best of modern farm machinery. For generations they have been accustomed to common pastures and a common herdsman; and now they are planning, each village by itself, to have a common wheat field; worked by the latest and best methods. They are handicapped by lack of money and credit, but advantaged by the fact that the tax amounts to not more than one-tenth of the crop. The Government is the only landlord, and buys all the produce. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The cooperative societies of Russia have just celebrated the twenty-fifth anniversary of the formation of their central organization. Americans can hardly comprehend the magnitude of Russian cooperation, but can form some idea of it when told that America has seventy-seven thousand post-offices and Russia’has one hundred thousand cooperative centres. According to their own statement:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">*The cooperatives are purely economic bodies and have no interest in politics. They made considerable progress during the regime of the Czar, despite many difficulties; survived the World War, withstood the severe hardships caused by the revolution, with its consequent iron blockade, and through it all emerged more firmly entrenched than ever before.<sup>9</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The railroads of Russia at this time are carrying about one-third the goods and passengers carried before the war. The rolling stock is in bad shape, but is slowly improving. The railroads have asked of the Soviet Government the privilege of charging one-half the prewar rates. In America the railroads took advantage of the war situation to charge about twice the prewar rates. Russian mines are now producing thirty-four percent of the coal produced before the war, and the oil fields are producing fifty percent of prewar. The Russian army is now 600,000 in size.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">In marked contrast to the attitude of the American Government, Edgar Blake of Chicago, appointed by the Baltimore conference as bishop of the American Methodist Episcopal Church of southern Europe, in addressing the all-Russian church conclave at Moscow is reported to have said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;Revolutions and upheavals are not born of death. They just show new life, and our hearts should be filled with gladness. The church is always much affected by these upheavals. The church should not, then, pro-</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Beooccrx, X X.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">nounce anathema against such movements. The church cannot stop new movements, but must join them. What we pray for in America is that the Lord will give us a ministry that will accept and join new movements. Russia is passing through a great social and economic experiment. For the first time in human history a great nation is dedicating itself to do good for the masses of humanity, and is striving to attain everything God-given for man. It is a gigantic task, and such a gigantic task is unattainable-without the help of God. I cannot see how the church can stand aside.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">It may be all right for Methodists to talk that way when they are in Russia; perhaps Methodists might even dare to talk that way in America, for they stand very close to the Governs meat; but we would not feel so secure about other religionists that would try it, especially if of foreign birth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Italian Statesmanship &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">C</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ONTRASTING the spirit which animates Europe now with the spirit which prevailed throughout the world only ten or twenty years ago, Francesco Nitti, Premier of Italy, at the time of the signing of the Treaty of Versailles and one of the world’s greatest statesmen, says in the Los Angeles </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Examiner:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“The United State* of America defeated Spain. With the exception of severing Cuba and the Philippine Islands from Spain, she imposed no humiliatian an the vanquished foe. Japan defeated Russia. Her peace terms were very reasonable and honest. Great Britain defeated the Boers. She indulged in no acts of revenge and granted them a liberal constitution. But tike treaties concluded after the European war are founded on rapine and fraud, a disgrace to humanity. The victor* kept none of the promises they had made in the hour of danger; they forgot all principles of liberty and of selfdetermination which they had solemnly proclaimed.<sup>9</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Mr. Nitti admits that all the Allies, including Italy, lied about German cruelties. He traces the causes of the World War, showing that France, Russia, and Italy were each partly to blame for the difficulty which sprang up between Russia and Austria over the Sarajevo affair.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">He cites the prewar treaty between Russia and France, found and published by the Soviets, wherein it was agreed that when the anticipated war should he over Russia was to see to it that France should get the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">100%</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> German Saar valley, and says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;History records no bargain more cynical or more shameful. Hnd that horrible treaty of rapine been published during the war it would have destroyed all sympathy with Franca.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">As to Mr. Wilson Mr. Nitti says that the eloquence, force, and simplicity with which he expressed his idealisms that the &quot;last great war” was fought for civilization, for democracy, for the triumph of all principles of nationality and self-decision made him believed by everybody, including Germany.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;But, unfortunately, President Wilson, who convinced everybody else of the truth of what he said, was not himself convinced. He did not act as he spoke. He did <sub>k</sub> not live up to his words.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Bishop William Burt, of the Methodist Church, in a lecture at Gowanda, New York, referring to his ten years’ residence as a Methodist Bishop in Borne, says of the papal power: </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;It is still true that all roads lead to Rome. Rome, the capital of capitals, still continues and will continue to be a place of destiny for Europe and the world. The present pope, Pius XI, is regarded by some as the ablest and cleverest pope that has ruled the Vatican for centuries. It is reported that twenty-five nations are rep- resented at his court What is he doing to eave the continent from the ruin for which the Vatican is largely responsible? He is simply applying his old salve of opportunism and pitting one nation against another. I regard the nest of intriguers at the Vatican as the One danger center in the actual crisis. Peace and pros-/ parity can never be established on the continent of Europe by forces that are merely political, financial or material.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Go to it, William! You are hitting the nail on the head, not only in what you have to say &gt;&nbsp;about the Papacy but in your general observation that “if professedly Christian people had really been Christian before 1914 there would have been no war.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Italians are reported as eager for Germany to be given a chance. They see nothing to be gained by Italy in a Germany that is broken up into small states, each of which is bankrupt and unable to pay anything in the way of reparations. Italy wants her share of the reparations, and sees no comfort in France’s determination to ruin the German people so that nobody will receive anything.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Bankers and Packers</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">HE farther we get into this government &quot;of the bankers, by the bankers, and for the</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19240116_files/g_E_19240116-2.png" alt="" style="width:15pt;height:18pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">bankers” the less rosy it looks. Take for instance the way the b</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">^nk</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">era have handled this crooked packing business. The Government knew, and everybody knew, that the packers were squeezing the life out of the stock growers by artificially depressing prices for livestock and inflating prices levied upon the consumer. So the Federal Trade Commission set about making an investigation. It made an honest one; and this was something that apparently was not expected by either -the Government, the packers, or the bankers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">When the packers found that a real honest-to-goodness investigation was likely to come, the representatives of Armour, Swift, and Morris got together and signed a memorandum to the effect that &quot;we believe the situation to be serious and recommend that due consideration be immediately given to it and that everything • be done to head off the present movement and to relieve the tension. We believe that as it stands today, nothing could stop criminal prosecutions.” We must at least give the packers credit for having enough sense to want to keep out of jaiL The investigation itself showed their absolute moral rottenness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">As the investigation proceeded with its labors it had a good chance to see what are the real standards of the big business men of America, the bankers and the packers. The report says that we &quot;had to meet deliberate falsification of returns properly required under legal authority; we had to meet schools for witnesses where employes were coached in anticipation of their being called to testify in an investigation ordered by you [the President] and by the Congress of the United States; we had to meet a situation created by the destruction of letters and documents vital to this investigation; we had to meet a conspiracy in the preparation of answers to the lawful inquiries of the Commission.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;’</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">When the report of the investigation readied Congress a bill was passed, embodying amendments written </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">in the handwriting of the lobbyists for the packers,</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> ignoring the recommendations of the Trade Commission and putting it out of business. A few months later J. Ogden Armour, of Armour and Company, called at the White House and notified President Harding that an illegal merger of the packing monopolies of Armour and Morris was about to occur; and it has since been put across by the bankers, Guaranty Trust Company of New York, Kuhn, Loeb &amp;&nbsp;Company, and the J. P. Morgan Company, all of them shining examples of modern finance. All of these concerns are</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“up to their ears” in the packing industry, and are running it on the same principle or lack of principle as the railroad, sugar, lumber and other basic industries are run.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Maintaining the Monarchy</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">A</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> NEWS despatch states that the United</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">States Steel Corporation has made a voluntary and unsolicited gift of $100,000 to the Eight Reverend J. M, Gannon, for the use of the Catholic diocese of Erie, Pennsylvania. Just what we would expect. We have previously exposed in these columns the red-handed anarchy which existed in Western Pennsylvania some two or three years ago, when the workers for the Steel Trust were seeking better conditions. Instance after instance was cited showing just where and when the so-called officials in certain communities set aside all laws and rights of the people in the interest of the gigantic organization which controls Western Pennsylvania and, with its allies, claims to control and does control the United States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Here is a good sample of how the partnership works. Is the Steel Trust specially interested in Catholic works of charity </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">1</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> Perhaps, perhaps! But the Steel Trust is looking ahead; and when, at any future time, it needs in Western Pennsylvania a few more clerical &quot;gents&quot; to put the screws on public officials by threatening them with the loss of the Catholic vote unless they do certain things, and when it needs to get word to Catholics not to do certain things, it knows how to get the results desired. We consider this $100,000 well spent, for the purely commercial end in view; and no doubt the directors of the Steel Trust feel the same way, or they would not have appropriated the stockholders' money for that purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;Tis a grand system, my masters; and just as long as the priests can control the people, and keep them in ignorance, and just as long as the Protestant clergy will faithfully follow the same system of keeping the people in ignorance, nothing can prevent the scheme from working in the future just as Mark Hanna said it would work, and as history shows it has worked. Mark was right. But if the people should ever get to thinking, then the jig will be up.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">I</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">T IS of no avail to send a policeman or a detective to arrest a big banker or packer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">He would run against a pile of briefs, bills, motions, orders, injunctions, delays, petitions, exceptions, writs of error, habeas corpuses, noils prosses, rulings, and decisions that would soon make him know his place. If he started out to do it he would be in a fair way to land in jail himself, and without any cellmate to keep him company. The proper work of the police is to apprehend and bring to justice the little thieves who more or less interrupt the orderly work of shaking, the loose change out of the pockets of the people as a whole; and it must be admitted that they are often clever at the job.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Admiration has been aroused by the work done by two sleuths of the New York Police Department They suspected a certain place to be a Chinese opium smoking den. The . place was searched several times, but disclosed, no* opium. At length, still convinced that it was an opium den, the police suddenly crashed through a barred door into a room where they found fourteen Chinese, but no opium. *</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">A careful search took place. In one spot the wallpaper bulged. When tapped it gave forth a hollow sound. One of the officers tore away the paper, bringing to light a magnet, to which was attached a piece of string. The officer let the magnet down the chimney and up came a package containing $5,000 worth of opium, wrapped frith steel bands, to make it responsive to the magnet The smokers stopped laughing^ and went along to jaiL</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Police officers have to do many things which they do not enjoy. Seven boys, fourteen to sixteen years of age, escaped from a Catholic institution near Nyack, pooled their resources for enough to pay their passage across the Hudson River, walked thirty miles across plowed fields, swamps and woods and finally landed, late at night, in the upper part of the city of New York. They had thirty-nine cents among them and were headed for the home of one of the boys, where they hoped to stay over night, and the next morning each strike out for a job for himself. The police took them in an automobile to the police station, the first auto trip they had ever had in their lives, and the next day they were sent back to their prison.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark46"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark47"></a>The Business Outlook for 1924</span></h3>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">B</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">USINESS men all over the world are wondering what the year 1924 is to bring. Amongst financiers there is a wide difference of opinion. Mr. Roger W. Babson, one of the world’s leading economists, gave a resume of the situation in New York city recently. Mr. * Babson is at the head of a statistical organizar lion which has a large clientage for statistical information and business data, and his address was also in the nature of advice to those who are depending somewhat upon his vision of * things.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Mr. Babson referred to the general optimism of big business—to the expressions that filter through the Steel Trust, the Studebaker Corporation, and other leading industries. He said' that Wall Street is optimistic about the outlook for 1924, their optimism being based on what Mr. Babson called &quot;surface vision.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Surface statistics reveal the fact that there are 100,000 carload lots of freight daily, an increase of ten percent over a year ago; that building permits are thirty percent greater; that retail sales are twelve percent more; that bank deposits are over ten percent in excess of a year ago. These, according to Wall Street, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">' ' f</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> point to prosperity and are reliable thermometers forecasting the revival of business.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Carload freight is a thermometer of produo-tion; building permits are thermometers of construction; retail sales are thermometers of consumption; and bank deposits are thermometers of savings. The increase along these lines makes Wall Street decidedly bullish, using a stock expression.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;But,” said Mr. Babson, &quot;what is a thermometer f”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">A thermometer is an instrument which tells about the present weather; it does not today register yesterday’s weather, nor will it fore-cast the weather of tomorrow.- Mr. Babson makes a wide distinction between &quot;surface” and “fundamental” statistics. Wall Street sees only the surface statistics; and the surface statistics are the only ones which find their way into the daily newspapers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The fundamentals are not studied. No set of men can be mqre blind to financial conditions than those who study merely the surface statistics. The stock market is a thermometer; it registers the effect of speculative winds, showing the present feverishness or sluggishness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">But business is good or bad according to fundamentals. Fundamentals are based upon basic industries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The basic industries are: Lumber, rubber, coal, iron, oil, cotton, leather, wheat, etc.; and these are all fiat—inactive and not in demand. Something is wrong when a farmer can take one acre of ground and plow, harrow, plant, cultivate, harvest, and deliver the products of that one acre, for one year's time, and </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">get</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> less for it than a bricklayer will draw in wages in one and one-half days!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Foreign Goode Imported at Low Pricee</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">E</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">UROPEAN countries are maintaining the largest armies in their history, in the face of a deficit in government incomes. Something must break. Another European war would tem-. porarily help business conditions in the United States, but when Europe goes bankrupt it will be harmful for the world generally. <sub>%</sub></span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Labor has already reached a very low level in the European countries, enabling them to manufacture commodities at a very low price, as compared with prices in the United States. But Mr. Babson thinks that we are going to get along fairly well as long as the war problems, the reparations problems, and other strife-producing problems in Europe are not settled; for these keep many of Europe's laborers employed in the armies. But what are we going to do when the world recovers her normalcy, and starts in on production with all the improved machinery we have today?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Mr. Babson exhibited a good-sized pocket searchlight having a double battery which had been imported in large quantities from the war-stricken areas and which, with duty paid, costs only fifteen cents, delivered in New York. He also exhibited a safety razor, made to take the Gillett blades, delivered duty paid, for only fourteen cents. He also exhibited a desirable-sized jackknife, thin model, strong and durable, having two blades (such a knife as anyone would like to carry), duty paid, for only fifteen cents. If Europe should pay her debts to the United States in merchandise, what would be the reaction here!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The year 1923 was very unsatisfactory for producers of coal, copper, oils, fertilizers, leather, rubber, wheat, and other basic raw materials, for the reason of lack of </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">deman</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">d.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">'ihere is too great a difference between the prices paid the laborers who work in production and the wages paid city laborers, and too great a difference between the cost of manufacture and the cost to the consumer. But this condition should not be wholly charged to the merchant. This difference, called by economists the &quot;spread,&quot; Mr. Babson said would have to be corrected.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">With our own stagnation as a result of overproduction, what shall we do when peace is restored in Europe, adding their over-production to our own! He pointed ont that the panic of 1854 followed the rapid multiplication of the steam engine; that the panic of 1873 followed the expansion and development of the railroads; that the panic of 1892-3 followed the over-building of the West And the now-looked-for great period of readjustment (panic) will follow whgtf He said: “I do not know.” But he fol-lowed with the suggestion that it would be the automobile.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Crate far Automobile!</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">M</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">M. BABSON gave some statistics bearing upon the automobile industry. In part they were as follows: At the present rate of increase, in three and one-half years there will lie more automobiles than homes (whether he was speaking of New York state or of the country as a whole is not clear). The growth in automobiles in twenty-three and one-half years (the age of automobiles) is greater than the increase in homes in three hundred years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">He said that the automobile depreciation is between $7,000,000 and $10,000,000 each day. This means that the depreciation in the value of automobiles after they are sold by the dealer amounts to that amount of money each day. If the shoe, clothing, and furniture industries are to survive, the output of automobiles must be curbed, was his thought.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">To illustrate the crazy-madness of the country about automobiles he told a story. He was talking to a young lady who was going to be married. He advised her how to get started right; where she could get good, durable furniture at reasonable prices, a piece at a time until her home would be well supplied. She replied: &quot;Hum, we’re going to rent our furniture, and put our money into an automobile.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The manufacturers were told to be prepared for all eventualities during the coming year. There are two laws which control the manufacturer: the manufacturing cost, and the selling cost The greater the output the less will be the cost of manufacture; but, proportionately, the selling cost is advanced after a certain point in the output is reached. The costs of hiring saleomen and advertising automobiles are now greater than the re&lt; tion made in production costs. This is the reason why the Ford car is now sold on the instalment plan.' Over ninety percent of the automobiles sold in the last two years were sold on time payments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The remedy which he offers for the present distressing conditions is for men to have greater confidence in each other, systematize for greater efficiency, work for lower taxes and other fundamental, rather than superficial, remedies. The need of the hour is to cut ont fake optimism and false standards, and get back to the old-fashioned honesty, thrift, and service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">We should strive to get back to better business methods, and not be misled by the present record-breaking figures of oil production, auto output, building permits, car loadings, retail sales, high wages, and bank deposits. A rapid pulse and a high temperature do not mean a healthy patient. It is a notable fact, so Mr. Babson said, that when business is good and everybody making money, operations for appendicitis are heavy. Statistics show that appendicitis increases at a time of upgrade of business levels, and decreases when business is tobogganing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Perhaps there is something psychological in this: When business is good money flows easier, and the surgeons take advantage of prosperity to turn the channel to their own account; or being told that he has appendicitis the patient puts too much confidence in the diagnosis and additionally is not willing to take too many chances with death; so he submits to the ordeaL</span></p>

<div><img src="g_E_19240116_files/g_E_19240116-3.png" alt="" style="width:15pt;height:18pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">VERYBODY should do what he can to stimulate business. The Government is doing just what it should do: It is trying to hold business up and create confidence in order that our people may continue busy and happy; and, notwithstanding the sluggishness of the movements and trading in the fundamentals, there is a general disposition to be hopeful.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Jaav^ar 10, UM</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Since the upward movement to business activity started in 1920, business should be generally good; for there is no reason for an immediate depression, and the present trend may continue for a year or two. We are due for a decrease in wages, cheaper money, and lower prices; and the downward movement in commodity prices may stretch over a long term of years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Mr. Babson said that the banks are interested in deposits; the stores are interested in % their sales; the laborer is interested in his union; and young people are interested in clothes, and are pleasure-bent on what they call a &quot;good time.&quot; But the ultimate thing, he pointed out, is bread and butter. To this end he advised the cutting out of loans, the paying off of debts, reduction in overhead expense, and the cutting out of all speculation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">In other words, if you are in a yacht, with menacing storm-clouds in sight, the thing to do is to pull in the sails and stay close to shore. There will be no real season of prosperity until after election, in any event. Meantime, business men are not to lose their heads in the business squalls that may blow against their industrial </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">j</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> crafts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Mr. Babson said in plain words that many people today have the wrong attitude toward life. They desire merely to be fed, amused, and • taken care of by the' governments. Almost everyone wants to ride in the cart, while few are willing to push or pulL They want to spend but not to save. People today are not paying for their current purchases out of their current earnings, but are pledging the future in order to buy. A lack of religion is exhibited in the present spirit of the times, which is very disconcerting to careful observers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">_ Natural resources do not make communities. -* Building permits, retail sales, and bank deposits are not the greatest things. The greatest thing is man. The greatest thing in man is his ambition, his objective, his character, when he has determined upon a righteous course of business integrity and public service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Life Better Than Making Money</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">M</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">R. BABSON’S advice and summing up of the business situation showed that he was conscientiously trying to lead his clientage into a more wholesome attitude toward their fellow men; that business endeavors should be clean, with a reasonable margin of profit based upon an economical overhead expense; that manufacturing industries should be conducted honestly, the factories should be sanitary, and there should be a better and closer understanding between employer and employes; and that there should be a cooperation that would bring contentment to all; that life is better than making money.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">But Mr. Babson has forebodings of the future. He sees the over-productivity in all commodities with the improved machinery, if the laborer is allowed to work; that with the over-production of shoes, clothing, automobiles, farm machinery, etc., as far as our own needs are concerned, and Europe's inability to buy, there is nothing but unemployment and stagnation staring us in the face.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Mr. Babson sees man’s extremity; but, evidently, he does not see the real remedy. He theorizes on the duty of man; but he has not yet comprehended the human heart: That it is desperately wicked and has gone to seed with selfishness, and that the fruit of that selfishness is now ripening and is white for the harvest</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Within the next two years we opine that man shall have reached his extremity. The great tribulation, prophesied by the writers of the Bible, such as never was before on the earth, will reach its climax. Men's hands (powers) will hang down, and their knees will knock together because of the strife and turmoil and commotion. Then the present unstable, unrighteous, Satanic order of things, which enriches one class and impoverishes another, shall melt like wax and disappear into oblivion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Then will come the divine remedy—the Lord’s kingdom, with Jesus as King over all the earth and Satan bound for the ensuing thousand years in order that the nations may learn true business principles and comprehend the true brotherhood, and be deceived no more. God has promised that He will raise Christ to sit upon the throne to reign for the blessing of all the families of the earth.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">XTES; it was blue Monday. I had entered the A breakfast room with a grouch. My mind was filled with thoughts of the examinations scheduled for the day at school. &quot;Why isn't my plate on the table?” said L “How can I eat breakfast without milk for my cereal? I’ve got enough to think about without thoughts of starvation. My brain can't work without nourishment”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;Very true, my daughter,” interjected my father; “but have you forgotten that the purpose of your attending school is to equip you for service, that you may become able to do something worth while for others as well as for yourself? After a day of rest and a night of sleep, are you not able to perform a trifling service for yourself J</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“Tour first obligation, if able, is to wait on yourself and to relieve others of that burden. Service, like charity, begins at home. After you become qualified to fulfil all of your own wants at your own expense, then you may begin to extend your usefulness for the benefit of others. Why fuss about the examinations? Practise the rule of helpfulness, and you will welcome the examination as one of the means of increasing your usefulness.”</span></p>

They usually travel with each other and work together. They make one love ease and envy others. If you want to live a life free from these masters, you can earn that freedom easier and better by subduing them before their grip is fixed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“Cheerfulness and grouchiness are not merely moods. They are the outward expression of character, and the prevailing traits of character develop and mature with the prevailingthoughts ’ and attitude of the mind.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">tions, without having the capability to face them cheerfully, do not expect a bundle of good feel* ing to fall out of the sky.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;Neither will a changed mental perspective, ; which might help you to forget the disagreeable condition for a time, be a lasting cure; for the i spell is quite sure to recur when the temporary relief vanishes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“Now, let us consider how your blues this ; morning were not really caused by the conditions at the table nor by the impending examination, but were unwittingly helped along yesterday. You spent a day of ease, free from pressing duties, gratifying passing impulses to read, to joke, and to play. All these were feeding Selfishness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“You had on your best dress, your hair culled, maybe trying to excel; and that comes dangerously near to feeding Pride, if not positively doing so; and like weeds, if these imps Selfishness and Pride get a chance to sprout they persist in growing, and soon crowd out or chedf the growth of useful plants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“So, this morning, selfish impulses wanted continued pampering, and pride feared that Joyful Worker might excel Therefore helpful* &lt;&nbsp;ness and humility were in the background and not sufficiently awake or alive to push through this morning.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“But, father, why did the Lord make the Sab* bath, if it puts helpful and. humble impulses to sleep?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“I see, my child, that you are not alone at fault I should have helped you more carefully to a proper appreciation of the purpose of the Sabbath. It was provided for God’s people. They were to use it as a period of rest from selfish pursuits and in hearing the reading of His law and thinking of His character and goodness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“This course would cultivate godlikeness in His people. Part of that likeness would be helpful service and humility. He is the Giver of all good things; and although He is all-powerful, His humility is manifested in extending mercy to a rebellious people, and in enduring blasphemy for ages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“His Son demonstrated how these principles may be practised on earth. Surely they cannot be lived perfectly by imperfect beings; but Ho invited us to learn of Him and find rest unto our souls. We learn that He delighted in service and sacrifice and that He had no pride to be injured because undeserving ones sat in Moses* seat and exercised rulership over the people.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">desire to serve and to see others happy helps me to be hopeful and to endure all things.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">If we hunger and thirst after righteousness, then every effort to control our conduct in accord with the original law written in perfect humanity, produces an inward satisfaction and . harmony that is truly blessed and that cannot be taken from us.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark50"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark51"></a>The Rights of Non-Tobacconists</span></h3>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">HE leading article in Cfoldest Age No. 109, entitled “The Truth about Tobacco,&quot; stirred some of our readers considerably. A subscriber writes that her father had been a constant smoker for half a century. She put the article into his hands. He read it and asked her to destroy all his tobacco and smoking paraphernalia, announcing that he was through with it forever. This gentleman is over eighty years of age; and although the sudden stoppage of the flow of nicotine and other poisons into his system has temporarily made him ill, he sted-I fastly refuses to have anything more to do with it</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Another subscriber, less wise, we think, took personal offense at the article, seeming to think that anything written against the tobacco habit reflected against him personally, and savored of meddling with other people's affairs. But now the anti-tobacconists are being heard from; and they think that the article was just right, but that it did not go far enough.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">They contend, and we think their contention is correct, that non-tobacconists have some rights and that these rights are persistently <sub>r</sub> and increasingly abused by the users of the ■' filthy weed. A gentleman who travels widely writes us on the subject as follows, and there are not a few of our readers who will concur with his views:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;Any man has the privilege of smoking who wants to smoke, but he has not the privilege of blowing his smoke in the other fellow's face who wants to eat his breakfast or dinner in peace. In all the hotels and restauranta smoking is indulged in during meals, to the utter disgust and discomfort of many of the guests —tolerated because it is a habit. The Pullman can have gotten to be smoking can.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“I do not think that we non-smokers should take the position of being prohibitionists. Let a man exercise his own will and volition; but I believe it is the duty of </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> to state plainly the proper poci-tion on the use of tobacco in public places. Smokers are the most selfish men in the world, having no regard . for the comfort of nor consideration for others. We cannot expect to reform them; nor is it our business to reform them. But we only expect to state the facta for the reflection of the people.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Others have asked us to say something' regarding the chewing of tobacco. We hesitate to express our opinion of such a filthy habit; but -perhaps we may say that a tobacco chewer reminds a cleanly person of nothing so much as a sick creature in need of the services of a veterinarian, a scrubbing brush and a fumigant How any woman could ever kiss such a creature —the thought appalls us! How could she want to be in the same room with him! How could anybody want to be in the same room with him —except the pig! &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Another subscriber remarks that in his town the other day he was shoved off the sidewalk by six high-school girls walking abreast, every one of whom was at the time smoking a cigarette. He wants to know what it means. We answer: It means Armageddon! It is merely one of the signs of the break-down of all the old standards. The women are going to pieces along with the men. It is a noteworthy fact that on the New York subways the rudest persons are the misses, still in their teens or early twenties, who alone will elbow and push fellow passengers right and left without a solitary indicar tion of any interest in the welfare of anybody except themselves. Selfishness has gone to seed, and the old order is madly rushing to its doom in general anarchy. It will be followed by a better order. Thank God I</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">A Study of the Theory of Evolution, in Two Parts</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">^FORMALLY the cells of a developing em--L v bryo do not fall apart, as noted in our last issue, but cling together, forming a mass of cells. Finally, when a certain stage in the process of development is reached, a second process begins—that of differentiation. The cells that previously were all alike now begin to take on differences, so that from one original cell, or rather its descendants, are developed the different tissues and organs of a highly organized animal body, with its various powers, capacities and functions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">All of these identical cells were fed, nourished, in exactly the same medium—a homogeneous substance—so that if chemistry could account for the differentiation, any differences they might take on, due to any change in the nutritive medium, would be shared by all cells alike. If we assume that various changes take place in the nutrient media so that part of the cells are bathed in a medium of one character and part of the cells are bathed in a medium of another kind* we would have a mere haphazard process* with nothing to assure the development of the embryo into anything with any fitness to survive. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">But such an assumption would be absurd, even if we did not already know that it is not true. First, the nutrient media bathing the embryo cells are constantly circulating, and are fed from the same source with identically the same elements in the same proportions being fed into them. Second, we know that the process of development is orderly and progressive, and is not a haphazard one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The facts are that the tendencies towards differentiation are inherent in the fertilized ovum, and that these tendencies are fixed in definite directions. The adult animal exists potentially in the fertilized ovum; and no amount of change of environment can change this potentiality into something else. The facts of cross-breeding, of either varieties or species, demonstrate this fact in a remarkable manner. If a mare be bred to a jack, the fertilized ovum develops in an environment and of a nutrient medium that is intended for the development of a horse. But it does not develop into a horse. In the ovum of a mare fertilized by the spermatozoon of an ass we have a mixed potentiality, and this develops into a mixed actuality.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The horse or the ass characteristics may be</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">(Part II) </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">dominant or recessive to each other according to the Mendelian laws, however, since the product of such a union—a mule—is not capable of reproducing its kind, not capable of indefinite inbreeding, which is the mark of a species. In such a case the dominant and recessive characters are not easily determined. Nevertheless, the fixed and definite direction of development is emphasized by these facts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Definite Gaal of Nature's Laws</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">TN THE cross-breeding of varieties we are confronted with the same significant facts and phenomena that are seen in the cross-' breeding of species. The product of cross* breeding of varieties is capable of indefinite inbreeding so that we can watch the process a bit further. In breeding a female white rat to a male black rat the fertilized ovum develops in an environment and of a nutrient medium suited for the development of white rats; but we get all black rats instead. If the products of such a union be interbred, we get both white and black rats with black predominant These white rats if interbred give whites and binds with whites predominant The blacks if interbred give blacks and whites with blacks predominant In a very few generationswe can again have two strains, a white and a black one, as we started with; and each strain will be pure. This process can be repeated over and over again, with always the same results. No better proof is needed of the existence of a definite tendency towards a fixed goal in development And what is here said of rats is true of all other animals and of plants. The same tendencies can be seen in the crossing of the white and the black races.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">In the developing of an animal from ovum to adult the development always takes definite directions from &quot;invisible beginnings to the latest complex results and complexities of structure,* the development or growth always follows a determinate course to an equally determinate end. In the whole process it seems that the power back of it knows exactly what it is doing and how to do it; and the power back of it is the law of an intelligent Creator.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The microscope has shown us not only that plants and animals are composed of cells, but that some organisms are one-celled beings. These are called unicelled; while the higher</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;">JAVCxil</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> % 19M forms are known as multicelled organisms. All cells, whether of unicelled or multicelled beings, - have certain functions in common known to biologists as the common or fundamental functions; the cells of multicelled organisms have certain special functions known as special or expressed functions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">It is from some unicelled organism that the evolutionist thinks that the whole animal and * vegetable kingdom is derived. These organisms V function only through their fundamental functions, and manifest no tendency towards differentiation or , of organizing themselves into a complex organism, such as we see the fertilized ovum do. They have existed from the beginning under almost all conceivable conditions and circumstances and are with us yet, the same simple . structures they were in the beginning. When one of them divides into two, instead of clinging together as the divided ovum does, each separate cell goes its own way, Eves its own life all independent of the other, and is- not dependent in any way upon the functions of another cell.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Nutrition and Drainage</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">SUCH cells were suddenly to develop a tendency to coalesce, they would succeed only in producing a homogeneous mass of cells, - with or without definite form, but without any definite structure. There would be no means of conveying nutriment to those cells inside the mass or of carrying away their waste. Without the powers and tendencies toward differentia' tion, so that special structures and special functions would be developed, the mass would soon . perish of starvation and autotoxemia. Such a cell mass would not be likely to survive in the mildest conceivable struggle for existence. This fact is well proven by the facts connected with ■the bits of tissue from a chicken which Dr. Carrell of the Rockefeller Institute has succeeded in keeping alive for a few years. Artificial means to supply nutrition and drainage have to be resorted to.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">It would be hard to account for the origin of 'even the simplest cell by spontaneous generation. In fact, it is at present impossible. Still lees can the origin of the more complex cells, with their special structures and functions which compose the bodies of the higher forms </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">ef</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> life, be accounted for in this manner.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">But if the structure, functions, tendencies, and powers of such cells point us away from the possihiEty of such an origin, the process of cell division speaks in still more eloquent terms. There are two kinds of cell division, simple and indirect We will confine our remarks here to the indirect method, or mitosis, as it is called. This process is a rather complicated one, beginning with the cell “at rest,” and progressing upward through a definite and fixed series of structural changes until a certain point is reached, when the structures in the two cells that now exist pass backward over the same series of changes, beginning at the end and passing back in inverse order to the “at rest” condition whence the parent cell started.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">This complicated process, which is carried out in an orderly and progressive manner, and with a definite end in view, cannot be explained by any laws of chemistry and physics, and cannot be duplicated outside of the living cell</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Under conceivable conditions, inorganic elements may come together and form inorganic compounds closely resembling protoplasm; but such compound would be a lifeless, inert, homogeneous mass, lacking function, structure, differentiated parts, or the power of reproducing itself. It might increase in bulk in much the same way that a crystal increases in size, but this is not even analogous to growth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">External factors or even internal chemical changes might cause it to divide, that is, break it up into two or more masses; but this could in no wise be made to resemble the phenomena of cell division. The cell is more than a mere chemical compound, and manifests powers that no dead substance, however complex, is capable of manifesting. Let it be carefully noted in passing, that mere aggregation is not growth, and that simple cleavage is not reproduction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Should such a mass form and should it be divided as above stated, the masses thus produced must either remain separated as two independent masses or coalesce and become one mass again. This one mass would be homogeneous. Such a process could not produce a multicellular organism in billions of years. Such a process could never be mistaken for growth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Such a mass would be governed entirely by chemical and physical laws—gravitation, chemical affinity, cohesive attraction, etc., and would be devoid of either instinct or intelligence, would be incapable of locomotion and of structural progression. It would be wholly inorganic, wanting in all those peculiar characteristics that distinguish the living from the non-living. It would be lifeless, and could not pass from the realm of the non-living to the living. This is as far as “matter, motion, and force,&quot; together with the &quot;secondary laws’* of matter which are the ‘Imminent god of the evolutionist,&quot; can carry us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Supernatural Power Originates Life</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">TT IS well proven that spontaneous genera--L tion is not now taking place. It is admitted by all that there is no proof that it ever took place. Yet spontaneous generation, as conceived of by present-day evolutionists, is a purely -chemical process; and we know of no reason why a chemical process once performed cannot be repeated.* If spontaneous generation has not taken place, it must be admitted that a supernatural act originated life. In other words, the admitted overthrow of the theory of spontaneous generation leaves us no other alternative than that of creation as taught in the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">For “matter, motion, and force&quot; and mere “secondary agencies&quot; to bring into being spontaneously a single cell endowed potentially with all the characters, capacities, and powers of the whole animal and vegetable kingdoms, is a miracle such as no creationist ever asked us to believe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">For the Creator to have produced such a cell would have been a special act of creation, greater by far than the creation of a number of cells, one for each species of plants and animals, each possessing potentially the capacities and powers of the form it was to give rise to, just as the fertilized ovum now does, and to have supplied special conditions for the immediate and rapid development of these germs into full-grown animal or vegetable forms. Only those who reject miracles and &quot;an occasional wonder-working God&quot; have sufficient faith to believe in such miracles!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Just as no living being comes into existence today except through the agency of a preexistent living being, so none of the higher forms of life come into being except under special arrangements for their development from the ovum to infancy. These special arrangements do not exist in the inorganic world. The development of a primordial ovum into a full-term or full-grown animal required some special arrangement—an arrangement clearly within the power of an all-wise Creator.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Lifeless matter is not now raised to the plane of the living except through the operations of life, and ovums do not develop into complex organisms except under special conditions. We believe that we are .justified in saying that lifeless matter has never been raised into living matter except by the operations of life.. At the beginning, at least, these operations had to be carried on by a life higher than any known to earth. That Life is God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Whether God created the horse and other animals full-grown, or created an ovum and supplied the necessary conditions for their development into what they were to be, we have not yet found out</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">If the primordial cell could not have come into existence by spontaneous generation bat must have been created by an act of God, I cannot see the logic in the so-called reasoning that limits Him to one such creative act. If God can create one cell, why cannot He create millions or even billions of them? Indeed, if “practice makes perfect** in the divine workshop, as it does in the human, we would expect to see Him do a quicker and more skillful piece of work out of the millionth than out of the first ceU* this last cell giving rise to His masterpiece —man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">No one claims that God made the universe and Hving forms as a carpenter builds a house. But Jehovah, no doubt, worked by method just as He now works by method. Was this method evolution? Did He first create a single cell or a few cells, and from these did He by a process of evolution bring all the many and varied forms of plant and animal life into being?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">If so, the process is not now going on. Not a single indubitable case of species-making by this process has ever been observed to occur in nature. It seems that if this is or has been the process, we would be able to point to some single pair of coexisting distinct species along with the links between them. But we cannot. It is hardly necessary to add that there have been no new species formed during the historic peripd.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">But we are assured that the rocks abound with evidence of the process; that is, some evolutionists assure ns that such is the case. Upon this point, however, geologists and paleontologists seem to be pretty well agreed that these fossil remains of the ancient world are not connected by any </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">link.</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> Each species stands out distinct and separate from every other.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">EvolutioniBte Make Monkepe of Themeelvee</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">HE evolutionist has made what he believes to be his strongest case out of the case of fethe horse. He has a series of fossil forms, arranged according to the tlfeory, beginning with a small five-toed quadruped about the size of a fox and ending with the modern horse. Out of all the many thousands of progressive &quot;links* that must have existed between these two extremes, he has a mere handful, and has not the slightest evidence of any genetic relationship existing between them. It is not proven and not provable that any of these &quot;ancestors” of the horse are even remotely connected with him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">I quote the following from &quot;The New International Encyclopedia,” 1915, article on &quot;Evolution” :</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;It is roughly estimated that about 30,000,000 yean </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">|hsve</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> elapsed since the deposition of the lowest fossilif-eroxu rocks—those of the Cambrian.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;There are remains in the Cambrian rocks of fourteen rim rn of marine invertebrate animals [Question: From what did these evolve? Why are there no pre-Cambrian fossils?] and traces of primitive plants. The Cambrian annelids, trilobites, crustaceans, and other class forms are highly developed. [From what ?] Some, as the trilobites, are old-fashioned, generalized types; some of the Crustacea are composite or generalized types, as the pAyttocrida; but the annelids are as highly specialized as their representatives of today. [This is some progress in thirty millions of years!] The earliest trilobites were blind or eyeless, though they may have descended from eyed forma [of pre-Cambrian ages, perhaps].” I &quot;On the other hand certain types have never made any progress and ahow little advance over their paleozoic ancestors; such are the foraminifera. the sponges, the corals, certain mullusks, as nautilus, king crabs, lingula, and even ceratodus and Hatteria. Certain arthropods, as peripatus, scolopendrella. and compodea, are probably peuistont types.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">From the article on &quot;Bats” I take the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;Few fossil remains of bats are known. In the upper eocene deposits in A Lx, France, has been found a well-developed bat wing, and in other portions of the tertiary deposits of the same country have been found skulls of species that very closely resemble those of modern forma.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">In North America their remains are known in fragmentary condition from the eocene, miocene and post-tar* tiary deposits, and in South America they have been recognized in the cave deposits of Brazil All these differ but little from living general _ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Who Are the Gullible? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;’</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ARWTNTANS in general, as does Wallace in his &quot;Darwinism,” admit that no one ever saw a species originate by natural selection. We may add that they have never seen one originate any other way. Weismann in the &quot;Contemporary Review,” 1893, p.322, frankly admitted that &quot;it is really difficult to imagine this process of natural selection in its details; and to this day it is impossible to demonstrate it in any one point&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The above quotations from the &quot;International Encyclopedia,&quot; together with many thousands of other such facts that could be adduced, demonstrate that not only can they not demonstrate natural selection or any other method of evolution in its details in the modern world, but that they cannot even demonstrate that evolution by any method has ever occurred.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Huxley declared that paleontology alone could furnish us with direct and primary evidence in favor of evolution. In the last chapter of his voluminous work on &quot;Mammals of the Western Hemisphere,” Prof. Scott discusses the various fields that have been appealed to to supply evidence of evolution. Prof. Scott, who is an evolutionist, says in the opening of this chapter that no time has been spent on evolution in the previous chapters; for he did not consider it necessary. The theory he thinks is already too well established to require such discussion. This is a common characteristic of the evolutionist. This assumption is a very convenient one, since it does away with the necessity of furnishing proof of the theory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Taking up comparative anatomy, embryology* geology, paleontology, eta, he tells how each of these has been appealed to for evidence and how none of these has furnished the desired proof. He thinks the science of genetics hardly far enough advanced to be relied upon. Since the appearance of his book, however, Prof. William Bateson has given us the verdict of genetics in regard to evolution; and that verdict is: &quot;Weighed in the balance and found wanting.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Prof. Scott is one of America's foremost paleontologists. He says that paleontology has failed to supply the desired proof. Prof. Huxley said that paleontology alone could supply such proof. If paleontology and genetics both negative the doctrine, who are the ignorant and unthinking—those who still ding to the doctrine with all their might or those who reject itT</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">An Indiscreet </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Doctor</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">S</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">INCE writing the above it has come to my attention that one Dr. Charles W. Stiles of Wilmington, N. C., has declared that either Adam had all the diseases of the nosology or that Bryan is wrong. I quote here the report as published in the San Antonio </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Express</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> for April 1, 1923:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“Washington, March 31.—Tf William Jennings Bryan's denial of the theory of evolution be correct, Adam must have survived for 930 yean all the germ diseases which affect man today; Eve must have been created by vivisection; the Garden of Eden must have been in </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">h</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;text-decoration:underline;">Mm</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">;</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> and a lot of other startling things must have followed in conaequenca In addition to all that, Noah must have been not only a capable ship captain, but the world's first successful public health officer; for he must have taken all the germs into the ark and taken them out again without losing a single elephant.'</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“So declared Dr. Charles W. Stiles of Wilmington, N. noted zoologist and sdmtific research worker, before the Washington Biological Society here Saturday night Describing himself as *Mr. Bryan's self-appointed attorney on germs,' Dr. Stiles argued to his fellow scientists that if one does not wish to believe all these things one cannot agree with Mr. Bryan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“ ‘According to Mr. Bryan's premises/ said Dr. Stiles, ‘all germs which cause disease must have-been created in the beginning as they exist today. If if is to be conceded that those germs were originally created in some form other than as disease germa, the theory of evolution stands admitted. Obviously, since Adam was the last animal created, and since the animals were not created until after the plants, it is unthinkable that any of the numerous germs which cause disease were created after Adam. Since disease germs are dependent for their existence upon animals and plants in which they cause disease, it is clear that these germs could not have been created prior to the creation of their victims. A challenge of this deduction would be admission that the germs were not created as they are today, but that they later evolved into disease germs; but this would be an admission of evolution!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“ ‘Therefore/ said Dr. Stiles, ‘if Mr. Bryan’s challenge is to be accepted, we must conclude that Adam harbored every germ disease which Is characteristic of man or dependent on man for its life cycle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“‘According to that,' said Dr. Stiles, ‘Adam must have had among other troubles, various species of cooties, typhus fever, hookworm, pneumonia, tapeworm, Jacksonian epilepsy, three kinds of malaria, sleeping sickness, tuberculosis, typhoid fever, Asiatic cholera, mumps, whooping cough, yellow fever, scarlet fever, measles, meningitis, infantile paralysis, and smallpox.'</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“From that deduction and Admitting that Adam survived all these, Dr. Stiles said that it must be further deduced that the Garden of Eden waa in China, because <sup>1 </sup>that is the only place where man Is known to survive some of the afflictions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“Moreover, Adam like as not had a boil an his nos^ Dr. Stiles further reasoned, and an abnormal appetite.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“ 'No wonder he ate the apple H concluded the bioh&gt; gist. ‘The wonder is he did not eat the snake also.'&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">This foolishness of Dr. Stiles is of interest to us here not for its scientific value, for it has none, but to show to what lengths these men will go to uphold their pet hypothesis. It is really hard to believe that any sane man would put forth such an argument as </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">thia la and</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> claim to be serious about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The basis for his whole argument is contained in these two assumptions:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">(1) That germs cause disease; and, <sup>v</sup></span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">(2) That every one who ever lived, Adam included, has to have all the various types of disease common to the locality in which he resides.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Neither of these assumptions is correct If the learned doctor, who is said to be a scientific research worker, possessed as much real knowledge of the true cause of disease as he does of the theory of evolution he would not have been caught erecting a proof of evolution on this flimsy foundation. It has never been proven that a single disease is due to germs. A theory of prevention and cure based upon the theory &lt;. that they do has proven an abject failure. However, this much has been definitely established: Whatever part germs may have in the production of disease, germs alone can no more produce disease than gas alone can produce fire. Just as gas must be united with oxygen before fire is produced, so germs (if they are real factors in disease production) must come in contact with “suitable soil'* in the organism. If this were not true, health would be impossible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Bacteria or germs were evidently created, as there are no lower forms from which they could</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Xunun M. 1*M</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">have evolved. Nor could they have ever been much simpler in structure than they now are, and survived. But they were not created as disease germs, and are not disease germs. Their office is that of returning dead organic matter to the inorganic state. They are scavengers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Germs cannot live in pure water, which is devoid of all organic matter. Neither can they live in pure blood, which is deprived of all mor* bid matter. This fact alone should lead the । “noted zoologist&quot; to see the fallacy of his assumption. Before the germ theory of disease can be used to substantiate the descent theory, it is first necessary to prove the germ theory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">But if germs do cause disease and if evolution is a fact, these tiny creatures change with infinite slowness. Tuberculosis, pneumonia and typhoid fever present the same symptoms as described for them by Hippocrates over three thousand years ago. Considering the rapidity with which germs multiply, and the billions of generations they have passed through daring this period, one would think they should have evolved into something else long ere this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">A few words now about his second assumption, which is an exceedingly childish one. Why does he assume that Adam must have had all </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">ot </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">these diseases when he Enows very well that every one now living does not have them! Among the diseases he mentions, measles, whooping cough and mumps are the only ones the writer has had; and he has no intention of having any of the others. Neither have I ever been afflicted with any of the worms and bugs he mentions. What is more, I know that Adam and I are not in a class by ourselves in this respect. I do not live in China, yet I have not been carried off by any of those diseases that are survived only in China.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">in my opinion Adam never had a boil on Ms nose, and it is my guess that he did not have a cancer in his reasoning faculties that would have led him to talk as this doctor does. Probably the doctor would have us think that Adam died of the “Blade Death,&quot; although he does not say so. His “challenge&quot; amounts to nothing more than a farce, and his so-called deductions are but “east wind.&quot; No doubt he, like other evolutionists, is ready to call all who refuse to swallow such mental excrement “ignorant, narrow-minded, unprogressive,” etc These men are guilty of all the abuses of which they accuse those who oppose their theory; but none are so Hind as those who can see but irH not.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark28"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark52"></a>Psychic Phenomena Explained</span></h3>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">S</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">PIRIT messages are quite plentiful which purport to give “he human family superior wisdom from the so-called spirit world. Miss Winifred. Graham, an English psychic, has written a book, “My Letters from Heaven,” in which she gives credit to the spirits for the entire contents, claiming that the thoughts were never consciously hers. The spirits have informed her that there is no hell, but that there is a heaven in which God dwells.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">We think that the devil and his angels (the spirits) are responsible for foisting upon the creed-ridden world the doctrine of eternal torment; that Dante’s “Inferno” and Dore’s pictures illustrating it, and the messages from heaven received by Miss Graham, are all from the same source. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The basis for all these theories lies in the fact that Satan disputed the word of God in the garden of Eden. When the Creator told our first parents that the penalty for disobedience is death, the adversary, operating through the serpent either by actions or by giving it voice as Balaam’s ass was made to speak, contrar dicted the Almighty in these words: “Ye shall not surely die.” (Genesis 3:4) In other words, the devil said that God was a liar when He said that anybody would or could die.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Jesus, God’s acknowledged Son and the founder of the Christian religion, referring to unbelieving, self-righteous, hypocritical people said: “Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it.”—John 8:44.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">All liars and self-willed, false religionists are privileged to claim for their parentage, in the matter of their .thinking, the devil; for he it is that injects the thoughts into the minds of them who believe not St. John again says that the whole world lieth in the wicked one—the deviL</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The Bible is very plain on the subject of death. Because of sin, death passed upon the race. Man dies, and becomes extinct in death. He is as though he were not &quot;The dead know not anything.” A man dies, &quot;his breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; in that very day his thoughts perish.” &quot;The soul that sin-neth, it shall die.&quot; “All have sinned, and come short of the glory of God.”—Ecclesiastes 9:5; Psalm 146:4; Ezekiel 18:4; Bomans 3:23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The Bible is consistent with the thought that “whatsoever thy hand findeth to do [while you nre alive], do it with thy might; for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave [sheol, hell], whither thou &quot;goest”—Eclesiastes 9:10. ,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The doctrine of eternal torment has done more to break down the morale of the world than any other one thing, for the reason that it has done more to discourage humanity than anything else. People found themselves beset with weaknesses and unable to do perfectly the things they would like to do. A lake of fire stared.them in the face.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">In despair they often gave up; and growing careless drifted with the tide, or becoming desperate, they said: &quot;If I am going to hell I will see to it that I deserve it” Therefore they bridled their consciences and went the limit</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Or, being too conscientious to do this they have made excuses for themselves, justified themselves, and lowered the standard of Christian deportment, believing that thus at death they should be rewarded with an eternal inheritance with the saints in glory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">World Not Now Offered Salvation</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">TTTHAT people need to see. is that the world ’ ’ is not now offered salvation. Salvation comes with the second coming of Jesus. His first coming was to provide the ransom-price so that the world could be turned over to him by the Father, whose law had been violated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The scripture which says: &quot;Now is the day of salvation&quot; (2 Corinthians 6:2), is a mistranslation. We notice first that it is part of a parenthetical statement. It is quoted from Isaiah 49:8, which reads: “Thus saith the Lord, In </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">an</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> acceptable time have I heard thee, and in </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> day of salvation have I helped thee.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The context shows clearly (verse 7) that a Holy One, despised of men (the Lord Jesus— Isaiah 53:3), should arise and bring the promised salvation; that kings (the Church, chosen <sub>s </sub>during the Gospel age) shall see and arise; . that princes (other holy men, chosen before the , Christian era) also shall worship (when they &gt;&nbsp;are raised from the dead—Hebrews 11:39,40); ; for the Lord God is faithful.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The Gospel age has been set apart for the. ; gathering of the spiritual seed of Abraham, of which Jesus is chief, and the Church is the under-priesthood. (1 Peter 2:9); and it has proven to be </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> day of salvation for the Church; , for the judgment begins with the house of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Now notice what the rest of Isaiah 49:8 says: &quot;I will preserve thee [Christ Jesus and His Church, as a composite body—1 Corinthians 12:12], and give thee for a covenant of the people [the world at large]<sub>v</sub>to establish the earth [in truth and righteousness], to cause [the people] to inherit the desolate heritages [the Edenic earthly promised blessings, but not yet realized]; (verse 9) that thou [the composite Christ] mayest say to the prisoners [all in ' the graves—John 5:28], Go forth; to them that are in darkness [the millions living at the time the kingdom is put into operation], Show yourselves. They [the world of mankind] shall feed., [get the truth of God] in the ways [Isaiah? 35:8], and their pastures [feeding places] shall &gt;&nbsp;be in all high places [where light and truth and heavenly wisdom will be dispensed with lavish . hand].” ■</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Moses was given for a covenant, a mediator , of the Law covenant, for fleshly Israel’s benefit. Just so, God has been raising up a greater than Moses (Acts 3:22) for the purpose of giving to the world of mankind the Mediator of the New Law covenant And when this becomes operative, the law of God will be written in the hearts of the people so that it shall no longer . be necessary for a man to say to his neighbor;. or to his brother, “Know the Lord”; for all' shall know </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">Him</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> from the least of them even to the greatest—Hebrews 8:8-13. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">This arrangement of the Almighty does not mean that a person can be as evil as he can be, and get away with it without punishment &quot;Whatsoever a man soweth, that shall<sub>f</sub>he also reap.” But this arrangement encourages everyone who knows of it to do well; they become hopeful; they see that salvation is on the way; they show their gratitude by living better lives; ; they want to come forth in the resurrection on</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">as</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> high a plane of mentality and morality as possible.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">B</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">UT nothing like this is designed of God to encourage anyone who believes the diabolical doctrines of devils, that God has fueled up a furnace called hell, and that all the wicked are to roast in it forever. Preaching the badness of God never got a person into the kingdom class; Tut preaching God as He is, proclaiming His goodness, will do wonders.—Bomans 2:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“If I believed in that dread place</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Where billions writhe in pain, - <sup>f </sup>In untold agonies of woe, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">As the plan of God begins to dawn upon the mind, the doctrines of demons begin to flee away. What interest could there be in the demons, the “spirits,” proclaiming the truth on this subject: t&amp;t there is no hell—of torment? The “lake of fire and brimstone&quot; theory has been painted in such black colors, its unreasonableness and unscripturalness shown so long by Bible Students, that no one takes it seriously any more; and to attract attention and be listened to the demons must no longer proclaim anything so unpopular as hell-fire and eternal torment for the wicked.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">So to lead the unwary they once in a while tell the truth, as they did in the days of Jesus. But their truths are only half truths; they do not go ahead and explain that “hell&quot; is an English word use to translate </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">sheol</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">hades,</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> and that the true meaning of these words is the death condition, and cannot refer to a place. So the demons have sinister motives; they attract by the magnetism of their voices, and through curiosity, to receiving information from forbidden sources, and usually in the dark and under cover.—Isaiah 8:19,20; 19:3; Deuteronomy 18:9-12; Leviticus 20:27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">A Heaven</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> a </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Vacuum?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">HE heaven which Miss Graham describes is a wonderful place, where disembodied spirits, fairer than mortal mind can conceive, roam at will, untroubled by considerations of money, time or weather. We suppose the spirits which she saw are the same that the Methodist bishop described as being “without body, shape, or parts; without exterior and without interior* and a million could be put into a nutshell.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The Bible gives ample proof that there is no such thing as intelligence- without a body. Humanity cannot think without a body. God Himself has a body—a spirit body; it is an </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">organism,</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> of the divine nature. That spirit beings are invisible to the human eye means nothing; electrons and atoms are invisible to the naked eye; we do not see the cells in our skim The vibratory rate of certain colors is so great that they are invisible to the human eye.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">St Peter claims that the Church will have the divine nature in the resurrection, and St. John tells us that just what we shall be in the resurrection is not comprehended by us now. Ue says: “It doth not yet appear what we shall be [in the resurrection]: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is.&quot; (1 John 3:2) And Paul says that Christ is now “the express image of his [the Father's] person.&quot;—Hebrews 1:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Another item of superwisdom doled off by the psychic from the demon spirits is that while we are asleep the spirit world has a far greater opportunity of controlling the subconscious mind. “Happy marriages,” she says, “are generally the result of some previous spirit communication between the souls of persons on earth before their bodies meet. This accounts for the strange feeling that lovers have of knowing each other so well in a short time.” *</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Perhaps the error in the above is the assumption that the subconscious mind is something separate and distinct from the person himself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">and that when asleep the subconscious mind rambles and roams until it meets another subconscious mind, and finally it finds one that is congenial. Then, when the bodies of those two congenial subconscious minds meet there is love at first sight!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">We have brains; we have spinal coI</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">nnin</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a; we have a network of nerves. The law of our nature is that the nerves through the senses constitute an elaborate and intricate channel of communication between every part of the body and the brain by way of the spinal cord. God made the heart and liver and stomach and kidneys to function without thought The blood flows, and the different glands perform their work without our thinking about it It is the involuntary functioning of certain parts of our bodies that were made that way by God. And we may rest assured that if our bodies die, as for instance, when the lungs cease to function, the subconscious mind, which is dependent upon the nerves and brain and backbone of the individual, is also dead—if there is such a thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Spirit </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Phenomena Explained</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">W</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">E WOULD be at a loss to explain &quot;spirit phenomena&quot; were it not for the Bible. There we are informed that the &quot;spirits'* are really spirit beings (not the spirits, souls, or subconscious minds of humans)—spirit beings which have minds and bodies'suitable to their nature; that these were once in harmony with God, but that prior to the flood of Noah's day they used their power to materialize and have direct communion with human beings, corrupting them and turning the world into wickedness. The spirit-materialized fathers and the human mothers produced a hybrid race; and the flood came to destroy this mongrel, unauthorized race of people.—Genesis 6:1-6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">At the flood the hybrid progeny of the &quot;angels which kept not their first estate&quot; perished, but the angels (now bad and known as demons) dematerialized to save themselves from destruction and were again spirit beings. On account of being out of harmony with the law of God they were restrained in our atmosphere and not permitted to enjoy the privileges of the universe as before.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">. St Peter says: &quot;God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast them down to hell [Greek, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">tariarus; ow</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> atmosphere—not hell], and deliv-</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Banounr, JT. &amp;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ered them into chains of darkness [confined them in environments where learning wisdom from God would be an impossibility], to be reserved unto judgment” (2 Peter 2:4) The final deciaion respecting these fallen angels has not been determined; these are the ones who are to ba judged by the glorified Church. (1 Corinthians 6:3) No doubt some of them will turn to righteousness, while many will be destroyed with the devil and his* angels.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">But the point is, that these fallen angels are-now in our atmosphere. They are at the bottom of all spiritism, stances, fortune-telling, telepathy, clairvoyance, and all spirit communication at the present time. They are at the bottom of solar biology, astrology, occultism, and mediumistic phenomena. They are at the bottom of every God-dishonoring creed and belief foolish theory, and superstition. They are in league with and promoters of all dishonesty, unchastity, lust, and crime. Their amusement is playing horse with the human family; and the brainier their dupes the greater are their sportive festivals. -</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">When Satan is bound for a thousand years, all evil shall be restrained. Then the fallen ” angels will not be permitted to peep or mutter;' and then those who have been used as mediums to communicate and write books, those who have filled their minds with the dynamic forces of spiritualism, will find their minds as empty as wash-boilers and bass drums.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">But the fountain of truth will then be opened for the infilling and blessing of all' peoples; and then people will come to know God and praise Him for His wonderful works to the children of men. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Men will find themselves in the resurrection on earth, not in heaven; on terra firms, and not in any &quot;spirit world”; they will be eating pot*&quot; toes and cabbage, and not angel food; they may be sailing around in a flying machine, but certainly not with wings; they will find the earth an extremely delightful place on which to live, and so enjoy it that they will wish to live here forever; and they will thank God with their whole hearts when they find that that is exactly what He has provided for them—when life and liberty and happiness are opened up for them by an all-wise God, brought about through the redemption of Jesus Christ and in His glorious kingdom.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">* “<sup>T</sup>We may be sure that these faithful, holy angels, as God's instruments, were carefully watching every step of Jesus from the time of His birth up to the moment of His resurrection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">&gt; With eagerness they would watch and wait to See if Jesus fully met all the requirements of God's law. They evidently knew that His full compliance would meet with the marvelous reward of a resurrection from the dead. It was one of these faithful messengers that the Lord sent from heaven to roll back the stone from the door of the tomb at the resurrection of the Master. What great joy must have filled the heavenly courts now when they beheld Jesus, by the power of God, triumphant over death and the grave! &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“•Lucifer, who became Satan, who had once been associated with the holy angels and who had seduced some of their fellow angels, had for ' ^centuries opposed Jehovah and specially tried t&lt; destroy Jesus. Jesus had been sent into the .world that He might destroy the works of &lt;&nbsp;Satan; and now, having been raised from the 'dead, He would ultimately &quot;destroy him that had •? the power of death, that is, the devil,&quot; which de; ftruction would guarantee the deEverance of the - human race. (Hebrews 2:14) Now Jesus had /broken the bonds of death, being raised by</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Jehovah to power and glory, demonstrating the * fact that He was fully approved by Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">He now proved that He was worthy to be praised; and without question He received the unlimited praise of all the heavenly host. The Revelator says: &quot;And I beheld, and I heard the v$ice of many angels round about the throne and the beasts and the elders: and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands; saying with a loud voice, Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honor, and glory, and blessing.&quot;— Revelation 5:11,12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“•It was not their previous knowledge of the Scriptures and their faith in them that Christ Jesus would arise from the dead which induced the disciples to believe that He was risen, but it was what they actually saw and experienced that led them to this conclusion. The knowledge’ gained by experience, coupled with the knowledge of the Scriptures subsequently acquired by them, not only established beyond a doubt in their own mindsy the resurrection of thq Lord Jesus, but emboldened them to declare the message on every opportune occasion to others and to emphasize this great doctrine of truth in their epistles to the church.</span></p>

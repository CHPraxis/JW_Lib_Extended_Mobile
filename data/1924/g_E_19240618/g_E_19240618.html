<h4><a name="bookmark34"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark35"></a>Modem “Medicine Men”</span></h4>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">HROUGHOUT the least civilized parts of Asia, Africa, and </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">Am</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">erica the untutored savage, ailing in body or mind, applies to the “medicine man” of his tribe for relief. The “medicine man” obtains what help he can from the demons to whose control he has surrendered himself. That is all there is to modern faith healing, faith cures, miraculous cures, and everything of the sort, except in so far as the mind of the patient may and does have an effect upon his body.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The cotton-saint scheme of the Holy Russian Greek Orthodox Church, exposed hitherto in these columns, was a crude piece of work as compared with the 'more subtle, intangible “faith” system of separating people from their money such as is now, and has for centuries, been worked by the Holy Roman Catholic Church in connection with various shrines like, for example, that of the Basilica of Our Lady of Lourdes, in southern France.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">. Our explanation of the apparition claiming to be the Immaculate Conception, which appeared to Bernadette Soubirous on February 11,1858, telling her to drink of the spring which is now enclosed within the Basilica, is simply that Bernadette was deceived by a demon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Revelation 18:2 says of Mystical Babylon the Great, that it is “the habitation of devils, and the hold of every foul spirit”; and we adhere to the principle of Biblical interpretation which applies this primarily to the Roman Catholic - Church and secondarily to the Protestant daughters. Lourdes claims first honors- in the number of “Holy Candles” sold annually.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Just after the war everything French was much sought after; and the Lourdes shrine did a large business, though with very little advantage to anybody except to those who were in the candle end of the trade. In 1923, in the month of May, 850 Britishers went all the way to Lourdes, hoping for some improvement in their condition, only to return disappointed. And later, in September, 1923, according to the London </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Herald,</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> more than half that number again took the trip, only to come back disap* pointed, none of them having been cured.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">It would seem that if Our Lady of Lourdes had any favors to bestow, she ought to be very impartial about it Why discriminate against -the British? Were they not the mainstay of Catholic France during the war against Protestant Germany! If it had not been for Protestant Britain and Protestant America, we may be sure that Protestant Germany would have (most unwisely) turned Catholic France into a German colony.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Nature of the “Cures”</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">HE only cures performed at Lourdes are of a mental sort; such as that of a cripple on his way there who was slowly hobbling across a track. He suddenly saw a railroad train bearing rapidly down upon him, and in dismay dropped his crutches and raced to safety. He was well from that moment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">One does not have to go to Lourdes to find cases of this kind, however. An officer in the Indian army was confined to his bed by asthma, and could breathe only in an erect position. </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">party of Maharattas broke into the camp; and, fearing death, he sprang out with amazing activity, mounted his horse and used his sword with great execution, though the day before he could not draw it from the scabbard.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Another instance is told by the London </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Daily Man</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> of a performance being given before </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">company of wounded soldiers at a hospital in Bristol. A feature of the performance was </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">mirth-provoking lawyer, who gave an extremely; laughable sketch. Among those that joined in the merriment was a soldier who had been rendered deaf and dumb during the fighting in Flanders. The contagion of witnessing the mirth of those about him suddenly caused this man to regain his speech and hearing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Despite the fact that the Lourdes shrine is a palpable fraud, Europe and America have many such, where the unfortunates go, and either are given temporary relief by the demons, or else in a moment of mental exhilaration throw away their crutches only to buy new ones when they get home, or else they are lifted out of what was in the first place only a mental condition, or else they get no relief at all. The majority are of the latter kind. There are such shrines at Montreal; St Anne, Illinois; and Holywell, England.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">It seems that most of this healing business is done by Saint Anne, the mother of the Virgin Mary. How anybody knew that her name was Anne, when the Bible fails to mention it, is one of those “mysteries” which help to keep the religion business afloat; </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">i. e.,</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> the regular paid religion trade. But the Bible does mention Ananias.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The New York </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">World</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> tells us that on a July day in 1921 it took four priests all day to apply a relic of St. Anne to the afflicted bodies of thousands who came to the church of St. Jean Baptiste, Lexington Ave. and 76th Street, New York city. Without a doubt the bbne that was applied was a chicken leg or an old soup bone; and when the performance was all over, the priests had an uproarious laugh behind the scenes over the whole farce.'</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Shrine of St Come</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">W</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">E MIGHT as well call Cone, the French druggist, a saint as any of these other modern faith curists; for he uses the same methods. But Cone admits that he got his start by spending thirty francs for an American book on hypnotism, which latter is simply devil worship, nothing more nor less.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Coue visited England and America in 1922 and 1923; and the world went wild over him, because he invented a formula by which people could supposedly mesmerize themselves and thus call the demons to their aid by repeating over and over again, &quot;Every day, in every way, I am getting better and better.” If not satisfied to retain control of your own personality, and wishing to let unclean spirits dominate your being, all you have to do is to repeat this or something else designed by the same evil beings for their own delectation, as will be shown presently.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Coue was able to mesmerize whole crowds at once. Evidently this is a favorite method by which the demons perpetrate error. They are not interested in- getting a solitary convert now and then. What they want is to get the crowd all on their side, as they did during the war. Who was on the Lord’s side then? Who.was on the side of the demons?—Revelation 16:13,14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Coue puts our Lord down to the low level of a common mesmerist, a panderer to the demons, in the folio-wing language: “My plan is quite simple. It is just the same as Christ’s. Christ possessed the gift of planting tremendous faith in sick people. When He said, ’Arise, you are cured,’ the patient was cured because he believed what Christ told him.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Everybody who has read the Gospels knows that this statement is untrue. Christ would not even let the demons testify in His own favor. When they said</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">: “We</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> know thee who thou art, the Holy One of God,” He commanded them to be silent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">As showing the identity of Cone’s methods with those used for centuries by the Boman Catholic Church, and by the heathen medicine men in all countries, from the Ganges and the Congo to the Colorado and Amazon, the New York </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> reports that Coue “had given up reciting his day-by-day formula, and he admitted that </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">as long as the proper mental state is maintained the Litany of the Saints or any other litany would work just as well.&quot;</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> Does not this statment of St Coue show why the Boman Catholic Church keeps its adherents continually reciting litanies?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">But although Coue gets his powers from the cooperation of the demons, and although visits to fifteen of his patients, upon whom he had' laid his hands, showed that his treatment grew less and less efficacious with his absence, yet Doctor Beisner, pastor of the Chelsea Methodist Episcopal Church of New York city, says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“Mr Cone has put before us a wonderful system. Without religion his sjs’em is like a motor with no electric power in it But the Church may make his system a great channel of power for helping humanity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Jon IS, 192* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">TU </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;">QOlDEN</span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;"> AGE</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;W</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">... It is a great mistake for ministers and churches to attack Mr. Coue. He has exalted God by enforcing the marvelous gifts with which the Creator has endowed men. It is well that he has not tied his system to any special religious cult or sect, but leaves it open for wise religious leaders to appropriate the truths he has uncovered by showing how religion can be related to these truths.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">This statement shows how readily some of these professional collection-basket passers are to endorse anything that looks as if it might bring them an occasional nickeL</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Shrine of St Cudney .</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">M</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">AYBE it is incongruous to refer to an old houseboat on the Mississippi as a shrine; but the boat where John Cudney lived when he was at New Orleans in the spring of 1920 is as much of a shrine as any of the rest, and in the same sense.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">John called himself “Brother Isaiah” for the same reason that some others call themselves “Father” and “Reverend.” It helped to give an air of piety and mystery, and was good advertising. It brought the crowds, scores of ailing and crippled men and women, in such uncontrol-able numbers that five policemen who endeavored to keep them in line were swept off their feet and pushed into the Mississippi river. They were easily dragged out, however.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Cudney’s description of how he came by his powers shows that he is under the control of demons. He declared that the sand upon which he walked became “sacred ground,” like the “holy ground” of a Roman Catholic cemetery; that it then possessed wonderful curative powers; and that when some of it was sprinkled over a worthless oyster-bed the bed became the finest in the south.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">St. Cudney had the same ability as St. Coue to mesmerize whole crowds at once. One of his favorite stunts, as reported by the Jacksonville </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Times-Union,</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> was to change the color of the sun, at will, to suit the whims of the crowd. As a matter of fact, the color of the sun remained the same all the time. The color changes, produced by the demons, were purely in the minds of the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Cudney worked all the tricks of those who are in league with the demons. He could tell at once the names of his visitors, what they had concealed about their persons, and what their-ailments were. All this is as old as demonism itself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">A careful census was taken after Cudney left New Orleans, with the result that not a single real cure could be found. Yet while he was in town the crowds became so great that the newspapers had to print a notice requesting that no more sufferers come; for the crowds had become so large that they could not be handled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Referring directly to Cudney the Columbus </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Evening Dispatch</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> very wisely and very truth* fully observed:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">“All over the world are shrines to which people used to make pilgrimages to be cured of disease; in every age have appeared these healers; always there is a rumored place or person that has mysterious powers of healing. But time reveals the fact that there was really nothing in it The healers pass away after a brief reign, and it is seen that they did not really heal at all.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">About the same date another editor, not so wise, published the following as the opinion of the world’s most unreasonable and most foolish men: “Clergymen almost without exception, agree that ‘Brother Isaiah’s’ work has done good.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Shrine of St Hickson</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">HE Episcopal Church has gone wild over James Moore Hickson, who has been circumnavigating the globe during the last four years, leaving behind him the greatest number of disappointed sufferers that have ever followed in the wake of a modern “medicine man.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Hickson began his work of healing at fourteen years of age, when he cured a neighbor’s child of neuralgia; at least so the story goes. If he healed the child at all, it is our conviction that he did so by the power of mental suggestion; and those powers are conveyed from one person to another by demons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">In 1919 Hickson was in New York city. He was endorsed by Bishop Manning; but that means nothing. He claimed to be an instrument of Christ. That means nothing. In one </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">mail</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> we have had letters from as many as three persons, each of whom claimed to be Christ himself. We sent copies of the letters around to each of the three, and asked them to straighten the matter out among themselves. They must have had a nice time adjusting things. We never heard from them afterwards. • &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- <sup>J</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">St. Hickson says that he has ‘‘found children the easiest to work upon because their minds are absolutely open.” That gives the whole scheme dead away. Moreover, when the most absolute faith has been shown by a child, as was done by a little cripple at Pasadena, California, February 14, 1920, nothing but disappointment resulted. ,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The poor little fellow, with his legs pitifully twisted and his body undersized and undeveloped, was brought out of the church; and his high childish voice was heard asking to be taken out to the grass where he would “walk alone and surprise everybody.” He made the attempt and fell in a heap. If Christ were back of St. Hickson, where was He then? The answer is that Hickson is mistaken. Christ has nothing to do with it, even if the board of Bishops of the Episcopal Church did endorse the movement. The Board is wrong, as it usually is.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Three months later the Baltimore </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Netvs</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> said: “A sincere effort was made to find some absolute cures resulting from the healing service, but nothing could be discovered that could not be laid at the doors of hypnotism or sudden emotional exaltation and belief.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">That Hickson’s power is the same as that of Coue’s, namely hypnotism, is plainly evident from the following description of a Hickson mission service published in the Cleveland </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">News-Leader.</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> The writer does not mention hypnotism, but gives all the symptoms:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;I attended one of the sessions of Hickson’s Mission of Healing. I was not in the church five minutes when I felt myself to be in a most inflamed, abnormal, exalted state. I did not seem to be myself. The sight of the misshapen, the miserable, about me strained my emotions to the bursting-point. I found that I could use my rational faculty only with considerable exertion. I ▼as in a mood tb believe almost anything. If a crutch had risen before my eyes and danced, I would not have thought it strange. I was immersed in the supernatural. I felt I could do something extraordinary if I were called upon to do it. I felt an overwhelming yearning for God to come down in healing upon this tragic and stricken multitude. I cared not how He healed, whether by hands or feet, by straw or star, so long as He lifted the heads of those poor, paralytic infants, so long as He stilled the cry of those demented souls! I stood it for an hour, and could stand it no longer. I must leave or burst. I left?'</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">j From a journal published in Melbourne we cite the following regarding Hickson’s work in that city:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“Hickson, the healer, passes. In his world-wide tour there is no continuing city. About fifty cases of benefit are claimed in Melbourne. The church authorities pay no heed to the unuttered reflections of the 3,000 sufferers whose pilgrimage of pain to St. Paul’s Cathedral has led them into a pit of despair blacker than the night from which they emerged towards this newly-lit lamp of healing, which the Anglican Church lately discovered among the possessions it had thought to be lost. A young priest approaches a group and, in a voice of authority, asks them to desist from doing something— one does not hear what—as it may disturb this ‘atmosphere.’ It is apparent that the atmosphere plays a very important part in the proceedings. His appearance [Hickson’s] indicates phenomenal strength and animal magnetism, but no trace of spirituality.” •</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">One more newspaper clipping regarding St. Hickson, this time from the </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">People’s Pulpit,</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> an I. B. S. A. newspaper published in Australia; and we pass on to other members of the modern “medicine men” fraternity. There is a great deal of food for thought in what the </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">People's Pulpit</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> has to say:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“Without in any way impugning the honesty of heart or the sincerity of purpose of the gentleman who is the center of the healing mission, we do not hesitate to describe the whole movement as a carefully stage-managed endeavor on the part of the Anglican System to restore a fast waning prestige, to attempt to hide by magical performances the absurdity of its doctrinal errors, and to secure at all hazards some semblance of Divine (?) authority for-its preposterous claim to be jthe authorized custodian of Divine truth and mercy. To our certain knowledge, Mr. Hickson laid hands upon thirteen sufferers in the vicinity of Melbourne, none of whom were cured, and six of whom died before the healer left the city. Contrast this with the record of Jesus. (Matthew 4: 23, 24) ‘And Jesus went about aS Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> manner of sickness, and </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> manner of disease among the people. And his fame went throughout </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> Syria: and they brought unto him </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> sick people . . . and he healed them.’ No ninety percent disappointed there. But even if Mr. Hickson were able to heal all who came to him, that would not identify him as a man used of God. In the article referred to above we read: ‘Mr. Hickson points back to the early church, which accepted whole and entire Christ’s commission to preach the Gospel and to heal the sick, as the pattern for the church of today’; and in proof of this statement Maric 16:15-18 is quoted. • But that gentleman ought to know, and his clerical</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">confreres certainly do know, that the 16th chapter of Mark from verse 9 is spurious. If it be accepted that the power to Hay hands on the sick and they shall recover’ is truly a 'sign of belief’, then it would set the seal of Divine approval upon Spiritualists and Christian Scientists, whom Mr. Hickson has the presumption to describe as guides to 'blind alleys and fool’s paradises’, as well as to various heathen healers who are not Christian at all.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Shrines of Miscellaneous Saints</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">M</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">rs. Annie Semple McPherson has been in the healing business in California. There is nothing more to be said for her than can be said for any of the others cited. The methods are the same. A three weeks’ investigation of supposed cures at Fresno resulted in the discovery of twelve cases of insanity and domestic strife following her mission there, but no cures. How does this come about if she is the special instrument of the Lord, as she thinks! Mrs. McPherson herself lays the source of her healing power open to suspicion when she claims no miraculous power; for Christ and the apostles did claim it. Mrs. McPherson makes her healings dependent upon conversion (submission of the will to the healer), while Christ and the apostles sought no such mesmeric advantage. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Dr. Charles S. Price, Vancouver, British Columbia, is another healer who has been attracting much attention. But a committee that investigated the basis for the excitement that his meetings have aroused there found that not one miracle of healing had been performed and that no organic lesion or defect had been helped. The only successes were in cases of functional or hysterical disturbances, such as the demons would be able to assist by influence on the mind. Another plain case of hypnotism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Another modern medicine man is Mr. Smith Wigglesworth, who has been plying his trade in New Zealand. An account of this man’s life shows that he has been under the influence of evil spirits, who appeared before him, commissioning </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> for a </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">limi</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">ted time to heal the sick and demanding that his patients must all have implicit faith in the trinity, which, briefly stated, is that &quot;the Father is the Son of-himself, and the Son is the Father of himself, and [that] each of these is another person, who is the same as and yet different from the other two.” No real cures are traceable here, either, except of the kind last mentioned. '</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The Denver </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> tells us that the Denver District of the Methodist Episcopal Church has formally approved faith healing, and has urged all ministers to “make this subject an integral part of their ministry.” We foresee a big boom in correspondence courses in hypnotism as a result. A San Francisco Rabbi is going in for the same thing. Just now Rev. Evangelist F. F. Bosworth advocates it also. Dogs travel in packs. See Isaiah 56:9-12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Porto Rico has a “healer” who, under the influence of the demons, is aroused from her trances with great difficulty. The Detroit </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">News </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">reports that a prominent faith healer has been ordered back to the asylum. They will all be there yet. A New York healer declares that he got his powers by a revelation that came to him from heaven in flaming letters. He will soon be in a padded cell, you may be sure. Lewiston,- Maine, has a three-year-old healer. What a crime I Why carry this study in demonism further!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">We close with a sane and sensible quotationi from the magazine </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Health Culture: -</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“Approximately eight persons out of ten recover from their illness naturally, regardless of whether they receive treatment or not The tendency of most diseases is toward recovery. One patient out </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">at</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> ten will </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">require </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">expert, scientific care by a trained physician in order to avoid premature visit to the undertaker’s. One sick individual out of ten is suffering from a disease the tendency of which is to progress toward a fatal termination, regardless of any and all kinds of treatment Thus it appears that quacks of all varieties can successfully treat eight out of ten patients. Doubtless one-half of the people who seek relief from ailments of all kind* are not the victims of any real disease; the trouble lies entirely above the eyes. They imagine themselves sick when they are not. Obviously, any procedure in which they have faith and confidence willjjive relief to such sufferers. These medical frauds are as old as ancient history. They vary only to suit the times and </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">whims </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">of the people. In the sixth century the powder obtained by scraping the tombstones </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">saints, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">when placed in </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">water or wine, was in great repute as </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a remedy. Eight </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">out of ten persons who partook of that concoction experienced relief. The same number would </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">have been </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">relieved without taking any treatment.&quot;</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">TF IT had not been for President Cooliage’s veto the life insurance companies would have been granted the bonus. That is to say, it was hoped by some that the soldiers would be granted a bonus; but instead, the bonus bill which the President vetoed provided that the insurance companies were to have the money until the soldiers were dead.* *</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">In the meantime, of course, the great financiers who use the funds of the insurance companies as they please would have continued to corner the necessities of life so that by the time the soldier was dead, and his widow had paid his debts, there would be nothing left of the bonus; and he would not get it after all</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Whoever was the apostle of big business that fixed up this plan so that the bonus would be paid by the American people, not to the soldiers who need it, but to the financiers who already have too much money, was a real 100 percent profit American. The President has done wisely in vetoing the bill.</span></p>

Four of these banks in New York city have total resources of $12,000,000, while the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers Cooperative National Bank of Cleveland, Ohio, has resources of approximately $25,000,000.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">nine billion dollars, At this rate, in about three years these profits would equal the great debt assumed by the American people for its privilege of participating in the war that made the world safe for democracy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Let us not look so closely at these profits that we forget profits made during the World War itself. An interesting item on this line has come to light in the testimony of an accountant of the Department of Justice, that one of the DuPont powder concerns was overpaid by the government at least $5,000,000 on war contracts. Who overpaid it, why they overpaid it, and how much they were paid for overpaying it is the affair of the Department of Justice, and not ours. It looks to us as if big business has the American people by the neck or by the heel; we are not sure which.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Within the past few years a number of instances have occurred in which men who have made fortunes out of their business have given the business away, lock, stock and barrel, to their old employes. Among the concerns that did this was a bleachery at Wappinger Falls, capitalized at $1,250,000; the Nash Clothing </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Company, Cincinnati;</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> the Herman Handkerchief factory, New York city; the Bubin Clothing factory, New York city; besides several other large concerns in New York and Chicago. This is a healthful sign. It indicates that there are a few people in the world who have some other god besides the almighty dollar.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The Standard Oil Company, and many othei corporations that have made fabulous fortunes for their founders, are now pursuing the very wise course of taking in their employes as stock holders. A certain percentage of the employe’s salary is set aside for his investment in stock The company adds to this a like amount, and in the end the employe’s investment usually yields him a large return.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The larger output of coal per miner in the United States over that of Europe is explained by the fact that in America the coal veins are thicker and more level than in Europe; and also by the fact that the American method of mining, which leaves one-third of the coal in the ground, enables the employment of more men at the coal face. By the method of mining in general use in Europe, all the coal is taken out of the mine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Not only is Europe more economical in respect to the fuel, but it is more economical with respect to the men employed, the deaths due to mine accidents being much less in proportion to the number of miners employed than in America. A part of the large loss of life among the miners of America is traceable to. the use of black -powder instead of other explosives which would be safer. One hundred and fourteen men have just perished in a mine explosion in the Benwood, West Virginia, mine. This explosion occurred early in the morning, only a few minutes after the men had gone to work.</span></p>

If this performance could be carried out with all the political crooks there are in America, there would be fewer office holders; and it would probably be necessary to make large additions to most of the prisons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">While public attention has been .largely centered upon Fall, Denby and Daugherty in the Republican capital because of their failure to protect the government’s interests in connection with the Teapot Dome, yet it is also pointed out that Lane, Gregory and McAdoo, all members of Wilson’s cabinet, as well as other Democratic officials of prominence, were given employment by the Doheny interests practically as soon as they were out of the cabinet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The country has been stirred from end to end by the Teapot Dome oil scandal; but this is only one theft out of a great family of other thefts of public wealth, about which little or ■nothing is ever said. The following is an extract from the Federal Land Law Office Report of 1914. It is significant that although these California frauds were unearthed by the government thirty-six years ago, no person was ever sent to prison for perjury or for theft of the millions of dollars worth of valuable timber referred to in the report. The following is -a copy of the report:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;A new agent was appointed, who reached his field of operation about the first of January last (1886) and entered upon the discharge of his duties.. The agents of the company soon discovered his presence and business and attempted to defeat the investigation. Some of the witnesses were spirited out of the country; others were threatened and intimidated; spies were employed to wateh and follow the agent and report the nansee of all</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">persona who conversed with or called upon him; and on one occasion two persons who were about to enter the agent’s room at his hotel for the purpose of conferring with him in reference to'the entries were knocked down and dragged away. Notwithstanding this, the agent proceeded with his investigation, and succeeded in obtaining a large amount of evidence. He found ninety of the entrymen, and procured their affidavits as to the frauds and the manner in which they were induced to make the applications and affidavits. This testimony embraced forty-seven of the patented cases. Several employes of the company gave sworn statements of their connection with the illegal transactions and of facta within their knowledge. Affidavits were also made by citizens of Eureka and other reliable persons, among which are the affidavits of sixteen business men, who were asked to make entry applications in the interest of the company and offered $50 each, but who declined to do so. It appears that the persons </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">composing </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">this company went to work systematically and on an extensive scale; and to enable them to carry through their scheme they took into their association several wealthy men, who furnished the necessary means. Expert surveyors and men well informed in regard to the character and value of the timber were employed to locate and survey the lands. Others were then hired to go upon the streets of Eureka and elsewhere and find - persons who could be induced to sign applications for land and transfer their interests to the company, a consideration of $50 being paid for each tract of 160 acres so secured. The company’s agent received $5 for </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">each </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">applicant obtained. No effort seems to have been made to keep the matter secret, and all classes of people </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">were </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">approached by agents and principals of the company and asked to sign applications. Sailors were caught while in port, and hurried into a saloon or to a certain notary public’s office and induced to sign applications and convey the lands to a member of the firm. Farmers were stopped on their way to their homes, and merchants were called from their counters and persuaded to allow their names to be used to obtain title to the lands. The company's agents presented the applications to the registrar and receiver in blocks of as many as twenty-five </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">at a </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">time, paid the fees; had the proper notices published; hired men to make the proofs; paid for the lands and received the duplicate receipts; yet the registrar and receiver and some of the special agents appear to have been the only persons in the vicinity who were ignorant of the frauds.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“Brewer sued after he had charged the department of justice with attempting to seize the evidence he had collected at the personal request of President Coolidge and the late President Harding. He said he had refused to surrender the documents to the department for fear they would be suppressed and he would be discredited.

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“Immediately after filing his suit, Brewer met a score of Progressive senators and congressmen and laid his charges before them. Representative King of Illinois, announced that he would intervene and become a party to the suit.&quot;</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Washington told freely that they had broken into Senator LaFollette’s office and desk, in absolute violation of the Constitution and in violation of all decency as well. What honest man can feel safe when anarchists wearing Government badges can safely violate the law in this manner?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Mr. Vanderlip has taken out a $1,000,000 accident policy because of interference with his mail, the tapping of his telephone wires, and the placing of dictaphones in his room. How much longer the American people can and will stand for such acts of anarchy on the part of the Government officials has become a serious question.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">During the Wilson administration a person who, when closely questioned, admitted that he had </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">&quot;previously&quot;</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> been employed as a detective by the Department of Justice, waited upon the Editor of The Golden Age with a silly scheme to entrap him into publishing some propaganda; and when told that he was easily identified as a detective, angrily informed the Editor that he might expect at any time to be lured to some place where he would be beaten into an unrecognizable pulp if he “made too much trouble for the government.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The Editor’s reply was merely to ask this gentleman in a kindly way please to define an anarchist and to state whether or not men who ■would undertake to beat a law-abiding citizen into pulp are law-abiding men or whether they are anarchists. He admitted rather shamefacedly that it is quite possible in our day for those who have no regard for law and order to occupy positions in which they are paid well for maintaining law and order. Surely this is a strange condition of affairs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Senator Borah, speaking in Washington on the growth of bureaucracy in the United States, takes a foreview of the next thirty years as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“If these next thirty years are to be as the last thirty years, as everything indicates they are, at the end of thirty years we shall have one employ^ or officer for every ten citizens in the Republic. Every conceivable activity of body and mind will be under the surveillance of the bureau. Spies and inspectors, guides and counselors, will leer upon the citizen from every corner, and accompany him in his daily vocation of life. Our taxes</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">TT IS pathetic, in one way, to learn how excited •* the administration at Washington became at the mere-suggestion that an honest and capable and fearless man, Francis J. Heney, had been suggested by Governor Pinchot as a man suitable to investigate the Treasury Department, especially the prohibition section of that department.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">It was openly admitted in the Senate that if the prohibition enforcement section of the Treasury Department was investigated by Heney, so much official crookedness would be uncovered that nobody would have a shred of respect for anything in the District of Columbia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">In the bright sunlight of Sunday afternoon, May 4, aviators in the chemical service of the United States army from a height of 700 feet laid a smoke screen around the lower part of New York city, completely hiding the city from view, and preventing the people on the lower part of the' island from being able to see more than a few hundred feet into the bay. It is expected that smoke screens of this nature will be of some assistance in protecting New York from immediate annihilation when the anticipated Battle of Armageddon occurs.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">R. Richard B. Moore, former chief chemist of the United States Bureau of Mines, declares that the bituminous coal mines of the United States, stretching from Texas to West Virginia, contain the only large supply of helium-bearing gas in the world. Helium is non-inflammable. An airship filled with helium gas could remain afloat years, and would virtually need to be torn in pieces before it could be brought to the ground. In the case of an airship filled with hydrogen, a small leak would be sufficient to cause an explosion that would utterly destroy it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">A most remarkable machine, exhibited in New York, April 25, at the annual convention of the American Newspaper Publishers Association, is one-half of one percent of error. One of the inventors, speaking of this typewriter, made the statement: “We are proud to have been privileged to work out this fascinating problem of transmitting the printed word through the air to a sheet of typewriter paper. To have suggested such a thing a short decade ago would have been to invite the services of an alienist.” The system has been in use for a full ^year between San Francisco and Los Angeles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">By the simple device of what is called in electrical circles “booster stations” it is now entirely possible for a single broadcasting station to send messages to every part of the world. The messages, as they are received and enter the booster stations, are inaudible but are audible at the regular receiving stations. The plan is already partly in effect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The courts have decided that a broadcasting station may broadcast a copyrighted piece of music without infringing the copyright. This decision, made in Cincinnati, will be appealed to the Supreme Court.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">John Hays Hammond, Jr., the radio inventor, claims to have discovered a method of broadcasting by which only persons having specially constructed licensed sets can hear the program.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Dr. Carl L. Alsberg, director of the Food Research Institute of Stanford University, in an address in Washington, April 23rd, expresses his opinion that recent chemical advances make it probable that human foods, proteins, fats, and starches may be manufactured synthetically:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“The solution of the world’s food and fuel problem will be the same. When it is achieved, a more profound social revolution must follow than followed the invention of the steam </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">engine, for the</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> importance of land and agriculture will diminish and it will remove to a far more distant horizon the bounds that now tend to limit the growth of population.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">DESPATCH from Syracuse states (hat students of the New York State College of Forestry, Syracuse University, are confident that they have discovered a means by which sawdust, old boxes, barrels, and odd pieces of boards, leaves, twigs, etc., can be transformed into new and valuable lumber.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">New York State will make a very sensible use of each of the six State schools of agriculture farms during the summer of 1924. Boys between the ages of thirteen and eighteen will be given practical instruction in every variety of farm work at small expense. Their afternoons and evenings will be devoted to recreation and sports.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">California is having an epidemic of foot-and-mouth disease. The states, one after another, are quarantining California products in the effort to prevent the spread of what is recognized as a very dangerous disease to cattle. New York State is among those that have issued such quarantine. Congress has voted $1,500,000 to fight the epidemic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The effort to confine the foot-and-mouth disease in California is being prosecuted vigorously. No eastbound automobiles from California can now enter the state of Arizona, but are leaving for the east through the state of Nevada. The method of disinfecting tourists who enter Imperial County, California, is to have them step into canvas bags, which are drawn up over the body and tied tightly around the neck. The arms and the hat are required to be inside the bag. For three minutes the person to be disinfected remains in the bag while a powerful vapor destroys the germs. The automobiles themselves are disinfected by pools of disinfectant built into the roadway. Imperial County is the center of the cantaloup district, and hopes by these strict regulations to be allowed to market its crop in the eastern states.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The first year of the cooperative marketing resulted in the sale of 33,510 cars of vegetables and fruits in 772 cities and town&amp;. This is a most extraordinary showing for one year’s work and demonstrates what can be accomplished by cooperation. It is estimated that the sales for 1924 will be at least twenty-five percent greater than the record for 1923.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The death rate from pneumonia in Pittsburgh is three and one-half times as great as the national average for this disease. It is supposed that this is partly due to the smoke and dust in the atmosphere, and partly to long hours, heavy work. and high temperatures in steel mills.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">America has a new disease, Mah Jong. Perhaps we might say that it has two Mah Jong diseases. During the past winter, millions of Americans learned something of the mysteries of this peculiar Chinese game. Immense numbers of Mah Jong sets are made and sold; and it is now discovered that in the manufacture of the little pieces the kind of lacquer used causes an eruption of the skin similar to that caused in the dying of furs and the manufacture of those peculiar forms of cosmetics used liberally in the United States to hide the natural beauty of cheeks and lips.</span></p>

<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">S</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">EVEN years after the Bible Students made their declaration against war and went to prison for it, the Pittsburgh Conference of the Methodist Church has urged the general conference of that church to declare for an unalterable opposition to the entire war system and to inform the government that hereafter the church can take no part in any' movement toward war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Bishop McConnell, of the Methodist Church of Pittsburgh, in a speech in Louisville, April 19th, advocating the adoption of the resolution said: “I don’t mind the man’s going to war, but I do object to trying to give that nasty, dirty, stinking business a halo of sanctity. You can’t get Christ into khaki, and prayers for success of the national arms are not a sweet odor before the Most High.” This is good; but it is seven years too late.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">On the other hand, seventy-four oat of eighty-two bishops of the Episcopal Church bitterly opposed a similar pledge urging that war is un-Christian, brutal, suicidal; that the Episcopal Church will never again sanction or participate in it, will not again allow its pulpits and classrooms to be used as recruiting stations, and will not again give financial or moral support to any war. In view of this stand on the part of the Episcopal bishops, it is practically certain that in the next war every one of them will be put into the front line trendies, including the eight who for the present are in bad company.</span></p>

<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">HE West Side Unitarian Church of New</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">York of which the Reverend C. F. Potter is the pastor, has accepted a bronze statue of a young man emerging from the form of a gorilla. One cannot but wonder what use such people can have for a Bible which declares in the very first chapter that “God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The evident intent of the Biblical statement is to draw attention to the fact that man is a direct design of the Creator, with similar mental powers of reason, memory, judgment and will, and moral qualities of justice, benevolence and love. The very lowest form of man has sixtyeight cubic indies of brain capacity, as against thirty-four cubic inches in the highest form of ape. The gap has never been bridged. The missing link -will never be found.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The following account of the “service” of unveiling the statue of the new god is taken from the New York </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Times:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">‘&quot;The Chrysalis’ was unvailed while Miss </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Graee </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Leslie, the church soloist, sang William Herbert </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Car</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">ruth’s evolutionary poem, ‘A Fire Mist </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">and a Planet,* </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">in which occurs the line:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“‘A jellyfish and a saurian were in a cave </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">where </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">cavemen dwelt’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“The statue, which is about twenty-eight inches high,-had been placed on a table on the church platform. It was heavily draped with blue silk. As the poem commenced Mr. Potter’s three young sons removed </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">draperies. The congregation was obviously stirred.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“At the morning service Mr. Potter had spoken on </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">‘Spiritual Significance </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Evolution.’ </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Continuing this </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">theme, he asserted that </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a new </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">religion was </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">about to </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">sweep the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">‘ ‘Theology and evolution are in conflict,’ </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">said Mr. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Potter. ‘One of them will perish. It won’t beevolution. In the Western and Southwestern universities .professors who teach evolution are expelled, but the new religion will wipe out these Fundamentalists. When I told Dr. John Roach Straton, my opponent in tonight’s debate at Carnegie Hall, of today’s unveiling, he said that it was a desecration of a holy place and that </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">‘the beast </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">was in the sanctuary at last.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“ ‘This church claims the distinction of being the </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">oily </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">church in the city openly to champion the doctrine of evolution.

<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">HE Canadian Government has made a protest to the United States Government, and very appropriately we think, respecting the diversion of water from Lake Michigan through the Chicago drainage canal into the Mississippi Valley. The protest points out that the Great Lakes are the common heritage of the United States and of Canada; and that the water which has already been diverted has appreciably injured the Sault Ste Marie, Welland and St.' Lawrence Canals, and the St. Lawrence River between Montreal and the Sea. The Canadian Government thinks it right that Chicago should adopt some more modern, scientific system of disposing of its sewerage.</span></p>

<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">P</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">resident Obregon, having formed the opinion that the recent attempt to overthrow the Mexican Government was caused by the activities of the Knights of Columbus, has ordered the doors of their lodge rooms throughout Mexico sealed, and has expelled the Papal Nuncio as what he terms “a pernicious foreigner.” The reason for this latter step is said to have been the effort on the part of the Nuncio to prevent the introduction of a public school system into Mexico.</span></p>

<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">I</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">T IS claimed that the northeastern part of Peru, lying on the head waters of the Amazon, is one of the world’s garden spots, with an ideal climate much like that of southern California, and would easily support 50,000,000 people, where at present there is only an average of about one native to each three square miles. Investigation made by representatives of a New York syndicate demonstrates that a railroad can be built over the Andes Mountains into this district at a cost of approximately $60,000,000. In this territory it is estimated that there are 500,000,000 tons of anthracite coal, and large quantities of iron, copper, gold, and other minerals. Grapes in this part of Peru mature twice a year, in July and December. Travelers who have visited it report that cotton here grows to the height of a small tree, yielding </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">annuall</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">y a ton to every two and a half acres;</span></p>

King George made a speech which was broadcast over the world and also was sent by cable around the world, the circuit via Canada, Australia, and South Africa back to London, requiring eighty seconds. The -speech was not generally heard well in most places in the earth, although it was picked up satisfactorily in Poughkeepsie, New York. The route by which the cable speech went around the earth was 31,500 miles long.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">King George is cutting down the British payroll. Hereafter there will be no Master of Music, a job which has been in existence for 250 years. It is also probable that the present poet laureate will be the last.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The scrapping of the British plan to spend $55,000,000 in the construction of a naval base at Singapore has had immediate and wholesome results in the proposal now made by President Coolidge for another world conference to consider still further the question of disarmament All good men will wish well for this disarmament conference, if it is held.</span></p>

The auction posters advertise the sale as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“Sagan is a complete independent principality, situated between Silesia and Brandenburg; area about 500 square miles; 65,000 inhabitants, capital city of 15,000; chateaux, gothic church, complete city hall with reception saloons, bronze statue of Frederick III; the river Bober with plenty of fish, and divers fields, forests, etc.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Those who are watching for the Lord’s hand in the control of earth’s affairs have noted with considerable interest that within the past five months, death has removed the three men who have by some been called the evil spirit of Germany. One of these was the head of the Reichsbank who, after the war, gave unlimited credit to Hugo Stinnes and other great manufacturers, and then allowed them to pay these immense loans with depreciated paper money. The second was Stinnes-himself; and the third was Helffrich, a bosom friend of the Kaiser, and perhaps the greatest enemy in Germany to the payment of reparations to France. It is quite likely that with these three men out of the way, the Dawes plan will be generally accepted; and that those who have hitherto been saying, “Peace, peace,” will then be saying, “Peace and safety,” which up until now they have been unable to say.</span></p>

<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">R</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">EPORTS from Austria show that the efforts of the German banks in Vienna and elsewhere to depress the French franc have resulted most disastrously to the banks of Vienna and also of Berlin, Hamburg, Amsterdam and Zurich. It is expected that all the smaller banks of Vienna will collapse, as the total loss through the franc speculation is supposed to have been in the neighborhood of $100,000,000.</span></p>

It. is easy for him to say this since the government of his country was seized by </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">the army. The army is really the ruler, and he is king only in name. Alfonso is said to be well pleased with the way the military dictatorship is working out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Once a year Alfonso has the job of washing and kissing the feet of six male beggars, and the queen has the same job with six beggar women. These beggars, carefully selected by the priest, are thoroughly disinfected for one full week before the ceremony. The water for the washing is poured from a golden pitcher, and the drying is done with a silken towel.</span></p>

<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">A</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">N INTERESTING item comes from the • Congo Free State, that on the appeal of a tribe of African natives the British Government surrendered control over their territory and allowed them to become joined to the Congo Free State, because they did not wish to be separated from other parts of their race living within the area controlled by Belgium. This is good news; for it shows an increasing disposition on the part of European governments to recognize the rights of others.</span></p>

We do not know upon what evidence this opinion of Mr. McAlister is based; but if his ideas are correct, this find will be of great interest to scientific men and students, especially Bible Students.</span></p>

<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">I</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">WAS pleased to learn that the International Bible Students Association had a Radio Station. It will do much good. It will broaden human intelligence, and educate us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The other day I listened in on an address by Dr. L. P. Jacks, D. D., of Manchester College, Oxford, England, on the safeguarding of our lives, interests, and souls. It was worth while!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">On the same day, an hour later, Dr. Charles R. Brown, of Yale College, addressed a luncheon meeting of the Chamber of Commerce, Boston, on business as a profession. He urged the use of the Golden Rule in business, and likened present conditions to those of the Roman Empire. He said that if better methods in the management of affairs were not adopted in our dealings with the world, the white civilization would fall and might entirely disappear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Already there is a war cloud upon the horizon; and while the President talks of peace and disarmament, our navy is to be moved to the Pacific. All authorities agree that another war will be worse than the World War. Few have any conception of what it may mean.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Just before the Armistice, Taube, of the German Air Service, recommended the use of worn-out aeroplanes as vehicles in which to carry heavy charges of explosives against an enemy. The world has recognized Taube as an eminently practical man; but at the time Germany had need of every plane that was capable of flying. But it is unbelievable that the idea has been forgotten.; and an article in a recent paper leads me to think that the Germans have developed it for defensive purposes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The United States Government has everything necessary to put Taube’s idea into practice. It in no way differs from torpedo warfare.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Germany has made wonderful progress in the development of the glider, and wonderful records have been made in other countries. The glider is a simple little invention, cheap in construction; and most boys understand the principle. Launched from an elevation, it will coast until it strikes the ground or other obstacle. If it has controls (and there are such controls available) it will follow the desired course.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Warships, fortifications, and heavy ordnance will soon be things of-the past; and no surface ship will be able to cross the ocean in wartime. Our submarines already carry aeroplanes; they can also carry gliders and explosives. It will be an easy matter for the plane to carry a glider to the required altitude and, from a point beyond the range of any gun on the ship, direct and control the flight.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">When the supply of explosives is exhausted it can return for more and, with its greater speed, overtake and harry the ship until it is no more. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The gliders and explosives may be carried in a Ford car or on an army truck. They may be launched from an elevation, or reach higher altitudes through the use of kites, aeroplanes, or balloons. It would be possible for a greatly inferior army to destroy New York city and its surrounding boroughs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Dr. Jacks asks: &quot;What are we doing to safeguard ourselves T”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">When war stalks through the land, when the church spire becomes a target under the claim of military necessity, when the alien property custodian sets an example and legalizes robbery, when murder is compulsory, and man becomes as an ox, have we any right to expect other conditions than we find in our great cities, where holdup men and criminals of every variety multiply and prosper?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">With Dr. Charles R. Brown, I believe that work is necessary and a blessing; and I believe that a man should be able to show that he is a useful member of society, if he is to encumber the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">In an earlier article, published in The Golden Age, such a form of attack was mentioned. Our large cities would be wonderful places to loot; and an enemy that was a jump or two ahead of us in preparedness would get the loot.</span></p>

<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">W</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">HAT a thrill of pleasant emotions the word &quot;excursion” arouses in the minds of many people, especially young people. How we anticipated the pleasure of an excursion days and weeks before the time for it arrives 1 And when it is all over, how the memories of it linger for months and years thereafter! *</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Why is it that an excursion takes such a hold on our minds T Day after day we move around in a certain narrow circle of duties, with which we become so thoroughly familiar that very few new and fresh ideas come to- us as a result of direct, personal observation. Taken from this narrow circle, we are met by sights and events that crowd in on us from all sides with such freshness and rapidity that we almost forget our familiar surroundings. An excursion always broadens our minds, refreshes them, and takes us out of our old ruts and our usual lines of thinking.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">No doubt many of you have often spoken of some special trip that you would like to take, if you only had time and money. I shall not try, however, to intensify your desire for the trip you may have in view; but let me take you with me on a far grander, sublimer, and more extended one, free of charge!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Let us use our imagination and suppose that a railroad extends from the earth, in a direct line through space, away off to the sun; that an excursion train, &lt;nanaged by us who hear this lecture tonight [the regular readers of The Golden Age], will run over this track; that the train will consist of the finest Pullman palace dining, and sleeping cars; that all of us shall have first-class, unlimited tickets; that we shall take along an </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">imme</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">nse stock of clothing and provisions of all kinds; and that we shall give orders to our engineers to run the train at the rate of forty miles an hour, day in and day out, thus going at the rate of our express trains that </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">rush across our continents,</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> and covering 960, or almost 1,000, miles per day. If we were content to go only around the Earth at this rate, our excursion would be at an end in twenty-six or twenty-seven days. But no; let us go to the Sun!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Who will go along on this wonderful excursion f We managers are all very broad-minded and large-hearted; so let us invite, nay persuade, every man, woman, and child in the United States to go along on tdis, tife grearfesv<sup>1</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">603</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">excursion ever undertaken by man. Our train load will consist then of 120,000,000 passengers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;AZZ </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Aboard&quot; for the Big Trip *</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">A</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">LL the arrangements for the excursion have ■ been perfected. The immense train stands in Chicago, waiting for the excursionists. It is n: 00 a. m. An order goes forth that seems to make the earth tremble to its very center: </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">&quot;Americans, one and all, assemble! Next train for the Moon, Venus, Mercury, and the Sun! All aboard!!&quot;</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> How they come I Afoot, on horseback, in Carriages, on bicycles and motor-cycles in automobiles, on steamers and trains, and even in balloons and flying-machines I They are rushing for the train. They come from the north; they roll in from the west; as a black cloud they come up from the south;.and in hosts they swarm in from the east! Every one is now aboard! Off we go!!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Let us not forget to wave good-bye to our neighbors in Canada. How the tears stand in their eyes as they think of the fact that they may never see us again!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Having gone one mile, one excursionist having died, we drop his body on the track as a mile-stone. At the end of a second mile, another one having died, we drop him also; and so at the end of every mile. But, of course, you are still with us I</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">As we leave the earth and get out into the thin air, it grows colder very rapidly. At the end of four or five hours, or at a distance of over 150 miles, we have gone beyond the atmosphere and have reached the cold, empty space, where the thermometer registers 200 degrees below zero. On with your woolens and furs! Stoke the fire, and allow your radiators to have full play! &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">On, on, we go, day after day; for there is no night for us, even though darkness be all around ns. </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Moon is</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> coming toward us from our right like an immense ball. But the astronomers of our party have carefully calculated our time of departure so that there will be no collision; and that the Earth, Moon, and Sun will be in a direct line with each other when we arrive near the Moon’s orbit, or path. In other words, we arrive at a time when there is an eclipse of the Sun, seen by those whom we have left behind </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">on o Af £sr&amp;</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">See the Moon’s rugged, barren, dead surface! It is covered with rocks, mountains, and what looks like huge craters of volcanoes long since extinct, or inactive. Not an animal roams over its surface. Not a twig nor blade of grass is to be seen. Water and air are altogether wanting. We pass it by; or rather, it rushes past us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Let us see how far we have gone now. We discover that 240,000 bodies have been left behind as mile-stones—240,000 miles we have therefore traveled—over eight months have we been on our journey. Let us not get discouraged, however. Our journey has just begun. We have lost only one out of every five hundred we had on board.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">On, on, and still on we go; day after day, week after week, month after month, year after year. Our crowd is becoming smaller and smaller. We have now been on our journey for seventy long years; for we are in the year 1994.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The hairs on our heads have all become gray, and our faces are wrinkled. Having traveled 25,000,000 miles, we are come to the orbit of Venus, and are just in time to meet it as it passes near the direct line between the Earth, Venus, and the Sun. There is no transit, however; for the next one will not occur until the year 2004.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Venus Veiled with Clouds</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19240618_files/g_E_19240618-5.png" alt="" style="width:17pt;height:18pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">ENUS comes along at the terrific rate of twenty miles a second, while we are crawling along at the rate of forty miles an hour. We cannot see anything of the surface of this mighty planet, almu_. as large as the Earth, because of its dense atmosphere and the thick clouds that always hang in it. Whether there are any beings on its surface we cannot find out on our hurried trip and during her flight past us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">We keep moving on, anxious to see little Mercury, only one-twentieth as large as the Earth. Do not be in a hurry, however, to get there; for it will take ninety more years to arrive in its vicinity. After years and years of travel we meet Mercury, named after the Greek god Mercury, the messenger of the gods. Truly a messenger he is ; for he passes by us. as an</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">immense cannon-ball at the rate of thirty miles . a second to make his journey around the. Sun., in a year of only three of our months.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">We have now been traveling for one hundred and sixty long, long years; and three-fourths of our people are gone. We are bowed with years; and yet how bright our memories are of the times we used to have on the Earth, of our happy school days, and of all the experiences that we passed through in our various spheres of life! A few more years, and nearly all our passengers will be gone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">A journey of one hundred years still lies before us when we leave Mercury. How every incident and lesson learned is remembered and told and retold during this stretch of time! Nearly all of the books in our train library of a million volumes have been read so often that they are beginning to fall to pieces. But a happy crowd we are; and time flies very rapidly among so many lively old maids and equally old bachelors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">As we are approaching the Sun, it is becoming hotter and hotter; but we can endure great heat. Larger and larger the Sun seems to grow as we continue to approach. But are we able to realize how very large a body the Sun is! Immensity of immensity is before us! Years before the birth of Christ a Greek philosopher became rather wild in his imagination, as the people of his time thought; for he claimed that the Sun is a ball of fire, and at least as large as the southern part of Greece.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Greatness of Our Sun</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">A</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">S A matter of fact, long ago we found that ■ the Sun is 1,300,000 times as large as the Earth. What!! That does not mean anything to you! Well, then; we will suppose the Sun to be completely hollowed out and our insignificantly small Earth to be placed in the center of the Sun. We will also swing the Moon in its orbit at its actual distance of 240,000 miles from the Earth to perform its monthly revolution. The Moon has plenty of elbow room within the Sun; for there would be a space of 193,000 miles between its orbit and the outside shell of the Sun. Another illustration: It would take 109 earths laid side by side like a string of beads to stretch across the diameter of the Sun, and 300,000 earths would have to be melted to make up the weight of the Sun.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">At last we have arrived in the very atmosphere of the Sun. What do we see before ust</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Ten hundred thousand billions of furnaces rolled into one! What a seething, raging, writhing, roaring mass of gases and molten matter! What oceans upon oceans of flame! Over the Sun are sweeping storms of flame of such violence that the wildest and most furious of our hurricanes, tornadoes, and cyclones are tame in comparison! Should such a hurricane as sweeps over the Sun, moving at the rate of one hundred miles per second, occur on the Earth, it would sweep entirely across the United States from the Gulf of Mexico to the St. Lawrence river in Canada in half a minute! It would carry with it everything on the earth’s surface, cities and towns included, in a mass of glowing vapors arising from the cities of New Orleans, Chicago and New York; and these vapors would be mixed in a single indistinguishable cloud.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">We often talk of the terrible eruptions of the volcano Vesuvius in Italy and the destruction wrought thereby; but notice that eruption in the Sun that sends a mass of flames upward 50,000 miles in height! Look at that one rising up to the enormous height of 100,000 miles! One such flame would be sufficient to melt the entire Earth in a single moment</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">How can our minds begin to take in such sights! Impossible! Impossible!! We have become so filled with awe and sublimity, so astounded by the manifestations of infinite power, so overcome by the conscious realization of our own smallness and of the greatness of the power that God holds in His hand, and so completely overcome by the intense heat and light, that we all are ready to fall into a trance. And thus ends our journey to the Sun, having spent two hundred and sixty years in this eventful excursion of 92,000,000 miles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Rapid Changes in Mind-Travel</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">P</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">RESTO! Change! Once more we are in the</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Owe youth also has come back. Let us now take another journey of a still greater distance. We will go on the wings of imagination, at the same old rate of forty miles an hour. Instead of going toward the Sun, we will wing our flight like angels, going from the Earth, in a direction away from the Sun.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The first planet we meet is Mars. It takes us, however, one hundred and forty years to reach that planet, which makes us all full-fledged centenarians by the time of arrival. As we approach this most nearly earth-like planet, we aotice a very peculiar appearance. Venus and Mercury, which we saw on our other journey, have no moons. But notice the tiny moons of Mars! “They are too cute for anything,” the old ladies of our party exclaim. One moon is only six miles in diameter and the other is about seven. It would be only a pleasant day’s journey to walk around one of these moons. Notice how near the inner moon is to the surface of Mars! This moon revolves so rapidly that it makes three revolutions around Mars while Mars makes one rotation on its axis. This causes this inner moon of Mars to rise in the west and set in the east twice a day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Let us look more closely at Mars itself. What a peculiar distribution of land and water ! All the seas seem to be long like the Red Sea or like the Baltic. They look almost like a number of large canals crossing the land in all directions. What an ideal world for commercial facilities and intercommunication of all kinds! What a high state of civilization must exist here if intelligent beings live on Mars! But we do not have time to investigate this interesting but perplexing problem.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">We shall now leave Mars and go on toward giant Jupiter. But how many strange little planets we meet on our way! Over 800 of these have their orbits between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. How small they are! The largest one is only 300 miles in diameter, while here one comes along which is a regular Tom Thumb among the planetoids, being only fifteen miles in diameter. We cannot resist the temptation to step on this one. How light we are! Gravitation draws us but very little. We weigh but a few ounces apiece. How easily we can move about! As for jumping, we can easily spring up sixty feet and alight on our planetoid without the slightest injury. Look at our athletes I It is a regular paradise for them. A running broad jump of 200 feet is play-work for them. Their athletics seem more like contests in flying . than anything else. We are so old, however, that we do not care to indulge very long in these sports.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">On, on, on, and still on we go. All of us are now older than Methuselah ever was; and he died at the age of 969 years. While coming near the orbit of Jupiter, we find that we have been</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">1,110 years on our journey. Marvelous lapse of time! How can we realize it!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Jupiter, thou art worthy of thy name; thou art larger than all the other planets put together—1,400 times as large as the Earth—and yet only one-thousandth of the size of the Sun. See the eight huge moons circling around this giant planet! Do you see that great shadow passing over Jupiter’s surface of heavy clouds and belts? An eclipse is occurring. At every revolution of each of Jupiter’s moons an eclipse occurs. Such a phenomenon is of no special Occasion to the inhabitants of Jupiter, if there are any, and if they have means of seeing through the great envelope of clouds, thousands of miles in thickness, all around it. On the Earth astronomers travel thousands of miles to observe an eclipse of the Sun, caused by the Moon passing before the face of the Sun.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Merry-Go-Round of Saturn</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">W</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">E MAY not linger long; for yonder, away yonder, is Saturn, which presents the . most magnificent spectacle of all the planets, with its ten moons, and its three rings of matter that revolve around it like so many merry-go-rounds. How beautiful and well-proportioned they are in all their appearances! Notice that Saturn also is covered by dense clouds and belts like unto those of Jupiter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">We pass this glorious planet at the end of 2,200 years and go on until we meet Uranus, at the end of 5,000 years. Uranus is nearly 1,800,000,000 miles from the Sun. We notice nothing striking about it except its four moons, so we pass on over a great and incomprehensible stretch of space and time and arrive at Neptune, the last planet of our own solar system. This planet has one moon and is nearly 2,800,000,000 miles from the Sun. Altogether we have spent nearly 7,740 years of continuous traveling to reach this point from the Earth; whereas our journey to the Sun took only 260 years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The cold has become very intense on account ' of our great distance from the Sun. It overcomes us, and once more we fall into a trance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Presto! Change! Again we are in the year 1924.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">How thankful we are for these wonderful imaginary experiences, which help us to understand something of the greatness of the Creator •f this solar system and all that it comprises!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Something about the Stars</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">A</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> FEW concluding words about the stars, and I shall have finished. Thus far I have spoken only of the Sun, and its planets which revolve around it. Immense as the space is in which they perform their operations, yet it is only a very small patch in the vast field of the universe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The stars are suns; but the planets are not suns, having no light of their own. Nine hundred and ninety-nine out of every thousand of the heavenly bodies that you can see with the naked eye are suns. All af these stars are so far from us or from any other part of our solar system that the distances bewilder when we try to comprehend them. To give you some idea, let me illustrate:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">As some of you know, light travels at the rate of 186,000 miles a second; and so it takes light eight and one-half minutes to reach the Earth from the Sun. Light from the Sun reaches Neptune in about four and one-half hours. So all parts lying within 2,800,000,000 miles in all directions from the Sun receive light that is less than five hours old. But the light that we receive from the nearest star (a sun), called Alpha Centauri, is over four years in reaching us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Let me illustrate this in another way: Let the Sun be represented by my closed hand, and I shall place a few of the planets at their relative distances from it. The Earth, 92,000,000 miles from the Sun, I place in its orbit one inch from the Sun. Inside of the one-inch circle would lie the orbits of Venus and Mercury. Next I will place Mars, then the planetoids or asteroids, and at a distance of five inches comes Jupiter, 480,000,000 miles from the Sun. Outside of this I place Saturn and Uranus at their relative distances, and at the distance of twenty-nine inches is the place for the orbit of Neptune, 2,800,000,000 miles from the Sun.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">As I told you before, it takes light four and one-half </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">hours</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> to reach Neptune, whereas light from the nearest star travels over four </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">years </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">to reach us. A simple calculation shows that this star would have to be placed four and one-third miles from my hand. Think of the immense empty space (so far as we know) that lies between the outer boundaries of our solar system and the nearest so-called fixed star, or sun I</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Truly, our Sun and its children, the planets, are very, very far separated from the other parts of the universe!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Beyond that nearest star are suns as many in number as the grains of sand upon the seashore, each one removed infinitely from us and infinitely removed from one another, as a rule.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">What do these things teach us! In the language of the Psalmist, we have the best short answer:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;The heavens declare the glory of God; And the firmament, showeth his handiwork. Day unto day uttereth speech, And night unto night showeth knowledge.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">—Psalm 19:1,2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">'As we begin to study the mighty works of God, we begin to see how little is our home, the Earth; and how insignificantly little are we in body and mind and power when compared with the great Creator and Director of all things in the heavens above and in the Earth beneath. How far removed from us He is in some respects, and yet how near is He with His all-seeing eye! “For the eyes of the Lord run to and fro throughout the whole earth to show himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect toward him.”—2 Chron. 16:9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">In no other natural science is the character of God as the </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">Alm</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">ighty One, the All-wise One, and the All-seeing One, so fully shown forth as in the study of astronomy. Truly great and wonderful beyond all our knowledge are God and all His mighty works. Let us therefore reverence Him in all our thoughts and words and doings. The great English poet Addison voices the sentiments of a true worshiper of God in his beautiful version of the first part of the 19th Psalm:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“The spacious firmament on high, With all the blue ethereal sky, And spangled heavens, a shining frame, Their great Original proclaim: The unwearied sun from day to day Does his Creator's power display, And publishes to every land The work of an Almighty hand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“Soon as the evening shades prevail, The moon takes up the wondrous tale, And nightly, to the listening earth, Repeats the story of her birth;</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Whilst all the stars, that round her burn, And all the planets in their turn, Confirm the tidings as they roll, And spread the truth from pole to pole.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“What though, in solemn silence, $11 Move round this dark, terrestrial ball? What though no real voice or sound Amidst her radiant orbs be found? In reason’s ear they all rejoice, And utter forth a glorious voice, Forever singing as they shine,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">‘The hand that'made us is divine.’” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark44"></a>Powerful Friends of Zionism</span></h6>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">M</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">RS. Nathan Straus, acting in accord with the splendid philanthropy that characterizes that great family, has given her own personal jewels, valued at ten thousand dollars, to the fund for the development of Zionism in Palestine. Dr. Chaim Weizmann has just returned to Palestine, carrying back $5,000,000 collected in this country for the restoration work. The reports of all travelers who have recently visited Palestine agree that during the last five years as much progress has been made in the development of the country as was made in the- previous five hundred years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Mr. Oscar S. Straus, three times United States Ambassador to Turkey, after a visit to the Jew</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">ish colonization centers in Palestine has said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“They are bound to triumph over the many obstacles which, under other circumstances, it would be impossible to achieve. There is a spirit of cheerfulness and happiness beaming in the faces of the men and women who are building up the colonies; unlike the hosts that Moses led, they do not seem to hanker after the fleshpots of Egypt. If the Christian world knew and appreciated what a reconstructed and prospering Palestine means for the cause of securing Christian harmony and brotherly love in the Holy City and throughout Palestine, where discord has continued for centuries, they / would be among the most ardent Zionists, and would join hands with the Jews in promoting good will among all religious communities as well as in aiding the economic reconstruction of the oountry.”</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark45"></a>The End of the World</span></h6>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">(Broadcast from ’WATCHTOWER WBBR on a wave length of 273 meters, by Judge J. F. Rutherford)</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">HE meaning of &quot;the end of the world” has been greatly misunderstood&quot;. For generations people have been taught that the end of the world meant that the earth and everything in it would be burned up amidst suffering beyond description of human words. Necessarily this caused dread in the minds of the people. Since unpleasant things are not desirable to listen to, few have cared to hear anything about the end of the world. When properly understood, however, it is an event to be welcomed with joy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">If a man was suffering imprisonment and knew that at the end of a certain period he would be released and restored to his loved ones, he would receive that information with gladness. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The human race has long been in bondage to evil influences. If the people can understand that the end of the world means release from this bondage, bringing to them happiness and peace, health and strength, this message should be received <sub>f</sub> with gladness. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The word “world,” as used in Scripture, does not mean earth. It means the social, political, and ecclesiastical order of things controlling the general course of man. Everyone will bear witness to the fact that the history of the world has been written in tears and human blood. It has been a long way of suffering and toil, and man has ever hoped for something better. The end of the world means the end of such suffering and the beginning of a better way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Earth and world are not used as synonymous terms. The earth is the mundane sphere upon which man resides. The earth will never be destroyed. Staten Island will always be where it is now. When evil agencies have ceased upon the earth, when the oppression of man has passed away, when the memory of the oppressor and misrepresentation have perished, Staten Island will bloom as the rose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Concerning this point, with reference to the earth, the Scriptures declare: “The earth abid-eth for ever.” (Ecclesiastes 1:4) Again, says the Lord: “I have made the earth, and created man upon it; I, even my hands, have stretched out the heavens, and all their host have I commanded.” &quot;For thus saith the Lord God that<sup>-</sup>created th<sub>e</sub> heavens; God himself that formed &quot;&nbsp;the earth and made it; he hath established it, he created it not in vain, he formed it to be inhabited; I am the Lord, and there is none else.”—Isaiah 45:12,18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">God formed the earth that man might have a home fit for a perfect creature to live upon. While man has been going through his trying experiences, the earth has been in course of development; and by the time man is restored to a perfect condition the earth will be like the garden of the Lord, an Edenic Paradise. It will be Paradise restored.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Worlds of the Bible</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">HE period of time from Eden until the flood is described in the Scriptures as &quot;the world that was.” Of it St. Peter says: “Whereby the world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished.” (2 Peter 3:6) Noah and his family were in that world, and were carried over to the new world, which began when the flood had ceased. Noah had warned the people of the end of the first world and of the coming deluge. A parallel is found at the end of the present world, when some are warning the people about the approaching end.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The world which began at the flood is mentioned as the “present evil world.” (Galatians 1: 4) Since the world first above mentioned was destroyed in the flood, concerning the present evil world St. Peter says that it is “kept in store, reserved unto destruction against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men.”—2 Peter 3: 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The word god is often applied to mighty creatures, aside from Jehovah. For instance, Satan, the devil, is called the god of the present evil world. He is invisible to man yet powerful, exercising an evil influence amongst men, and has made the world an unpleasant place in which to reside.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">God made a promise to Abraham and bound it with His oath, that He would bless all the families of the earth. These blessings will come through the seed of Abraham; the seed of Abraham is the great Messiah. For this reason the coming of the Messiah and the establishment of His kingdom have been uppermost in the minds of devout men for centuries past.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The disciples of Jesus, who were associated</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">with Him for three and one-half years in Pales* tine and who heard the gracious words that fell from His lips, often heard about the coming of the Messianic kingdom. They were familiar with the promise that God had njade to Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and to Israel through the prophets. It was incumbent upon them to learn the Scriptures. They believed that Jesus was to be the great Messiah, the King, and that through Him the promised blessings would come to mankind? Naturally they were anxious to know when that event would take place. So anxious were they that two of the sons of Zebedee requested that one might have a place on the left hand, the other on the right hand, of the .Lord in that kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Evidently Jesus’ disciples talked over the matter of the end of the world and the coming of the new order. Just five days before His crucifixion they came to Jesus as He sat on the side of the Mount of Olives, and propounded to Him this question, which is recorded in Matthey 24:3: &quot;Tell us, when shall these things be ? and what shall be the sign of thy coming, and of the end of the world?” They knew that with the passing away of the old order a better time would come; hence they were keenly interested as to the time of its coming.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Jesus’ answer to this question is all-important. It must be conceded that His answer was true; for He spake with authority, as no man ever spake. His words on this and other questions show that it would be a long time after the question was propounded before the end of the world should come. He knew that by the time it did come His answer would be forgotten by all except those who were diligently watching the unfolding of events in the light of the Scriptures. He gave His answer, however, in such plain phrase that all who are anxious for the coming of that time, and who would therefore be earnestly watching the development of events, would be able to discern when the time arrived.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Importance of Year 1914</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">O</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">F COURSE, Jesus was familiar with the prophecies. He was the only one, aside from Jehovah, who knew their meaning at that time, He knew that God had, at Mount Sinai, organized Israel into a nation and dealt exclusively with that nation for more than sixteen centuries. God had given to Israel His law, that is, a perfect rule of action for the guidance of man; that under this law Israel might have life everlasting if that nation kept the law perfectly. -</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Jesus knew that Jehovah had given to Israel the true religion. Of course, He knew that they had failed to keep God’s law, and that as a nation and people they had been untrue to their covenant and had embraced a false religion, which had been introduced into other nations by the great adversary, the deviL He knew that time and again Jehovah had warned Israel that her repeated violation of Jier covenant would result in the destruction of the nation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Jesus knew that this warning was carried into effect by Jehovah’s judgment pronounced upon Israel and executed when Zedekiah was king; that then and there God had permitted the nation of Israel to be overthrown and the Gentiles to establish a universal government in the earth under Nebuchadnezzar. He knew that Jehovah had stated in substance that the Gentiles should continue ruling the earth without interference for </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> period of 2,520 years. Of course, these facts were in His mind when He answered the question.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The period of &quot;Gentile times” began in. 606 B. C., and ended 2,520 years thereafter. Therefore, the end would be August 1st, 1914.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The end of the “Gentile times” would mark the beginning of the end of the world. Now that these historical facts are definitely established in the minds of every student, let us examine the words of the Master given in answer to -the question propounded to Him, and consider this in the light of present-day events.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Answer of Jesus</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19240618_files/g_E_19240618-6.png" alt="" style="width:12pt;height:18pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">ESUS said that when that time comes the nations will become angry and that God’s wrath will come. The nations embrace particularly those who claim to be Christian nations. Exactly on time they did become angry; namely, in August, 1914. Jesus’ answer further reads: “For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places. All these are the beginning of sorrows.” —Matthew 24: 7,8. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">It would be impossible for the physical facts more completely to fit the conditions foretold by Jesus than what we have observed happened 'during the past ten years. In 1914 began the World War, the worst that man has ever experienced. It was followed by the greatest f</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">ami</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">ne that man has ever known, which swept many of the countries of earth. There quickly followed pestilence, the like of which was never known before. The pestilence was not confined </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">4o</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> the war district, but claimed its victims by the hundreds of thousands, from the frozen zone of the north to the heated zone of the south. More people died in that pestilence in one year than were killed during the World War in four years. During the past ten years there have been more earthquakes, which have wrought greater destruction, than at any other time in man's history. Earthquakes are also symbolical of revolution, and there has been a greater number of revolutions during the past ten years than ever before.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Now be it noted that Jesus said that the World War, famines, pestilences, earthquakes, and revolutions would be the </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">beginning</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> of the sorrows upon the peoples and nations of earth, and would testify that the world had come to an end. In other words, the period allotted to the Gentiles to rule had legally ended, and now conditions were beginning which clearly mark the disintegration and passing away of that order.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Favor to Israel Returning</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19240618_files/g_E_19240618-7.png" alt="" style="width:12pt;height:18pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">ESUS furthermore stated that the Jews should be trodden down of the Gentiles until the end of the Gentile times. Otherwise stated, the Jews would suffer great persecution, which would begin to pass away with the end of the Gentile times. Every Jew knows, and many Christians likewise, that the Jews have suffered great persecution ever since they were driven from Palestine, shortly after the crucifixion of our Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">For centuries the ambition of the Jews has been that they might return and build Palestine as a homeland. On November 2nd, 1917, Arthur James Balfour, speaking in behalf of the British Empire, which had then come into possession of Palestine under the terms of the League of Nations, addressed Lord Rothschild, one of the leading Jews of the world, the following note:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“Foreign Office, November 2nd, 1917. “Dear Lord Rothschild:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“I hare much pleasure in conveying to you on behalf of His Majesty’s Government, the following declaration of sympathy with Jewish Zionist aspirations, which ha* been submitted to, and approved by, the Cabinet:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“ ‘His Majesty's Government view with favor the establishment in Palestine of a National Home for the Jewish people, and will use their best endeavors to facilitate the achievement of this object, it being clearly understood that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine, or the rights and political status enjoyed by Jews in any other country.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;I should be grateful if you would bring this declaration to the knowledge of the Zionist Federation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“Yours sincerely,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">“Arthur James Balfour.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">This was followed by a similar declaration by other nations; and in the spring of 1918 Dr. Chaim Weizmann, clothed with authority from the British Empire, went to Palestine and opened an office in Jerusalem. Since then he has been putting forth an effort, together with his assistants, to establish in Palestine the nation of the Jews, for the Jews, and by the Jews. Dr. Weizman has recently been in the United States in the interest of this movement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Lack of Faith Apparent</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">I</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">T WILL be noticed that the end of the world and the second coming of the Lord are closely allied, and relate to the same period of time. Jesus said: “When the Son of man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth?&quot; (Luke 18:8) The time was, for many years, that all Christian ministers believed the Bible and honestly tried to teach it. The people have wondered in recent months why the great controversy now on between the Modernists and the Fundamentalists. Meantime the Modernists are growing in strength, and vehemently declaring that they have no faith in the fall of man and his redemption through the blood of Christ, hence no faith in the coming of Christ’s kingdom for the restoration of man. I cite this as another evidence of the time in which we are living.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">This controversy ought to cause thoughtful people to turn to their Bibles and carefully examine them in the light of the prophecies to see what these things mean. Each man is responsible to the Lord according to the knowledge he has. St. Peter, referring to this same time concerning the end of the world, said this: “Knowing this first, that there shall come in the last days scoffers, walking after their own lusts, and saying, Where is the promise of his coming? for since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation. For this they willingly are ignorant of, that by the word of God the heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of the water and in the water; whereby the world that then was . . . perished.” (2 Peter 3:3-6) It is a well-known fact that a great number who claim to be Christian leaders are now scoffing at the statement that the world has ended, that the Lord is present, and that the kingdom of heaven is at hand. I cite this merely as corroborative proof as to where we are.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Fear </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Overshadowing the World</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">W</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">HEN the World War came, men marched to the front to the slogan: &quot;The war will make the world safe for democracy.” Several years have passed since the war, and democracy is further from being safe than at any time in the past Seven nations are now ruled by dictators, and fear has taken hold upon the ruling classes everywhere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The apostle Paul said that in the latter days there would be great wickedness in high places; and the American people are hanging their heads with shame today as the press daily heralds forth the facts of the great wickedness in high places in Washington.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The conditions in the earth have caused men to fear. The rich fear the laboring classes and the radicals; the poor and the laboring element fear the oppressive hand of the wealthy; the business man fears concerning his investments; the politicians fear for their positions. In fact, fear has laid hold of men in all walks of life. Jesus said that this condition would be another sign or proof of the end of the world. His words are: &quot;Upon the earth distress of nations, with perplexity; . . men's heart’s failing them for fear, and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth.”—Luke 21:25,26. ■</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">All these evidences are so patent that we cannot be mistaken as to what theymean. They mean this: The'old order is passing out; the new order is coming in; Messiah’s kingdom is at the door; and the time for </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">Him</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> to begin Hie reign is here. In connection with the things of the present time Jesus gives a command to His followers in these words: “This gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations: and then shall -the end come.” (Matthew 24:14) I believe it to -be the duty of every Christian to take up the message and herald it forth to his fellow creature, advising him that the present distress upon the earth means the passing of the old order and the coming in of the new. It is necessary for man to have this information in order that-his heart may be refreshed and hope implanted in his breast concerning the better-thing promised for his early relief. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">From the evidence here adduced it must be apparent that we have reached the end of the old world, and that the present trouble is .due to the fact that the world is passing away. There is no one who is satisfied with the present conditions, not even the profiteer/ What man desires is a government of the people which will result in the greatest amount of good, guarantee equal and just rights to all, and which will establish amongst the people an everlasting peace, bringing to them the blessings of life, ' liberty and happiness. This great desire of Jew and Gentile, Mohammedan and Christian is about to be realized. The Lord plainly shows that with the end of the old world would follow a better condition of society. I am happy to tell you that we are standing at the very portals of a new and glorious time of relief for mankind.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark27"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark46"></a>The Papal Jubilee</span></h6>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">G</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">REAT preparations are being made in Rome for the jubilee which is to take place from December 24th, 1924, to December 25th, 1925. This celebration is supposed to take place every twenty-five -years, but something has always happened to prevent it since 1825. All the cardinals and bishops of the Roman Catholic Chureh are supposed to be present at this Papal jubilee, as well as are the governors of Roman</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Catholic states and the mayors of Roman Catholic cities. It is expected that there will be fully 3,000 bishops and not less than 2,000,000 visitors at Rome during the jubilee year. Many new buildings are being constructed to house the visitors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">It is noteworthy that international congresses of all sorts are more and more making their headquarters in the city of Rome.</span></p>

<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">S</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">MITH was joking one day about the things people believe. He said: &quot;There are some people who are credulous enough to believe that Jonah swallowed the whale if the Bible said so.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">“Some believe worse things than that,” said Tyler. “I think the most ridiculous is the doctrine of the Trinity. What can you think of the </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">min</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">d whose mathematics are three times one are one!&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">“Unless you can reduce everything to logic and mathematics you call it ridiculous and absurd,” put in Wynn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">“So it is,” retorted Tyler. “Who ever heard of a being sitting down on the right hand of </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">splfl Or of a son being his own father and a father his own son!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">“There are mysteries which the finite mind cannot grasp. Even P</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">alm</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">er has to admit that; and the Trinity is one of them.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">“I admit with you that there are mysteries which are beyond the mind of man to grasp; but I make a distinction between that which is opposed to reason and that which is outside the scope of reasoning,” said P</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">alm</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">er. “As I have before pointed out, the fact of the limitlessness of space must be conceded; it may be beyond our conception, but it is not opposed to reason.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">“So is the doctrine of the Trinity,” said Wynn; “and why do- you want to reduce everything to reason!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">“Experience has taught that reason cannot always be relied upon; and if we start with false premises we cannot avoid wrong conclusions. But while this is true, it is also true that terms are used with some definite thought in them; and it is unthinkable that God, who desires to convey His thoughts to us through the medium of language, should use terms with meanings destructive of one another. A term represents an idea; a sentence represents a judgment of ■two or more ideas. The words chalk and white both represent ideas; and when we say that chalk is white, this is the expression of our judgment of the relation of the two ideas. No one would understand us to mean that chalk and white are the same.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">“In giving us the Bible God has come down and taken hold upon the language of men that He might express His will to us; and it is only proper to conclude that He intends us to use our best powers to diseover what it is He has to say.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">By C. E. Quiver (London) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">“When we read, ‘The Father sent the Son,’ it would be violating all the laws of language and reason to conclude that the Father sent Himself. The term father conveys the thought of lifegiver; and the term son, one who has received life from another. While these terms mean what they do, and are used in this relationship, they must imply that two persons, two beings, are meant. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">“On a question of this kind it is well to start by confessing our ignorance. The study of science cannot discover the relation of God and Jesus Christ. It will not be found in botany, nor in physiology, nor in mathematics. It can be found only in Scripture. It is the Bible that tells us of Jehovah and His Son Jesus. It must be the Bible that will tell us their relationship. Analogies in nature are no good until we have established, the point in Scripture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Creed Teaching on Trinity</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">&lt;&lt;rpHE creed says of God and Jesus that they</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">J- are ‘co-equal, co-substantial and co-eter-nal.’ Texts of Scripture are not given to prove this because none can be found. And we are discouraged in the use of our reason by the expression that this is incomprehensible; which of course is true and always will be true, as it involves so much contradiction and confusion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">“Pure water may be deep, but it appears to be shallow because one can see to the bottom; whereas muddy water appears to be deep, although it may be very shallow. So it is with truth and error. Truth is clear as crystal, leading the mind easily from point to point; but error is confusing, and one is soon lost in the labyrinth of mystery and superstition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">“There are mysteries enough without creating more. Of all the jargon that has ever been written in the name of religion nothing surpasses the Athanasian creed. It is such a combination of absurdity and contradiction that it is difficult to think that anyone could possibly believe it. The creed has been the bone of contention throughout the age; and those who have tried to explain what is confessed to be inexplicable have differed in their views. And then to think that this upon which even theologians themselves cannot agree should be put forth as an article of belief necessary to salvation is-absurd in the extreme. I am glad to think that God is more reasonable than men. Jesus said of</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">some that they 'strain at a gnat, and swallow a camel.’ Evidently quite a few have swallowed the camel.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">“It is all very well talking like this, but you cannot refute the creed,” broke in Wynn.,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">“Not refute it? Why! it is refuted on every page of the Bible, and supported by none. The creed says that the Father and the Son are coequal. Jesus said: ‘My Father is greater than I.’ The Bible says that ‘the Father sent the Son,’ that ‘God raised him from the dead and set him at his own right hand,’ clearly implying that one is superior to the other.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">“There are so many passages of Scripture on this point that I could go on quoting for half an hour; but I will give one that settles it beyond question—1 Corinthians 15:25-28. The apostle Paul is speaking of the glory and power of Jesus during His reign on earth. He says: ‘He must reign till he hath put all enemies under his feet.’ Then, when Jesus has reached the very apex of the glory of His reign, Paul says: 'And when all things shall be subdued unto him, then shall the Son also </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">self be subject unto him that put all things under him, that God may he all in all* This clearly shows that the Son is not equal with the Father.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Jaiu Received-Life from God</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">( HEN the creed says that the Father and the Son are co-substantial. At the time of the making of the Nicene creed, which had to do with the question we are discussing, there were two factions at the conference that voted for the creed, and thus obtained a majority in its favor; but they understood the matter differently. A Greek word was introduced meaning ‘of the same nature.’ One faction understood this to mean that although the Father and the Son are separate beings, yet they have the same </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">kind</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> of nature. The other faction, the forerunners of the trinity-makers, took it to signify that they have the same nature, and that ‘Father’ and ‘Son’ are two names of </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">one being.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">“Are the Father and the Son co-substantial according to the latter thought 1 for that is the meaning of the expression -in the creed. Are the two one being!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">“I have already shown that the terms Father and Son imply that they are not. There are many scriptures that could be* given, but I will confine myself to one. When Jesus was taken by wicked men and crucified, the whole wor Id was opposed to </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">Him</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">. His disciples had left Him and fled; and last and most trying of all, God left Him. Then Jesus cried out in agony of soul: ‘My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me!’ If the Trinity doctrine is true then this was all a farce, a make-believe, a wonderful piece of deceptive acting. A blasphemous thought. Who can believe that our Lord was merely praying to himself! All the circumstances contradict the idea. The words were true, and were wrung out of Jesus by the bitter ordeal. The Apostle says that He prayed unto Him who was able to deliver Him from death, and He was heard. I could say a great deal more, but I think this is sufficient.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">“That is splendid,” said Tyler; &quot;I have not seen it put so clearly before.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;And now a few texts on the last point. The creed says that the Father and the Son are coeternal. The Bible says of Jesus that He was ‘the beginning of the creation of God.’ (Revelation 3:14) St Paul says (Colossians 1:15): He is ‘the firstborn of every creature.’ God is the great Creator, from everlasting to everlasting, without beginning and without ending; whereas Jesus is a creature.” •</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;A creature I” said Wynn. “I deny that.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">“Yes, a creature,” replied Palmer. “The Apostle says that He is the first-born of every creature; He is a creature, and the first one to be born. This word first-born implies a beginning of existence. He is the only begotten Son. There must then have been a time when He was not begotten; otherwise the word has no meaning. He is the first-born of every creature in the sense that He was the first one to be brought into existence; and He is the only begotten because in His creation He became the only agent of God in bringing forth all other creatures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">“There are a few passages in the Bible which if one reads while wearing the Trinity spectacles seem to support the view; but rightly understood, they do not. We have not time now to go into these ;4&gt;ut I would recommend that you read Pastor Bussell’s book entitled ‘The , Atonement’ for an explanation. The scriptures ; that I have quoted are so destructive in every way of the doctrine of the Trinity that if the &lt;&nbsp;Bible is to be our authority, then the doctrine t’-<sup>! </sup>of the Trinity cannot be true.”</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark29"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark47"></a>How the New Testament was Formed</span></h6>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">HE same Hand that wrote the New Testament brought the various books together into one volume as we have them today. There can be no doubt about this. On the point “McClintock and Strong’s Encyclopedia” says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“Each </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">of</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> the original churches, specially those of larger size and greater ability, collected for itself a complete set of those ■writings which could be proved by competent testimony to be the production of inspired men, and to have been communicated by them to any of the churches as part of the written Word of God; so that in this way a great many collections of the New Testament Scriptures came to be extant, the accordance of which with each other, as to the books admitted, furnishes irrefragable evidence of the correctness of the Canon as we now have it”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“This opinion, which in itself is highly probable, is rendered still more so when we consider the scrupulous care which the early churches took to discriminate spurious compositions from such as were authentic, their high veneration for the genuine Apostolic writings, their anxious regard for each other’s prosperity leading to the </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">free </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">communication from one to another of whatever could promote this, and, of course, among other things, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">those writings which had been entrusted to any one of them, and by which, more than by any other means, the spiritual welfare of the whole would be promoted.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“In this way we may readily believe that, without the intervention of any authoritative decision, either from an individual or a council, but by the natural process of each body of Christians seeking to procure for themselves and to convey to their brethren authentic copies of writings in which all were deeply' interested, the Canon of the New Tes</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">tam</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">ent was formed.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">St. Peter is supposed to have been martyred in Rome in the year A. D. 68. It was several years before his death that he speaks of parts of the New Testament having been already assembled together and in use by various churches, in the following language:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">“We, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness. Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for such things, be diligent that ye may be found of him in peace, without spot, and blameless. And account that the longsuffering of our Lord is salvation; even as our beloved Brother Paul also, according to the wisdom given unto him, hath written unto you</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">; as</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> also in all his epistles, speaking in them of these things; in which are some things hard to be </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">un</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">derstood, which they that are unlearned and unstable wrest, as they do also the other scriptures, unto their own destruction.”—2 Peter 3:13-16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">A Very Reasonable Tradition</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19240618_files/g_E_19240618-8.png" alt="" style="width:15pt;height:18pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">USEBIUS, the “Father of Church History,” who was born in 270 A. D., narrates a tradition, still prevalent in the church in his own day, to the effect that during the lifetime of St. John the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke were in general use throughout the Christian church; that they were laid before St. John for his approval; that he bore witness to their truth, but said that they had passed over what Jesus had done at the beginning of his public ministry. His friends then expressed a desire that he should give an account of the period which had thus been passed over. He complied, and the Gospel according to St. John is the result.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">There is no more reasonable way than this to account for St. John’s Gospel; there is no Gospel with which it would have been more difficult to tamper. It went forth from the churches of Asia Minor, and spread thence into all the world. If the slightest taint of suspicion had rested upon this book these Asiatic churches, for so long a time under St. John's close personal care, would have been the first to detect the fraud.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Writing of what must evidently have happened after the death of St. John, in A. D. 100, Dr. Constantine Tischendorf, one of the most truly wise and justly honored men that ever lived, has said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“After the death of the aged John, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">those </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">holy </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">men </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">who had known the Lord in the flesh, including the great Apostle of the Gentiles and the early church, had thus lost a definite center of authority. It was at this time, when the church dispersed over the world was persecuted without and distracted by error within, that she began to venerate and regard as sacred the writings which the apostles had left behind them aa precious depositories of truth, as unerring records of the </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">life of </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">the Savior, and as an authoritative rule of faith and practice. Do you ask in what way and </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">by what act was </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">this done? Certainly no learned assemblies </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">sat to decide </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">this question. If men like Matthew, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Mark, Luke, and </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">John had left behind them outlines of the Lord’s life, did it need anything more than their names to make their writings of the highest value to the early church ? And had not these men stood in such near relationship to the church as to make it impossible to pass off forged writings of theirs without detection?”</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Early References to the New Testament</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">A</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">LMOST immediately after the death of St.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">■ John we begin to have, from the pen of one person or another, references to the Gospels and the various books of the New Testament. Some of these references are from martyrs who suffered death because of their fidelity to those - Scriptures, others are from heretics who vainly endeavored to put their own writings on a par with the work of the Lord, others are from enemies of the cross of Christ, yet all contribute to the same general end of establishing the trustworthiness of the record. We can give only a few of the many lines of evidence which connect the apostles of our Lord and the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John with the New Testament as we now have it. -</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The Epistle of Barnabas, one of the apocryphal books, was never accepted by the Church as genuine, and not believed to be genuinely the work either of Barnabas or of the holy spirit. Nevertheless it is known to have been written by or before the time of St. John’s death. This Epistle contains references to Matthew 9:13; </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">22:</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">14; Luke 5: 32; and John 3:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">At about the same time a Jew-hater named Marcion, endeavored to compile a New Testament of his own, limiting it to St. Luke’s Gospel and ten of St. Paul’s Epistles. It was never accepted by the Church, because it omitted other writings which the Church of that day knew to be genuine, but it is of value as evidence of the admitted credibility of St Luke and St. Paul.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Fifteen years after St John’s death one of his disciples, Ignatius, was martyred at Rome; and on his way to the scene of his death he wrote several letters which have survived. In these letters he quotes feelingly and intelligently Matthew 3:15; 16:26; and John 6:41,48,54, applying them to his own hope of ultimate life through Christ, the Bread from heaven.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">In a letter written the same year of the martyrdom of Ignatius, Polycarp, who was also one of St. John’s disciples, quotes 1 John 4:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Under the reign of the Emperor Hadrian, some time between 117 A. D. and 138 A. D., or less than forty years after St. John’s death, Basilides, an heretical teacher, wrote a long work, purporting to explain the Gospels, in which he quoted from the Gospel according to St. Luke, and also from John 1:9; 2:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Justin Martyr, who suffered martyrdom at Rome in the year A. D. 166, was twice before the Roman Emperor to explain the Christian religion under penalty of death. On the first of these occasions, in A. D. 139, less than forty years after the death of St. John, he stated that the writings of the apostles and prophets were then read every Lord’s day in the assemblies of the Christians, and himself quoted from John 1:20-23; 3:3-5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Justin Martyr also quoted from one of the apocryphal books of the New Testament, a spurious book bearing the name of St James, never accepted by the Church. In this apocryphal book Matthew 1:21 is quoted word for word. He also quoted from another of the apocryphal books of the New Testament, a spurious book entitled the Acts of Pilate, never accepted by the Church. In this apocryphal book there are lengthy references to Matthew 27:15-26, 45-50, 62-66 ; 28:2-15; Mark 15:6-15, 33-37; Luke 23:13-25,44,45 ; 24:12; John 18: 39,40; 19:1-6; 20:5-7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Fifty Years Later</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">A</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">T THE middle of the second century, or * about fifty years after St John’s death, Celsus wrote a book ridiculing Christianity. In this book he made sarcastic comments on Matthew 1:18-25; 2:1-15; 3:13-17; 26:36-40; 27: 48; 28:1-7; Mark 1:9-11; 14:32-37; 15:36; 16: 1-7; Luke 1:26-38; 3:21,22; 22:39-45;24:1-7; John 1:1,*32-34; 2:18; 6:30; 19:28-30,34; 20:1-13. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Valentinus, a heretic, evidently under the influence of demons, in an attempt which he made at Rome about A. D. 150 to establish a new religion with himself at the head of it, applied to himself the titles which St. John applied to the Redeemer; namely, The Word, the Only Begotten, Life, Light, Fulness, Truth, Grace, the Redeemer, the Comforter. He made such references to Matthew 8:9; 9:20, and Luke 7:8, so as to make sure that he had seen these texts, and quoted John 10:8 boldly applying it to himself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Between A. D. 150 and 200 the New Testament had been translated into Latin and Syriac. Copies of these translations are in existence today, and are regarded as extremely valuable evidences of the reliability of the New Testament books.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">In A. D. 170 Muratori wrote a catalogue of the books of the New Testament which from the first had been considered sacred in the Christian chnrcL At the head of the list were Matthew, Mark, Lake, and John, in the same order in which we now have them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">About the same date two men, Theophilus and Tatian, separately brought into existence works entitled Harmonies of the Gospels, in which the attempt was made to mould the four Gospels into one. These Gospels must have been in existence at the time, or no such attempted combination of them would have been made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Irenseus, about the same time, wrote a work in which he quoted four hundred passages from the New Testament, eighty of these being from the Gospel according to St. John. Irenaeus was for many years a disciple of Polycarp, who had himself been a disciple of St. John. Polycarp died A. D. 165. Tertullian, writing at the same time, wrote several hundred pages taken from the Gospels, two hundred of these from St. John.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Sinaitic Manuscript</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">HE next step is the writing of the Sinaitic Manuscript. Most wonderful to relate, this identical manuscript itself has been preserved throughout the age and is (or was un recently) in the Museum at St. Petersburg. Scholars can now tell with great accuracy the date of any old manuscript, by the materials nsed, the forms of letters, words and sentences, spelling, penmanship, etc. The date of the writing of the Sinaitic MS. is fixed as 331 A. D. There are special reasons to believe that it is one of ten written at that time by order of the Emperor Constantine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">This most valuable of all MSS. of the Bible ever discovered the Lord was pleased to bring to light at the hand of Dr. Constantine Tischen-dorf, at the foot of Mount Sinai, in the Convent of Saint Catharine, in May, 1844. Dr. Tischen-dorf had consecrated his life, and made good use of his consecration, in trying to find all possible proof of the reliability of the books of the Bible as we have them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">After many great achievements in deciphering manuscripts unsolvable by others he finally found himself in the great hall of the convent, facing a large, wide basket full of old parchments about to be committed to the flames. He instantly recognized in the heap of papers a considerable number of sheets of the oldest Greek Old Testament he had ever seen. In his zeal he' betrayed the real value of the sheets; and it required fifteen years of patient negotiation, backed by Pope Gregory XVI and the Emperor of Russia, to get control of the MS., which, however, was finally obtained and placed in the Emperor’s care at St. Petersburg.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Dr. Tischendorf started on his long quest a poor man; but his great ability, and the Lord’s blessing upon his efforts, made him before his death one of the most greatly honored men of all time. Though a Protestant, he had the unusual honor of a close personal friendship with Pope Gregory XVI and with the Emperor of Russia. No doubt all of this was of the Lord’s arrangement, as without their sanction and active assistance his errand would have been a failure, and the Bible Students of today would have been without their greatest and most highly prized treasure, a very nearly perfect Greek text, from which they can determine with almost absolute certainty just what the Lord and the apostles actually said.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">“‘Then unto Abraham Jehovah called and made him the promise: 'Tn thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed.” This was another reference to the mystery; but that jiromise was not understood in its proper light. Abraham believed God would bless the human . race, but he did not understand just the manner in which it would be ddne. At the time of this promise Abraham had no children. Several years more passed and then Isaac, Abraham’s first legitimate son, was born. Abraham believed that his natural seed, his son, would be the ruler through whom the blessing would come to the people; but his son Isaac was merely a type of the mystery, God using him to foreshadow the greater one. This promise was renewed to Isaac and to Jacob; and at the death of Jacob his descendants, who of course were descendants of Abraham, were organized into twelve tribes, forming the nation of Israel, and were thereafter recognized as God’s chosen nation. (Genesis 49:28; Deuteronomy 26:5) Then it was that the faithful believed that God’s promised blessings would come through this nation, His chosen people. But in time they became slaves to the Egyptians and their hopes were almost blasted. They were sorely oppressed in Egypt when God sent Moses to be their deliverer and to lead the people of Israel out of Egyptian bondage. Moses was also a type foreshadowing the great One. (Acts 3:22) Moses died, and the promised blessing had not yet come. The prophetic statement made by Moses that God would raise up unto Israel one like unto himself led the prophets to understand that there would be raised up from the nation of Israel a great one who would be the deliverer and blesser of mankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">“’Joshua followed next in line after Moses. His name signifies savior or deliverer. But he also was only a type of the great Deliverer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">’“Then David became the king of Israel. His name means beloved one. The Jews had hoped that he would be the great deliverer, but in his old age he abdicated the throne in favor of Solomon, and yet the ' blessing did not come. Solomon beetime the most famous man in the world for riches and wisdom, and the hopes of</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Israel were centered in him, only to be disappointed. David and Solomon were also but mere types of the great Deliverer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">“’The nation of Israel degenerated; and under the reign of Zedekiah, their last king, they fell into captivity to the Babylonians; and they continued subject to other nations until they were finally driven out of Palestine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">“•Moved by the holy spirit of God operating upon their minds, the holy prophets testified of the coming of this great Deliverer, both of His sufferings and of His glory that would follow; but they did not understand. The matter was a mystery to them. (1 Peter 1:11) Even the angels of heaven sought to look into it, but they were not permitted. Gou's purpose was to keep the matter secret until His own due time to reveal the great truth.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">A promise backed up by such authority gives assurance of its fulfilment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">The great thing promised and bound by God’s oath is that for which man is ever striving—life and happiness amidst conditions where nothing can mar the full enjoyment of life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">And to confirm man’s faith, the burden of every prophet’s message, that which distinguishes prophets of Jehovah from self-styled prophets, was the guarantee . of perpetual life on earth. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Jehovah’s very purpose in supplying the Bible was to acquaint man with His plan to fulfil the greatest desire of every human heart.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">When used for the purpose designed, the Bible is the greatest example of consistency ■ and harmony. Although it was written by twenty-four of God’s prophets and other agents living hundreds of years apart, their remarkable fidelity to every detail of the divine plan, beginning at Genesis and ending with Revelation, is one of the most amazing things which ever came to the knowledge of man.</span></p>

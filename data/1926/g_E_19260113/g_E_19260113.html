<h4><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font1"><a name="bookmark16"></a>The Successors of the Ark</span></h4>
<p><span class="font16">T</span><span class="font7">HE evolutionists, in their desire to disown or discredit the Creator and thus to shine at His expense, never have much to say about the ark of the Deluge; and it is well for them that they do not, because the ark as constructed by Noah makes their claims of superior intelligence look very foolish.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Figured on the basis of 25 inches to the cubit the a.rk was 625 feet long, 104 feet wide and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">62y<sub>2 </sub></span><span class="font7">feet deep. Its dimensions do not differ materially from those of a representative large vessel of today. E. H. Bigg, naval architect of the New York Shipbuilding Corp., declares that the ideal dimensions of a large and speedy vessel should be 585 feet long (only forty feet shorter than the ark) and 70 feet wide. The ark was not built for speed but for stability and comfort; hence its greater width. Moreover, it is significant that the newest boats show a general tendency to increase the width of the beam to approximate more nearly the ark’s proportions, The fishing boats on stormy Lake Erie are modeled after the proportions of the ark. They are able to </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">go</span><span class="font7"> out and return when all other vessels have to be kept in port. One fishing company has six vessels of this type in use.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Some three thousand years ago the Hebrews had vessels of considerable size, used in transporting timbers for the temple. The Phoenicians, the first masters of the sea, •were connected with the Hebrews in their maritime enterprise and retained their prestige for hundreds of years. It is now more than twenty-five hundred years since they circumnavigated Africa. In the Metropolitan Museum of Arts are to be found ship models made for an Egyptian ruler who lived in the days of Solomon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Carthage, Rome, Venice and Genoa each had their day as the shipmasters of the world. Genoa was the first to make vessels exclusively </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">for </span><span class="font7">merchant service. Norway, Holland, Britain and the United States have all been famed </span><span class="font10">for </span><span class="font7">their navigators.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Paddle wheels, operated by hand or by ox power, were used by Rome before the time </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font7">Christ. The first steam vessel to </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">erose the </span><span class="font7">Atlantic was the “Savannah”, built at New York, which made the trip from Savannah to Liverpool in the spring of 1819. The vessel was twenty-seven days enroute, and only a littl® over three days of the time under steam.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">American Clippers and Schooners </span><span class="font7">rpHE first American schooner was built </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">at </span><span class="font7">-*■ Gloucester, Mass., in 1745, and was so named because of the way in which she “schooned” or skipped over the waters as she descended from the ways when launched. These vessels soon became familiar sights in every part of the world. They were built with a square stern, fitted with two masts bearing a sloop sail on each, and a bowsprit with jib.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The first half of the nineteenth century saw the sailing vessels rise to the heights of their glory. The swiftest of these vessels were under the American flag. In 1854 the “Lightning”, under the U. S. flag, in five consecutive days made runs of 332 miles, 348, 300, 311 and 329. Her best day’s run on the trip was 412 miles. In the same year the “James Bains”, also under the U. S. flag, on a passage from Liverpool to Melbourne, made a day’s rim of 420 miles. These mileages are equal to those of steam vessels of the present day. In the year 1851 the “Flying Cloud”, on a trip from New York to San Francisco, around Cape Horn, averaged 227 miles per day for twenty-six days. The average speed of the slower passenger ships today is about 360 miles per day. In ten years after the first clipper ship was built the size of 2,400 tons was reached.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The foregoing were wooden vessels; </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">and</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">drives to </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Betpenifon by the emergencies </span><span class="font7">of the</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">World War an </span><span class="font7">attempt was made to revive </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font7">glories of </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font7">day that is past by construct</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">ing a huge number </span><span class="font7">of wooden ships. Accordingly America built 226 of these ships at a total cost of $300,000,000; but the day of the ship carpenter was past and, although the ordinary house carpenters that were pressed into the work did the best they could, the results were unsatisfactory. The outcome was that the government sold the entire 226 ships for $750,000, </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">or</span><span class="font7"> one-fourth of one percent of their cost.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Not only did the government lose 99 % percent of their money on the vessels which were completed, but they had to pay $5,000 per hull for the removal of each wooden hull that was on the ways when the armistice was declared. The concern that bought the hulls sold them as they lay t® the owners of the yards, and hence was paid by both parties to the transaction.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark17"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark18"></a>Steel the Ideal Material far Ships</span></h6>
<p><span class="font16">I</span><span class="font7">N THE latter part of the nineteenth century wood began to go out of use as shipbuilding material, it having been found that an iron ship is lighter than a wooden one of the same size and that the iron has the advantage of being easily bent or cast into any required shape.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Steel is a still better material for ship construction than iron, and by 1890 had quite displaced the latter. Shipbuilding is the queen of the steel industry. In the one hull there is combined the framework of a sky scraper and a great hotel, while at the same time the whole exterior is sheathed in the same material; and a gigantic steel constructed power-plant drives the whole structure forward through the seas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A striking example of the merits of steel construction was the salvage of the “Liberty Glow” during the World War. The ship struck a mine and broke in two, both parts floating ashore one and a quarter miles apart. The greater part of the cargo was salvaged; and after a few weeks the two parts of the vessel were drydocked and put together.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In the desperate days of the war an attempt was made to produce concrete boats, and seven ocean-going boats were made of that material; but they are now all out of service. Concrete is lacking in tensile strength, and cracks or ©rumbles easily. Blows that-come from heavy seas have little or no effect o» steel or wooden vessels, as the material will give ; but even the docking of concrete vessels required extreme care, as they were so easily broken. <sub>;</sub></span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark20"></a>The Smaller Ships Safer ’</span></h6>
<p><span class="font7">TT IS probable that the generation which is -*■ now passing has seen the largest ships that will ever be built. Experience has shown that the largest vessels are not the safest. Indeed, the strength of a vessel’s hull decreases as its size increases. Moreover, the large vessels are unwieldy to handle, especially in getting in and out of harbors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The two largest vessels afloat are the &quot;Majestic” and the “Leviathan”, both designed and built in Germany, as was also the “Berengaria”, the third largest. The vessels are supposed to be sister ships, but the &quot;Majestic” is actually six feet longer than the &quot;Leviathan&quot;, which is an even 950 feet long. The breadth is 100 feet, the depth 102 feet, the draft 38 feet, the number of decks 9, the deck area 7% acres, the height of main deck above the water 75 feet, the passenger capacity 4100, the crew 1000, the speed 25 knots, the number of boilers 48, the horsepower 100,000 and the tonnage 56,000. The interior space of each of these vessels is equal to 400 eight-room houses. The famous “Great Eastern”, which made its maiden trip from Liverpool to New York in 1858, and was at on® time the most talked-of boat in the world, was 680 feet long, with a breadth of hull of 83 feet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">During the war the “Leviathan” was used to transport troops. After the war it was determined to recondition her and make her over into a first-class passenger ship. The Boston navy yard bid less than $6,000,000 for making the desired changes, but the contract was awarded to a private yard at a cost of over $9,000,000. More than twenty-five miles of copper tubing were used in the reconditioning, 250,000 pounds of it for the heater coils in the staterooms.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There is no more talk now of building additional Majesties, Leviathans, Berengarias, Aqui-tanias or Mauretanias. These great vessels do not pay, because of the enormous expense of operation and the impossibility of keeping th® passenger list filled in the winter time. Henca the resort to winter cruises, to provide work foe them.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark21"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark22"></a>The Speed Limit About Reached</span></h6>
<p><span class="font16">T</span><span class="font7">HE speed limit for ocean travel seems to have been about reached. The “Leviathan” and the “Mauretania” have held the record be, tween them for many years. The present record i Is by the “Mauretania” in 5 days 1 hour and 59 minutes from New York to Cherbourg.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">■■ Every increase in speed of an ocean-going vessel involves a great increase in expense of operation. For every mile of increased speed</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">’ per hour there is a greatly increased fuel consumption. It is claimed that the new airplanecarrier of the navy will be able to make between thirty-three and thirty-four knots an hour, but a passenger boat of that speed would be so unprofitable as to be impossible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The fastest boats of all are those designed by Dr. Alexander Graham Bell, inventor of the telephone. As the speed of these boats increases, the hull is lifted out of the water by a system of planes which are not a part of the hull. At the top the planes are largest, the smallest being at the bottom. Boats built on this system have made speeds of seventy-seven miles an hour, or upwards. They are used only for sport</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark23"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark24"></a>Great Changes Under Way</span></h6>
<p><span class="font16">T</span><span class="font7">HE public is hardly aware of the fact that gas engines are now being installed in the majority of the new ships built, and that the smokestacks are carried only as ornaments, if they can be called such. Some ships are already appearing without them; and they are bound to go. In motor ships there are no furnaces, no boilers, no stokers, no trimmers; and the oil can be bunkered in spaces that would otherwise be wasted. This makes a great difference in the cargo capacity of the ship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">An equally drastic change is under wav in the domain of sailing vessels. As has pre iously been mentioned in these columns, Anton Flett-ner, Director of the Institute of Aero and Hydrodynamics at Amsterdam, has made use of his technical knowledge of the effect of wind currents on moving bodies, so as to convert the masts of old ships into towers into which the wind sweeps and propels the ship. These sailless sailing vessels are said to make even more complete use of the wind than the ordinary sailbig ship, and require only a fifth of the crew.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Another maritime improvement is the mar</span><span class="font7">velous steering device foown among saflqrB as the &quot;Metal Mike”. This gyropilot, once the head of the ship is set in a given direction by an an* rangement of compasses and gyroscopes, actual* ly steers the vessel better than a helmsman himself. The invention records the exact course followed by the ship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Then there is the German stabilizing device which has proven so successful in the “Alberti Ballin”. These U-shaped tanks largely counteract the rolling of the vessel, and in connection with what are called the Foerster bulges have practically ended seasickness on the vessels thus fitted. The “Deutschland&quot; is one of these.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There is also the submarine signal apparatus attached to each side of the ship below the water line, which enables the captain in a dense fog to tell of the proximity of another vessel, or even of an iceberg. Sound travels through the water more than four times as fast as it travels through the air. This device was used in the World War to locate submarines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">And finally there is the discovery that a six-bladed fan, fixed firmly to the rudder post behind a revolving propeller prevents the swirl of water, and makes it more like a solid block against which the propeller that revolves is more active. With the use of this device a sixth of the fuel can be saved and the ship driven ten percent faster.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It might be said that there is a general return to the old custom of pouring oil on troubled waters in the case of very heavy storms. It is a fact that the use of heavy vegetable or mineral oil has a remarkable effect in smoothing troubled seas and preventing them from breaking on board.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark25"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark26"></a>Improvements for Passengers</span></h6>
<p><span class="font16">T</span><span class="font7">HE United States has ceased to be an immigrant receiving country. With this change in governmental policy has come a change in the design and operation of steamships. Once they were largely operated because of the income derived from steerage passengers. Now it is proposed to do away with all class distinctions, as on railroads and in hotels throughout America, and to let all passengers have the run of the ship. This is the only sen« sible way to do, and it is the custom on Amec* ican lines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">, With the passing of immigration there is </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">a</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Sdetermfned -.effort' on th® part ©f stowaways to find their way into the country. Many do so, but many </span><span class="font7">others are detected and sent </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">back home. A </span><span class="font7">police dog found twenty stowaways on </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">one </span><span class="font7">Austrian boat in the run between Trieste </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font7">Lisbon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There lias been a softening by the United States of the severe restrictions formerly im</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">posed </span><span class="font7">upon third-class passengers. Only two </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">years </span><span class="font7">ago third-class passengers from Liver</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">pool for New York were </span><span class="font7">first examined </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">on the </span><span class="font7">dock at Liverpool. As they walked aboard their hail* was examined for vermin; on the first day out all women and children were compelled to bathe; every night at eight o’clock all women, married or unmarried, were ordered off the decks; when half way across and again on arrival at New York there were medical inspections in which women were forced to take down their hair and loosen their clothing, while the men had to strip stark naked. Persons arriving in the United States by third-class now are said to have the same courteous treatment that fig extended to Americans when they go aboard.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark27"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark28"></a>Screw </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Sillions Beneath the Waves</span></h6>

<p><span class="font7">Among the treasures recovered by divers were five million dollars in gold from the White Star dominion liner “Laurentic”, which was sunk in 1917 off Fastnet light. The development of salvaging apparatus has been so rapid since the,war that it has even been proposed to </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">try </span><span class="font7">to raise the “Lusitania”; but it is unlikely that this will be done, on. account of. the enormous expense attached to the venture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">During the war the neutral country that suffered the heaviest losses was Norway. During </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font7">years of submarine warfare there were 829 Norwegian vessels sent to the bottom, with 1,162 Norwegian, sailors. Norway had no way to obtain redress for these great and terrible losses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When the war was over and it became </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">ap</span><span class="font7">parent that there were mor® ships in the world Shan could be operated at » grofit, there were at one time about a dozen mysterious disappearances of vessels. It was conjectured that some of these hit floating mines, which may be true; and in some other cases the owners probably put mines into them before they left port, so as to collect the insurance. At least that is the opinion of friends who are familiar with maritime matters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Occasionally there have been real mysteries on the sea, as in the case of the “Marie Celeste”, found off the Azores in 1872, three months after leaving Europe, with all sails set, undamaged, in calm weather, and not a soul aboard. The table was set for dinner; there was still hot coffee in the pot; the captain’s wife had an unfinished waist in the sewing machine; the toys of the captain’s son were on the floor; in the forecastle was a game of playing cards distributed as though left but a moment before. What became of the captain, his family and the crew of ten men is unknown. Six years later the ship disappeared again, with its new crew; and nothing was ever heard from it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Among sunken vessels which it is hoped to sometime recover is the floating palace of th® Emperor Tiberius, which now lies at the bottom of Lake Nemi, seventeen miles from Rome, ft is known that the treasures on this vessel are worth millions of dollars. The plan is to drain the lake and recover the vessel itself along with its precious cargo.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark29"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark30"></a>The Dangers of the Sea</span></h6>
<p><span class="font7">rpHE true deep-water sailor does not feel that A anything that can happen to him on land is a hardship. Nothing is too strange to happen at sea. Some two hundred vessels per year are destroyed by fire, and it is hard to think of anything worse than being out in a stormy sea on a ship that is. afire. It all sounds very well to talk or think about taking to the boats, but there ar® many cases where it is impossible to launch them. Most of these fires are due to spontaneous combustion in the coal bunkers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In the northern seas many a, good ship has gone down because of icebergs, such as sent the “Titanic” to the bottom. In the southern seas<sub>B </sub>around Cape Horn, th® waves are of such prodigious height that nothing in norther®, waters can be compared to them.-</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Last year the four-masted iron full-rigged ■ ship &quot;Garthwxay”, from Ghwgemouth, Scotland^ </span><span class="font10">to </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Iquique, Chile, was compelled to turn back from Cape Horn; and in order to get to Chile had to sail around the world, to the south of Africa </span><span class="font7">and Australia. </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">On </span><span class="font7">the one-way trip, which lasted 519 days, the ship was dismasted twice and had three captains; and when she finally reached Iquique, after a 21,000 mile voyage, the only members of her original crew still on the vessel were the steward, the carpenter, and nine cadets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">On a steamship the firemen are in constant danger from burning oil flying out on them if the vessel is an oil burner, or from the hot coals if the ship is a coal burner. No matter how rough the weather they must keep working, and constantly face the hot slice bars. Sailors on deck are frequently washed overboard or fall from aloft to the deck. The life of Boyd O’Neal, engineer on the steamship “New England”, was saved only because his shipmates sewed seventeen wounds in his abdomen with sail twine and heavy needles and then wrapped his body tightly with adhesive tape. He was injured by the bursting of a steam pipe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The old-time ship’s rigger had one of the most dangerous jobs in the world. It was his duty to go aloft, in rigging known to be weak and defective, remove the damaged parts and replace them with sound material. He was a combined sailor, painter, carpenter, rope expert and trapeze performer; and if he made an error of judgment he often paid for it with his life.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark31"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark32"></a>The Perils Near Shore</span></h6>
<p><span class="font16">N</span><span class="font7">EAR the path of greatest ocean travel, at the entrance of the Strait of Dover, the narrowest part of the English Channel, lie the remains of what was once the island of Domea. This island has been swallowed up by the sea, and the place where it stood is a great bed of quicksand commonly called the Goodwin Sands. So dangerous are these sands that in a single night as many as thirteen large ships have been caught in them and swallowed up.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">On account of the quicksands it has been found impossible to delimit the area, but the British government maintains four lightships </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">on </span><span class="font7">the outer edges of the sands area. These are kept in touch with each other and with the lifesaving stations by wireless. But in spite of all efforts many, many thousands of vessels have </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">been swallowed up in these sands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">On the Pacific </span><span class="font10">coast there Is an uncanny drift </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">of the surface waters toward the mainland that has caused the loss of a hundred vessels in the </span><span class="font7">last twenty years. The west coast of America is gradually sinking, even as the east coast </span><span class="font10">is </span><span class="font7">rising. In foggy or bad weather a ship may gradually drift nearer and nearer the land until it runs aground, when it is supposed that it is still safe out at sea.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">New York City has one of the grandest harbors in the world, and yet it takes longer to train to be a Sandy Hook pilot than it does to be a physician or a lawyer. The apprentice period is seven years; and then come four years more of progressive rank for vessels of 18-foot draft, then 24-foot and then 28-foot. The pilot becomes so familiar with the soundings that in any kind of weather, day or night, he can see with his mind’s eye the topographical map of the harbor’s bottom, with all its hillocks, swales, cliffs and jutting rocks, and know just where to steer hig course.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark33"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark34"></a>The Destructive Teredo</span></h6>
<p><span class="font16">E</span><span class="font7">VERYTHING in nature has its enemies, bent upon its destruction. It seems strange that this should be true of an inanimate tiling like the shipping business, but nothing less can be claimed for the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Teredo,</span><span class="font7"> or ship-worm, which has been one of the greatest foes of mariners in all ages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Teredo, which is related to the clam or mussel family, enters into the wood of a ship or dock through a hole no larger than a pin. Having once entered, its presence can be detected only by cutting the timber. It grows and grows on sewage and such other choice morsels as are to be found about the docks of great cities. It multiplies like the multiplication table, and in some waters attains a diameter of an inch and a length of as much as four feet. It eats tho whole interior out of timber, and often the only warning is the collapse of the timber.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Various methods have been taken to circumvent the Teredo. The Phoenicians coated their vessels with pitch, and the Norsemen charred theirs. The modern ship-builder sheathes the vessel with copper. The Hollanders protect their docks by driving them full of iron nails with huge heads. The modern method is to boil the dock timber in creosote until it absorbs </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">twelve or fourteen pounds per cubic foot </span><span class="font10">But </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">after a few years the creosote leaches out, and the Teredo enjoys </span><span class="font7">his feast as much as ever. Piles which are wholly unprotected sometimes </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">last but a few months.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark35"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark36"></a>The Rule of the Sea</span></h6>
<p><span class="font7">rOHE rule of the sea is that the saving of hu-•*- man life is the first consideration. When the “Volturno” burned in midocean in 1913, ten vessels raced to her assistance from every point of the compass; and although the seas were angry and the wind was blowing a gale they managed to save 521 of the 657 persons that were aboard. On that occasion the captain of the “Volturno” stuck to his post and faced the intense heat of the burning vessel until, when his turn came to be rescued, he was no longer able to see. The Lascar firemen came up from the boiler room because it was impossible for human beings to stand the heat, so they said; but the British sailors went down in their stead and stayed to the end. Of such stuff ar© the British made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The pathos of it is that sometimes every possible effort is made to reach a sinking ship, but time and the seas make all efforts vain. When the &quot;Titanic” went down, aid was coming to her from every point within a circle of hundreds of miles; but none of the vessels arrived in time. When the Japanese steamer “Raifuku Maru” went down in the same waters last spring both the “Tuscania” and the “Homeric” were rushing toward her, and were near enough to see the boat go down and the crew drown; but they bad not the time to do anything. The “Raifuku Maru” was a strictly modern ship, with electric lights and wireless. The last word from the sinking vessel was the quaint radio message in broken English, “N ow very danger.” In a few minutes all was over. Thirty-eight men sank with the ship. ■</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark37"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark38"></a>Safety Depends on Personnel</span></h6>
<p><span class="font16">T</span><span class="font7">HE safety of all the persons on a vessel depends upon the kind of men who have the vessel in hand. If the men are well trained in their duties, and if all speak the same tongue, the task of keeping afloat or of knowing what to do in an emergency is much simplified. When the British steamer “Egypt” was rammed off the coast of France, she had a European crew of 86 and a non-European crew of 208. It was twenty minutes before the vessel sank; and in </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">that time, if all the crew had been Europeans and properly drilled, not a Mie need have been lost.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In order to keep expenses of operation down it is the custom of ship owners to employ a considerable number of Asiatics. This is even true of American vessels; and when these Asiatics are from the Philippines and are American citizens there is no legal way of barring their employment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As the British and the American people object to crews which have many Asiatics or Africans, so the Asiatics themselves, on boats in their own waters, want only Asiatics, from the captain down. Chinese sailors a few years ago won a strike against the then prevailing system of hiring mixed crews through a laborcontracting agency which charged a commission of about one-third the wages made on the job.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">American ships carrying U. S. mail are required by law to be manned by at least forty-five percent American citizens; sixty-five percent of the deck crew must be men with at least three years’ experience on deck; seventy-five percent of the crew in each department of the ship must be able t© understand the language of the officers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Under the British Navigation Act no person may be engaged as a deck or engineer officer in any British ship who is not a British subject and fully conversant with the English language; nor may any person be engaged as a seaman who does not possess a working knowledge of the English language sufficient for him to understand any orders that may be given to him in the performance of his duty. Boarding-house labor agents are forbidden to hire seamen for duty on either British or American vessels.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark39"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark40"></a>Wages and Working Conditions</span></h6>
<p><span class="font16">I</span><span class="font7">T IS not so long ago .since sailors were virtually prisoners on board the vessels on which they sailed, but conditions are gradually improving. The Sailors’ Unions have succeeded in bringing about better wages for themselves, shorter hours, better food, larger quarters, proper treatment, right to quit vessels in port, freedom from attachment of wages and clothing, and many other desiderata.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">For several reasons, including the higher rates of wages paid to seamen, vessels operating under the United States flag have a hard time to make a profit. But for some strange reason, although many believe it would be the only way for America to maintain a merchant marine, American labor has always opposed the payment of part of their wages by the government. They say that any form of subsidy is the granting of a special privilege to some men to fill their pockets at the expense of others, through the forms of law. They seem to overlook the fact that other governments do this right along.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">On the maiden voyage of the “Aquitania” the Cunard Company permitted two hundred of their clerks to sail as stewards, but on the vessel’s return to Southampton the clerks were glad to get back to their desks. They found the hours long and the stories about large tips exaggerated. The United States Controller of the Treasury limits the tips of embassy attaches to $5 for cabin and dining-room stewards for the voyage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Shipping Contact with Government</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">TN </span><span class="font7">THE nature of things ocean-going vessels </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font7">come in contact with the governments wherever they go. When a shipmaster arrives with his cargo in the United States he may come in contact with as many as six departments of the federal government and ten governmental bureaus. It is hoped to correct this situation by having a new' department of the government, </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font7">Department of Marine, headed by a Secretary of Marine, which will have jurisdiction over everything of this nature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One important branch of the Treasury Department is what is known as the United States Coast Guard, which is a combination of the United States Revenue Cutter Service and the United States Life-Saving Service. Its duties are to prevent smuggling, to lend aid to vessels in distress, to locate and destroy derelicts, to supply medical assistance to fishermen, and to maintain an international iee patrol in the North Atlantic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One life-saver in the employ of the government is accredited with having saved over 500 lives during his several terms of service. Just now the Coast Guard is busy with the “Rum Fleet”. While the Coast Guard is required to relieve only such distress as occurs on navigable waters, yet it is the firm policy of the Guard never. to ignore a call of Buffering humanity anywhere. The </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">U. S. Marine Hospitals main</span><span class="font7">tain a wireless service which gives advice to vessels anywhere within reach as </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">to how to </span><span class="font7">treat cases reported to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">From </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">1795 to </span><span class="font7">1830 inclusive, </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">ninety percent of </span><span class="font7">America’s overseas traffic </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">was carried in </span><span class="font7">America’s own ships. </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">By the outbreak of th® </span><span class="font7">Civil War it had dropped t© sixty-six </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">percent. </span><span class="font7">The ivar finished the job, and from 1900 to </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">1914 </span><span class="font7">the percentage carried </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">was only one-tenth what </span><span class="font7">it had been a hundred years before.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There have been many efforts to revive </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font7">United States merchant marine, </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">but </span><span class="font7">it </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">does not </span><span class="font7">revive. Government operation of vessels does not seem to be a success anywhere. The thing has been tried out faithfully by Canada, </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Aus</span><span class="font7">tralia and the United States; and the result </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font7">each case has been the same—-dismal failure.</span></p>

<p><span class="font16">O</span><span class="font7">UR readers are aware that </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">we </span><span class="font7">never </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">had </span><span class="font7">bright hopes for the United States merchant marine. This is not </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">because American </span><span class="font7">ships and American sailors are </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">not the equal </span><span class="font7">of any in the world, but because Americans will not ship their goods in American ships, and both British and American public opinion do everything humanly possible to belittle and destroy the enterprise. It is true that the </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">U. S. </span><span class="font7">vessels were made during the peak of war inflation. Some of them were not made well. All of them cost more than they should. More of them were made than could be used. They </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">de</span><span class="font7">preciate rapidly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Idle tonnage in the United States alone costs the taxpayers over $7,300,000 a year for upkeep. The effort on the part of the Shipping Board to maintain and operate 387 ships, which represent only one-third of the tonnage under its control, resulted in a loss during the last fiscal year of $36,739,000. The world’s idle ocean tonnage in 1925 was about half what it was in 1922. Only about one-third of American, exports and imports are now carried in United States vessels, but all British goods are carried in British ships and all French goods in French ships.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Great Lakes are very proud of the part which they play in the carriage of goods. It is pointed out that the Great Lakes in 1914 had one-half of the entire steam tonnage of the country, and that if it were left to the railroads </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">to transport all the goods which go by lake</span></p>

<h6><a name="bookmark43"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark44"></a>Items About the Shipping Board ‘</span></h6>
<p><span class="font16">W</span><span class="font7">E DO not attempt to say why the operation of a merchant marine by the United States government is so unprofitable, or why both Canada and Australia in the same years had the same kind of record; but we give a few items which are of more or less interest to our readers:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Shortly before the war, when Mr. Morse was </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font7">convict at Atlanta prison, he bought from the government for $175,000 a shi;<sub>z</sub> built with public money. This ship he arranged to sell to a foreign country. She was sunk, and the United States Shipping Board awarded Mr. Morse $400,000 damages for the loss of his ship-—more than twice what he had paid the government for it a short time before. Reported by Universal Service in 1920.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Shipping Board has been a rapidly changing body. No one seems to be able or to care to stay in it any length of time. It seems to have been taken for granted that nobody could make anything of the fleet. In Britain everything possible is done to help the merchant marine; in the United States exactly the reverse is true. Some have compared the whole Board to a turnstile, so rapidly have men passed into and out of its most important positions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In 1920, when the public first began to know something of what had been done to them during the war, the magazine </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Reconstruction</span><span class="font7"> called attention to the $12 per day paid to common labor in the shipyards, with one and one-half to two and one-half hours pay for every hour of overtime.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">For heating-tongs which cost sixty cents the contractors charged ninety cents plus their profit. For backing-out punches which cost ninety cents they charged $2.24 and added their profit. In one small yard they put 400 dummies on the payroll every week, and in one single week the number jumped up to 526. Ships built by this method cost $320 to $400 per ton to build as against $75 per ton in less patriotic times.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The patriots of the country rushed into the shipyards with such reckless resolve to participate in the tapioca that in the fall of 1920 the</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">i. a year, engaged in an attempt to straighten ouf -the </span><span class="font7">tangle </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">of building accounts of the Emar* </span><span class="font7">gency Fleet </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Corporation.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The High Cost of Patriotism</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">rpHE patriots were not all engaged in building the ships. Some were engaged in operating them. On this point Philip Manson, president of the Pacific and Manson Steamship Company, said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There was turned over to American shipping interest^-free of all costs to them, a fleet of over 1,500 vessel^ including some of the finest passenger ships afloat. Not only have American shipping interests had the free </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">use </span><span class="font5">of this fleet of ships which has cost the American people over four billions of dollars, but the shipping interests to which these ships were turned over for operation received in addition from the government hundreds of millions of dollars in cash to cover alleged losses in the operation of these ships, notwithstanding that during much of the period during which they have had these ships, high freight rates prevailed and large profits should easily have been earned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Nevertheless, the high cost of building American ships and of keeping them in repair has been a fatal handicap. The initial cost of building in the United States is twenty-five to thirty-three percent higher than abroad. Also, the cost of repairing a vessel in the United States is proportionately higher, and on account of the existing law which imposes a tax of fifty percent on the cost of all repairs in foreign ports, the American shipowner cannot take advantage , of the lower costs abroad. Some of the war-time vessels were very inferior and the repair bills were heavy; but most of the vessels now in the service are the equal of any afloat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In the year 1923 competition on the high seas was so keen that American privately-owned vessels were driven into the coastal trade. In that year Captain Dollar, an American shipowner, pointed out that England measures ships to the advantage of shipowners, while the United States does the reverse. He mentioned two sister ships, one registered under the British flag and the other American. The American vessel pays $500 more than its British ; sister every time it passes through our own Panama Canal. Early in 1923 the U. S. Shipping Board was losing four million dollars </span><span class="font10">a </span><span class="font7">month in the operation of its vessels. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;?</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark45"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark46"></a>History of the Past Two.Years</span></h6>
<p><span class="font16">I</span><span class="font7">N 1924 the Shipping Board sold the steamship “City of Los Angeles” for $100,000. This was after the Board had spent $4,677,001 on the vessel. The Los Angeles Steamship Company was-the only bidder. Apparently they did not lose much on their purchase; for the Board had already lost all there was to lose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In the early part of 1924 the Board boasted that its gross profits on the first trip of the &quot;Leviathan” were $379,000, but it forgot to mention that the invested capital was $20,000,000, and that the interest charges on this amount, together with depreciation, repairs, insurance, advertising and overhead expenses would eat the profit all up.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In 1924 American business men were urged to use United States vessels; but United States Senator Ransdell of Louisiana brought to light the fact that secret agreements exist between a score of American trunk lines and foreign steamship companies by which the roads agree to give these foreign ships free dock facilities, ■ell them coal at lower cost, than to Americans, and assist in securing reductions for these foreign companies in city, county and harbor taxes. At the very time that the patriotic railroad managers of the country were receiving funds from the United States Treasury they were utilizing their resources to prevent the government’s shipping program from becoming a success.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The North Atlantic Steamship Conference, representing the twenty-five principal lines plying between the two hemispheres, is one of the most powerful organizations in the world. This Conference fixes the rates for freight and passenger service between the two continents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Hog Island shipyard, which cost the government more than $66,000,000 and whose name is thoroughly descriptive of what was done to tiie American people daring the shipbuilding orgy, is said to be for sale. .The finish of the American Merchant Marine and the successful outcome of British propaganda to put American shippers again wholly in their power, is proba* bly not far off.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark47"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark48"></a>As to Shipping Elsewhere</span></h6>
<p><span class="font16">G</span><span class="font7">ERMAN tonnage before the war was 5,038,’ 000. After the war it was only about 400,000 tons, mostly in small vessels; but by tho close of 1924 Germany bad 2,856,000 tons, and even in 1923 Hamburg had regained its old position as the greatest shipping center on the European continent. At that time the Hamburg-American line had-regained thirty percent of. its pre-war tonnage. Antwerp and Rotterdam each handle nearly as much tonnage as Hamburg.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The British shipyards are feeling more and more the great- strain of the situation created by the war. Work which was greatly needed in Britain has gone to Dutch and Belgian yards, with not much of it to go anywhere; for there; is little need for new ships and little money with which to build them. Only ten vessels of over 15,000 tons were launched during 1924. All of these were built in Great Britain and Ireland.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The world has now 338 steamers and motorships of 10,000 tons each and upwards. Of these, 198 fly the British flag. Britain continues to rule the sea. The following is </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font7"> comparison of the tonnages of the principal maritime countries :</span></p>

They have a good crop this year, which will revive their courage and help to bring in tome fresh immigration from England and the continent of Europe; but, in my opinion, without this steady flow of the most precious of materials (human labor) the golf-players and retired farmers of Canada would be lonesome, to say nothing of the ruling giant </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">•r </span><span class="font5">giants that have the country in their grasp.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Another subscriber writes:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">1 have read quite a few articles about Western Canada, but I have never seen a more truthful description ®f it than Mr. Bogard has presented. 1 should say that seventy-five percent leave during the first three years, This is not imagination; for I was secretary-treasures of a school district for years, and know that most of the homesteads changed hands five or six times, by being thrown hack on the government’s hands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Most of the Polish and Russian settlers succeed, but for the first fifteen or twenty years they live or exist in * way in which no other people could. For instance, a son of a Russian settler whose father is now quite well to do, stopped at my place tor the night. The next morning I asked him how he had dept, and he told me that this was the first night he had ever slept in a real bed. And it was only a cheap spring and mattress, bs* cause I could not afford much myself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Mr. Bogard, in his rebuttal, contents himself with citing the following paragraph from Golden Age No. 134, wherein a correspondent writes of a trip through a certain section of Southern Alberta and says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There had been no crops year after year, and only ten percent of the farms were inhabited. I traveled for twenty-five miles at a stretch with Imuses on both sides of the road without an inhabitant. I never could have believed such exists had I not seen it myself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">On the same page is quoted a newspaper despatch from Shuanavon, Saskatchewan, concerning a trip of a local barrister:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Conditions in Southern Alberta are reported as being most pitiable, fields being absolutely without a sign of vegetation for scores of miles. A procession of caravans was seen at different points, farmers pulling out to seek new homes in Northern Alberta or in the United States. Others were moving but had no particular destination.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">My worst dog experiences all happened in the city of Los Angeles, where two collies, one Airedale and one bull terrier jumped at me, while canvassing. So often, on the gates one is met with the sign, “Beware of the Dog.” And indeed, you had better beware; for sometimes they are regular man-eaters. In one instance where this sign appeared on the gate, I looked through and, seeing the dog chained, ventured inside. Such a commotion! I could not tell you the breed of dog, but I would call him the Large-and-Feroeious. Seemingly his only desire in life, at that moment was to tear me to fragments. Soon an agitated woman appeared and said: “Lady, get outside quickly, or the dog will make mince-meat out of you.” “But,” I protested, &quot;the dog is tied.” &quot;But,” she an-</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">We had our first snowstorm here in Nebraska that day also. There was over an inch of snow, which melted before evening. It certainly was strange to find these tiny blossoms protruding out of the snow and at this time of the year, as they generally are through blooming the first part of May. I am sorry a spray could not have been mailed to you, for they were so dainty and so much smaller than the spring clusters. Each one was so perfect, and the perfume so much stronger than on the spring flowers. But they were completely ruined by the heavy frost we had that night.

<p><span class="font16">T</span><span class="font7">HE following is in reference to the article by J. A. Bohnet, in The Gownn Act, Number 159, on ‘(Handling the Kiddies”, to answer th® question, &quot;What does an old bachelor know about handling children?” Much will depend ®n what is meant by handling. Thia worthy old bachelor handled the first two cases he cited much as th® Tea Pot Dome ease was handled and .asProhiMtiw is.being handled by the Stet® Jtegartamt</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A Christian parent, wing th® spirit of a sound mind, will not use bribery to obtain any end. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Disobedience is developed in children by on® of three methods: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7">1. Threatening to punish a child for disobedience and then failing to do so.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7">2. Neglecting through parental pride to discipline children before others. <sup>ff</sup>Johnny is such a dgriffigj he is </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">so ©atefM does not know aoj </span><span class="font7">better; his mother's little treasure.&quot; Therefore Johnny is allowed to disturb the meeting, just to show him off,</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7">3. Bribing a child to do right Invariably the child will learn to exact a larger bribe each time.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7">The first two instances mentioned by the old bachelor fall under method number three, and are very wrong; they should have no place in a parent’s work of training a child to be pleasing to the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The third instance, that of putting the baby’s head under the spigot to quiet it, is amusing. But it furnished me with a good suggestion. The next time this &quot;old bachelor” is entertained in my home and annoys me by opening all the windows and doors in freezing weather, and insists on getting to the meeting place an hour or two before time, I shall turn the hose on him. I hope the result will be as satisfactory as it was with the little baby he mentioned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Hundreds and hundreds of mothers know enough to give their children plenty of fresh water and not to burden them with overmuch clothing. </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Doubtless they have been so busy try</span><span class="font7">ing to get others to do the same that they </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">find no </span><span class="font7">time to brag about it in the magazines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Instance four, Sir Bachelor, is where </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">we </span><span class="font7">mothers have a good laugh at your expense. Ten teaspoons of water at one time to a two months’ old baby! Even the baby saw the joke and smiled. O you bachelor! If you expect to be any help to mothers, get yourself any one </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font7">the scores of books on child training (not a book on medicine; modern mothers do not study medicine) and read it thoroughly. Then borrow </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font7">baby and care for it fifteen hours a day for three hundred and sixty-five days. By that time you will be able to read again the article you have written and smile.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">To the readers of The Golden Age: Do not think that I would uphold any mother for allowing her children to be a disturbance. Far from it. We parents must remember the scripture which says: “Obedience is better than sacrifice.” But I sincerely hope that no one will try to handle a child by following the old bachelor’s advice.</span></p>

<p><span class="font16">T</span><span class="font7">HE October 21st issue of The Golden Age was received today; and the first article I read was entitled “Handling the Kiddies”. Every word of it appeals to me as sound and good judgment, merely emphasizing how thoughtless we are in some of the smaller matters associated with handling children, and thus causing unnecessary anxiety and unpleasantness. I have often felt that the rearing of a boy should be the father’s joy, and he should regard it as a pleasure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We have a boy next door who is seemingly rude and unruly; and it has been a revelation to note how good words and encouragement along proper lines help to bring forth from a young man otherwise undesirable, the grandest of traits, making him willing and eager to obey.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark168"></a><span class="font10"><a name="bookmark169"></a>The Strings of the Violin </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">By Robert E. Armstrong</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7">ALL the instruments; of music ever per-vJ’ fected the violin ranks first. It is easily the queen of the orchestra. Within its bosom are the pathos of sorrow, the glad note of joy, the burning heat of desire, the soft melody of love, the wail of distress. In the hands of a master the violin is a voice, speaking the hopes, the aspirations, the fears and the conflicts of the human soul. Only the human voice has the freedom of expression to be found in the violin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">These lives of ours are violins giving forth music, sometimes discordant, sometimes full of melody. It makes all the difference in the woria who draws forth the notes. If the master’s hand is upon the instrument the notes are sweet and musical. If lesser hands touch the strings, the notes are not so sweet nor sb full of music.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Four strings upon the violin produce the medium for the music. As these strings are touched by the finger and the bow, there is drawn from within the violin the notes that reflect the heart and soul of the player. The more the man is master of his instrument, the more that instrument speaks the soul of the man. </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">In tha</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">: HmsWfc. Kas'ds the violin becomes a </span><span class="font7">living </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">tking, animate with the spirit and the soul of the master. These </span><span class="font7">four strings become vocal </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">chords uttering in </span><span class="font7">choicest language the feel-</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">* tags of the heart.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The </span><span class="font7">first of these four strings, to commence </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">at </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">the right, is the E. Upon </span><span class="font7">it are played the </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">higher notes, </span><span class="font7">those long runs that climb up </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">higher and </span><span class="font7">hiw j like birds seeking high hea</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">ven. </span><span class="font7">The E string vibrates with the more joy-«us music. It is full of energy and life. The dancing fairies and the whispering winds find </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">their </span><span class="font7">tongue in this little thread. Upon it are produced the rustling of the leaves of trees in </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font7">forest, the music of the falling waters, the whisper of the angels. Upon it are produced the stirring calls to life and energy, the upward push and surge, the aspirations of the soul.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Is there an E string to this instrument which we call life? I find that there is. It is Faith. Faith * is the string that draws forth from within us those high aspiring notes that draw us onward and upward. Faith is the string upon which the music of life and energy is played. When faith 1b broken, only the lower registry of the instrument is of use. The whispering of trees, the babbling of brooks, the twitter of birds, give way to the somberness of the other strings of the instrument. Faith is the E string upon which the very highest hopes may find expression, through which the deepest desires of the eoul ean find their utterance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The A string comes next. It is a strong Btring which gives forth a beautifully melodious tone. Whereas the E string often breaks, the A Btring seldom does. Upon it is played much of </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font7">sweet melody, the body of the song. The strong martial notes find their finest response coming from the A string. One feels a strength and sureness there, a dependability. One ean even use the A string in the case of an emergency to fulfil part, at least, of the mission of the E string. One cannot soar quite so high, nor be quite so jubilant, but the faithful A string gives of its best, and without it the E string would be of little use.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There is </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">an </span><span class="font7">A string on this instrument </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">we call </span><span class="font7">life. It is the String of Service, to bring the melody and the harmony into life. Faith </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">is of little use </span><span class="font7">without service. Faith depends </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">upon service to </span><span class="font7">keep it </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">sweet </span><span class="font7">and strong, as in </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">ths words of the hymn;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In work that keeps faith- sweet end -strong.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is service that makes life ring with a qufei melody that speaks of inner peace. It is service that enriches all of the higher string.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The next string of the violin is D, still stronger, seldom breaking, giving resonance and power to the tones of the violin. It- is the D string - that gives most towards body and richness of tone for the instrument. Upon it may be played the deeper melodies of life. Upon it is usually played the quieter lullaby of trie mother. There is not the flexity to the D string that there is to the A or the E; but there is a strength and a depth of tone that make a most important contribution to the richness and the beauty of the music.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The D string of the instrument of life is Friendship; not a sham or superficial type of friendship, but the real friendship that binds heart to heart and purpose to purpose, strong as steel and seldom breaking. Friendship gives resonance and power to the tones of life. The man who has no friends lacks depth and power. His instrument of life is a shell giving forth only a dry, cracked sound. The strength of the D string is gone. The richness of tone is lacking. Even the tenderer notes of the quiet songs of love are missing. The instrument of life is not complete without the D of Friendship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The fourth string is G, which is unlike its fellows, in that it is wound with silver wire. The G string gives ns the background and the depth to the tones of the violin. A master often plays his violin without the E string. I have never heard a man attempt to play without the G string. The beauty and tone of the instrument depends in large measure upon the background formed by the G string. Even when not actually played upon it is giving a contribution to the music in the sympathetic undertones produced, when other strings are used. The master knows the value of playing accurately in order to produce the full value of those undertones which come in largest measure from the G string.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">What is the G string of this instrument o* life? It is-GOD. God is the background of life, the Giver of depth and tones of life. Without God we lose the richness of the undertone, those echoing notes reflecting the fulness of divinity Without God the other strings of life are fiat and valueless. The beauty and tone of life depend upon God.. When the instrument of life is rightly used God speaks in every tone that played. The G string of our being vibrates in response to the tones of the D and the A and the E.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">So we have the four strings of the violin covering all the range of the human experience, upon which one can bring forth the full language of the soul. But one string alone upon the instrument is not of much use. Each string contributes to the full value of the other three. Each string has its specific as well as contributing value.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Energy and life are good. But energy and life are much stronger and better when braced by service and friendship based upon God. God is powerful. But God does not perform His work here without His children to help Him. Ue depends upon the full-toned instrument.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Once in a while the musician finds a defective string upon his instrument. It cannot be rightly tuned. It gives a jarring note. It fails to harmonize with the other strings. That string is east aside. So it must be with every string upon the instrument of life that does not harmonize with faith, friendship, service, and God. The false string will spoil the beauty and tone of all the other three strings. If we would have the rich full tone of life we must see that our instrument is strung with true strings, free from the harsh and jarring notes of insincerity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Of course there are various kinds of violins. The Stradivarius, the Amati, are instruments of almost perfect form and beauty. One pays thousands of dollars for instruments of that kind. But one can pay five dollars and get an imitation of them. Not ail violins have the same value. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We see about </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">as there </span><span class="font7">faBteraa^ats of lif^ </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">some rare and rich, others cheap and apparent, ly valueless. The instruments are not all thi </span><span class="font7">same. Even instruments of the </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">same value giv® </span><span class="font7">forth different sounds. The Amati </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">may bring </span><span class="font7">the same price as the Stradivarius, but </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">the tons </span><span class="font7">will be different.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Yet, put </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font7">poor instrument into the </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">hands of </span><span class="font7">a master and the rarest tones win issue forth. But let the finest instrument be plaeed in ths hands of a novice, and it will sound like mail order product. The passengers of an ocean liner were harassed by the screechings and wailings of a violin in the hands of an unskilled player in the steerage. One day a man went down to the steerage deck, took the cheap instrument in his hands, adjusted a string or two, and placed the violin under his chin. Ah! the soul of an artist spoke then from the despised instrument, which brought tears to the eyes of those who stood by. Ole Bull was a master.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">All of us are potential Stradivarii.

<p><span class="font16">W</span><span class="font7">E HAVE before us a copy of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Our Missions, </span><span class="font7">a journal- devoted to Catholic missions in the interior of China. A photograph sb ws a gJbup composed of Bishop Buddenbrock and eight missionaries and reveals the fact that in the Far East Catholic priests do not shave. All have full beards, which make them look strange. The article states that a journey of 150 miles by cart in the interior of China costs $65.00 -The progress is seldom more than two miles an </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">bear. At </span><span class="font7">night the traveler and liis mule occupy the same room with some Chinese family. The “father” who writes the article says naively:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Christians received medals, rosaries, and holy pictures, which I brought with me; and behold, the mission is now in full progress! Ab my supply of religious articles is at present exhausted, I trust some generous reader is in a position to renew the supply; for these articles of devotion are a very useful and in-despensable aid to the missionary. They are necessary to supplant the superstitious amulet of the natives; and besides, they bring God’s grace and blaring.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">[Radiocast from Watchtower WBBR on a ware length of 272.9 meters, by Judge Rutherford.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">O</span><span class="font7">N THE same occasion when our Lord said to Peter: &quot;Upon this rock I will build my church,” etc., He also said: &quot;And I will give Unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth, shall </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">be </span><span class="font7">bound in heaven; and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth, shall be loosed in heaven.&quot;— Matthew 16:18,19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There are millions of good honest Catholics who in all good conscience believe that this scripture means that St. Peter was by these words of the Lord given supreme authority over the church; that the pope of Rome is the successor of St. Peter; and that therefore the pope of Rome is the supreme ruler over the church.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Commenting upon this text the distinguished and venerable Cardinal Gibbons, in his book &quot;The Faith of Our Fathers&quot;, on page 97 says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When He [the Lord] says to Peter: “I will give to thee the keys,” </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">etc.,</span><span class="font5"> He evidently means: I will give the supreme authority over My church, which is the citadel of faith, My earthly Jerusalem. Thou and thy successors shall be My visible representatives to the end of time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">And again the same authority on page 105, paragraph two, says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Whatever privileges, therefore, were conferred on Peter which may be considered essential to the government of the Church are inherited by the Bishops of Borne, as successors of the Prince of the Apostles; just *s the constitutional powers given to George Washington have devolved on the present incumbent of th® Presidential chair.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But did the Lord by the words in the text quoted mean that He would give St. Peter the supreme authority over the church 1 The Scriptures make it quite plain that such was not the purpose and intention of the Lord. His words: &quot;I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven&quot; etc., without doubt relate to a knowledge of the divine plan for the development of the kingdom of heaven.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The words “kingdom of heaven&quot; apply primarily to the royal family of heaven, of which Christ Jesus is the Head, and of which St. Peter is a part.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Lord at all times spoke to the disciples in parables and dark sayings. He often spoke of the kingdom of heaven, and in each instance He used a parable. In Mark 4:33,34 we read:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">'And with many such parables spake he this word unto them, as they were able to hear it. But without a parable spake he not unto them.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Now what was the purpose of this! The answer is found in Matthew 13: 34, 35: “And without a parable spake he not unto them; that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying, I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The things pertaining to the kingdom of God were entirely a mystery from ages and ages, and first began to be made known unto the apostles. This is made clear by the words of St. Paul in Colossians 1:26 and 27: “Even the mystery which hath been hid from ages and from generations, but now is made manifest to his saints: to whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you, the hope of glory.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Not even the disciples understood the meaning of the kingdom of heaven until Pentecost, when they were given the holy spirit. There is where the saints began to understand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The word key in our text does not represent supreme authority, but it does represent the means of opening or closing that which is locked. The secret of God concerning His heavenly kingdom was locked, as we have seen from these scriptures preceding. No one could understand the Lord’s words unless by His permission. What the Lord Jesus meant by the use of the word “keys&quot; maybe better understood by His own words expressed on another occasion when He addressed the Pharisees, who were the doctors of the law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Pharisees constituted the clergy of Jesus’ time. They were lawyers in this sense, that it was their duty and obligation to daily read the law to the people. (Leviticus 10:11; Malachi 2:7) These clergymen, or doctors of the law, neglected their duty. They ignored the law of God and taught their own wisdom, just as do their counterpart, their successors, the clergy of our present time. These modern ones have entirely ignored the teachings of Jesus and the apostles; and by so doing they have kept the people in ignorance of the truth concerning the kingdom of heaven. Their predecessors, the</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Pharisees, or doctors of the law, by their unfaithfulness in failing to teach the people the law that God gave to them through Moses thereby took away from the. people the key of knowl</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">edge. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">God had specifically set forth in His law what the Jewish people must do; and if they were ignorant of this, they could not obey.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When Jesus came He plainly told these clergymen of their unfaithfulness. In a scathing denunciation of them and their unfaithfulness, He said in Luke 11: 52: “Woe unto you, lawyers ! for ye have taken away </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">the key of knowledge</span><span class="font7"> : ye entered not [the kingdom] yourselves, and them that were entering in ye hindered.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Here Jesus definitely shows that key is used as a symbol and symbolically means the power to open to others, given to those entrusted with its care a knowledge of God’s way or plan of salvation. It does not mean supreme authority-over the church by any means. Supreme authority over the church resides in Jesus Christ, who is the Head over the church, which is His body.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Now when Jesus told St. Peter that He would give him the of the kingdom of heaven, for the reason above stated St. Peter did not understand. Forty days after the resurrection of our Lord He met with His disciples on the ride of the Mount of Olives, just before His ascension into heaven. There, as set forth in Acts 1:4, He commanded that they should remain at Jerusalem until they received the holy spirit, as promised. <sup>v</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font7">His words to them a short time before His crucifixion were: “When he, the spirit of truth is come, he will guide you into all truth.” Then Jesus said unto His assembled disciples, just before his ascension: &quot;Ye shall receive power, after that the holy spirit is come upon you; and ye shall be witnesses unto me, both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth.”-—Acts 1:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The disciples waited at Jerusalem. Ten days later when assembled together they received the holy spirit. It is written in Acts 2:4: “And they were all filled with the holy spirit, and began to speak with other tongues, as the spirit gave them uttemiee.”<sup>!</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Here was th® time «®,d ghee where St Peter</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">•received and used.one of the </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">keys...-Here was the </span><span class="font7">first time St. Peter understood what </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font7">Lord meant by committing to </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">him </span><span class="font7">the </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">keys of </span><span class="font7">the kingdom of heaven.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">You will notice that th® word &quot;keys” is in the plural, which would signify more than one. The facts show there were two, in this: One he used with which to unlock to the Jews the great truths of God’s plan; the other he used to unlock' the same great storehouse of knowledge to the Gentiles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Lord had chosen St. Peter as His messenger for this purpose; and bo on this occasion the Apostle Peter, begotten and anointed, illuminated with the. holy spirit, began to perform this duty. Some of the Jews who heard the disciples speaking said that they were drunk. In Acts 2:14 it is recorded: “But Peter, standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice, and said unto them, Ye men of Judea, and aH y® that dwell at Jerusalem, be this known unto you, and hearken unto my words; for these ar® not drunken, as ye suppose, seeing it is tat th® third hour of the day.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">He then told them that the disciples were not drunk, but that this was a manifestation of th® holy spirit. As shown in Acts 2: 22-40, St. Peter then and there told these Jews that Jesus of Nazareth was the Approved One of God; that He was the great Messiah, for whom they had looked; that the Jews had caused him to bo put to death; and that God had raised Him up out of death and exalted Him to His right hand; and that this was the reason why the holy spirit was shed upon the disciples.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Then St. Peter says to the Jews; “Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that-God hath made that same Jesus, whom ye have crucified., both Lord and Christ. Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart, and said unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles. Men and brethren, what shall w® do! Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ, for the remission of.sins, and ye shall reeeiv® the gift of the holy spirit. For the promise I® unto you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord ©ur .Goc! shall call. And with many other words did h® testify and exhort, saying, Save yourselves from this untoward generation. . And they continued steadfastly in the apostles’ dcetnae and fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and In prayers.”—Acts 2:36-40,42.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It was on this same occasion that St. Peter used the key to unlock to the Jews the mystery of God, that they might know the way to the heavenly kingdom. He further said (Acts 3: 18-26):</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“But those things, which God before had shewed by the mouth of all his prophets, that Christ should suffer, he hath so fulfilled. Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the face of the Lord; and </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">he </span><span class="font7">shall send Jesus Christ, which before was preached unto you: whom the heaven must retain until the times of restitution of all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began. For Moses truly said unto the fathers, A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me; him shall ye hear in all things whatsoever he shall say unto you. And it shall come to pass, that every soul, which will not hear that prophet, shall be destroyed from among the people. Yea, and all the prophets from Samuel, and those that follow after, as many as have spoken, have likewise foretold of these days. Ye are the children of the prophets, and of the covenant which God made with our fathers, saying unto Abraham, And in thy seed shall all the kindreds of the earth be blessed. Unto you first, God, having raised up his Son Jesus, sent him to bless you, in turning away every one of you from his iniquities.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It was on this same occasion that Peter for the first time understood what the Lord had meant when He said: “Upon this rock I will build my church.” We know this because upon this occasion, speaking to the same company of Jews Peter said (Acts 4:10-12): “Be it known unto you all, and to all the people </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">oi </span><span class="font7">Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye crucified, whom God raised from the dead, even by him doth this man stand here before you whole. This is the stone which was set at nought of you builders, which is become the head of the corner. Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">we </span><span class="font7">must be saved.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">There is nothing in these words to indicate that Peter himself was given supreme authority </span><span class="font7">over the church; but his words, on the contrary, show that the Lord is the chief one, and the one who has authority, and who is the founds-tion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Now even the apostles for some time thought that the Jews only were the ones to receive the gospel. For three and one-half years the teaching of the gospel of the kingdom of God was confined to the Jews alone. But in the Lord’s own due time He showed Peter what he must do; and that the time had come for him to use the other key to the kingdom of heaven and to unlock this mystery to the Gentiles, that they too might have an opportunity to follow in the footsteps of Jesus, and enter the kingdom. They could not follow the Lord's footsteps until they had the knowledge,</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">St. Peter was on this occasion stopping at the house of Simon the Tanner, at what is now known as Jaffa, Palestine. There while asleep the Lord gave him a vision in a dream, and revealed to him that it was time for him to carry the message of the kingdom of heaven to the Gentiles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">For some time Cornelius, a Gentile, had been praying to God. Cornelius resided at Csesarea. He was a devout man. He had a vision in which God said to him: “Thy prayers and thine alms are come up for a memorial before God. And now send men to Joppa, and call for one Simon, whose surname is Peter.”—Acts 10:4,5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">These men called on Peter, who accompanied them to Caesarea. The humility of Peter here is very beautiful and in keeping with a true ; Christian. It is not uncommon for some who claim to be St. Peter’s successors to have the multitude bow before them, and kiss their hand, and even kiss their foot. Such seems to be the desire of selfish men to have homage paid </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font7">them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">How different was St. Peter! Doubtless </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">he </span><span class="font7">went afoot over the dusty paths. He journeyed : to Caesarea to see Cornelius. He did not have Cornelius come and wait outside of his door all night, and then be admitted next morning to kiss his toe. The record reads in Acts 10: 25,26: “And as Peter was coming in, Cornelius met him, and fell down at his feet, and worshipped him. But Peter took him up, saying, Stand up; I myself also, am a man.” Thus he refused </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">to permit a man to worship him. This is ons i</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i * </span><span class="font7">man who Catholics say was the first pope and who refused to let man how down to him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Cornelius then repeated what the Lord had shown him. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">hi</span><span class="font7"> Acts 10:34-44 we read: &quot;Then Peter opened his mouth, and said, Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons: but in every nation he that feareth him, and worketh righteousness, is accepted with him. The word which God sent unto the children of Israel, preaching peace by Jesus Christ: (he is Lord of ^H:) that word, I say, ye know, which was publisned throughout all Judea, and began from Galilee, after the baptism which Jahn preached; how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the holy spirit and with power; who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil: for God was with him. And we are witnesses of all things which he did, both in the land of the Jews, and in Jerusalem; whom they slew and hanged on a tree: him God raised up the third day, and shewed him openly; not to all the people, but unto witnesses chosen before of God, even to us, who did eat and drink with him alter he rose from the dead. And he commanded us to preach unto the people, and to testify that it is he which was ordained of God to be the Judge of quick and dead. To him give all the prophets witness, that through his name whosoever believeth in him shall receive remission of sins. While Peter yet spake these words, the holy spirit fell on all them which heard the word.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Thus did the Apostle Peter use the two keys which the Lord had committed unto him to unlock to Jew and Gentile a knowledge of the divine plan that leads devout and L. hful men into the heavenly kingdom. That he was ehosen for this purpose is made clear by his own words when on a subsequent occasion he said, as recorded in Acts 15: 7: &quot;And when there had been much disputing, Peter rose up, and said unto them, Men and brethren, ye know how that a good while ago God made choice among us, that the Gentiles by my mouth should hear the word of the gospel, and believe.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">These words of St. Peter show conclusively what was understood by keys; namely, that the Jew’s and Gentiles both should have unlocked for them the mystery of God and should hear the message of God’s kingdom first through Peter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Now if the learned cardinal was mistaken </span><span class="font7">when he said that supreme authority was com® mitted to St. Peter, then surely he is mistaken in saying that St. Peter has any successors and that any other man on earth has ever had supreme authority over the church. There is no scripture in the Bible that says that St. Peter has any successors whatsoever; and we ought not to wish to clothe men with authority which the Lord has not given them. Those who have done so have ignored the provision the Lord has made for those- who love and serve Him. ,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">-i</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Forgiveness of Sins &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">TT WILL be recalled that our Lord said on this same occasion to St. Peter: “And whatsoever thou shah bind on earth, shall be bound in heaven; and whatsoever fhou shall loose on earth, shall be loosed in heaven.” This latter part was not confined to St. Peter alone; for the Lord Jesus spoke the same words to th® other disciples, as is plainly set forth in Matthew 18:18 as follows: “Verily I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven; and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Apostle Peter subsequently showed what he understood the meaning of these words to be when he said: in Acts 10:43: 'Whosoever believeth in him shall receive remission of sins.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Plainly what was intended to be conveyed by the words of Jesus is this: That the Lord would so control the minds of the disciples by His holy spirit that whatsoever they wrote concerning His plan would be correct, and that therefore the people might confidently rely upon the words of the disciples. This is another way of stating that these men wrote by inspiration of the holy spirit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The holy spirit means the invisible power of God operating upon the mind of one devoted to Him and using such minds in the way that He desires. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;’</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Here were Peter and the .other disciples, devoted to the Lord. At Pentecost they were begotten and anointed with the holy spirit. They were clothed with this authority and power. They afterwards wrote th® gospels and the epistles of the New Testament; and in doing this their minds were guided by the Lord so that their words are to be taken as the Lord’s words. These men spoke with authority. What they wrote while on earth is confirmed by the</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Lord fat heaven. These men, under the direction Of the Lord, laid down plainly the rules that mark the way that every one must follow in order to reach the kingdom of heaven.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Now from these disciples we have learned that </span><span class="font7">he who would become a Christian must first realize that he </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">is </span><span class="font7">a sinner </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font7">believe that Jesus Christ is his great Redeemer; that then if he consecrates himself to do God’s holy will, the Lord Jesus imputes to him the merit of his own sacrifice, and God justifies him. From these disciples we learn that justification comes by faith in the blood of Jesus. (Romans 5:9) We are justified by faith. (Romans 5:1) We are justified by grace. (Romans 3:24) “It is God that justifies.”—Romans 8: 33.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Justification means to be made right with God. It means therefore that the Adamic sin has been removed from the Christian by Jehovah Himself, who sits as the great eternal Judge to determine who is right; and the basis for His decision is the merit of Christ Jesus’ sacrifice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This authority was never committed to any man. Surely the Lord has not conferred upon any man on earth since the time of the apostles the power to forgive sins. We are not left in doubt about this; for St. John plainly says (1 John 2:1,2): “My Httle children, these things write I unto you, that ye sin not. And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous: and he is the propitiation for our sins; and not for ours only, but also for the sins of the whole world.” Where</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">in then does any man obtain power and authority to hear confession and absolve men from sin!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The Lord Jesus is the Advocate of the church before the great throne of Jehovah; and the same apostle, in 1 John 1:9, says: “If we confess our sins, he [God] is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The apostles never permitted anybody to worship them. No other man has any authority </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">to be </span><span class="font7">worshiped by men, and he who permits </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">it </span><span class="font7">is doing violence to the truth and dishonoring God. The Lord Jesus always honored His Father and never claimed honor Himself. We should follow His example in this regard. The prophet in Psalm 29: 2 says: “Give unto the Lord [Jehovah] the glory due unto his name, worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Do we not see then that to wrest the Scriptures for the purpose of teaching that a human being on earth is clothed with power and authority to receive the homage of men, to forgive their sins, and to authoritatively act as the vicegerent of Christ, is wholly wrong? De we not see that this takes away from Jehovah the hon</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">or </span><span class="font7">which is His due? What every honest persons wants to do is to honor God and to honor the Savior of men, the Lord Jesus Christ. If men claim such honor then let them do so; but let him who desires to please the Lord follow the Lord’s Word, and if he is governed by that he will receive the blessing which the Lord has in store for them that love and obey Him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The Master </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">By William E. Brooks,</span><span class="font9"> in </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Continent</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">A camel-driver from far Babylon,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Came hurrying to his comrades by the fire, Warming the inn-yard in Capernaum, With eager face to teH about the Man Whose words had stirred him:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“After we had supped</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I left you telling each the ancient tales</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I heard in every Inn 'twixt here and home. And wandered off to see this Galilee.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I passed the narrow street and reached the shore, Where lay the fishing boats and where a crowd Had gathered round a Teacher as he spoke, teaning at ease upon an upturned boat. His feet upon the stones, and on his face The golden glory of the setting sun.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">They had no fear of him, that eager crowd. Clustered upon the beach or on the boats;</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I saw a baby leave its mother's arms,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">And toddle toward him, clutcldng at his robe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">And the Teacher stooped and stroked its tangled hair, Then picked it up and held it to his breast.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Ha was so different from our </span><span class="font4">holy </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">men.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">*<sup>T2</sup>Wliile the selection of the new creation began with the baptism of Jesus, God had foreordained long in advance that there should be a church, of which Jesus Christ is the Head. St. Paul wrote: “According as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love; having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will, to the praise of th® glory of his grace, wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved. In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of gins, according to the riches of his grace; wherein ho hath abounded towards us in all wisdom and prudence; having made known unto us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure which ho hath purposed in himself.”— Ephesians 1:4-9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>473</sup>The world referred to here means the social and political order existing from the time of tha Flood until the coming of ths Lord’s kingdom, and is designated in the Scriptures as the present evil world. St. Paul therefore says that before the foundation of this world God made provision for the choosing of the members of the church. He did not choose the individuals, but He predestinated or foreordained that there should be such a church or new creation, and that these should be adopted as His children through His beloved Son Jesus Christ, and should become tho members of His household, and that these should be made in the image and likeness of Christ Jesus the Head. (Homans 8: 29) As we view the experiences through which Jesus passed, we may expect to find that the body members would hve similar experiences; and this w® do find. ■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">■ *<sup>T</sup>*Fifty ’ days after th® resurrection of Jesui was the day of Pentecost. There went forth the call to the remnant ef th® Jews to come unto th® Lord, accept J®sus as their Head, be transferred from Moses into Christ and become the members of the 144,000, constituting the church. A call means an announcement or an invitation. The call here signified aa announcement of God’s purpose ef electing th® member® of -the church and an invitation to those of the right heart con-</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">tft</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font7">dition to accept that invitation. Many were called, but only a few responded to that call and were chosen. (Matthew 22:14) For three and ft half years thia call was confined to the Jews, at the end of which time Cornelius, the first Gentile, was granted the gospel. He heard, believed on the Lord, fully consecrated himself to do God’s will, and was accepted. (Acts 10) From that time forward the call has been general to any one who might desire to respond to th® terms and follow in the Master’s footsteps.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">*”For this purpose the gospel has been preached, that men might know of the plan of God and understand that He is selecting th® church. Men of worldly wisdom have given no heed to the gospel. To them it has been foolishness. And so St. Paul wrote: “For after that in the wisdom of God th® world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe. For th® Jews require a sign, and the Greeks seek after wisdom; but we preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews a stumblingbloek, and unto the Greeks foolishness; but unto them which are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and th® wisdom of God. Because the foolishness ©f God is wiser than men; and the weakness of God is stronger than men.”—-1 Cor. 1:21-25.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">We cannot do less than to say that this latest book by Judge Rutherford Is an Epoch-making book. It comes at just the right time—at the close of Israel’s long period of waiting for the Jubilee of Jubilees. The seventy Jubilee periods have expired. The time for the blessing of the Jews has come. The blessing itself Is here in tills wonderful book.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The book is not only for the Jews. It is for them, very much so, but it is for Gentiles too. They need to have set before them the Old Testament evidence of the Plan of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Judge Rutherford has done just that in this book. Those who have read it regard it as in many respect* the most remarkable thing he has written.</span></p>

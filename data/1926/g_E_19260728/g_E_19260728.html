<p><span class="font5">MERICAN high speed machinery has enabled cotton manufacturers here to so reduce costs of cotton cloth manufacture that it is claimed that American cloth can be and is sold to cloth dealers in India cheaper than it can be produced in that country by the poorest paid labor on earth. Incidentally it is observed that on a given line of goods Americans receive slightly less per yard than their British cousins; but they operate more, faster and better machines, and they live in a country where it costs much more to live.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Copper Production Here May Cease </span><span class="font5">rpilE fear is expressed that copper production -A- in the United States may come to a standstill because of vast deposits discovered in the Belgian Congo area, where unlimited quantities of black labor can be had for twenty cents per day. It is claimed that this African copper can be smelted and delivered in New York for about half the cost of American production. A tariff on copper importation is being asked in order to help cover the situation.</span></p>

In a nine months cruise near the South Pole the whaler captured and killed 531 whales. The whales produce on an average over seventy barrels of oil apiece, the value per barrel being about $30. The whales are 75 to 100 feet in length. Whaling is considered one of the most dangerous of occupations.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">HRHE New York </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font5"> contains an interesting story of a marine earthquake off Cape Horn. Fish by the thousands were thrown to the surface, including forty-seven whales and many cowfish, sharks and seals. The ship which was in the midst of the disturbed area shook violently, as it would have done in striking a reef. The masts whipped and bent like fishpoles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The concussions of the rocks beneath caused the surface of the ocean to give forth hoarse murmurs.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">T</span><span class="font5">HEORETICALLY the North Pole, on June 21st each year, receives the most heat of any point on earth. But the temperature is kept down on account of the ice in the Arctic Sea. The sea itself is relatively warm. Explorers in the arctic sometimes camp over a hole in the ice, to keep warm. Sunburn is not unusual in the arctic regions, and for six weeks in summer the temperature above the Arctic Circle frequently rises to 90 degrees Fahrenheit. Probably the coldest place in the world is Verhoyansk, Siberia, where temperatures of 90 degrees below zero have been registered • but in the summer time Verhoyansk sometimes has temperatures of 90 degrees above.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Many More Attempts at the Pole</span></p>

Two expeditions will attempt to reach it by airplane, since Byrd and Amundsen met with success, by both airplane and airship.

<p><span class="font5">HERE are at least two ice caves in Pennsylvania, both located on the northern slopes of hillsides, where in winter they are subjected to prolonged blasts of very cold air. This air finds its way into crevices in the rocks, and when it emerges in the summer time reduces the sinner moisture to ice. At the principal cave, near Coudersport, Pa., ice accumulates in summer, in the bottom of the cave, to a depth of several feet. An admission fee is charged and as many as three hundred persons have visited the mine in one day.</span></p>

Mr. Darden was twice married and left children, all of whom are of normal size.

The payment of rent, when it is at all possible to begin paying for a property, is a great mistake.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Motors to Go Overhead</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">N</span><span class="font5">EW YORK CITY seems to have decided to put its motor traffic overhead and to leave the surface for pedestrians. Probably this is as good a solution of the problem as is possible at tills time. Pittsburgh already has such an overhead motor road for some distance. No doubt this will become the custom now in all places where the street traffic is so congested that it cannot conveniently be cared for.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11" style="font-variant:small-caps;">A</span><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">ntok Flettner’s Rotor Ship aroused immense interest when it came up New York harbor with all engines shut off, propelled solely by the rotors. The rotors, which have the appearance of large stacks covered by a projecting cap at the top, are used in practice as a fuel saving device. It is not intended that, ordinarily, they should constitute the sole propulsive power. In a stiff breeze, however, it is practical to shut off the engines and move by the wind alone. This enables the navigator to make the best combination of calm and storm. In the one ease he uses his engines; in the other he saves fuel.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">TT OW labor-saving devices do actually do away with labor i$ shown in the switching yards of the Illinois Central Railroad system at Chicago, where the’ inauguration of automatic brakes and interconnected microphones has reduced the switching force from 288 men to 27, The cars are even weighed automatically, their weights being recorded on a tape as they pass. No brakemen are needed to slow up the cars after they cross the hump in the yards.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Some of us wondered what would be done with the corn. Would it be burned for fuel, or what would be done with.it? Results show that it went into pork, with the effect that the hogs shipped into the Chicago yard this spring were the heaviest ever known. The corn will be largely used as human fuel after all.</span></p>

The entrance of every one of these, except Germany, is opposed by some members of the present Council, and as the decisions of the Council must be unanimous in electing new member states, there is a deadlock which, bids fair to mark the end of the League.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">No Church Property in Mexico</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">OR over half a century there has been no legal holding of property by the church of Mexico. This dates from the time of Juarez. Since 1917 it has been illegal for foreign-born clergymen to preach or teach in Mexico, on account of the fact that these have always been found' hostile to the Mexican government, and ready to foment strife whenever possible. Predictions are freely made that Mexico’s latest effort to run her own affairs without interference by priests born in foreign countries will result in another Mexican crisis. The. foreign-born priests are already crying ■&quot;Persecution”, when, as a matter of fact, they are the real trouble makers themselves, because of their refusal to obey the laws of the land. They could have been prosecuted criminally, and it was an act of toleration and mercy merely to deport them instead of locking them up.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Mexican Constitution of 1917</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">I</span><span class="font5">N 1917 Mexico adopted a new constitution, setting aside for the use of the Mexican people all subsoil mineral rights of lands upon which ground had not been broken by that time. The view of some in the United States is that ownership of the soil above, no matter by what tricky method the title was obtained, gives perpetual rights to everything above and beneath. The deported foreign-born priests are using their great influence to push this view. They are apparently trying to use the United States government as a catspaw to get them chestnuts out of the fire, even if they have to bring on a war between Mexico and the United States in order to do it. Why is it that in all ages priests and preachers have always been first and foremost in egging nations into war? Is that their mission? If so, ■who gave it to them, and when? It looks like the devil’s business and the devil’s program.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The Menace of a World Race War</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font11">T</span><span class="font5">HERE are many great minds that begin to realize that the world’s peace is again being threatened. The Rev. A. H. Clarke, writing in the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Nineteenth Century Magazine,</span><span class="font5"> said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">?&lt;o one who surveys the world of the future with' open mind can fail to see at a glance that so far from peace being in sight, mankind is on the eve of four great wars: (1) A war between East and West; (2) a war between Jew and Gentile; (3) a war between Protestantism and Romanism; (4) a war between what is commonly known as Capital and Labor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">All of these wars are well on the way. The first is perhaps not so clearly discerned by the majority as yet. But it is seen looming in the foreground by those who are carefully observing. The various differences and legitimate grievances which are alleged to exist between white and tan, and which constitute good reasons for dissatisfaction on the part of the colored races, are along the following lines:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The world’s population is estimated to be about 1,800,000,000. Of these there are only approximately 600,000,000 whites, so that the proportion of colored peoples to the whites, is in the ratio of three to one. Alongside these figures, the recently awakened colored races are finding that although the world’s habitable land surface is estimated at fifty-three million square miles, nevertheless forty-seven million of those square miles are under 'white dominance, comprising nearly nine-tenths of the whole area of the habitable earth. Tims two-thirds of the world’s population have only one-tenth of the earth to call their own.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The yellow races, chiefly China and Japan, occupy about four million square miles of land, with a population of approximately 500,000,000. Hence they have to house and feed nearly one-third of the world’s people on less than onethirteenth of the earth’s habitable surface, in other words, the yellow races are crowded to 125 persons to the square mile.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Compare this with Australia, a modern white man’s land, with its total population of only 5,500,000 (less than London alone), but which has three million square miles of land surface—less than two persons to the square </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">mil</span><span class="font5">e. Japan is only' one-twentieth the size of Australia, yet it has to support ten times the population.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Australia could (in spite of her deserts) easily support twenty-five times as many people as</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">By William Harrison</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">she now possesses; yet her government has deliberately closed her doors to Chinese or Japanese immigrants, on the plea that if they were admitted they would soon cause an economic crisis in Australia, by reason of their willingness to work for low wages, on account of their lower standards of life and comfort requirements, as compared with those enjoyed and practised by Europeans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">New Zealand, Canada and the United States have adopted a similar attitude and economic policy towards the colored races; yet at the same time they maintain their hold upon vast territories of land which, by location and ancient heritage, more rightfully belong to the colored groups. Wherever the white man goes, he confiscates the land as far as possible, and treats the native as an inferior being—a barbarian.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The United States, with its vast territory of three million square miles, has a population of but 105,000,000; while China, with only half the area of land, supports nearly four times as many inhabitants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In Africa the natives are being robbed wholesale of their land by the whites who go there. The whites tax the blacks, and make them work to fill the white man’s pockets; then if the black man asks for a vote in the elections of Parliament or of the Provincial Councils, “the fat is in the fire.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In India, the British Government claims the right to seize the land and utilize its vast mineral and food resources, and dominate 320,000,000 colored peoples; and if they dare to protest they are liable to treatment similar to that which 10,000 Indians got at Amritsar in April, 1919, when a British regiment, under General Dyer, opened fire upon this vast crowd, without even warning them to disperse, killed 380, and wounding over 1000, who were left unattended; or else have bombs dropped on whole villages, as has more recently been done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A day of reckoning is approaching. There are ominous signs that the growing intelligence of the colored races will not always tolerate the arrogant dominance of the white. Japan, with her modernized army and navy, her universities and educational system, and her industrial achievements, is already recognized to be a world power, and others are following fast upon her heels; all clamoring for a place in the sun, and for control of a fair proportion of the world,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">with the right to direct the current of their own lives and destinies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Now, with one voice, the educated Indian, the Chinese, the Japanese, the Arab, the Egyptian and the Negro, are all asking that they should be free to use and expand the powers of mind and body which they possess; and are fast reaching the point when, if the white man continues to assert his authority and resist these demands, they will by militant power enforce them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another alleged cause leading up to a clash between the white and the colored races is the growing feeling of resentment that is now rankling in the minds of thousands of educated blacks, browns and yellows, over the boasted &quot;superiority” of the white races; and the constant refusal of the white governments to allow the colored races equality of opportunity with the whites along the lines of education, industry, wages, conditions of labor, privileges of franchise, security from mob violence, non-pre-judiced legal decisions and,, last but not least, the perpetual ostracism that is shown to them by the petty rules and customs set up by the whites for the purpose of segregating the colored peoples, as a reminder that they are members of &quot;inferior” races. Well doth the scripture say, &quot;Pride goeth before destruction, and a haughty spirit before a fall.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We could not, under present conditions, advocate indiscriminate mixing of the races, nor intermarriage; but all should recognize the general truth expressed by St. Paul at Athens, “God hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">After all, there are but three distinct races in the earth, the sons of Shem, Ham and Japheth; and the present supremacy of Japheth is, in fact, modern. It began about the sixteenth century, A. I)., when, as Dr. Vaughan Cornish SEiys'</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Western Europe, including the British Isles, became (owing to trans-oceanic voyages) the centre, instead of the terminus, of maritime communications, which thus brought new requirements in practical astronomy; and there soon followed great improvements in mathematics, in the instruments for recording time and measuring angles, and in optical aids to observation. On this foundation was modern physics built, and hence the mastery of chemical and physical forces which resulted was localized in Europe, where oceanic navigation originated. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In Macaulay’s &quot;History of England” (Chapter 1), \ve further read:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Nothing in the early existence </span><span class="font4">of Britain indicated </span><span class="font3">the greatness to which she was destined, to attain. </span><span class="font4">Hei </span><span class="font3">inhabitants, when first they became k</span><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;">n</span><span class="font3">own to the Tyrian mariners, were little superior to the natives </span><span class="font4">ol </span><span class="font3">the Sandwich Islands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">. Before this the time was when the Egyptians and the Asiatics were far ahead of Europeans in such sciences as chemistry, physics, mathematics and astronomy. The modern rise of the white man, viewed in the long perspective of human history, is almost a mushroom growth; and not much to his credit when we realize that he has ofttimes allowed the grossest forms of selfishness to cause him to use his lately acquired advantage to the detriment and boycott of those peoples who were once his superiors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Too often has it been true that the explorer has merely paved the way for the exploiter. Christian missions to the heathen have ofttimes been used as the gateway of entrance for white profiteers and scheming politicians', who, animated by self-interest, have robbed and subjugated the heathen by force, confiscated their’ lands, used the natives as mere pawns and chattels, and treated them worse than mere animals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The causes of race hatreds, enmities and distinctions are not hard to trace, but when examined in the light of facts they are quite superficial. The barriers that now separate men and nations are mostly artificial, locally induced or inculcated. The fact that </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font5"> white child wilt often dearly love and show a marked preference for its black doll, brown teddy-bear or black &quot;mammy”, proves that the color bar is not instinctively present in the child, but is put there through suggestion and &quot;education” by the adult, as a necessary by-product of our so-called higher civilization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The war of 1914-1918 revealed the fact that men of different races and colors can join hands and co-operate side by side in a common cause. Remove from the world the economic and educational disabilities, the political antagonism, the confusion of tongues and the religious bigotries and superstitions, and there would be little left of the color line.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One thing only would then be necessary, i. o., a change of heart. How can this be accomplished? Some look upon the League of Nations as the coming panacea; but this is a forlorn hope, for the whites dominate the League. Man will need some help from heaven, and that help will come only by and through the</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">promised kingdom of Messiah, in which both Jew and Gentile, Christian, white, black, brown and yellow, will realize their highest hopes and noblest desires. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">A Trip to an Ancient Sequoia Grove</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font11">T</span><span class="font5">HE great sequoias, or giant redwoods, are the oldest living things on this planet; from the annual growth-rings of cut specimens their age is proven to be not less than 6,000 years. In fact, a giant stump whose rings have been carefully counted shows a warped and stunted growth-ring which occurs at the right place and synchronizes with the Biblical date of the flood, when the young 1,600-or-so-year-old tree was submerged in the swirling waters of the descending canopy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">To gaze up at these living giants which were in existence throughout the antediluvian world, with its misrule of materialized angels and evil giant progeny; which have lived on through the present evil world, and were old trees when Abraham was called, and when the Great Pyramid was build; which were ancient when David lived and Solomon reared the temple, and hoary with age when Christ walked the earth and the flame of gospel truth began its illuminating work with the apostles of the Lamb; which have lived on through all the changing events of church and state of the Gospel Age, and which stand today, alive, gigantic, stately, impressing upon all who have eyes to see the majestic lesson of the power of nature’s God to give continuing life—to gaze up at these mighty monarchs of time lends a new and thrilling meaning to the words, “As the days of a tree shall be the days of my people!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">And these trees, living on into the third world, the golden age of Messiah’s reign, will doubtless see the countless myriads of the race of man springing up to perfection of life and health, and will be a factor in the wholesome schooling of that age of life, the Millennium. In a peculiar way they represent what man might have been, had he remained in accord with the laws of his being; for they are as old as man, began their life at approximately Adam’s creation, and may meet man at the close of the great seventh creative epoch-day—the omy living earthly things with unbroken existence from paradise lost to paradise regained!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">By H. A. Seklemiem</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Sierras of Western America contain many groves of these wonderful trees. General Grant Park and Sequoia Park, in California, are notable for them. I will recount'a trip made on June 21st to General Grant Park, from Fresno.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Two autos, a Ford and a Chevrolet, neither of them very new nor very excellent, were the conveyances. Seven Californians, one of whom had never before looked upon a Sequoia (to our shame, be it said) comprised the party. Wise in the wmys of the mountains, our mentor instructed us to start our trip at four o’clock in the morning, with the first glimmer of day; for there is just one thorn in the rose of these particular mountain trips—the well-made and well-kept roads are not as yet graveled or paved through the mountains; and with summer sun and increasing traffic the dirt road, no matter how good, will become dreadfully dusty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We did our best to get an early start, and succeeded in leaving town by five a. m. We w’ere blessed with a breezy day. By leisurely travel, letting all who wished pass us by, and then slowing down to widen the space between us and the car ahead, we had practically no dust to breathe, and consequently could enjoy the wonders of the ever-changing and ever-increasing beauties of the California hills.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Through the vineyards and orchards of the Valley of the Sun, we traveled due east on Ventura Avenue to Centerville; then to the right, beneath the ancient lumber flume, up the road between Jesse Morrow Mountain and Mt. Campbell, then over the many bridges of the many channeled Kings River. We could not have missed the road if we had tried, for it was well traveled and well sign-posted all the way; through hills and valleys, and valleys and hills, but ever ascending to a higher level. Through Squaw Valley, Dunlap, Pinehurst, we saw the dusty oaks of the lower foothills change to the smiling pines and firs of the higher mountains. Again and again, in my dense valley ignorance, I shouted “Sequoia” at sight of a towering tree overtopping the beautiful landscape; but our patient mountain guide Would smilingly explain, “Another yellow pine.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The children with us were far more interested in the vistas of new and surpassingly lovely mountain flower beds than in historic sequoias. Time and again we yielded to their pleadings and stopped to let them pick “just one or two”. It is mountain ethics to pick very few wild flowers, because if all the thousands who traverse these mountain passes should pick to their hearts’ content there would soon be no flowers left along the roadways; and within the boundaries of the parks signs are posted, warning visitors to pick no flowers whatsoever, “under penalty of the la’w.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At last our guide signaled a halt. We looked about for a reason. &quot;We pointed and asked, wistfully, “Sequoia?” “Kot that one,” smiled the guide, “that’s another yellow pine. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">There</span><span class="font5"> is your first sequoia 1” “What? That little midget? That——” I was speechless. The guide laughed outright at his little joke, a standard one among mountaineers. “Why, certainly,” he explained; “a </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">baby</span><span class="font5"> sequoia, of course! Did you think that all sequoias are 6000 years old?” I was squelched and thoroughly crestfallen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Not only do. “great oaks from little acorns grow”, but the cone of the sequoia is much smaller than is the usual cone of mountain trees, being only about an inch and a half in length; and its seeds are like dwarf’s purses, averaging hardly a quarter of an inch in breadth, and like the thinnest paper in thickness. The baby giant that springs from that tiny seed is almost un-noticeable among the thronging life of the verdant hillsides.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">But the mature sequoia towers like a mighty pillar over two hundred feet into the air, its outstanding characteristic being that its top is but little less in diameter than its base—between twnnty and forty feet—and its foliage seems grotesquely insufficient and scraggly to support the life of that majestic trunk. If leaves represent professions, this might well picture how the great characters among men, the giants in all walks of life, are usually sparing in their professions concerning themselves. But that is getting ahead of our story.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We were approaching the park entrance. We now saw great, black, burned stumps along the vmy—the relies of the depredations of greedy lumber companies of bygone days, before a thoughtful people reserved these parks for themselves and their children. Going around one more of the countless bends of the road, and we found ourselves at the ranger station, the entrance to General Grant Park, some sixty-four miles from Fresno.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">None of the grades had been difficult, and wo already felt infinitely well repaid for our trip. It would have been more than worth while, even if we had been forced to turn back at the gate of the park! But the best wonderland was yet before us. A fifty cent fee for each of our two cars, which gave us certificates entitling us to free access to that park for the remainder of the year (cheap enough), and we passed on up the grade.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We were now in the park! At sixty-six miles from home we were at the administration buildings of the park, where we paused to wash'up (the facilities being clean and modern to the last degree); and we lingered there for awhile beneath the towering firs and pines, so cool and restful!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It was now just nine o’clock in the morning, with a whole day of inspiring, genuine pleasure before us! We wandered through the photo studio (but we meant to take our own photos— a privilege freely permitted, with the one stipulation that the trees themselves be not climbed); we secured maps and booklets at the administration buildings, through the courteous uniformed ranger; the children ran down to the green mountain meadow, visible through the trees, and disported themselves awhile on the lawn; and then we proceeded about a mile beyond to the famous sequoias themselves!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Ah! The giants at last!” everyone exclaimed. We were inclined to stop at sight of the first one, right at a turn in the road; but a signboard warned us to keep going, for many other cars were behind us. We soon stopped beneath the grove. The mighty monarchs were all about us now! We all stood in silent amazement. There was a reverential greatness about them, that makes it inspiring to jfist look at them. The breeze was pungent with that sweetest of all perfumes in the world—the ozone of a mountain forest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At our feet, adorning the springy needle-floor of the sequoia grove, were ferns and flowers in abundance. Some of us almost wept at our inability to call them by their names; while others, more practical and ready of mind, asked shamelessly of anyone and everyone for information and were answered with the ready courtesy of the mountains, or else proceeded to give each new form of life a brand new name!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We admired the tiny “star-dust flowers” which smiled in pink beauty at the feet of the giant redwoods, and talked of the “candle-bushes” seen on the way, with their candle-like bloom; while others informed us of the rare blood-red snow flowers, which appear when snow is on the ground, peering out from the whiteness to be loved and admired by possible passers by. We found several of these rare plants during the day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Several score automobiles were parked in the grove; the laughter of romping innocent children seemed strangely sweet and fitting as it resounded through this primeval forest. We joined the happily wandering throngs, read each sign of warning and instruction, and gazed to our heart’s content at the ancient glory before us, meanwhile posing for various photographs in obedience to the persistent pleadings of our camera-owning member.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Every state of the Union is represented in the sequoia grove. Of course, we took our picture in front of the “California” tree. But the redwoods far outnumber the forty-eight states. “General Grant” was the name of the largest, forty feet in diameter and considerably over two hundred feet in height. But “General Lee” was unanimously voted to be the handsomest of them all. There were “General and Lady Washington”, side by side; then the “Twin Sisters”, 'which actually join at their base; the “Quintuple”, or five close-set giants; and many, many unnamed ones on up the trails.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Finally we came to the “Fallen Monarch”! Through its hollow interior we passed—a mounted rider could easily enter its great baseend—then w’e mounted upon its mighty back for the inevitable photograph.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Lunch, unusually appetizing amid such surroundings, was served on a spread armyblanket, on the slope beneath immense firs and pines, where centuries of falling needles had</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">made a rich, loamy carpet, adorned by tiny wild roses in full bloom. The park water, piped from near-by springs, was clear, cold and refreshing, and was everywhere accessible. We ate and drank and thanked the Lord; and then some of us took luxurious siestas of an hour or two in nature’s paradise. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Then we took hikes on this trail and that, by this warbling mountain streamlet and that; while some of the more venturesome of our party took the precipitous trip of some four miles to Sequoia Lake—a journey hard on the car but voted well worth while. Beautiful Lake Sequoia, the special gift of the people to the children, affords unusual fishing, rowing and bathing, and additional delightful hikes around its scenic borders.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Half past five, and all assembled for the parting. We announced ourselves hungry again, and ate to the tune of some ringing yodelling, emanating from some camps in the depth of the park. There were real tears in our eyes as we bade goodby to our giant friends, with sincere promises of another visit to them soon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">On the way down the slope, a mile below the park entrance, the first path to the right after passing a great overhanging rock, we posed for our last picture upon a 6,000-ringed stump, appropriated for souvenirs several pieces of its venerable bark (permissible because outside the park), and then speedily retraced our course home—the darkness of night overtaking us on the way. We were home, tired but happy, and most of us in bed by 9: 35, at the end of a truly wonderful day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The ideal way -would, be to </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">go</span><span class="font5"> up the mountains one day, stay over night (free camping for all, or—for those who make reservations weeks in advance—room at the park hotel), and then spend another day to see the park. Lake Sequoia alone is worth a separate visit. One could profitably spend many days amid these inspiring surroundings. But for most of us, pressed with the duties of life and of the truth, a day or two must suffice. The memory of the experience, however, lasts forever, and becomes one of the blessed treasures of life itself.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">T</span><span class="font5">HERE is no man or group of men who can figure out a law that will help the farmer out of his present difficulties and problems. He must get out the best way he can, all by himself; for there is no outside help for him. The farming industry is the only industry that continually takes advice from men who would actually starve to death if they themselves had to farm.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">What do men who live in the cities know about the practical side of farming, or of its hardships and hazards? Do they really think that they are in a position to give the farmer sound advice about something -with which they have never had experience? The farmers are easier picking for these smooth-tongued gents than are any other class in the world. Let some clever fellow, who has it all figured out to his own benefit, come out to the guileless farmer and talk knowingly, and the farmer often will go into debt to buy his -wares.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One thing that is threatening financially to ruin the average American farmer (it has already ruined many) is the hasty purchase of automobiles, trucks and tractors. The automobile salesman tells the farmer that if any one needs an automobile it is he, so that he can go to town quickly and return to his farm quickly ■—to produce more of something of which we find we already have too much, when we try to dispose of it at a fair price. This modern rush 4s further lowering prices on farm produce, and is gradually bringing the farmers into abject slavery to big business. Of course the gas wagon salesman does not explain this side of the proposition, perhaps he does not see it; but these are the inevitable results of the present pace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Then, after inducing Mr. Farmer to get a, good car, the oily salesman next tells him that he must have a tractor, so that he can farm more land; that he should plow up even his pastures and meadows and put them to grain, of which he already has too much for selling at a profit. So the tractor, like the automobile, further lowers farm produce prices.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Then the farmer is told that he needs a truck, so that he can very quickly deliver to town what he produces. But when the farmer gets to town with his fine truck full of produce, he finds that there are too many other truck-loads of produce there already; then he has his choice of either selling at less than it cost him- to raise it and</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">By Paul Everett Saddlemire &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“truck” it to market, or else take it all back home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Then the farmer is told that he can sell his produce by advertising. The dairyman pays for an ad which says, “Drink more milk,” or “Eat more wholesome butter”. The hog and cattle raiser advertises, “Eat more pork and beef,” notwithstanding the fact that most people already eat far too much meat for their good. The poultryman urges “Eggs”; the fruit grower says, “Eat fruit”; while the grain growers’ ad asks the public to “Eat more bread, oatmeal and mush”, even though they do not eat much of it themselves. But the farmer finds that his advertising merely helps the city dealer, while his own prices stay as low as ever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Now the farmer should be like other business men; he should patronize “home industry”. A coal operator would laugh at a man who would try to sell him wood, nor could the coal dealer sell anthracite to a lumber camp. Let the farmer, likewise, be more independent of the city, and cease letting smooth-talking town gents who never drove a plow tell him how and what to raise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There seems to be a lot of worry nowadays about the surplus farm products that the farmer raises. Some people think that we have too much land under cultivation for the requirements of the country’s population. Perhaps we have, under the modern methods of farming. But let the farmers go back to the horse and plow, and turn some of their cultivated land into pastures and meadows, and they will soon see a very big difference in prices for their produce. This is the very thing that big business does not w’ant the farmer £o do. They would rather keep the farmer over-stocked, buy his produce at a lower figure, and then traffic in it on the floor of the exchange. It gives them more to sell, several times over, and each time at a profit. If the farmer should get over his present craze for automobiles, and should return to his everfaithful friend the horse, he would not raise so much, but it would mean higher prices for what he does produce, and more time and leisure for himself. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This would, of course, mean a big decline in the sale of automobiles, tractors and trucks, which in turn would mean less money for the already overflowing coffers of big business. This would cause a calamity hovvfl from big business; for it Avants all the money that it can get its greedy hands upon, at the same time keeping the farmers and other common folks as poor as possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The farmer should do some advertising. He should advertise the horse, the same as big business advertises the automobile. This automobile riding is a temporary fad. The grownups have gone in for the automobile the same as children do for roller skates. The same may be said of bobbed hair, bare knees, lip stick and painted faces—they are passing fads which quickly yield to new ones.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There is just as much genuine pleasure in riding in a rubber-tired buggy, drawn by a gentle pony, at seven miles an hour, as there is in riding in a dusty auto at fifty—and a good deal safer. Once in a while you have heard of a train bumping into a horse and buggy, but never of a buggy bumping into a train, as so many automobiles do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I admit that you cannot ride so fast in a buggy as you can in a car; but what is the necessity of covering so much ground during a pleasure jaunt? Why try to be a speed demon and run risk of meeting an early death? You can not even see and enjoy the scenery when you try to go as fast as the wind; but in a buggy you have time to enjoy the beautiful landscape. True, you cannot go so far in a day in a buggy as you can in an automobile. But why go fifty miles to look for a nice place to eat your lunch, when you can find an equally pretty place ten miles away? If you cannot, you had better move to a new location.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One solution of. the present difficulty in which most of the farmers find themselves would be for them to organize into one big union and pledge themselves to use the horse wherever possible; then put some of their cultivated land back to pasture and meadow; and feed up some of their surplus farm products. This course would deal a death blow to the aspirations of scheming and grasping big business, which seeks to reduce the farmer to absolute serfdom. It Avould push up the price of farm produce, and thereby make the farmers a more prosperous class. This is the very thing that big business wishes to prevent. Let the farmers' dues In their organization be one dollar a year, and from that fund hire a good advertising man to advertise and popularize the horse.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">And why should we not advertise the horse ? There never was a friend that the farmer has ever- had that has been more true, loyal and reliable than he. Is it fair to despise now the faithful ponies who have borne such hard burdens for their masters ? Horses have been, and still are, our most dependable possessions. Without them the development of a large part of this country would have been an impossibility. They made it possible for us to become a mighty nation, and shall we now relegate these true and ever-faithful animals to the background, or exchange them for automobiles, tractors and motor trucks to our detriment ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Are we to discard our truest, most loyal friends simply because some glib-tongued salesman seeks to secure our hard-earned cash in exchange for something that we do not need, and in many cases can scarcely afford?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Many of the American ponies, indeed almost all of them, are gentle, patient and longsuffer-ing; and this is something that no auto salesman can say for his stock in trade. Horses are almost human in their feelings, and can actually sympathize with their owner when they discern signs of distress on his part.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Many people may think that the horse has about passed away; but the fact is, there are still over twenty million ponies in our country. It is true that the ponies can not do as much work as a tractor, or draw as heavy a load as a truck; but I repeat, why do so much work when it only means lower prices for what we have to sell?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Let us go back to the horse, and stop squandering money for what big business wants us to buy, simply that they may grow even more rich. There are certain places where the horse cannot thrive as well as autos and trucks: and here is where it would be proper to bar the horse. But elsewhere the horse should have undisputed sway. In the golden age, now so close at hand, I believe that horses will be used by lovers of God's creatures, rather than inanimate trucks and tractors. I venture the assertion that the ponies will outlast the automobile fad and will come once more into their own.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There will be many labor-saving devices as the New Day dawns; but horses as useful domestic companions will undoubtedly be allowed to come once more into man’s affections.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Those who have never ridden on the back of</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font5"> gentle and lovable pony have missed many a. pleasant thrill. I for one would rather have just one pony, gentle and patient, than to own all the autos and trucks in the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Let others have the auto, The honking old tin-can;</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">But let me have the pony, The-proven friend of man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Homesteading in Eastern.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">T WISH to add a little to Mr. Bogard’s article on “Western Canada as I Know It”, published in The Golden Age some time ago. Having spent thirty-five years in the Northwest, I have gone through all of the things spoken of in the article mentioned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In late years the loan companies have put a few more kinks into the manner of loaning money on homestead land, especially here in eastern Montana. In many instances the loan company requires the applicant to make out an application for a loan wherein many strange questions are asked, such as: “What do you ■want to use the money for?” Then the questionnaire closes by demanding the signature of the applicant to the fact that he will use the money only to stock his homestead with sheep or cattle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This agreed to, the applicant states how much money he wants on his land; then the agent for the loan company gives the applicant a' check on a bank, for several hundred dollars of the amount asked for, without any further security.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">That part of the transaction seems very generous, and very strange—giving an applicant money on the strength of a mere application for a loan, seemingly without ample security. But the iron-clad feature of the proposition is not long in reaching the applicant, double shod, pressed down and running over.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A mortgage is demanded of the borrower, covering the loan in such amount as the loan company has deemed sufficient to loan on the land; taking into account the applicant, his surroundings, his ability, his standing in the community and, last but in no wise least, his ability to get away from the tight clutches of the ironclad mortgage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In addition to the amount of the loan, with interest agreed upon, there is another or second mortgage made up for him to sign. This the agent claims is only a “protective” mortgage, and “'not to be placed on file”. This second mort-</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Montana Bt/ </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">S. R. Grabill</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">gage</span><span class="font5"> covers the whole amount of the interest that will accumulate during the whole of the time the original mortgage is to run, which is generally three to five years, with all the compound interest, taxes and lawyers’ fees that can be added to it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Now how does this plan work out? The applicant has no interest coming due until the first year of the term of the loan has expired. If the loan is made in April, the first interest payment is due January 1st following. Then complications begin to enter the deal. The applicant usually does not buy cattle or sheep with the loan money. Both parties to the contract knew he would not. Instead, he finds some one to sell the land to, perhaps for a few dollars more, or less, than the loan on the land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Now the party who buys keeps the land until the first year’s interest comes due. Usually he cannot pay, or does not want to pay, and the mortgage company forecloses, first filing that second mortgage, which calls for all of the interest for the full term of the loan. The loan company thereby gets judgment against the original owner of the land for the loan plus interest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In a case I had to do with the loan called for $1700. When the courts were through with the foreclosure the judgment against the original owner of the land, as well as against the purchaser thereof, was approximately $2400. While most of these transactions might be declared highway robbery by a higher court, where will the homesteader get the money to clear himself of an unjust debt of $2400 legally settled upon him by the lower court?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Add these loan steals to all the other hardships that a homesteader, either in Canada or in the United States, has to contend with, before you “go west” and file; and I think you will conclude that you are better off where you are. May God speed the time when His kingdom shall rule on earth as in heaven.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Airplane Construction and Operation</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font11">T</span><span class="font5">HE readers of The Golden Age are probably better informed on general subjects than are the readers of any other one magazine; but there are some topics, among which is airplane building and the metals used therein, also the airplane’s speed and durability, which have not been dwelt on to any length in these columns.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The principal thing about airplane construction, if you could read the machinist’s thoughts, would be the precision required in finishing the working surfaces. This accuracy is absolutely required by an efficient corps of inspectors; and rightly so, as faulty fitting that would allow gas and oil leakage, as well as poor compression, would probably cause another fatality.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Air travel has reached such proportions in the short time since the Wright Brothers began their experiments of a few years ago, that many inventive minds are now constantly employed searching for less resistance, lighter metals, surer oiling and better landing places; all of which go to insure safer passenger and freight transportation via air. The U. S. Mail planes call for continuous flight, and have experienced a very small percent of fatalities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At present a well-known airplane firm of Buffalo, at which plant the writer is employed, is building the fastest plane on record. The engine weighs less per horsepower developed than any one yet built elsewhere. The age of the engine in miles averages 80,000, which means an average of over 1000 hours.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One thing above all others which has been used to overcome the air is duraluminum, a metal one-half as heavy as steel and capable of sustaining a pressure of 128,000 pounds per square inch. This metal enters very largely into the construction of both engine and fuselage, or body; in fact the only large parts of the engine that are composed of steel are crank shaft, connection rods and the cylinders.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The oiling system of the engine has received considerable attention. Every time more miles have been added more speed is developed, and lubrication must therefore be assured. Then the propeller which, until terrific speed was developed, was constructed of wood, has been replaced by a light metal. Wood will stand approximately 1400 revolutions and then fly apart, while metal propellers stood the strain of the 1925 races, In which all records were broken. The foreign-</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">By David Finch</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">built planes which entered were away behind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">After the engine has been constructed and the inspection department is satisfied, the next step toward completion of the graceful invention is the test room. In applying the tests a mechanical contrivance, called the hydrometer, is connected to the engine. This registers the speed attained and the horse power developed; and if the requirements are not met, then there is some imperfection, either in the metal used or in the machining and construction. The speed reached in test is from 2300 to 2600 per minute and the horse power about 260. After having undergone these tests, the engine is now installed in the' very front of the airplane. We should say that the engine draws the plane instead of drives, as the propeller is in front.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The driver or aviator of the then completed machine is seated in a box-like seat, called the cockpit, amid easy cushions, and right before him are all of the necessary instruments. At a glance he satisfies himself as to how much gas and oil are in the tanks, and he is then off for a trial flight. He can always tell how fast he is traveling and at what altitude.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The steering lever is directly between the knees of the aviator as he sits in the cockpit, and by being shoved away or drawn toward him will cause the plane to ascend or descend, even to looping the loop. If the lever is drawn to the right or the left it will cause the plane to recover its balance, or to ride on an even keel, as sailors would say. This equilibrium is also registered on a small instrument, directly before the operator. The mechanism for turning to right or left is patterned after the rudder on a vessel, and is accomplished by a small plane which stands on the rear end. The steering fans or planes are all situated on the rear. This has been copied from the birds, whose tail feathers are used for this purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the World War, when emerging from the clouds, aviators sometimes found themselves flying upside down. This has been overcome at the present time through research. The aviator is also provided with a parachute, which should be strapped to his back. If compelled to do so, he can jump over-board, and the next thing he knows he is probably standing in a cornfield.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The planes or wings are of light material, usually five feet wide and probably forty feet</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">long, according to the carrying capacity. One built during the late war had wings seventy-eight feet from tip to tip.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The body of the plane is called the fuselage, in the large part of which is partitioned the hold for carrying loads. This must be well protected, as three or four storms may be met or overtaken during a flight between landing stations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">With this great distance and time-saver mountains do not need to be dodged nor streams avoided. The distance between cities or countries is covered as the crow flies, by the shortest route.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At present the great aerial highway between New York and San Francisco is lighted at night between Rock Springs, Wyo., and Cleveland, Ohio, which is the route that Mail Planes cover during the dark. The landing stations are specially marked by placing very strong searchlights, some of them rotating, at the corners of the fields.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In all these modern “Aladdin’s Lamp” scenes we are but seeing Scripture fulfilled: 'Many shall travel to and fro, and knowledge shall be increased.’ The airplane is merely another proof that our great Jehovah is removing the barriers, and that the New Day is beginning. If obedient, man has the added promise that he may long enjoy the work of God’s hands, and live on and on forever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Mundane Things in the Bible </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">By G. W. Thomson</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">T</span><span class="font5">HOSE who object to handling purely mundane subjects, would do well to reread the Bible and see if it contains subjects of human interest. I wonder if they have forgotten the account of the creation of the earth; the creation of the two beautiful creatures who were placed in a beautiful garden specially prepared; or the love affairs of Isaac and Rebekah; Jacob and Rachel; Boaz and Ruth. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Among other mundane subjects of the Bible are the details of the erection of the Ark; Joseph’s methods of conducting the affairs of Egypt; the preparation and building of the tabernacle and temple; Moses’ instruction to the children of Israel on the purely mundane subjects of dietetics and sanitation; the details concerning the construction and use of the steam engine, as shown in the book of Job; how it would develop into a means of great profit; hoW selfish interests would feast upon the earnings, sharing it among speculators, thereby depriving the people of their rights, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Of course the Bible student who has been inducted into the secrets of the divine purposes, and given a glimpse of heavenly things, can see in many of these recorded matters certain spiritual lessons. But in themselves they are simply subjects of human interest. It is a well known fact that those who read these subjects of human interest in the Bible, with a pure motive, are elevated to a purer life.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Judge Rutherford at Royal Albert Hall</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font3">(Special to </span><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Golden Age)</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">T</span><span class="font5">HE international convention of the Bible Students was held at Alexandra Palace and Royal Albert Hall, London, May 25-31. It was the most enthusiastic convention ever held in this land. The climax was reached at the unanimous adoption of a Resolution, and the speech of Judge Rutherford supporting it. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Daily News,</span><span class="font5"> London, carried a full report of both, which The Golden Age here reproduces exactly as it appeared therein:</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div style="border-right:solid;">
<p><span class="font3">man lost his perfect home and his right to life and happiness; that since then man has organized governments and world powers in an attempt to govern himself, but in so doing lias ignored the Word of God and submitted to the control of Satan the Devil; that until now God has not interfered with Satan to the end that man might be free to choose right or wrong and by experience! learn the baneful effects of evil, but now the time has come when God will interfere in behalf of the peoples,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">THIRD. That Christ Jesus, by His faithfulness unto death, became the redeemer and deliverer of mankind; that when on earth He taught that the time for the deliverance of the people would begin when the evil world under the rulership of Satan shall end, and that He, Christ Jesus, would return and set up God’s kingdom of righteousness that the peoples might know and follow the right way; and for this reason He taught His followers to pray, “Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done on earth as in heaven”; that in the meantime world powers have been organized and carried on for the purpose of ruling and controlling the peoples, and these world powers are designated in the Scriptures under the symbol “beast” for the evident reason that they are the result of the combined efforts of the commercial, political and ecclesiastical leaders of men and are in-llueneed and dominated by Satan, the god of this world, and have been, and are, military, harsh, cruel and oppressive, and manifest the spirit of Satan, their invisible ruler, or god; and now the repeated cries of oppressed humanity have reached unto the God of heaven, who will hear and deliver them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">FOURTH. That divine prophecy now fulfilled, and in the course of fulfilment, bears testimony to the fact that Satan’s lease of power is done, and that the old world has ended, and that the time is at hand when Christ Jesus, the executive officer of Jehovah .and the rightful king of earth, will oust Satan the evil one and begin his righteous government, which shall establish God’s will on earth; that beginning with 1914 divine prophecy in the course of fulfilment gave testimony that the end of the evil world had begun in this, to wit, the World War, famine, pestilence, earthquakes, revolutions, the return of the Jews to Palestine, and later followed by general distress and perplexity of the nations of the world; that this testimony of the</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font11">D</span><span class="font3">URING the past week the INTERNATIONAL BIBLE STUDENTS have had their general convention in London. Delegates from many countries attended. A feature of the convention was the unanimous adoption of a resolution as a testimony to the World Rulers. Sunday night the Royal Albert Hall was packed out to hear Judge Rutherford, President of the Association. Mr. Hemery took the chair. He first read the resolution mentioned which follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">A Testimony</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">TO THE RULERS OF THE WORLD:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The International Bible Students in general convention assembled declare their unqualified allegiance and devotion to the Almighty God, and believing it to be their privilege and duty so to do, in obedience to the commandments of God, send this testimony to the governing powers of the world, to wit:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">FIRST. That it is of paramount Importance that all recognize that Jehovah, the Creator of heaven and earth, is the true and Almighty God besides whom there is none other; that His plan for man is set forth in the Bible which is His Word of Truth, and that Christ Jesus is the executor of Jehovah’s plan; that it is npw apparent to all that the nations of the world are in dire distress and perplexity,-and great trouble more terrible than any heretofore experienced is now threatened; that the efforts of the rulers to establish a desirable government or world power have failed; and, now be it known unto you, that the outworking of God’s plan concerning man, and that aione, can and will stabilize the world, and bring lasting peace, prosperity and, happiness to the peoples, and that the time lias come for those who arc exercising governing power over the peoples to recognize these great truths.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">SECOND. That the reason for the prevailing condition of perplexity and distress is because man disobeyed the true God and yielded to the wicked influence of Satan, the false god; that Lucifer, originally the rightful overlord of man, because of his disloyalty to God became Satan the Devil, the instigator of all evil, and the adversary of God, and the arch enemy of man; that the Evil One alienated man from the true God, and caused him to sin, by reason of which fulfilment of the divine prophecy having been plainly given to the governing powers of the world, there Is placed upon the shoulders of the rulers a re* sponsibility that cannot be avoided.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">FIFTH. That although Jehovah God furnished conclusive proof that the evil world had ended and that the time for the reign of His beloved Son had come, yet this testimony was ignored and pushed aside by those who should have known better; and contrary to the Word of God the commercial, political and ecclesiastical rulers attempted to stabilize the world and keep the peoples under control by adopting; that makeshift which is called the League of Nations and which was wrongfully and blasphemously hailed as the political expression of God’s kingdom on earth; that the real author and father of the League of Nations compact is Satan the Devil, the god of this world, which was put forward by him as his last desperate effort to deceive the peoples, turn-theni away from the true God, and hold them under his own wicked control; that now after seven years of laborious effort on the part of the proponents of that compact to establish peace and prosperity, it is practically conceded that the League of Nations is a complete failure and that its utter collapse is a matter of only a brief space ef time; that even now while its advocates are striving to re-assemble their forces to maintain that disintegrating and unholy alliance, the peoples are hearing the solemn warning of God’s prophet concerning the federation, saying, “Associate yourselves O ye people, and ye shall be broken in pieces; and give ear, all ye of far countries; gird yourselves, and ye shall be broken in pieces. Take counsel together, and it shall come to bought; speak the word, and it shall not stand.” —Isaiah 8: 9,10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">SIXTH. That by reason of the blinding influence of Satan the minds of the rulers and the ruled are turned away from the true God, and the evil forces are gathering the whole world unto the great battle of the Lord God Almighty; that there is now impending a time of trouble such as the world has never known, during which conflict Satan’s powerful organization shall fall never to rise again, and there shall be such a demonstration of divine power that all the nations will learn that Jehovah is God and that. Christ Jesus is King of kings and Lord of lords.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">SEVENTH. That the great tribulation will reveal to the people the kingdom of God, which kingdom shall rest upon the shoulder of His beloved Son the Prince of Peace, and of the peace of that kingdom there shall be no end: it will bring the heart’s desire of all peoples of good will, and in that kingdom the blind ignorance with which the people have long been afflicted will be forever removed and with the knowledge of and obedience to God tb.ere shall come to the people everlasting peace, prosperity, health, life,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">liberty and happiness; and that the klng-' dom will be the complete fulfilment of the prophetic song of the angels, “Peace on earth, good will toward men.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Therefore we earnestly bear before you this testimony: That Jehovah is The God, and that He has installed Christ His Son, as </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">T/ie King</span><span class="font3"> of the earth, and bids you to give full obedience to earth’s rightful King. Do so and use your influence to turn the minds of the people to THE THUE GOD, that disaster may not befall you.—Psalm 2: 2-12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">■Judge Rutherford’s Address</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Judge Rutherford then said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In support of the resolution read I desire to submit some argument. In the councils of the learned rulers of the world the burning questions are: &quot;Why do the nations continue in distress and perplexity? What remedy can be applied that will stabilize the world?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">More than seven years have passed since the signing of the Armistice which marked the end of the World IVar, and yet there are today more tangible evidences of the disruption and dissolution of the nations than ever before. There is good reason for this. There is a sure and certain remedy. The rulers of the ’world are respectfully requested to give candid consideration to the argument here submitted in support of the assigned reasons and the announced remedy. The seriousness of the situation warrants such candid consideration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The governing factors of the present world powers claim that their rule of the peoples is by divine right and authority, and therefore they have committed themselves to the divine law; and by this they should be governed and judged. This being true, then I need make no excuse for using the Bible as a basis for my argument.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">I propose to now prove that the trouble of this world has resulted because: (1) The law of Jehovah God has been disregarded and ignored; (2) and that throughout the ages world powers have been organized and succeeded each other and have now reached a climax in the British Empire; (3) that in all of these world powers fraud has been freely practised in the name of religion and in the name of the Almighty God, and that the clergy have been the agency chiefly used in the practising of such fraud; (4) that the time has come when Almighty God will make Himself known to the people, and will express His Indignation against nil hypocrisy; (5) that to this end Jehovah God has set His anointed King upon His throne of authority and judgment; (6) that the kingdom of God is the complete remedy for all human ills, and that there is none other; and. (7) that the rulers of the earth should now hear and heed these facts. In the consideration of these important questions 1 brief reference to the history of man, in the light of divine prophecy, is essential.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah is God</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah, the Eternal One, the Creator tf lieaven and earth, is the only true and</span></p>
<div style="border-right:solid;">
<p><span class="font3">living God. In Him resides all rightful power and authority. He created man perfect and clothed him with authority to inhabit and rule the earth. (Genesis 1: 26,27; Isaiah 45; 12,18) He assigned His son Lucifer as man’s overlord, thereby establishing a confidential relationship between Lucifer and Jehovah, and charged Lucifer wiili a sacred duty toward man. Being ambitious to be like the Most High God, Lucifer betrayed his sacred trust and induced man to violate God’s law. By this means man was alienated from Jehovah. (Genesis 3:1-5, 1.5,24) Thereupon Jehovah changed, the name of Lucifer to that of Dragon, Satan, Serpent, and Devil, which names be speak his evil disposition.—Revelation’ 20:1-3; Isaiah 14:12-15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">God expelled man from Eden, and permitted him to work out his own devices in an attempt to establish selfgovernment. He did not deprive Satan of the authority as man’s overlord, nor did He interfere with Satan’s influencing of man. Jehovah placed before man His way of truth and righteousness, and left man free to exercise his own will either to obey the true God or to take the 'wrong way and yield to the influence of Satan, the evil god.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Early in their experiences men began to organize into bodies politic. Satan easily overreached men by intrdclucmg fraud and deceit. In mockery of Jehovah the adversary early induced men to call themselves by the name of the Lord; while at the same time, in truth and in fact, they were the instruments and subjects of the Devil. Thus hypocrisy was first introduced. (Genesis 4: 26, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">margin') </span><span class="font3">It is easy to see that hypocrisy has been practised during the entire period of man’s history.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">God Forgotten</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The first great world power organized by man was ancient Egypt. Its invisible ruler, or god, was Satan the Devil. In that land were domiciled the Israelites, whom God chose for Uis own people and whom He used to foreshadow His future purposes. He organized His people into a nation and commanded that they should have Him as their God, and none other. (Exodus 20:4) The Israelites were oppressed by the governing factors of Egypt. God sent Moses to deliver His people from the oppressive hand of the tyrannical ruler<sup>-</sup> of that world power.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">At that time Jehovah made a great demonstration of His power by overthrowing the Egyptian world power; and He declared that He did so that the people might not forget, to their own hurt, that Jehovah is the true God. (2 Samuel 7:23) Moses foreshadowed the great Messiah, the anointed King of Jehovah. In the overthrow of the Egyptians and the deliverance of the Israelites, God foreshadowed the ultimate deliverance of the oppressed peoples of earth from the wicked hand of Satan and his world powers, by which the people have long been held in subjection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In the course of .time the Israelites yielded to the wicked influence of Satan the Devil, and their nation fell. With</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font3">the fall of Israel Satan became the god, or invisible ruler, of all the nations of the earth and is therefore designated in the Word of Jehovah as “the god of this world.” (2 Corinthians 4:3,4) But with the overthrow of Israel God declared that He would in His own due time send His anointed King with full power and authority to act, and that He then would rule the world in righteousness.—Ezekiel 21: 24-27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Experience alone can teach man lasting lessons. For centuries man has been passing through fiery experiences, being buffeted, misled and defrauded by Satan. At all times God has placed before man the evidence that He is the true and righteous God, but few of mankind have heeded this testimony. Man has readily yielded to the seductive influence of Satan, and has suffered therefor and continues to suffer. In due season, by reason of these trying experiences, man will learn that his true Friend and Benefactor is the’ great Jehovah God, that His way is the right way, and that to know Jehovah God and obey Him leads to life and happiness. This lesson, dearly bought,, will be lasting and beneficial. Mankind is now at a period of the greatest crisis in his experience. His deliverance from despotic and unrighteous power is near at hand.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>World Powers</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">World powers have been organized by man, with Satan as invisible ruler<sup>1</sup> or overlord. To accomplish his purposes in keeping man under his control Satan has always resorted to deceit, and by this means he has overreached and controlled the world powers that have existed in all the ages, past and present.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A world power is an organization formed and operated for the purpose of ruling the peoples. Seven great world powers have existed, in the order named, to wit: Egypt, Assyria, Babylon, Medo-Persia, Greece, Rome, and the British Empire. The governing factors of each and every one of these world powers have been three, to wit: the commercial, political and religious elements. The god or invisible ruler of each has been Satan the Devil, even as the Scriptures declare. (2 Corinthians 4:3,4; John 12:31) When Rome adopted Christianity as her religion she was there hypocritically calling herself by the name of the Lord; but in truth and in fact she continued to be the representative of the Devil, even as was done in the day of Enos.—Genesis 4: 26, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">margin.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Beasts</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">All of these world powers are indicated by Jehovah in His Word and each one of them is designated by the Lord God under the symbol of “beast”. (Daniel. 7: 3) The evident reason for this is that all of these world powers have been harsh, ferocious and oppressive. The commercial element is cold, calculating, military and harsh. The political element is suave, diplomatic and faithless. The religious element is, and always has been, sanctimonious, hypocritical, fraudu-</span></p>
<div style="border-left:solid;">
<p><span class="font3">By the mouth of His holy prophet Jehovah describes the beastly world powers or kingdoms, of which the British world power is the seventh; foretells their warring with each other; and then He declares, “And in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom shall not be left to other people, but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever.”—Daniel 2: 44.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This prophecy relates to the kingdom foretold by . all the holy prophets of Jehovah. This is the kingdom for which Jesus taught His followers to pray, “Thy kingdom come; thy will be done on earth as in heaven.” This is the kingdom which the clergy of all denominations, in all times past, have declared would come at some future time. Now God himself has given conclusive proof, which proof is available for all mankind and particularly for the rulers that His due time has come; and He now calls upon the rulers of the earth to recognize and render allegiance and obedience to His anointed King whom He has set upon His throne.—Psalm 2: 2-12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Proof</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jesus taught that He would return and set up the kingdom of Jehovah. For nineteen centuries His faithful followers have anxiously waited for that time to come. Before Jesus departed from the earth the question was propounded to Him by His faithful disciples: “When shall these things come to pass, and what shall the proof of thy presence be and of the end of the world?” (Matthew 24: 3) The Lord Jesus, as the mouthpiece of Jehovah God, speaking prophetically and with authority, answered that the time would be marked by the fact that the nations and kingdoms of the earth would become angry, and that then there would be a great world war, followed shortly by famines, pestilences, earthquakes, and revolutions; and that these things would be the beginning of sorrow’s upon the nations and kingdoms of the earth.—Matthew 24: 7-18; Rev. 11:17,18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In 1914, exactly the due time as foretold by the prophet of God, this great trouble began upon the nations and kingdoms of Christendom. The Lord God there furnished, to the governing powers of the earth particularly, the evidence that the world had ended, and that the time for the beginning of His kingdom of righteousness had arrived. The ecclesiastical element of the world powers were duty-bound to take notice of this evidence and to call it to the attention of their allies, the commercial and political elements. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">As a further proof that the time had arrived for God’s anointed King to take possession, the Lord foretold that the Jews would begin to return to and inhabit the land of Palestine. The British Empire recognized this, by its conduct at least, and was the first of all the nations of earth to make it possible for the Jews to return to their homeland; and now all see the fulfilment of this prophecy.—Luke 21; 24.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font3">lent and seductive. All of these reflect the disposition of their invisible ruler, Satan the Devil. In keeping with divine prophecy, these world powers have even designated themselves under the symbol of “beast”. The British Empire has adopted the Lion as its symbol.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Greatest of All</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Without question the greatest world power that has ever existed is the British Empire. The boast Is truly made that “the sun never sets on her domains”. During the period of her existence education, science and invention have surpassed that of all other times. In finance she leads. In military strength she is at the head. In the exercise of political diplomacy she has no equal. Her clergymen are the acknowledged leaders of the ecclesiastical world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The claim is made for the British Empire, as has been done for other world powers, that she rules by divine right and authority. The British Empire, together with other nations, claims to form “Christendom”, or Christ’s kingdom on earth. Therefore, these call themselves by the name of the Lord. But the law of Jehovah God is ignored and His name brought into disrepute.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Because Britain is the greatest of all world powers, because she together with her allies claims to be “Christendom” and to be ruling by divine right and authority, there rests upon the British Empire a grave responsibility which cannot be evaded. Because the British world power is the very center and bulwark of the world’s civilization, which the Lord symbolizes as a “beast”, and because London is its seat of government, and these governing factors claim to rule by divine right, here then is the very “seat of the beast”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The fall of the British Empire means the breaking up of the world’s civilization. Iler learned rulers must see that her very pillars are now tottering to the fall. All the other nations of earth, moved by the dread of impending disaster are, together with the British Empire, arming for another and a more terrible conflict than has ever before been fought. For this reason the attention of the rulers is here earnestly directed to the divine prophecy relating to the powers of this world and to the kingdom of God now in course of fulfilment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">And now I charge that the British world power, the head of the so-called “Christendom”, while claiming to rule by divine right and authority has openly repudiated the great Jehovah God and has rejected His anointed King, and that her clergy are chiefly responsible for this great wrong. Because of the rejection of God’s duly anointed King the world’s greatest trouble is impending and about to fall.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Everlasting Kingdom</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Prominently set forth in the Word of Jehovah is His purpose to set up His kingdom of righteousness, with His anointed Son, the Messiah, as the King.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">As a further evidence of the tima above mehtioned, the Lord declared that the nations would then be in perplexity and distress, and that men’s hearts would be failing them for fear; and surely there is not one amongst all of tha governing factors of earth today' but that recognizes the fulfilment of this prophecy. (Luke 21:25) The British in tha trades strike not yet settled are having such distress and perplexity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The second coming of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the establishment of His kingdom under God’s anointed King, has been the hope of Christians for nineteen hundred years. This great truth has not been hid under a bushel. It has been proclaimed from the housetops throughout the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">For the purpose of establishing the fact that the clergy' of the greatest world power, to wit, the British Empire, have recognized the divinely-provided evidence as proof of the Lord’s second coming and of the .establishment of His kingdom, I now read into the record a statement which was published by' the London press in the latter part of 1917, and which was republished by other papers throughout the Empire and throughout the entire world:</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The following manifesto was recently issued by a number of England’s most noted ministers :</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“First.—That the present crisis points toward the close of the times of the Gentiles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“Second.—That the revelation of the Lord may be expected at any moment, when Ha will be manifested as evidently as to His disciples on the evening of His resurrection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“Third.—That the completed church will be translated to be ‘for ever with the Lord’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“Fourth.—That Israel will be restored to its own land in unbelief, and be afterward converted by the appearance of Christ on its behalf.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“Fifth.—That all human schemes of reconstruction must be subsidiary to the second coming of our Lord, because all nations will be subject to His rule.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“Sixth.—That under the reign of Christ there will be a further great effusion of tha Holy Spirit on all flesh.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“Seventh.—That the truths embodied in this statement are of the utmost practical value in determining Christian character and action with reference to the pressing problems of the hour.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">This remarkable statement was signed by A. C. Dixon and F. B. Meyer, Baptists; George Campbell Morgan and Alfred Byrd, Congregationalists; William Fuller Gouch, Presbyterian; H. Webb 'Peploe, J. Stuart Holden, Episcopalians; Dinsdale T. Young, Methodist.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">These are well-known names, and are among the world’s greatest preachers. That these eminent men<sup>1</sup>, of different denominations, should feel called upon to issue such a statement is of itself exceedingly significant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In this manifesto the divinely-provided proof brought home to the greatest world power by her own ministers, that divine prophecy' has been fulfilled as to the end of the world and the second presence of the Lord. But has due heed been given to this divine proof? It has not been heeded. On the contrary, these very distinguished men who signed this manifesto have since vehemently spoken against present truth and the Lord’s kingdom, Furthermore, the rulers of tha world have ignored the divinely-provided testimony, as is shown by what has followed.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>The League of Nations</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">With propriety these questions may here be asked: If these governments of earth are operated by divine right and authority, then why<sup>7</sup> should God permit the devastating World War to come upon them? If the British world power, together with other nations, constitutes Christ’s kingdom, which claim is made by reason of their calling themselves “Christendom”, then why should the Lord permit the destruction of His own kingdom ? It is obvious from the correct answer to these questions that the claim that these world powers rule by divine right and authority is false, fraudulent and blasphemous.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Satan, the god of this evil world, seeing that his governing factors on earth were weakening each other, sought means to cement trie people and the rulers in a closer compact. During the World War he caused an appeal to be made to the patriotism of the common people, by having them adopt the slogan: “The War will make- the world safe for Democracy.” The purpose was to gain for the military the support of the democratic element of the people. God, through His prophet, had foretold that this very thing would transpire.—Daniel 2: 41.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Wiien the war ceased the grave and wise men of the world powers assembled at Paris for conference. There the rulers took counsel together, which counsel resulted in bringing forth a compact against Jehovah and against His anointed King. Necessarily Satan, the god of this world, would know the purpose of Jehovah in establishing His kingdom; and therefore Satan set about to produce something to offset that kingdom, whereby' to turn the minds of the rulers away from it and away from God. To do this lie must again resort to fraud and deceit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The commercial and political elements, constituting the military of the world powers, in substance said: “To stabilize the world we must have a compact of nations, in which all nations shall agree that our council shall govern and control them.” The result was the formation of the League of Nations. Notwithstanding the claim that these world powers rule by divine right and authority, the name of neither Jehovah nor His anointed Son was even mentioned in the League of Nations compact. But in order to lend a sacred tinge thereto, and that the people might be further deceived, Satan, through the clergy element of the world powers, in sanctimonious phrase declared the League of Nations to be “the political expression of God’s kingdom on earth”. Notwithstanding that the clear proof had been given to them by the Lord that the world had ended and that the second presence of Christ had begun and that special attention had been directed thereto by leading clergymen of the world, the Federal Council of and authority ? I answer, No. The Devil is its father, and the British Empire is its mother, and the other nations which support it are<sup>1</sup> its wet nurses. At this time the advocates of the League of Nations are desperately striving to unite its bellegerent members. With fear and trembling they see that unhold offspring of Satan headed for perdition, even as the Lord foretold.—Revelation 17: 8.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font3">Churches of the world endorsed the League of Nations as a substitute for the kingdom of God. This august body of ecclesiastics in January, 1919, issued the following blasphemous proclamation :</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The time has come to organize the world for truth, right, justice and humanity. To this end, as Christians, we urge the establishment of a League of Free Nations at the coming Peace Conference. Such a league is not merely a peace expedient; it is rather the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">political</span><span class="font0"> expression of the kingdom of God on earth. The League of Nations is rooted in the gospel. Like the gospel, its objective is “Peace on earth, good will toward men,” Like the gospel, its appeal is universal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The heroic dead will have died in vain unless out of victory- shall come a new heaven line; a now eartD, Wiiei'&amp;iri<sup>1</sup> (iwclictii rigiiteous-ness.—2 Peter 3 : 13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">- The church [nominal] can give a spirit of good will, without which no League of Nations can endure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">These distinguished ecclesiastics, contrary to the teachings of the Prince of Peace, whom they claim to represent, and in direct violation of His law, preached men into the trenches and haired the World War as a means of making the world safe for democracy. Thereby they deceived the young men and. sent them to untimely graves. (Jeremiah 2:34) And then after the war they completely repudiated the Lord God by openly allying themselves with and endorsing the Devil’s substitute for God’s kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The League of Nations is against God and His anointed. In it is nothing Irai darkness. Its approval by the clergymen, as a substitute for Messiah’s kingdom, has caused gross darkness to settle down upon the peoples of the world. (Isaiah 60:2) No longer can the people look to their clergymen as safe leaders. Their leadership is done.— Psalm 82:1-5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">League Foretold</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">God foretold the seven world powers, to wit, Egypt, Assyria, Babylon, Medo-Persia, Greece, Rome and the British Empire, and also foretold that out of the seven would grow the eighth. Tin latter is also symbolized as a “beast”, because its purpose is to rule and control the peoples of the earth. The Lord foretold its birth, its short existence, and its everlasting end.—Revelation 17:10 11; Isaiah 8: 9,10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The governing factors of the world powers, particularly the ecclesiastical element, by reason of claiming that these world powers rule by divine right and authority, thereby admit that the Word of God is true. Therefore they must be judged by the Word and are estopped from denying the Scriptural proofs which disclose their wrongful acts. No one will attempt t© deny that the British world power is the earthly agency that was responsible for the formation of <sup>+</sup>hc League of Nations compact. The British Empire is the very bulwark thereof. Let Britain withdraw and there will be no League of Nations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">But who is primarily responsible for the League of Nations compact? Is it formed and does it exist by divine right!</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font3">The Devil caused the governing factors of so-called Christendom to enter into this compact against Jehovah and His anointed King and thereby in fulfilment of prophecy to say in effect: “Let us refuse to give our allegiance and support to Jehovah and His King, but rather let us cast them away from us and hold to our present evil organization,”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Hear now, if you please, the inspired words of God’s holy prophet, which were written three thousand years ago, written to apply at this very time, and which do apply at this hour:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Wherefore have nations consented together? or -should peoples keep muttering an empty thing? The kings of earth take their stand, and grave men have sat in conclave together, against Jehovah and against His Anointed One, saying, ‘Let us tear apart their bands, and east away from us their cords ■ ’ One enthroned in the heavens will laugh, my Sovereign Lord will mock at them; Then will he speak to them in his anger, and in his wrath will dismay them :—‘Yet I have installed my king on Zion, my holy mountain, let him tell my decree!’ Jehovah said to me:—‘My Son art thou, I to-day have begotten thee: Ask of me, and let me give—nations for thine inheritance, and as thy possession the ends of the earth: Thou shalt shepherd them with a sceptre of iron, as a potter’s vessel shalt thou dash them in pieces.’ ” —Psalm 2:1-9, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Rotherham.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">But in order that those who have been inveigled into the Devil’s trap might see their mistake and repent and escape, God further says to them through His prophet: “Now therefore, ye kings, show your prudence, be admonished, ye judges of earth: Serve ye Jehovah with reverence, and exult with trembling. Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and ye perish on the way; for soon might be kindled his anger. How happy are all who take refuge in Him!”—Psalm 2:10-12, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Rotherham.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The clergy are the most reprehensible of all the elements that go to make up the governing powers of the world. Claiming to be teachers of the Word of God, their duty was to ascertain the truth and explain it to the others. But instead, they have caused the rulers of earth to commit fornication with an apostate church system, and have made the peoples drunk with their false doctrines. (Revelation 18: 3) The comme-r-cial and political rulers admit the ecclesiastics to their councils, with the evident - thought that their piety and sanctimoniousness will remove the curse from their own skirts, but now they see that these ecclesiastics have practised a fraud upon them because they are not in truth and in fact the representatives of God as they have claimed. Even now the ecclesiastics are hated by the other rulers, and soon tills hatred will be manifested in a more tangible maimer.— Revelation 17: 16, 17.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>The Cause</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The real reason for earth’s trouble is, because the rulers have rejected God’s duly anointed King and refused His kingdom, and since they persist in this course of defiance against God, He lias declared that He will dash them to pieces as a potter’s vessel. (Psalm 2:9) In corroboration of this, God’s prophet further says: “Thus saith the Lord of hosts, Behold, evil shall go forth from nation to nation, and a great whirlwind shall be raised up from the coasts of the earth. And the slain of the Lord shall be at that day from one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth: they shall not be lamented, neither gathered, nor buried: they shall be dung- upon the ground. Howl, ye shepherds, and cry; and wallow yourselves in the ashes, ye principal of the flock: for the days of your slaughter and of your dispersions are accomplished: and ye shall fall like a pleasant vessel. And the shepherds shall have no way to flee, nor the principal of the flock to escape. A voice of the cry of the shepherds, and an howling of the principal of the flock shall be heard: for the Lord hath spoiled their pasture. And the peaceable habitations are cut down because of the fierce anger of the Lord.”-—Jeremiah 25 : 32-37.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">No ruler can give a satisfactory answer as to why the World War suddenly stopped in 1918. But God’s Word explains that the reason it ceased at that time was that an opportunity might be given to the rulers, as well as to the people, to hear the testimony concerning the Lord and His kingdom. Men failing to take heed to this, the Lord Jesus declares that there shall follow a time of trouble such as the world lias never known, and that this shall be the last trouble of earth.—Matthew 24: 21, 22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">All the nations and kingdoms of earth are rapidly marching to the great battle of God Almighty. This will convince the peoples, as well as the rulers, that Jehovah is God and that Jesus Christ is the King of kings and Lord of lords.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>The Remedy</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">What men desire is a righteous government, one that will guarantee to them peace, prosperity, health, life, liberty and happiness. From the beginning it was God’s purpose that man should enjoy these blessings everlastingly. Because of sin man lost the right to all of them. God then began to work out His plan</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font3">of redemption and deliverance for man. He promised to redeem man from death and from the power of the grave. (Hosea 13:14) In due time He sent His Beloved away the right to life, because of man’s Son Jesus into the world, to redeem the disobedience. Jehovah God alone can world. (John 3:16; 10:10; Matthew provide life for the human race. He has 20:28) The death and resurrection of I made provision for the obedient ones to Jesus provided redemption for ail, andlhave life through Christ Jesus, and there-</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div style="border-left:solid;">
<p><span class="font3">in God’s due time all mankind shall have the benefit thereof.—Hebrews 2:9; 1 Timothy 2: 3-6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">God promised that Jesus Christ, His Beloved Son, should come again and restore to men all things that had been lost. (Acts 3:19,20) Now the time has arrived; Christ has come as God’s anointed King, Jehovah has set Him upon His holy throne to rule and now commands all to give allegiance to His King and kingdom. (Psalm 2:1-11) Let the rulers of the earth now take heed to Jehovah’s Word, accept His anointed King, and lend their power and influence to turning the minds of the people away from the Devil and to Jehovah God and to earth’s rightful King. Thus doing, they will employ their powers and faculties in the interest of peace and righteousness. Messiah’s kingdom now at hand will bring the desire of every honest heart.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Peace</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">There can be no lasting peace without a righteous government. God promised that His King- shall reign in righteousness and His representatives with justice. (Isaiah 32:1) Upon the righteous shoulder of the Prince of Peace shall that government rest, and the peace thereof shall never end. (Isaiah 9:6,7) No more shall the people be afflicted with war, nor be burdened with taxation for the preparation for war, nor shall they even have fear of such.—Isaiah 2: 2-4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Prosperity</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Under .the present world powers a few people have an abundance, many must skimp in order to eat and be clothed, while many others are objects of charity. Such will not be the conditions under God’s anointed King, whom He has now placed upon His throne. In this kingdom “shall the Lord of Hosts make unto all people a feast of fat things”. (Isaiah 25:6) Every man then will enjoy the fruits of his labor and dwell in happiness with those whom he loves.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font3">by it is written: “This is life eternal that they might know thee, the only trua God, and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">All the world powers are. the offspring of Satan. These can never bring life to man. God’s kingdom through Christ Jesus is now at hand, and those who render themselves in obedience to this kingdom shall live and shall not die. God’s Word declares that Christ Jesus comes to judge the living and the dead. (2 Timothy 4:1) The living shall first be given an opportunity, then all who are in their graves shall come forth, and those who keep the law of God shall never see death. (John 5:29; 8:51; 11: 26) God’s kingdom is here. Therefore with confidence it can be announced that MILLIONS NOW LIVING WILL NEVER DIE I The presumption is that when restoration blessings begin, millions will gladly avail themselves of the opportunity for life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">God made the earth for man’s habitation. (Isaiah 45: 12,18) The earth shall be the eternal home of restored man. The reign of Christ will destroy all of man’s enemies, the chiefest amongst which is death. (1 Corinthians 15:25, 26) Satan himself shall eventually ba destroyed and there shall be no more death.—Hebrews 2:14; Revelation 21: 1-6.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>Happiness</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">With a righteous government functioning for man’s good; with lasting peace on earth and good will toward men; with all the people enjoying health, and with no fear of sickness and death; with all families being united together and dwelling in peace, the human race will enjoy eternal happiness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Let the kings and rulers of the earth now give their allegiance and devotion to the Lord. Let them acknowledge Jehovah as God, and Christ Jesus as His anointed King; and thus doing they will render a real service to the people and put .themselves in line for the eternal blessings of Jehovah.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Health</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">All the efforts put forth by the world powers cannot bring health to the people. No one now has perfect health. But be of good courage! Under the righteous King all who are obedient to His reign will be made well. God has promised to cure them and to bring them health, to the end that no more shall the Inhabitants say: “I am sick.”—Jeremiah 33: 6; Isaiah 33: 24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Life</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">The first lie told by Satan was: “There is no death.” Long experience has proven to man how great was that falsehood. God gave man life. God took</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Judge Rutherford’s memorable address made a profound impression on the vast audience who heard him. The throngs outside Royal Albert Hall, unable to gain admittance, were nevertheless able to hear by means of loud, speakers which had been installed outside the building for that purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">following the close of the International Bible Students convention in London, which reached its climax in the foregoing address, Judge Rutherford proceeded to Spain and Portugal, where he addressed large audiences. His lectures were also radiocast throughout Spain and continental Europe.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark23"></a>Comfort for the Jews</span></h6>
<p><span class="font3">[Radiocast from Watchtower WBBR on a wave length of 272.6 meters, by Judge Rutherford.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">T</span><span class="font5">HE most conclusive reason why the Jews could not keep the law covenant is that all of them were imperfect. These imperfections resulted from the sin of Adam. God created Adam a. perfect man. When Adam violated God’s law the sentence of death was the inevitable result. To enforce this judgment he was expelled from Eden. It was after this, and while undergoing the sentence, that Adam exercised his God-given power to beget children,. It was impossible for the condemned and now imperfect man, undergoing the judgment of death,to produce perfect children. Hence all of his children were born imperfect. Every imperfect creature before God is condemned; that is to say, disapproved. Therefore by the disobedience of Adam sin became active and he was sentenced to death, and condemnation resulted to all of his offspring. Hence all were born sinners.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This is exactly what the prophet of God says: “Behold, I was shapen in iniquity, and in sin did my mother conceive me.” (Psalm 51: 5) No matter what man might do, his children must be born sinners until God exercises His power to remove the disability. Every human being on earth of course is descended from Adam; hence every one is condemned as a sinner.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The law covenant promised life to every one who could keep it. But no one could keep that law. Even though the Jews had been obedient to the law to the best of their ability, they could not have kept it perfectly. What advantage then to them in having the law? If they had done their best and kept the spirit of the law. they would have been blessed in the field and in store, blessed in their homes and blessed m their iam-ilies, and blessed with health and strength, relieved from disease and wars and famines, and would have lived long on earth in peace and in happiness. Had they loved. God and tried to serve Him, they would have learned that lie has a great plan for tlic-ir salvation, and. notion the Jews only but for all mankind; and that some day He would put that plan into operation and give all the obedient cues lire. Without a doubt the law was intended as a teacher or schoolmaster that would lead the Jews in the way that would bring eternal life to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">After repeated attempts to keep the law and foiling, the Jews must have realized that the difficulty was due to the sin of Adam, whie® made them imperfect. This knowledge must have been handed down from generation to generation to the time of Israel. Those who really familiarized themselves with what Moses and the other prophets said must have realized that Adam’s disobedience had brought them imperfection. Abraham had not known a law covenant, and yet he loved God and did his very best to please Him and had faith in Him. How could the Jews or any other of mankind be relieved of this imperfection resulting from sin? God through His prophet says: “Come now, let us reason together, saith the Lord: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow ; though they be red like crimson, they, shall be as wool.”—Isaiah 1:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Otherwise stated, God said to the Jews: Ton are sinners; but I have a plan by which in due time I will relieve you of this disability. You must know that I am Almighty God. You must have no other god beside me. if you will go about serving the Devil you cannot have my blessing. But if you serve me, in due .time I will bless you. Even though you are sinners and your sin is so great that it is red like crimson, I will wash it away and make you white and clean.’ Why did not the Jews reason together? Because they were overreached by Satan the enemy whose wicked influence induced them to turn away from God and to worship idols and serve the Devil. This is why God repeatedly brought punishment upon them. But when they would cry unto Him He would hear them and bring them back. They have spent a long dark night of warfare.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Now in the latter days, at the close of the Gentile times, God’s favor is returning to Israel and the light begins to shine as the great anti-typical Jubilee opens. Let all now in calmness and sobriety of mind reason together and see what God, through His Word, teaches concerning the removing of the disability that resulted from Adam’s sin and why He has provided a way to lead mankind to life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">God must be consistent; therefore reason leads to the conclusion that He could not set aside tire judgment that He had entered against Adam. He could, however, be consistent and at the same time arrange for that judgment to be satisfied, by permitting another to pay the debt</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">of Adam and thereby to open the way for Adam and his offspring to be released from sin and death and all of its evil effects. God could thus provide redemption for the human race. There is nothing more certainly taught in the Holy Scriptures than the doctrine of redemption. Some of the texts of the Old Testament 'will here be read with interest:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Job</span><span class="font5"> was a prophet of God. He stood as a representative of mankind. Evidently Job had been taught by the Lord that it was God’s purpose to redeem the race; for he wrote: “For I know that my Redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth; and though, after my skin, worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God.” (Job 19: 25, 26) Job also understood and taught that after the human race had been ransomed or redeemed man would be restored to his original youth and beauty. In poetic phrase Job describes the suffering of the people, and then states that when they know the truth and obey it they shall be saved from going down into death and be restored to health and strength: “If there be a messenger with him, an interpreter, one among a thousand, to shew unto man his uprightness; then he is gracious unto him, and saith, Deliver him from going down to the pit; I have found a ransom. His flesh shall be fresher than a child’s: he shall return to the days of his youth.” —Job 33:23-25.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Moses</span><span class="font5"> frequently prophesied concerning the times of restitution. See Genesis 18:18; 22:18; 28:14. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Samuel</span><span class="font5"> the prophet said: “The Lord killeth, and maketh alive: he bringeth down to the grave, and bringeth up.”—1 Samuel 2: 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">David</span><span class="font5"> prophesied that God would provide redemption and grant life everlasting to the people. (Psalm 19:14; 21: 4) He also wrote: “For when he dieth, he shall carry nothing away; his glory shall not descend after him; . . . But God will redeem my soul from the power of the grave; for he shall receive me.” (Psalm 49:17, 15) Furthermore, the Psalms foretold the time when all the peoples of the earth should come and worship God, and that after the long dark night of sin and suffering a time of endless joy would come (Psalm 22:27; 37:11; 45: 5,17; 86: 9); that Fie would return man, whom He had. sent into destruction (Psalm 90:3); and that then the world should be established and not be moved.—Psalm 93:2; 96:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Solomon</span><span class="font5"> testified that the earth should abide for ever as man’s habitation (Ecclesiastes 1:4), which is in harmony with Isaiah’s prophecies to this effect, as we have already noted.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Isaiah</span><span class="font5"> plainly prophesied as God’s witness that God would redeem the race and that He would prepare a happy way for them to return to him, and He called it a way of holiness: “And an highway shall be there, and a way, and it shall be called, The way of holiness; the unclean shall not pass over it; but it shall be for those: the wayfaring men, though fools, shall not err therein. No lion shall be there, nor any ravenous beast shall go up thereon, it shall not be found there: but the redeemed shall walk there. And the ransomed of the Lord shall return, and come to Zion with songs and everlasting joy upon their heads : they shall obtain joy and gladness, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away.” (Isaiah 35: 8-10) To the same effect this prophet prophesied concerning redemption, in Isaiah 44: 22; 51:11; and 59: 20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Daniel</span><span class="font5"> and all the minor prophets likewise foretold a time coming in which the Lord will restore the obedient ones of mankind to perfect conditions. This w<sup>T</sup>ould be impossible without redemption first.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In fact all the prophets, without a single exception, testified that God in due time will restore mankind to human perfection and that man will then live for ever on the earth. Now reason would conclude that such is impossible unless God first redeemed the race from the Adamic curse. It follows, in harmony with the other statements above made, that God would redeem mankind. Again God said through His prophet Isaiah that He had made the earth for man to live on, that He had not made it in vain, that it should be man’s habitation, and that the earth would abide for ever.—Isaiah 45:12,18; Ecclesiastes 1:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is quite apparent that the first and chief purpose of the law was to foreshadow better things to come and that by this schoolmaster God would teach the Jews concerning this blessing, that they might be used by Him in due time to give blessings to others. God used them to make pictures by which they might learn, and by which others through them might learn, of His coming blessings. Call to mind the sacrifices of Israel and what these represented. When Abraham was one hundred years old and when his wife had passed the age of women for childbearing, God had given him a son. This shows the overruling of divine providences in the birth of Isaac. Next we see Abraham with his only eon at the-mountain. An altar is built, the son is bound to it, Abraham is lifting his knife to slay his only son, and would have done so. What could this picture? Abraham was a friend of God and represented Jehovah God. Isaac, the only son of Abraham, represented God’s Son, who in due time would be permitted to die in order that he might become the great ransom sacrifice for man.—Genesis 22:1-18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Israelites were suffering great oppression in Egypt under Pharaoh. Egypt was a type of the entire world of sin, while Pharaoh pictured Satan the Devil, the invisible ruler of the world. The Israelites undergoing suffering pictured the entire human race and the suffering through which tlm race has passed. Repeated attempts were made to have the Israelites removed from Egypt, but without avail. Then God brought the death plague upon Egypt, and all the first-born died. Why, did not all of the first-born of the Jews die? The answer is that God commanded that for each house of the Israelites a lamb without blei’nish should be taken and killed and roasted whole, without even breaking a bone; that the blood of this lamb should be sprinkled over the doorway; and that the family should go into the house, close the door and remain there until the death angel had passed. For all who obeyed this command the first-born of that family was spared. The sacrifice of the lamb foreshadows that some day its antitype would be sacrificed, and that the antitype rvould take away the sin of man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The price required for the sawing of the firstborn of Israel was the placing of themselves under the protection of the blood of the paschal lamb. The Jews were commanded to observe this Passover each year. This clearly-proves that its yearly observance was typical and that the blood of the antitype would provide redemption for man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">God commanded Moses to build a tabernacle to be used in connection with the atonement sacrifice to be observed once a year. On the Atonement Day the high priest was required to kill a bullock, burn its flesh upon the altar in the court, and carry its blood into the Most Holy. This was to be a sin-offering. Then he was required to kill the Lord’s goat, and do with it the same as he did with the blood of the bullock. (See Leviticus 16:1-23.) The fact that this ceremony must be repeated once each year, and that it was for the purpose of a sin-offering, shows that it was a type foreshadowing that animals merely represent the one whose blood, at God’s due time, would be offered in the Most Holy, even heaven itself, as the great atonement for the sins of the people. This of course meant the death of the one who should thus provide the sin-offering. As a type must continue until the antitype comes, had the Jews remained true and faithful to God and observed all the law to the best of their ability until God’s due time to act, He would have shown them how their disability could be removed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The fact that God plainly says that He is about to make a new covenant, and that this new covenant will provide the way to life, and that restoration to human perfection will be the blessing to the people, necessarily proves that the great sin-offering must be completed and the disability removed before the new covenant can be made by which the Jews will receive the blessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In view of the fact that we are approaching the time when the new covenant is to be made, it behooves every Jew to look well to the teaching of God’s Word that he may see what provision God has made for releasing the Jews from the disability resulting from Adam’s sin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Could the yearly sacrifice of bulls and goats relieve the Jews from their sins and enable them to keep the law covenant? No. The fact that the ceremony must be repeated every year shows that it merely pictured the fact that some day God would cause the antitype to be performed. David testifies „ that this sacrifice of animals was not adequate to take away the sin; but that what God desired was to teach the people the way of obedience that He might show them His effectual way of removing sin.—Psalm 40:5-8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">■- Thus far we have reasoned upon these things taught in the Scriptures for the purpose of showing that God intended to redeem mankind. Now let us look at a positive promise made: <sup>£</sup>T will ransom them from the power of the grave; I will redeem them from death: O death, I will be thy plagues; 0 grave. I will be thy destruction.”—Hosea 13:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Fortunately for the Jews the Devil was never able to induce them to believe in the doctrine of conscious torment in hell-fire and brimstone. He left that sweet morsel for the Catholic and Protestant preachers to roll under their tongues. The Devil has used such preachers to screech out hell-fire and damnation to frighten the people, to arouse their passions; and while in this distressed condition of mind he has induced them in the name of Christianity to vent their spleen and venom upon the Jews. The persecution of the Jews by so-called Christians is one of the blackest things upon the world’s escutcheon. Of those who have indulged in the wicked persecution of the Israelites undoubtedly God will</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">.. require at their hands some recompense.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">All the prophets of God taught that </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">sheol,</span><span class="font5"> the grave, and hell are one and the same condition, referring to the condition of death. The Jews know that the Scriptures taught that all in their graves are dead, unconscious, and know nothing.—Ecclesiastes 9: 5,10; Psalm 115:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Now the positive promise through the Prophet Hosea is that God will redeem man from death, the grave, and destroy death. To redeem or ransom man from the grave moans that God will provide a means of satisfaction of the judgment against Adam and th,at then the dead would be awakened out of death and brought forth from that state or condition back to life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">David expressed his confidence in the redemption and resurrection of the dead when he wrote: “Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoiceth: my flesh also shall rest in hope. For thou wilt not leave my soul in hell; neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption. Thou wilt shew me the path of life: in thy presence is fulness of joy; at thy right hand there are pleasures for evermore.”—Psa. 16:9-11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Ransom means an exact corresponding price. It follows then that if man is to be ransomed or redeemed within the meaning of the words of the Prophet Hosea the price to be paid must be exactly that which the law required that the sinner should pay. God’s will or judgment is that Adam, the sinner, should forfeit his life and go .into death. God by His law then plainly states what would be required for the ransom; namely, ‘a life for a life.’—Deuteronomy 19: 21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Adam was a perfect man when he sinned, and the ransom requires that the life of a perfect man must be given to produce the price that will enable God to justly release Adam and his offspring from death and its effects. Was there a perfect man on earth that could meet these divine requirements? God answers: “None of them can by any means redeem his brother, nor give to God a ransom for him.”—Psalm 49: 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The race must be blessed with an opportunity for life, because God by His word and by His oath promised Abraham that such should be. The ra.ce could not be blessed until redeemed. Man must be redeemed because God gave His solemn word and promise that He would ransom him. God must, and will, keep His word inviolate. The irresistible conclusion therefore is that Jehovah God must make some provision for the redemption of man, and that to this end He must prepare a perfect man exactly corresponding to the perfect man Adam when he was in Eden and before he sinned; and that this perfect man must go into death to provide the ransom or redemptive price. These irresistible conclusions are reached by reasoning upon the scriptures of the Old Testament, which all Jew’s claim to believe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Since Moses declared that the Messiah was greater than Moses, and since the Redeemer must be a perfect man, it would seem reasonable to conclude that the Redeemer might be the Messiah. Now let the Scriptures which God gave to the Jews be used and carefully considered to determine who is the Redeemer and who is the Messiah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Bible Questions and Answers</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">[Radiocast from Watchtower WBBR on a wave length of 272.6 meters, by Judge Rutherford.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Q</span><span class="font5">UESTION : Is there such a thing as the spirit of a dead person roaming about the earth? I have known people who claim to have seen such a thing. Was it a dead person or not?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Answer: No. It was not a dead person. The Bible explanation is this: Spirit beings who are the allies of Satan, the Devil, have the power to </span><span class="font5">represent our dead friends and relatives, in form and by voice. These evil spirit beings who rebelled against God know just how our dead relatives liv^d when on earth, and many things about them. Evil spirits try to discredit the Bible, the Word of truth, by trying to make people believe that the dead are more alive than</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">ever. Those who cater to spiritism- are soon led into error, ar±d lose faith in God and the Bible. .The Bible says, in Ecclesiastes 9:5, “The living know that they shall die, but the dead know not anything.” In Eccl. 9:10 we read, “What. soever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might; for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave whither thou goest.” The dead are dead until the awakening in the resurrection. The Lord told the children of Israel to avoid spiritism, under penalty .of death. In Leviticus 20:27 we read, “A man also, or a woman, that hath a familiar spirit, or that is a wizard, shall surely be put to death: they shall stone them with stones: their blood shall be upon them.” These words of the Lord should be a warning to all who have faith in spiritism. Let us remember that one cannot be loyal to the Lord and at the same time play with the Devil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Question : In John 5: 28, 29, we read, “Marvel not at this, for the hour is coming in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his Voice, and shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation.” What is the meaning of the word damnation?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Answer: The word rendered damnation in this text is from the Greek word </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">krisis,</span><span class="font5"> which really means judgment. In forty-one instances in the New Testament it is rendered in the English by the word judgment, against but three places where it is translated damnation. The thought is this: In the resurrection they that have done good will be given eternal life immediately; while those who have not theretofore known the Lord will come forth and be placed on trial for the first time. Even these, it they make good by the help of the Lord during their period of testing, will eventually be granted everlasting life upon the earth. That this is the correct thought, is shown by Matthew 11:22, the words of Jesus, “It shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the day of judgment, than for you.” Christ meant that it would be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon, heathen people, in the one-thousand-year judgment period of His kingdom, than for those Jews who rejected the truth at His first advent. The Greek word here correctly rendered judgment is </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">krisis.</span><span class="font5"> Again we read in Matthew 12:18 of Christ Jesus, who will place the heathen and all the Gentiles on trial during His kingdom: “Behold my servant, whom I have chosen; my beloved, in whom my soul is well pleased: I will put my spirit upon him, and he shall show judgment </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">[krisis]</span><span class="font5"> to the Gentiles.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Question: Was Mary Magdalene the mother of Jesus or was it another Mary?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Answer : Mary Magdalene was ~ not the mother of Jesus. During the ministry of Jesus in Galilee Mary Magdalene, possibly from the town of Magdala, was among the individuals healed of evil spirits. In Luke 8:2 we read, “And certain women which had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities, Mary called Magdalene, out of whom went seven devils,” etc. Mary Magdalene became an ardent lover of the Master and is mentioned several places in the New Testament, in connection with the accounts of Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Question: If there is an everlasting heaven, does it not follow that there is an everlasting hell of torment?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Answer : No. The Bible holds that the reward of the righteous is </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">everlasting</span><span class="font5"> life; the punishment of the wicked is everlasting death, extinction of being, from which there will be no recovery. In Ezekiel 18: 20 we read, “The soul that sin-neth it shall die.” In Psalm 145:20 we read, “All the wicked will he [God] destroy.” Words to the same effect in Psalm 37:10 state, “Yet a little while and the wicked shall not be; thou shalt diligently consider his place and it shall not be.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Question: What is the meaning of John 14: 16, “And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another comforter, that he may abide with you forever.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Answer: This means that Jesus prayed that the heavenly Father might send the holy spirit to comfort His disciples. The holy spirit indeed abides with all of God’s children who persist in learning of the great Jehovgh, and who continue in doing His will. The mere fact that the masculine gender is ascribed to the holy spirit does not attribute personality to it. L has been the custom in many languages to ascribe gender to objects wholly inanimate. For instance, the </span><span class="font5">German applies the masculine gender to a table, and says, “D,er Tisch ist von Holz gemacht; er steht in der Mitte des Zimmers,” which translated means, “The table is made of wood; </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">he </span><span class="font5">stands in. the middle of the room.” We would not attribute personality to a table, a thing made of wood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The holy spirit is the invisible power of God. It is not a personality. The holy spirit was a means employed by the heavenly Father in the work of creation, and it enables the one begotten by it to understand God’s Word of truth. The holy spirit enables the Christian to do God’s will, bringing him hope, peace and joy. In Romans 15:13, we read, “Now</span><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;"><sup>t</sup></span><span class="font5"> the God of hope fill you with joy and peace in believing, that ye mav abound in hope, THROUGH THE POWER OF THE HOLY SPIRIT.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Question: To whom should the Christian make confession for wrong doing?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Answer: To Jehovah God, of course. If God does not forgive the sin there is no forgiveness. In 1 John 1: 9 we read, “If we confess our sins [unto God], he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.” In Psalm 86:5, we again read, “For thou Lord [Jehovah] art good and readj^ to forgive ; and plenteous in mercy unto all them that call upon thee.” Notice that the Scriptures tell us to confess and. acknowledge our sins to God, and that He will forgive our sins. The Bible does not authorize any man to take the place of Jehovah God in hearing confessions and to forgive sins.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Question : Has any organization on earth the powrnr to forgive sins?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Answer : It would be very presumptuous for any person or group of persons on earth to assume the right which resides only with the heavenly Father. In 1 John 1:9 we read, “If we confess our'sins [unto God] he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Question: Please explain the expression in Luke 17: 20, “The kingdom of God cometh not with observation.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Answer : It means that God’s kingdom, would be set up in an invisible manner, without demon</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">stration, unseen by human eye. The Scriptures plainly teach that Christ Jesus, as a powerful spirit Being, would institute the kingdom of His Father in a great time of trouble. The only people on earth who Avould know what had taken place would be the Christians who study the Bible and who have in mind the prophecies relative to the kingdom. The Christian, noting the events of earth as a fulfilment of prophecies, could definitely conclude what had taken place in the invisible realm. Jesus Himself definitely pointed out in prophecies the events which would transpire, and which would give assurance of the ending of the old world, or governments under Satan, and the beginning of God’s king-■ dom. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In Matthew’ 24:3 the disciples asked Jesus, “Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the sign of thy presence and of the end of the world?” The answer of Jesus clearly shows that the kingdom has already begun, and Scriptural chronology marks A. D. 1914 as the time when that kingdom was instituted. Jesus said in answer that there would be wars, famines, revolutions in different parts of the earth; men’s hearts would fail them for fear of the things about to come upon the earth; the Jews would go back to Palestine; and the gospel of the kingdom would be preached by His follow’ers in all the nations. All of these prophecies have been in process of fulfilment, for the first time, since 1914. Jesus said, “When ye shall see all of these things, know that he is near, even at the doors.” <sup>:</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In Daniel 2:44 we read, “And in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom shall not be left to other people, but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand forever.” From fulfilled prophecies the Christian knows that the kingdom has begun, and that Satan lias been ousted from his place of rulership. Satan is about to be bound for a thousand years, and the race of mankind will then exper'ence the manifold blessings of the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Question: Please explain the expression in Luke 17:21, “Behold the kingdom of God is within you.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Answer : The marginal rendering of this pas</span><span class="font5">sage is better. It states, “Behold the kingdom of God is </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">among</span><span class="font5"> you.” Jesus was the chief representative, as King of the kingdom; and He was in the midst of the company of Pharisees who asked Him concerning the kingdom. We must recognize that a kingdom is composed of two parts—the ruling class and the subjects. Christ, as the prospective King, was then in their very midst. So today, the faithful followers of Christ Jesus, who make proclamation of the incoming kingdom and who are prospective heirs with Christ in the kingdom, are in the midst of the world who&quot; know not God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Some have tried to use this text to support the idea that the kingdom of God is in the hearts of Christians. This is absolutely wrong, because these words were addressed to the Pharisees, who sought to entrap Jesus; and these Pharisees/ the religionists of Jesus’ day, were hypocrites. Jesus said concerning them that they would be the least worthy of the kingdom—that even thieves, murderers and adulterers would enter the kingdom before they would.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Question : Since you have stated on various occasions that infants could not enter the kingdom of heaven, please explain Matthew 19:14, “But Jesus said, Suffer little children, and forbid them not, to come unto me: for of such is the kingdom of heaven.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Answer : Jesus here meant that all who would enter the kingdom of heaven must be teachable, like little children—and not that infants go to heaven. Just as a child puts confidence in its parents, so the Christian must maintain his confidence in the heavenly Father from the time that he makes a consecration to do God’s will unto death. Jesus called His disciples “babes”, because they were teachable. In Matthew 11:25 we read, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“I</span><span class="font5"> thank thee, 0 Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes.” Surely we could not believe that any of the disciples ’were infants in years: but they were babes, in the sense that they were obedient</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is an impossibility for an infant to become a Christian. A Christian is one who does the will of the heavenly Father by following in the footsteps of Christ. In order to do the will of God knowledge is necessary. Infants do not have this capacity. Only a very few people will ever get to heaven, and they are the individuals who faithfully do the will of the heavenly Father. This requires will power, decision, a maturity of mind not possessed by infants. Jesus said, “Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Question : If infants do not go to heaven, what hope for them does the Bible entertain?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Answer : The Bible holds that all infants, and also all those who have not had the privilege to make a consecration to do God’s holy will before death, will come back to earth in the resurrection. These infants, growing to manhood and womanhood in the kingdom, will learn of God’s will and, being obedient, will be granted life everlasting upon the earth. The Lord gives us definite word concerning the awakening of the infants in the resurrection, and of their return to earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In Jeremiah 31:15,16 we read, “A voice was heard in Ramah, lamentation, and bitter weeping; Rachel weeping for her children refused to be comforted for her children, because they were not. [They were not living, they were dead.] Thus saith the Lord: Refrain thy voice from weeping, and thine eyes from tears: for thy work shall be rewarded, saith the Lord; and they shall come again from the land of the enemy. [The land of the enemy is the state of death.] And there is hope in thine end, saith the Lord, that thy children shall come again to their own border.” To return again to their own border means to return to the confines of the land in which they formerly died, and nothing else. There will be great joy in the earth when the mothers receive their infants back from the tomb of death, as the Lord has stated.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5"><sup>532</sup>It is well that .we take note here of the apparel of the bride of Christ now entering glory. “And to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen, clean and white.” (Revelation 19: 8) “The king’s daughter is all glorious within the palace; her clothing is of wrought gold. She shall be brought unto the king in raiment of needlework.” (Psalm 45:13,14) Thus in symbolic phrase the prophet describes the inherent beauty of the church when she is presented faultless before the glorious presence of Jehovah. It will be impossible for human words to approximate the grandeur and the majesty of the scene. Before the great white throne of the heavenly Father, bride and Bridegroom will be made one; and the glory of the church will be complete. There, in the presence of Jehovah, she will have fulness of joy and pleasures for evermore.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Oh that will be a union</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Such as earth has never known, When bride and Bridegroom are made one Before the great white throne.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>533</sup>The members of the body of Christ in glory will be a monument of the grace of God, because thus will be demonstrated the power, as well as the love, of Jehovah in taking insignificant creatures from amongst men and exalting them to the highest place in the universe, next to the Lord Jesus. Then she will be held forth in the power of Jehovah, exhibited as a crown of glory in Uis hand, and be used by Him to accomplish that which He purposed from the foundation of the world. As the glorified bride of our heavenly Bridegroom, clothed with honor and immortality, she will possess life everlasting, inherent life; and with her Bridegroom she will minister life and blessing to others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>534</sup>St. John had a vision of this wonderful royal family of heaven, and in symbolic language he described it as “the holy city, the new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven”. (Revelation 21:1-5) Thus he depicts the approaching kingdom of Messiah. In vision he saw the faithful followers of Jesus who are still on this side the vail, by faith beholding the approach of this happy time; and he describes them as those who had “gotten the victory over the beast [the Devil’s earthly organization], and over his image, and over his mark, and over the number of his name [whose allegiance is wholly to the Lord, and who] stand on the sea of glass, having the harps of' God. And they sing the song of Moses the servant of God [the song taught by the law, which foreshadowed the better things to come], and the song of the Lamb [the song of the clear fulfilment of prophecy and the unfolding of God’s plan, as set forth in the New Testament; they are playing upon their harps and praising Jehovah], saying. Great and marvelous are thy works, Lord God Almighty; just and true are thy ways, thou King of saints.” —Revelation 15: 2, 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>635</sup> The restoration string of the harp of God is one that will fill the earth with joyful song. Although every prophet from Samuel to John the Baptist spoke of the coming days of restoration, this wonderful doctrine represented by the tenth string of the harp was for a long time lost to the vision of many who claimed to be Christians, as was also the doctrine of the Abrahamic promise. Hence we see that the eight-string harp sometimes used by the Jews represents the harp of God minus the strings picturing the Abrahamic promise and restoration. Now these strings or doctrines have been found and appreciated by God’s people; and the harp fully strung yields music of unspeakable sweetness.</span></p>

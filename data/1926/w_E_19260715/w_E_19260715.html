D. 1884, &quot;For the Promotion of Christian Knowledge”. It not only serves as a class room where Bible students may meet in the study of the divine Word but also as a channel of communication through which they may be reached with announcements of the Society’s conventions and of the coming of its traveling representatives, styled &quot;Pilgrims”, and refreshed with reports </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">of</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"> its conventions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Our &quot;Berean Lessons” are topical rehearsals or reviews of our Society’s published </span><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Studies</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"> most entertainingly arranged, and very helpful to all who would merit the only honorary degree which the Society accords, vis., </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Verbi Dei Minister</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"> (V. D. M.), which translated into English is </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Minister of (rod’s Word.</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"> Our treatment of the International Simday School Lessons is specially for the older Bible students and teachers. By some this feature is considered indispensable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">This journal stands firmly for the defense of the only true foundation of the Christian’s hope now being so generally repudiated —redemption through the .precious blood of &quot;the man Christ Jesus, who gave himself a </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">ransom</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"> [a corresponding price, a substitute] for all”. (1 Peter 1:19; 1 Timothy 2:6) Building up on this sure foundation the gold, silver and precious stones (1 Corinthians 3: 1116; 2 Peter 1:5-11) of the Word of God, its further mission is to “make all see what is the fellowship of the mystery which. . .has been hid in God, ... to the intent that now might be made known by the church the manifold wisdom of God”—&quot;which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men as it is now revealed”.—Ephesians 3: 5-9,10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It stands free from all parties, sects and creeds of men, while it seeks more and more to bring its every utterance into fullest subjection to the will of God in Christ, as expressed in the holy Scriptures. It is thus free to declare boldly whatsoever the Lord hath spoken—according to the divine wisdom granted unto us to understand his utterances. Its attitude is not dogmatic, but confident; for we know whereof we affirm, treading with implicit faith upon the sure promises of God. It is held as a trust, to be used only in his service; hence our decisions relative to what may and what may not appear in its columns must be according to our judgment of his good pleasure, the teaching of his Word, for the upbuilding of his people in grace and knowledge. And we not only invite but urge our leaders to prove all its utterances by the infallible Word to which reference is constantly made to facilitate such testing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">TO US THE SCRIPTURES CLEARLY TEACH</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">That the church is “the temple of the living God”, peculiarly “his workmanship”; that its construction has been in progress throughout the gospel age—ever since Christ became the world’s Bedeemer and the Chief Corner Stone of his temple, through which, when finished, God’s blessing shall come “to all people”, and they find access to him.—1 Corinthians 3:16, 17; Ephesians 2:20-22; Genesis 28:14; Galatians 3 : 29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">That meantime the chiseling, shaping, and polishing of consecrated believers in Christ’s atonement for sin, progresses; and when the last of these “living stones”, “elect and precious,” shall have been made ready, the great Master Workman will bring all together in the first resurrection ; and the temple shall be filled with his glory, and be the meeting place between God and men throughout the Millennium.—Revelation 15 : 5-8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">That the basis of hope, for the church and the world, lies in the fact that “Jesus Christ, by the grace of God, tasted death for </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">every </span><span class="font7">man,” “a ransom for all,” and will be “the true light which lighteth </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">every man that cometh into the world&quot;,</span><span class="font7"> “in due time”.— Hebrews 2:9; John 1: 9 ; 1 Timothy 2:5, 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">That the hope of the church is that she may be like her Lord, “see him as he is,” be &quot;partakers of the divine nature’,’ and share his i glory as his joint-heir.—1 John 3 :2 ; John 17:24; Romans 8 :17 ; 2 Peter 1:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">That the present mission of the church is the perfecting of the saints for the future work of service; to develop in herself every grace ; to be God’s witness to the world ; and to prepare to be kings and priests in the next age.—Ephesians 4 :12 ; Matthew 24 : 14 ; Revelation 1: 6 ; 20 : 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">That the hope for the world lies in the blessings of knowledge and opportunity to be brought to </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font7"> by Christ’s Millennial kingdom, the restitution of all that was lost In Adam, to all the willing and obedient, at the hands of their Redeemer and his glorified church, when all the wilfully wicked will be </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">destroyed.</span><span class="font7">—Acts 3:19-23; Isaiah 35.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font13"><a name="bookmark5"></a>LONDON CONVENTION</span></h2>
<p><span class="font17">T</span><span class="font10">HE LORD put his blessing upon the London Convention of the International Bible Students. The enemy opposed it but failed. A few weeks before the time for the assembly a great labor disturbance arose in Great Britain, and every wheel of commerce stopped. The trouble was very serious. The military took charge. The government used its iron hand. The labor organization soon was defeated and the strike came to a sudden end.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Prior to the strike the railway companies had granted reduced fares to the Bible Students for the convention. When the strike was ended the reduced fares were cancelled. The brethren were determined to come, however, and did come. They came from South Africa, Switzerland, Germany, Denmark, Finland, Sweden, Australia, Spain, Canada, America, and from the British Isles. About four thousand of the consecrated were in attendance. From the very beginning it was manifest that these consecrated children of the Lord had come expecting a blessing. They were not disappointed. Never has such enthusiasm been seen amongst Christians in this land, and surely none greater any where else on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The convention opened Tuesday, May 25th, and closed May 31st. It was held at Alexandra Palace, a place beautiful for location, roomy and airy, and removed from the noise and disturbance of the city. It was an ideal place for a convention. The chairman of the convention was Brother Hemery of London, who was assisted by Brother Barber of Brooklyn and Brother Dey of Copenhagen. Addresses were delivered by the following named brethren: Brothers Senior, Hemery, Gillatt, Barber, Walder, Bowland, Young, Batchelor, Franz, Harrison, Lloyd, Pinnock, Scott, Guiver, Dey, Martin, Burton, Richards, Harbeck, Robinson, and Brother Rutherford. All the addresses were enthusiastically received.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Those who symbolized by water immersion totalled one hundred and eighty-four.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The outstanding feature of the convention was the unanimous adoption of a resolution as “A TESTIMONY TO THE RULERS OF THE WORLD”. This is a message which the Bible Students believe to be their privilege and duty to send to those responsible for earth’s governments. This will be done. It will also be distributed freely to the people. As the resolution together with the public address will constitute the volunteer matter for this year, the brethren everywhere will want to have it thoroughly in mind at the beginning of the distribution; therefore The Watch Tower carries a full report of the same.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Public meetings were held at Royal Albert Hall. Several months prior to the convention the subject selected for the public address to be delivered by the President of the Society was: “WHY WORLD POWERS ARE TOTTERING—THE REMEDY.” The labor disturbance about the time of the convention made the subject even more appropriate. Two hours in advance of the time of the meeting the crowds began to gather about Royal Albert Hall, London’s great assembly place; and when the doors were thrown open the great hall was filled exactly in eleven minutes, so eager were the people to rush in. Hundreds of others were left standing in the streets. This was anticipated, and voice amplifiers had been installed outside so that those in the streets could hear as well as those inside.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Prior to the meeting it was thought well to make an attempt to have the public address published in a London paper. The effort was made. The Lord blessed the effort. Of course the space had to be paid for, but this was gladly done that the people might have the message. The public press, being part of Satan’s organization, yields to the influence of money. Monday morning following the public meeting, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Daily News,</span><span class="font10"> London, with a regular circulation of eight hundred thousand, carried the full report of the resolution and public address. Many extra copies were printed and sold to the people on the streets. The resolution and public discourse follow:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">A TESTIMONY</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">To The Rulebs or the World :</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The International Bible Students In general convention assembled declare their unqualified allegiance and devotion to the Almighty God; and believing it to be their privilege and duty so to do, in obedience to the commandments of God, send this testimony to the governing powers of the world, to wit:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-variant:small-caps;">First. That it Is of paramount importance that all recognize that Jehovah, the Creator of'heaven and earth, is the true and Almighty God, besides whom there is none other; that his plan for man is set forth in the Bible, which</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Is his Word of Truth, and that Christ Jesus is the Executor- of Jehovah’s plan; that it is now apparent to all that the nations of the world are in dire distress and perplexity ; that great trouble, more terrible than any heretofore experienced, is now threatened; that the efforts of the rulers to establish a desirable government or world power have failed; and, now be it known unto you, that the outworking of God’s plan concerning man, and that alone, can and will stabilize the world, and bring lasting peace, prosperity and happiness to the peoples; and that the time has come for those who are exercising governing power over the peoples to recognize these great truths.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Second. That the reason for the prevailing condition of perplexity and distress is, because man disobeyed the true God and yielded to the wicked influence of Satan the false god; that Lucifer, originally the rightful overlord of man, because of his disloyalty to God became Satan the Devil, the instigator of all evil, the adversary of God and the arch enemy of man; that the evil one alienated man from the true God and caused him to sin, by reason of which man lost his perfect home and his right to life and happiness; that since then man has organized governments and world powers in an attempt to govern himself, but in so doing has ignored the Word of God and submitted to the control of Satan the Devil; that until now God has not interfered with Satan, to the end that man might be free to choose right or wrong and by experience learn the baneful effects of evil; but now the time has come when God will interfere in behalf of the peoples.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Third. That Christ Jesus, by his faithfulness unto death, became the Redeemer and Deliverer of mankind; that when on earth he taught that the time for the deliverance of the people would begin when the evil world, under the rulership of Satan, shall end; and that he, Christ Jesus, would return and set up God’s kingdom of righteousness that the peoples might know and follow the right way; and for this reason he taught his followers to pray, “Thy kingdom come, thy will be done on earth as in heaven” ; that in the meantime various world powers have been organized and carried on for the purpose of ruling and controlling the peoples; and these world powers are designated in the Scriptures by the symbol “beast”, for the evident reason that they are the result of the combined efforts of the commercial, political and ecclesiastical leaders of men, and are influenced and dominated by Satan, the god of this world; and these powers have been and are military, harsh, cruel and oppressive, and manifest the spirit of Satan, their invisible ruler or god; and now the repeated cries of oppressed humanity have reached unto the God of heaven, who will hear and deliver them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Fourth. That divine prophecy, now fulfilled and in the course of fulfilment, bears testimony to the fact that Satan’s lease of power is done, that the old world has ended, and that the time is at hand when Christ Jesus, the Executive Officer of Jehovah and the rightful King of earth, will oust Satan the evil one and begin His righteous government which shall establish God’s will on earth; that beginning with 1914 divine prophecy, in the course of fulfilment, gave testimony that the end of the evil world had begun in this, to wit: The world war, famine, pestilence, earthquakes, revolutions, the return of the Jews to Palestine and, later, the general distress and perplexity of the nations of the world; that this testimony of the fulfilment of the divine prophecy having been plainly given to the governing powers of the world, there is placed upon the shoulders of the rulers a responsibility that cannot be avoided.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Fifth. That although Jehovah God furnished conclusive proof that the evil world had ended and that the time for the reign of his beloved Son had come, yet this testimony </span><span class="font10">was ignored and pushed aside by those who should have known better; and contrary to the Word of God the commercial, political and ecclesiastical rulers attempted to stabilize the world and keep the peoples under control byadopting that makeshift which is called the League of Nations and which was wrongfully and blasphemously hailed as the political expression of God’s kingdom on earth , that the real author and father of the League of Nations compact is Satan the Devil, the god of this evil world, and was put forward by him as his last desperate effort to deceive the peoples, turn them away from the true God, and hold them under his own wicked control; that now after seven years of laborious effort on the part of the proponents of that compact to establish peace and prosperity, it is practically conceded that the League of Nations is a complete failure and that its utter collapse is a matter of only a brief space of time; that even now, while its advocates are striving to reassemble their forces to maintain that disintegrating and unholy alliance, the peoples are hearing the solemn warning of God’s prophet concerning the federation, saying, “Associate yourselves, O ye people, and ye shall be broken in pieces; ami give ear, all ye of far countries: gird yourselves and ye shall be broken in pieces. Take counsel together and it shall come to nought; speak the word and it shall not stand.”—Isaiah 8:9,10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Sixth. That by reason of the blinding influence of Satan the minds of the rulers and the ruled are turned away from the true God, and the evil forces are gathering the whole world unto the great battle of the Lord God Almighty; that there is now impending a time of trouble such as the world has never known, during which conflict Satan’s powerful organization shall fall, never to rise again, and there shall be such a demonstration of divftie power that all the nations will learn that Jehovah is God and that Christ Jesus is King of kings and Lord of lords.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Seventh. That the great tribulation will reveal to the people the kingdom of God, which kingdom shall rest upon the shoulder of his beloved Son, the Prince of Peace; and of the peace of that kingdom there shall be no end; it will bring the heart’s desire of all peoples of good will, and in that kingdom the blind ignorance with which the people have long been afflicted will be forever removed; and with the knowledge of and obedience to God there shall come to the people everlasting peace, prosperity, health, life, liberty and happiness; and the kingdom w’ill be the complete fulfilment of the prophetic song of the angels, “Peace on earth, good w-ill toward men.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Therefore we earnestly bear before you this testimony: That Jehovah is The God, and that he has installed Christ his Son, as </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Th e King</span><span class="font10"> of the earth, and bids you to give full obedience to earth’s rightful King. Do so and use your influence to turn the minds of the people to THE TRUE GOD, that disaster may not befall you.—Psalm 2: 2-12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">BROTHER RUTHERFORD’S ADDRESS</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">WHY WORLD POWERS ARE TOTTERING —THE REMEDY</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In the councils of the learned rulers of the world the burning questions are; “Why do the nations continue in distress and perplexity? What remedy can be applied that will stabilize the world?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">More than seven years have passed since the signing of the armistice which marked the end of the World War, and yet there are today more tangible evidences of the disruption and dissolution of the nations than ever before. There is good reason for this. There is a sure and certain remedy. The rulers of the world are respectfully requested to give candid consideration to the argument here submitted in support of the assigned reasons and the announced remedy. The seriousness of the situation warrants such candid consideration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The governing factors of the present world powers claim that their rule of the peoples is by divine right and authority, and therefore they have committed themselves to the divine law; and by this they should be governed and judged. This being true, then I need make no excuse for using the Bible as a basis for my argument.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">I propose to now prove that the trouble of this world has resulted because: (T) The law of Jehovah God has been disregarded and ignored; (2) and that throughout the ages world powers have been organized and succeeded each other, and have now reached a climax in the British Empire; (3) that in all of these world powers fraud has been freely practised in the name of religion and in the name of the Almighty God, and that the clergy have been chiefly used in the practising of such fraud; (4) that the time has come when Almighty God will make himself known to the people and will express his indignation against all hypocrisy; (5) that to this end Jehovah God has set his anointed King upon his throne of authority and judgment; (6) that the kingdom of God is the complete remedy for all human ills and that there is none other; and (7) that the rulers of the earth should now hear and heed these facts. In the consideration of these important questions a brief reference to the history of man, in the light of divine prophecy, is essential.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">JEHOVAH IS GOD</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Jehovah, the Eternal One, the Creator of heaven and earth, is the only true and living God. In him reside all rightful power and authority. He created man perfect and clothed him with authority to inhabit and rule the earth. (Genesis 1:26,27; Isaiah 45:12,18) He assigned his son Lucifer as man’s overlord, thereby establishing a confidential relationship between Lucifer and Jehovah, and charged Lucifer with a sacred duty toward man. Becoming ambitious to be like the Most High God, Lucifer betrayed his sacred trust and Induced man to violate God’s law. By this means man was alienated from Jehovah. (Genesis 2:1-5, 15-24) Thereupon Jehovah changed the name of Lucifer to that of Dragon, Satan, Serpent, and Devil, which names bespeak his evil disposition.—Revelation 20:1-3; Isaiah 14:12-15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">God expelled man from Eden, and permitted him to work out his own devices in an attempt to establish self-government. He did not deprive Satan of the authority as man’s overlord, nor did he interfere with Satan’s influencing of man. Jehovah placed before man his way of truth and righteousness, and left man free to exercise his own will either to obey the true God or to take the wrong way and yield to the influence of Satan, the evil god.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Early in their experiences men began to organize into bodies politic. Satan easily overreached men by introducing fraud and deceit. In mockery of Jehovah the adversary early induced men to call themselves by the name of the Lord; while at the same time, in truth and in fact, they were the instruments and subjects of the Devil. Thus hypocrisy was first introduced. (Genesis 4:2(5, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Maryin)</span><span class="font10"> It is easy to see that hypocrisy has been practised during the entire period of man’s history.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">GOD FORGOTTEN</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The first great world power organized by man was ancient Egypt. Its invisible ruler, or god, was Satan the Devil. In that land were domiciled the Israelites, whom God chose for his own people and whom he used to foreshadow his future purposes. He organized his people into a nation and commanded that they should have him as their God, and none other. (Exodus 20:4) The Isrr.e’itea were oppressed by the governing factors of Egypt. God sent Moses to deliver his people from the oppressive hand of the tyrannical ruler of that world power.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">At that time Jehovah made a great demonstration of his power by overthrowing the Egyptian world power; and he declared that he did so that the people might not forget; to their own hurt, that Jehovah is the true God. (2 Samuel 7: 23) Moses foreshadowed the great Messiah, the anointed King of Jehovah. In the overthrow of the Egyptians and the deliverance of the Israelites, God foreshadowed the ultimate deliverance of the oppressed peoples of earth from the wicked hand of Satan and his world powers, by which the people have long been held in subjection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In the course of time the Israelites yielded to the wicked influence of Satan the Devil, and their nation fell. With the fall of Israel Satan became the god, or invisible ruler, of all the nations of the earth, and is therefore designated in the Word of Jehovah as “the god of this world”. (2 Corinthians 4:3,4) But with the overthrow of Israel God declared that he would, in his own due time, send his anointed King with full power and authority to act, and that lie then would rule the world in righteousness.—Ezekiel 21: 24-27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Experience alone can teach man lasting lessons. For centuries man has been passing through fiery experiences, being buffeted, misled and defrauded by Satan. At all times God has placed before man the evidence that he is the true and righteous God, but few of mankind have heeded this testimony. Man has readily yielded to the seductive influence of Satan, and has suffered therefor and continues to suffer. In due season, by reason of these trying experiences, man will learn that his true Friend and Benefactor is the great Jehovah God, that his way is the right way, and that to know Jehovah God and obey him leads to life and happiness. This lesson, dearly bought, will be lasting and beneficial. Mankind is now at a period of the greatest crisis in their experiences. Their deliverance from despotic and unrighteous power is near at hand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">WORLD POWERS</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">World powers have been organized by men, with Satan as invisible ruler or overlord. To accomplish his purposes in keeping man under his control Satan has always resorted to deceit; and by this means he has overreached and controlled the world powers that have existed in all the ages, past and present.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">A world power is an organization formed and operated for the purpose of ruling the peoples. Seven great world powers have existed, in the order named, to wit: Egypt, Assyri:., Babylon, Medo-Persia, Greece, Rome, and the British Empire. Tile governing factors of each and every one of these world powers have been three, to wit: the commercia., political and religious elements. The god or invisible ruler of each has been Satan the Devil, even as the Scriptures declare. (2 Corinthians 4:3,4; John 12:31) When Rome adopted Christianity as her religion she was there hypocritically calling herself by the name of the Lord; but in truth and in fact she continued to be the representative of the Devil, even as was done in the day of Enos.—Genesis 4: 26, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">margin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">BEASTS</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">All of these world powers are indicated by Jthovah in his Word, and each one of them is designated by the Lord God under the symbol of “beast”. (Daniel 7:3) Tne evident reason for this is that all of these world powers have been harsh, ferocious and oppressive. The commercial element is cold, calculating, military and harsh. The political element is suave, diplomatic and faithless. The religious clement is, and always has been, sanctimonious, hypocritical, fraudulent and seductive. All of these reflect the disposition of their invisible ruler, Satan the Devil. In keeping with divine prophecy, these world powers have even designated themselves under the symbol of “beasts”. The British Empire has adopted the Lion as its symbol.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">GREATEST OF ALL</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Without question the greatest world power that has ever existed is the British Empire. The boast is truly made that “the sun never sets on her domains”. During the period of her existence education, science and invention have surpassed that of all other times. In finance she leads. In military strength she is at the head. In the exercise of political diplomacy she has no equal. Her clergymen are the acknowledged leaders of the ecclesiastical world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The claim is made for the British Empire, as has been done for other world powers, that she rules by divine right and authority. The British Empire, together with other nations, claims to form “Christendom” or Christ’s kingdom on earth. Therefore these call themselves by the rame of the Lord. But the law of Jehovah God is ignored and his name brought into disrepute.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Because Britain is the greatest of all world powers, because she together with her allies claims to be “Christendom” and to be ruling by divine right and authority, there rests upon the British Empire a,grave responsibility which cannot be evaded. Because the British world power is the very center and bulwark of the world’s civilization, and which the Lord symbolizes as a “beast”, and because London is its seat of government, and these governing factors claim to rule by divine right, here then is the very “seat of the beast”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The fall of the British Empire means the breaking up of the world’s civilization. Her learned rulers must see that her very pillars are now tottering to the fall. All the other nations of earth, moved by dread of impending disaster, are, together with the British Empire, arming for another and a more terrible conflict than has ever before been fought. Dor this reason the attention of the rulers is here earnestly directed to the divine prophecy relating to the powers of this world and to the kingdom of God, now in course of fulfilment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">And now I charge that the British world power, the head of so-called “Christendom”, while claiming to rule by divine right and authority, has openly repudiated the great Jehovah God and has rejected his anointed King, and that her clergy are chiefly responsible for this great wrong. Because of the rejection of God’s duly anointed King the world’s greatest trouble is impending and about to fall.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">EVERLASTING KINGDOM</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Prominently set forth in the Word of Jehovah is his purpose to set up his kingdom of righteousness, with his anointed Son, the Messiah, as the King. By the mouth of his holy prophet Jehovah describes the beastly world powers or kingdoms, of which the British world power is the seventh; foretells their warring with each other; and then declares: “And in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom shall not be left to other people, but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever.”—Daniel 2: 44.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">This prophecy relates to the kingdom foretold by all the holy prophets of Jehovah. This is the kingdom for which Jesus (elight his followers to pray, “Thy kingdom come; thy will be done on earth as in heaven.” This is the kingdom wh,ch the clergy of all denominations, in all times past, h;&gt;”e declared would come at some future time. Now God himself has given conclusive proof, which proof is available for all mankind and particularly for the rulers, that his due time has come; and he now calls upon the rulers of earth to recognize and render allegiance and obedience to his anointed King, whom he has set upon his throne.—Psalm 2: 2-12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">THE PROOF</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Jesus taught that he would return and set up the Kingdom of Jehovah. For nineteen centuries his faithful followers have anxiously waited for that time to come. Before Jesus departed from the earth the question was propounded to him by his faithful disciples: “When shall these things come to pass, and what shall the proof of thy presence be, and of the end of the world?” (Matthew 24:3) The Lord Jesus, as the mouthpiece of Jehovah God, speaking prophetically and with authority, answered that the time would be marked by the fact that the nations and kingdoms of the earth would become angry; and that then there would be a great world war, followed shortly by famines, pestilences, earthquakes and revo utions; and that these things would be the beginning of sorrows upon the nations and kingdoms of the earth.—Matthew 24: 7-18 ; Rev. 11:17,18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In 1914, exactly the due time as foretold by the prophet of God, this great trouble began upon the nations and kingdoms of Christendom. The Lord God there furnished, particularly to the governing powers of the earth, the clear evidence that the world had ended and that the time for the beginning of his kingdom of righteousness had arrived. The ecclesiastical element of the world powers were dutybound to take notice of this evidence and to call it to the attention of their allies, the commercial and political elements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">As a further proof that the time had arrived for God’s anointed King to take possession, the Lord foretold that the Jews would begin to return to and inhabit the land of Palestine. The British Empire recognized this, by its conduct at least, and was the first of all the nations of earth to make it possible for the Jews to return to their homeland ; and now all see the fulfilment of this prophecy.— Luke 21: 24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">As a further evidence of the time above mentioned, the Lord declared that the nations would then be in perplexity and distress, and that men’s hearts would be failing them for fear; and surely there is not one amongst all of the governing factors of earth today but that recognizes the fulfilment of this prophecy. (Luke 21:25) The British in the trades strike not yet settled, is having much distress and perplexity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The second coming of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the establishment of his kingdom under God’s anointed King, has been the hope of Christians for nineteen hundred years. This great truth has not been hid under a bushel. It has been proclaimed from the housetops throughout the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">For the purpose of establishing the fact that the clergy of the greatest world power, to wit: the British Empire, have recognized the divinely-provided evidence as proof of the Lord’s second coming and of the establishment of his kingdom, I now read into the record a statement published by the London press in the latter part of 1917, and which was republished by other papers throughout the empire and throughout the entire world:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The following manifesto was recently issued by a number of England’s most noted ministers :</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">“First. That the present crisis points toward the close of the times of the Gentses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">•‘Second. That the revelation of the Lord may be expected at any moment, when he will be manifested as evidently as to his disciples on the evening of his resurrection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">“Third. That the completed church will be translated, to be ‘for ever with the Lord’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">“Fourth. That Israel will be restored to its own land in unbelief, and be afterward converted by the appearance of Christ on its behalf.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">“Fifth. That all human schemes of reconstruction must be subsidiary to the second coming of our Lord, because all nations will be subject to his rule.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">“Sixth. That under the reign of Chiist there will be a further great effusion of the Holy Spirit on all flesh.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">“Seventh. That the truths embodied in this statement are of the utmost practical value in determining Christian character and action with reference to the pressing problems of the hour.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This remarkable statement was signed by A. C. Dixon and F. B. Meyer, Baptists ; George Campbell Morgan and Alfred Byrd, Congregationalists ; William Fuller Gouch, Presbyterians ; H. Webb Peploe, J. Stuart Holden, Episcopalians ; Dinsdale T. Young, Methodist.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">These are well-known names, and are among the world's greatest preachers. That these eminent men, of different denominations, should feel called upon to issue such a statement is of itself exceedingly significant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In this manifesto the divinely-provided proof was brought home to the greatest world power by her own ministers, that divine prophecy has been fulfilled as to the end of the world and the second presence of the Lord. But has due heed been given to this divine proof? It has not been heeded. On the contrary, these very distinguished men who signed this manifesto have since vehemently spoken against present truth and the Lord’s kingdom. Furthermore, the rulers of the world have ignored the divinely-provided testimony, as is shown by what has followed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">With propriety these questions may here- be asked: If these governments of earth are operated by divine right and authority, then why should God permit the devastating World War to come upon them? If the British world power together with other nations constitutes Christ’s kingdom, which claim is made by reason of their calling themselves “Christendom”, then why should the Lord permit the destruction of his own kingdom? It is obvious from the correct answer to these questions that the claim that these world powers rule by divine right and authority is false, fraudulent and blasphemous.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Satan, the god of this evil world, seeing that his governing factors on earth were weakening each other, sought means to cement the people and the rulers in a closer compact. During the World War he caused an appeal to be made to Hie patriotism of the common people, by having them adopt the slogan: “The war will make the world safe for Democracy.” The purpose was to gain for the military the support of the democratic element of the people. God, through his prophet, had foretold that this very thing would transpire.—Daniel </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">2</span><span class="font10">: 41.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">When the war ceased the grave and wise men of the world powers assembled at Paris for conference. There the rulers took counsel together, which counsel resulted in bringing forth a compact against Jehovah and against his anointed King. Necessarily Satan, the g’od of this world, would know the purpose of Jehovah In establishing his kingdom; and therefore Satan set about to produce something to offset that kingdom, whereby to turn the minds of the rulers away from it and away from God. To do this he must again resort to fraud and deceit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The commercial and political elements, constituting the military of the world powers, in substance said: “To stabilize the world we must have ? compact of nations, In which all nations shall agree that our council shall govern and control them.” The result was the formation of the League of Nations. Notwithstanding the claim that these world powers rule by divine right and authority, neither the name of Jehovah God nor his anointed Son were even mentioned in the League of Nations compact. But in order to lend a sacred tinge thereto, and that the people might be further deceived, Satan, through the clergy element of the world powers, in sanctimonious phrase declared the League of Nations to be “the political expression of God’s kingdom on earth”. Notwithstanding that the clear proof had been given to them by the Lord that the world had ended and that the second presence of Christ had begun, and that special attention had been directed thereto by leading clergymen of the world, the Federal Council of Churches of the world endorsed the League of Nations as a substitute for the kingdom of God. This august body of ecclesiastics in January 1919 issued the following blasphemous proclamation :</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The time has come to organize the world for truth, right, justice and humanity. To this end as Christians we urge the establishment of a League of Free Nations at the coming Peace Conference. Such a league is not merely a peace expedient; it is rather the </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">political</span><span class="font7"> expression of the kingdom of God on earth. The League of Nations is rooted in the gospel. Like the gospel, its objective is “Peace on earth, good will toward men”. Like the gospel, its appeal is universal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The heroic dead will have died in vain unless out of victory shall come a new heaven and a new earth, wherein dwelieth righteousness.—2 Peter 3:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The church [nominal] can give a spirit of good will, without which no League of Nations can endure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">These distinguished ecclesiastics, contrary to the teachings of the Prince of Peace whom they claim to represent, and in direct violation of his law, preached men into the trendies and hailed the World War as a means of making the world safe for democracy. Thereby they deceived the young men and sent them to untimely graves. (Jeremiah 2: 34) And then after the war they completely repudiated the Lord God by openly allying themselves with and endorsing the Devil’s substitute for God’s kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The League of Nations is against God and his anointed. In it is nothing but darkness. Its approval by the clergymen, as a substitute for Messiah’s kingdom, has caused gross darkness to settle down upon the peoples of the world. (Isaiah 60: 2) No longer can the people look to the clergymen as safe leaders. Their leadership is done.—Psa. 82:1-5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">LEAGUE FORETOLD</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">God foretold the seven world powers, to wit, Egypt, Assyria, Babylon, Medo-Persia, Greece, Rome and the British Empire, and also foretold that out of the seven would grow the eighth. The latter is also symbolized as a “beast”, because its purpose is to rule and control the peoples of the earth. The Lord foretold its birth, its short existence, and its everlasting end.—Revelation 17:10,11; Isaiah 8: 9, 10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The governing factors of the world powers, particularly the ecclesiastical element, by reason of claiming that these world powers rule by divine right and authority, thereby admit that the Word of God is true. Therefore they must be judged by the Word and are estopped from denying the Scriptural proofs which disclose their wrongful acts. No one will attempt to deny that the British world power is the earthly agency that was responsible for the formation of the League of Nations compact. The British Empire is the very bulwark thereof. Let Britain withdraw and there will be no League of Nations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">But who is primarily responsible for the League of Nations compact? Is it formed and does it exist by divine right and authority? I answer, No. The Devil is its father, the British Empire is its mother, and the other nations which support it are its wet nurses. At this time the advocates of the League of Nations are desperately striving to unite its belligerent members. With fear and trembling they see that unholy 'offspring of Satan headed for perdition, even as the Lord foretold.—Revelation 17: 8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The Devil caused the governing factors of so-called Christendom to enter into this compact against Jehovah and his anointed King and therby, in fulfilment of prophecy, to say in effect: “Let us refuse to give our allegiance and support to Jehovah and his King, but rather let us cast them away from us and hold to our present evil organization.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Hear now, if you please, the inspired words of God's holy prophet, which were written three thousand years ago, written to apply at this very time, and which do apply at this hour:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“Wherefore have nations consented together? or should peoples keep muttering an empty thing? The kings of earth take their stand, and grave men have sat in conclave together, against Jehovah and against his Anointed One, saying, ‘Let us tear apart their bands, and cast away from us their cords!’ One enthroned in the h&lt; avens will laugh, my Sovereign Lord will mock at them; then will he speak to them in his anger, and in his wrath will dismay them :-‘Yet I have installed my king on Zion my holy mountain, let him tell my decree!’ Jehovah said to me:- ‘My Son art thou, I today have begotten thee: Ask of me, and let me give nations for thine inheritance, and as thy possession the ends of the earth: Thou .shall shepherd them with a sceptre of iron, as a poller’s vessel shaft thou dash them in pieces.”—Psalm 2:1-9, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Rotherham.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">But in order that those who have been inveigled into the Devil’s trap might see their mistake and repent and escape, God further says to them through his prophet: “Now therefore ye kings, show your prudence, be admonished, ye judges of earth: Serve ye Jehovah witli reverence, and exult with trembling: Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and ye perish on the way; for soon might be kindled his anger. How happy are all who take refuge in Him!”—Psalm 2:10-12, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Rotherham.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The clergy are the most reprehensible of all the elements that go to make up the governing powers of the world. Claiming to be teachers of the Word of God, their duty was to ascertain the truth and explain it to the others. But instead, they have caused the rulers of earth to commit fornication with an apostate church system, and have made the people drunk with their false doctrines. (Revelation 18:3) The commercial and political rulers admit the ecclesiastics to their councils, with the evident thought that their piety and sanctimoniousness will remove the curse from their own skirts; but now they see that these ecclesiastics have practised a fraud upon them, because they are not in truth and in fact the representatives of God as they have claimed. Even now the ecclesiastics are hated by the other rulers, and soon this hatred will be manifested in a more tangible manner.—Revelator 17: 16,17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">THE CAUSE</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The real reason for earth’s trouble is, because the rulers have rejected God’s duly anointed King and refused his kingdom. And since they persist in this course of defiance against God, he has declared that he will dash them to pieces as a potter’s vessel. (Psalm 2:9) In corroboration of this, God’s prophet further says: “Thus saith the Lord of hosts, Behold, evil shall go forth from nation to nation, and a great whirlwind shall be raised up from the coasts of the earth. And the slain of the Lord shall be at that day from one end of the eartli even unto the other end of the earth: they shall not be lamented, neither gathered, nor buried: they shall be dung upon the ground. Howl, ye Shepherds, and cry; and wallow yourselves in the ashes, ye principal of the flock: for the days of your slaughter and of your dispersions are accomplished: and ye shall fall like a pleasant vessel. And the shepherds shall have no way to flee, nor the principal of the flock to escape. A voice of the cry of the shepherds, and an howling of the principal of the flock shall be heard: for the Lord hath spoiled their pasture. And the peaceable habitations are cut down because of the fierce anger of the Lord.”—Jeremiah 25: 32-37.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">No ruler can give a satisfactory answer as to why the World War suddenly stopped in 1938. But God’s Word explains that the reason it ceased at that time was that an opportunity might be given to the rulers, as well as to the people, to hear the testimony concerning the Lord and his kingdom. Bailing to take heed to this, the Lord Jesus declares there shall follow a time of trouble such as the world has never known, and that this shall be the last trouble of earth.—Matthew 24:21,22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">All the natio&quot;s and kingdoms of earth are rapidly marching to th? great battle of God Almighty. This will convince the peoples, as well as the rulers, that Jehovah is God and that Jesus Christ is the King of kings and Lord of lords.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">THE REMEDY</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">What men desire is a righteous government, one that will guarantee to them peace, prosperity, health, life, liberty and happiness. From the beginning it was God’s purpose that man should enjoy these blessings everlastingly. Because of sin man lost the right to all of them. God then began to work out his plan of redemption and deliverance for man. He promised to redeem man from death and from the power of the grave. (Hosea 43:14) In due time he sent his beloved Son Jesus into the world, to redeem the world. (John 2 : 16 ; 10: 10 ; Matthew 20 : 28) The death and resurrection of Jesus provided redemption for all, and in God’s due time ail mankind shall have the benefit thereof. ■—Hebrews 2:9; 1 Timothy 2:3-6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">God promised that Jesus Christ, his beloved Son, should come again and restore to men all things that had been lost. (Acts 3:19,20) Now the time has arrived. Christ has come as God’s anointed King, Jehovah has set him upon his holy throne to rule, and now he commands all to give allegiance to his King and kingdom. (Psalm 2:1-11) Let the rulers of the earth now take heed to Jehovah’s Word, accept his anointed King, and lend their power and influence to turning the minds of the people away from the Devil and to Jehovah God and to earth’s rightful King. Thus doing, they will employ their powers and faculties in the interest of peace and righteousness. Messiah’s kingdom now at hand will bring the desire of every honest heart.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">PEACE</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">There can be no lasting peace without a righteous government. God promised that his King shall reign in righteousness and his representatives with justice. (Isaiah 32:1) Upon the righteous shoulder of the Prince of Peace shall that government rest, and the peace thereof shall never end. (Isaiah 9:6,7) No more shall the people be afflicted with war, nor be burdened with taxation for the preparation for war; nor shall they even have fear of such.—Isaiah 2:2-4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">PROSPERITY</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Under the present world powers a few people have an abundance, many must skimp In order to eat and be clothed, while many others are objects of charity. Such will not be the conditions under God’s anointed King, whom he has now placed upon his throne. In this kingdom “shall the Lord of hosts make unto all people a feast of fat things”. (Isaiah 25:0) Every man then will enjoy the fruits of his labor and dwell in happiness with those whom he loves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">HEALTH</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">All the efforts put forth by the world powers cannot bring health to the people. No one now has perfect health. But be of good courage! Under the righteous reign of Jehovah’s anointed King all who are obedient to his reign will be made well. God has promised to cure them and bring them health, to the end that no more shall the inhabitant say: “I am sick.”—Jeremiah 33:6; Isaiah 33:24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">LIFE</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The first lie told by Satan was: ‘There is no death.’ Long experience has proven to man how great was that falsehood. God gave man life. God took away the right to life, because of 'man’s disobedience. Jehovah God alone can provide life for the human race. He has made provision for the obedient ones to have life through Christ Jesus, and therefore it is written : “This is life eternal, that they might know thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent.”—John 17:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">All the world powers are the offspring of Satan. These can never bring life to man. God's kingdom through Christ Jesus is now at hand, and those who render themselves in obedience to this kingdom shall live and shall not die. God’s Word declares that Christ Jesus comes to judge the living and the dead. (2 Timothy 4:1) The living shall first be given an opportunity, then all who are in their graves shall come forth; and those who keep the law of God shall never see death. (John 5:29; 8:51; 11:26) God’s kingdom is here; therefore with confidence it can be announced that MILLIONS NOW LIVING WILL NEVER DIE! The presumption is that when restoration blessings begin, millions will gladly avail themselves of the opportunity for life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">God made the earth for man’s habitation. (Isaiah 45:12, 18) The earth shall be the eternal home of restored man. The reign of Christ will destroy all of man’s enemies, the chiefest amongst which is death. (1 Corinthians 15:25,26) Satan himself shall eventually be destroyed, and there shall be no more death.—Hebrews 2 : 14; Revelation 21:1-6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">HAPPINESS</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">With a righteous government functioning for man’s good; with lasting peace on earth and good will toward men; with all the people enjoying health, and with no fear of sickness and death; with all families being united together and dwelling in peace, the human race will enjoy eternal happiness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Let the kings and rulers of the earth now give their allegiance and devotion to the Lord. Let them acknowledge Jehovah as God, and Christ Jesus as his anointed King; and thus doing they will render a real service to the peo-pie and put themselves in line for the eternal blessings of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">MEETING FOR THE JEWS</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Monday evening, at the same hall, Brother Rutherford addressed a meeting for the Jews. The great hall was well filled, and the attention was rapt. Like the meeting on the previous evening, it was a great success. It was interesting to watch the many Jews drinking in the proof that the time has come for them to return to the land of their fathers. The message was really </span><span class="font9">a </span><span class="font10">comfort to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">SERVICE DAY</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Our brethren at Brooklyn headquarters, hearing of the labor disturbance in England, concluded that it might be necessary to get an extra supply of booklets over for the convention. Accordingly they gladly worked day and night until an extra number of The Standard for the People booklets was completed; and when the “Tuscania” sailed bearing the American brethren for the London convention it also carried 117,000 extra copies of this booklet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The President of the Society told the convention why the American brethren had made this extra effort. The brethren at the convention arose to the occasion. They quickly bought for sale on Service Day 111,000 of these booklets, besides the many other Harps and combinations regularly provided for Service Day. On Saturday morning; as a well organized division of the Lord’s army, directed by Brothers Johnson of America and Swain of London, these enthusiastic workers moved into the field for action. Never was a Service Day attended with such enthusiasm. Nearly every one attending the convention participated. As they sold the books on the streets they invited the people to attend the public lecture. The sale of books at the two public meetings and on service day totalled one hundred and twenty thousand nine hundred (120,900).</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Nothing like this has ever been known on Service Day at a convention. The friends were bubbling over with enthusiasm. They felt that they had done their best to obey the command of Jehovah: “Ye are my witnesses that I am God.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">OUR KING IS</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Mine eyes can see the glory of the presence of the Lord;</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">He is trampling out the winepress where his grapes of wrath are stored;</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">I see the flaming tempest of his swift descending sword; Our King is marching on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">I can see his coming judgments as they circle all the earth ; The signs and groanings promised to precede a second birth;</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">I read his righteous sentence in the crumbling thrones of earth:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Our King is marching on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">MARCHING ON</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The Gentile Times have ended; for their kings have had their day;</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">And with them sin and sorrow shall forever pass away;</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">For the tribe of Judah’s Lion now conies to hold the sway: Our King is marching on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The seventh trump is sounding, and our King knows no defeat;</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">He is sifting out the hearts of men before his judgment seat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Oh, be swift, my soul, to welcome him ; be jubilant, my feet! Our King is marching ou.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font13"><a name="bookmark7"></a>1926 MEMORIAL REPORTS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font17">T</span><span class="font10">HE participants at the 192G Memorial services of the Lord’s people throughout the world, which have thus far reported to this office, make a grand total of 84,777. No reports have as yet been, received from Switzerland, nor have all the classes in America and other countries been heard from; although the majority of class secretaries were more prompt this year than usual in making their report to the home office. If all would send in these reports early, they could be published in The Watch Tower much sooner.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark600"></a><span class="font13"><a name="bookmark601"></a>THE TENT OF MEETING</span></h2>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-variant:small-caps;">---September 5—Exodus 33---</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">“Jehovah spaice unto Moses face to face, as a man speaketh unto his friend.&quot;—Exodus 33:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">T</span><span class="font10">HE incident which is the center of our study occurred some weeks after the law had been spoken from Sinai. When Jehovah finished speaking the words of the law in the hearing of all the people, in fear they asked Moses that God should not speak to them any more, but that he should speak to God for them. God told Moses that the arrangement pleased him well. (Deuteronomy 5:28) Accordingly henceforth Moses was the channel of all communications between God and the people.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> God then called Moses up Sinai to receive instructions for the people, based upon the ten commandments which are recorded in Exodus 21: 24 to 24: 2. Moses returned to the people, told them all that God had said, and the people with one voice agreed and said, “All the words which the Lord hath said will we do.”—Ex. 24: 3.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> Moses then wrote all the words of the Lord (the first note of writing in the Bible) ; and to ratify the covenant between God and them he built an altar and offered sacrifices. Half the blood was sprinkled on the altar; Moses read the book of the covenant in the audience of the people and they formally agreed; with the remainder of the blood he sprinkled the people, and the covenant was sealed. Then in accordance with the instruction already given him (Exodus 24:1,2) he took Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, and seventy elders of Israel and, accompanied by Joshua his minister, he went up the mountain. These men of Israel saw the glory of God manifested; but Moses was called higher. Taking Joshua with him he bade the others wait for him.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> Moses was up the mountain forty days and forty nights, while the Lord gave him all the details of the tabernacle which he wushed to have built, and whose pattern he showed to Moses. (See Ex. 25 : 9, 40.) God also instructed him respecting the ministry of the priesthood, which was to fall on Aaron and his sons, all of which is recorded in Exodus 25: 1 to 31: 17. At the end of forty days he gave Moses two tables of stone, tables of testimony, written with the finger of God, even as he had promised.—Exodus 24: 12.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> The people began to wonder what had happened to Moses. Apparently giving up hope of his return, they went to Aaron and said, “Up, make us gods, which shall go before us; for as for this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we wot not what is become of him.” (Exodus 32:1) They were impatient of restraint and unmindful of the fact that they were in the hands of God, and that whether they stayed at Sinai a long or short time was not their business. No doubt some of them suggested that Moses had forsaken his charge. No doubt they all claimed that they wanted to make progress and get on toward Canaan. They could not command the cloud to move and guide them, but they could make a god of their own and thus set their own pace. It is ever thus; those who are not obedient in heart are always either wanting to go too fast or are found lagging behind.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>6</sup> Aaron fell before the temptation; perhaps because even then, as was revealed by a later incident, he had a weakness in respect to his younger brother’s leadership. Aaron had not altogether agreed with Moses, being spokesman for the people, nor with God’s action in calling Moses alone up the mountain; and because he lacked the qualities of leadership, Aaron fell before the temptation. So Aaron bade the people bring their golden ornaments. The metal was melted and moulded into the image of a calf; and the people set it up, and began some of the degrading orgies of worship in which they had indulged in Egypt.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>7</sup> This coincided with the time when God had finished his instructions respecting the construction and appointments of his tabernacle. Suddenly he ordered Moses down from the mount, saying, “Go, get thee down; for </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">thy</span><span class="font10"> people which </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">thou</span><span class="font10"> broughtest out of the land of Egypt, have corrupted themselves.” (Exodus 32: 7, 8) He told Moses what they had done. Moses apparently made an appeal, but God prevented any petition, and offered Moses that he would make a great nation of him in their stead. But Moses appealed to God for the sake of God’s honor, and for the people, because God had counted Israel his people. God heard his request, and said he would not cut oft the people as he had thought to do.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>8</sup> Moses turned and came down to the people. Joshua, hearing the noise of the people, thought it was the noise of war. But Moses knew the shouts were neither those who cry because of mastery, nor from fear, but were of revelry. His anger rose as he saw the calf worship, and he cast the two tables of stone out of his hands, as if saying that the law of God could be of no use to a people who would do such things. Up the mountain he had pleaded for the people, but now he saw that nothing but the severest measures would prevent a wreck of all the hopes of Israel. Aaron offered the poorest excuse; he pleaded his helplessness and blamed the people. A time of crisis had come. Moses stood on the edge of the camp and cried, “Who is on the Lord’s side, let him come to me.” (Exodus 32:26) Only a few responded. The tribe of Levi nobly associated themselves with their head, and soon they were called to seal their decision for the Lord in the blood of their fellows; for rebellion broke out.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>9</sup> Next morning Moses spoke to the people. Telling them of their great sin, he said that he would go back up the mountain in the hope that he might make an atonement for them. Hitherto he had gone up the mount</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">only on God’s invitation; now he would venture into the presence of God uncalled. God graciously received him, and listened to him when he began to plead for Israel. He had but little to say; but taking God’s own word that God would make of him a nation in place of the rejected people, he pleaded that if God could not forgive Israel he would accept of him as their equivalent. He was willing to be blotted out instead of them.—• Exodus 32: 31, 32.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>10</sup> This is perhaps the greatest single incident in all the Old Testament pictures. It is the nearest type which history can give of the corresponding price which Jesus gave for human redemption. (1 Timothy 2: 5, 6) Jehovah could not accept Moses’ sacrifice to make such atonement. But he partly agreed to Moses’ request, and told him to prepare for going forward toward the land promised to the fathers, and that he would give it to Israel, but that God himself would not go with them ‘‘lest”, he said, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">“1</span><span class="font10"> consume thee in the way.”—Ex. 33 : 3.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>11</sup> When the people heard that God would not go with them, they mourned and stripped themselves of their ornaments. Moses now took the tabernacle, called the tent of meeting, where his rod and pot of manna would be kept, and pitched it outside the camp. Everyone who sought the Lord followed him there, and they saw when Moses went into it that the cloudy pillar which was always over them descended and stood at its door. The people rose up to worship, every man standing at his tent door. The Lord thus honored Moses, and accepted what he did.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>12</sup> Up in the mountain God had spoken to Moses by his angel, giving instruction as to a servant; but now God, as it were, had come down to him, speaking face to face as a man speaketh to his friend. (Exodus 33 : 11) They spoke as in friendly conversation, and we are told what was said. Moses asked for assurance that God would be with his people, and God assured him, saying, “My presence shall go with thee, and I will give thee rest.” (Exodus 33:14) And Moses, now associating himself with the covenant and the people, told of his desire that it might be known abroad in the earth that God’s people had found grace in his sight, and that thus “I and thy people” might be separated from all the people that are upon the face of the earth.—Exodus 33:16.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>13</sup> As if God would renew his covenant, Moses was now instructed to prepare two tables of stone to replace those he had broken and to go again up Sinai. There, according to Moses’ request in the tent, God gave him a manifestation of himself and declared his glory. Moses as an advocate for his people used the occasion to ask God for grace for them, saying, “If now I have found grace in thy sight, 0 Lord, let my Lord, I pray thee, go among us; for it is a stiffnecked people; and pardon </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">our</span><span class="font10"> iniquity and sin and take </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">us</span><span class="font10"> for thine inheritance.”—■ Exodus 34:9.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>14</sup> God kept Moses in the mount a second time for forty days (Deuteronomy 9:18), and then sent him down. Now his face shone, for the glory of God was impinged on it. In all he had made seven journeys up and down the mountain; the last down with the glory on his face, representing the Lord Jesus who, after his sacrifice for men and going to God, comes again in ths glory of his Father.—Matthew 16:’27.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>15</sup> These experiences were hard, but they were exactly what was necessary to prepare Moses for his office of Mediator of the law covenant. His offer to make atonement apparently sealed him in that office. God prepares his servants in his own way; natural qualities of mind and heart are given chances of use, and when faithfully used for God he adds to them by the operation of his spirit. The grandeur of Moses’ self-sacrificing spirit, and his fitness for the great and very onerous place he had, is repeatedly shown. He Tose to the height of his privileges and obligations. Without presumption, and keeping a true meekness of spirit, he used every occasion for getting some blessing for his people. He was a grand type of his still greater and grander antitype, the Son of God.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>16</sup> In the matter of communion with God no other man of the days of the law and the prophets had such a favor as Moses. To others of his servants God spoke by visions or by dreams, or by impressions on the mind, as when holy men spoke by the spirit of God upon them; but to Moses he spake direct. Yet Moses, with all his glory, did not have so great a privilege of communion with God as is the possession and privilege of the least of the saints of God at this time.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>17</sup> It was with the coming of the holy spirit at Pentecost that there came the privilege of communion with God as children to a father, as sons needing parental advice. Moses could get this great favor only as God chose to give it to him; and the tabernacle and the temple were set as the place for prayer. But Jesus had the privilege of going to his Father at all times, and finding his place of prayer wherever he chose. This privilege, through him, to those who have come to God by him and who have been begotten of God’s holy spirit, belongs to every child of God. Wherever he may choose to bow his knee or his heart, in fellowship with the saints or alone, there he may commune with God. He may pour out his heart, express his soul’s sincere desire, and find that he has a welcome at the throne of grace set in the heavens.—Hebrews 4:16.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>18</sup> The Lord does not now speak to his people by audible voice. He guides them by his Word. There is so much written that he who wants to know how to cleanse himself from self-defilement, to resist temptation and to grow in grace, may readily find all he needs. The Lord guides his </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">church</span><span class="font10"> by his Word, and also by the circumstances of his providences; and it constantly realizes his care. The church in its work realizes the direction of the greater than Moses, as clearly as the faithful in Israel realized God’s direction by the hand of Moses.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">CONVENTION AND TOWERS A BLESSING</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Greetings and love in Jesus’ precious name I It is with very great joy that I have read today in the London </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Daily News,</span><span class="font10"> the resolution put forward at the London convention, and I rejoice with my whole heart that such an effectual witness has been given throughout this country to the fact that the kingdom of God is now at hand, even at the door.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">I take this opportunity, too, to place on record my unqualified allegiance and devotion to the Almighty God, and to Jesus our great High Priest. I believe it to be my bounden duty and privilege to obey their commands, desiring to serve loyally in their cause and to be a witness for God in the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It is my earnest prayer that this convention may be the means of stimulating the brethren in this country and elsewhere to see the wonderful privileges accorded to us at this time, and that we may day by day endeavor to spend and be spent wholly and fully in the service of the King of kings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">May the Lord continue to strengthen and uphold you as you endeavor </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">to</span><span class="font10"> fulfil loyally your part of the covenant, and may your heart be comforted in the knowledge that you are a source of strength and encouragement to the Lord’s people generally. Our privilege it is to bear you up daily at the throne of grace, praying that an abundant measure of the holy spirit may be given to you to enable you to bring forth from the Storehouse further meat in due season for the Lord’s little ones, and that you may be enabled to overcome all your adversaries and difficulties in the strength of the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The articles in The Watch Tower at present are simply sublime, giving evidence that the church is walking in the light, and that the writers are growing in grace and in the knowledge of the truth. The recent articles, “Character or Covenant—Which?” and “Sacrifice and Service”, are a great stimulus and comfort. We cannot merely </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">read,</span><span class="font10"> our Towers now, we must STUDY them, if we desire to walk in the light and remain faithful and true.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Our class at Wallsend has recently adopted the idea of studying the Towers as published, i. e., we cover the current loading article in two studies, also the S. S. lesson on the day appointed, and the Weekly Prayer Meeting Comment at the Testimony meeting. Thus our Towers are </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">used,</span><span class="font10"> and already there seems to be a greater desire on the part of all to express their thoughts more freely at the studies, and it is otherwise having a very beneficial effect upon our ecclesia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Yours in his grace and service, Jas. M. Stephenson,—</span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Eng.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">LORD’S PEOPLE TESTED BY DELAY</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brethren :</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">A great work has been and is now being done by the I. B. S. A. under the direction of the Lord; and the Lord has been pleased to bless the efforts of his faithful ones. The Towers are full of instruction, encouragement, and comfort to me. And I thank the Lord for them and for the God-fearing men who have the preparing of them for the household of faith.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">I am able to see the awful conditions all over the earth, and why, and the end of all evil through Christ Jesus and the church in due time; and I long for the time when Christ shall rule in righteousness as promised. We can see that the time of trouble has come more gradually than Pastor Russell was able to see. And because of it, some have become discouraged. Surely a great testing of the saints is taking place, and Satan is doing his utmost to stumble us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Surely a great battle is going on between the Lord and his army, and Satan and his army; and some are falling. This is a grief to see. But the Lord knoweth all things; for he is all-seeing, all-knowing, and nothing can come to us except he permits it, for our good if we can only accept it in this way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The people in Milford seem pleasure mad, eating, drinking, dancing; wholly given over to the desires of the flesh. I think there is a very noticeable effort among both Catholics and Protestants to increase their numbers and strength. It seems as though this must be the rise before the final fall of which we are told in Revelation 18: 21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">I know that our Lord loves all mankind and gave himself a willing sacrifice while we were yet sinners. The Lord loves his church, and nothing can pluck us out of his hand. I read Romans, chapter 8, this morning; and every time I read it I find something new. What a wonderful book the Bible is! What a wonderful God of love to give us the Book!</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Spring has come again with all its wonderful beauty and the manifestation of the creative power of our Lord. The sure resurrection of the human family is always fresh in my mind in the spring time. May the Lord continue his blessing upon your efforts to serve him and the dear people, is my prayer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Yours in the one hope.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Mrs. Ida S. Harvell.—</span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">N. II.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">TOWER ARTICLE GIVES ENCOURAGEMENT</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Our Dear Brother Rutherford :</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Greetings of love in the name of our King. The joy of the Lord is our strength. Since reading the article in May 1st Watch Tower on Character or Covenant, I felt that I must write and tell you how very much I have appreciated it. I thank the Lord for making clear to me what has been so difficult to understand; for I had found it impossible to develop a character different from what I was, and, as the article states, I would often have been discouraged, only that I would come’ to the conclusion that the Lord knows my heart and the covenant that I have made with him. He knows that I want to walk in obedience to his will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">I just love the great privilege of sharing in his service, passing on the blessing that has so richly blessed me. This article has given me great comfort and assurance. This precious truth came to me in 1902, and is still more precious today because of the increasing light now shining on God's Word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Praying the Lord’s richest blessing and guidance on you, dear Brother Rutherford and all our dear brethren, especially those at the front of this great army, with continued love in the Lord, I am your sister and fellow servant.</span></p>

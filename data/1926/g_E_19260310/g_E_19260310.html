<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">Making the Desert Rejoice</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">W</span><span class="font6">HEN Congress passed its first Irrigation Bill in 1894 there were many wise men in both houses who doubted whether the act would ever accomplish anything. In substance the act merely offered one million acres of semi-arid land to any state that would undertake to irrigate the same and sell it to actual homesteaders.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is related of Senator Hoar of Massachusetts that when the bill came up in the Senate he jingled his keys and gravely said, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“I</span><span class="font6"> don’t believe it can be done, but I will vote for this measure. It promises to make the desert blossom as the rose. It sounds very nice, but I don’t believe it can be done.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The work of Senator Hoar and others has borne such results that four hundred thousand people are now employed and housed on irrigated or reclaimed land in the United States, and there are areas where the farmers and fruit growers think nothing of raising crops which bring them $1,000 an acre from such land. Five states, Colorado, Wyoming, Idaho, Oregon and Washington took advantage of the original offer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The original act, passed in 1894, provided that when ninety percent of the land had passed into the hands of private owners, the project would be turned over to the settlers themselves. As a whole the act worked well. Some of the land got into the hands of speculators, who made great fortunes at the expense of their fellows; but every good thing has its drawbacks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In 1902 Congress passed the Reclamation Act, which provided that all funds in excess of five percent received from the sale of public lands in the Rocky Mountain and Pacific Coast states, should be set apart for works of irrigation in those states. The cost of the irrigation works is charged against the acreage, and paid back by the settlers in ten annual installments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Today there are permanently installed in the cloak-room of the House of Representatives at</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Washington two beautiful paintings of twenty-four Irrigation Areas in the Far West, representing the world’s master effort in reclaiming arid areas for productive agricultural purposes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Choice of Lands &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">T</span><span class="font6">HE most important part of any irrigation system is the choice of lands which are to be irrigated. In making such a choice it is necessary to examine the character and depth of the soil, its behawior when irrigated, the slope and evenness of the surface, the presence of injurious salts, and the facilities for drainage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The soil is best judged by what grows upon it. If sagebrush, buffalo grass or cactus are growing upon it the soil is usually fertile, easily tilled and well drained. But if the soil produces crops of greasewood, creosote bush, saltwort or salt weeds, it is less suitable. Before diverting water from a stream, advice must be sought from the proper state officials, to prevent lawsuits and wasted efforts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Irrigation is one of the oldest of practices and one of the newest of sciences, i. c., it is new. as a science because there is so little known about the scientifically correct use of a given quantity of water.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Of the many ways of obtaining water for irrigation purposes, the gravity system of drawing a supply in ditches from the headwaters and mountain lakes is the cheapest. Storage is expensive, pumping from lakes or rivers is expensive, pumping from underground is more so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A vast amount of water is lost by evaporation and absorption in any gravity system. Concrete lining is the most practicable and satisfactory method, because the results are certain, and permanent; but it is much more expensive than oiling, puddling, silting or lining with wood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The cooperative irrigator, is compelled to cooperate with his neighbors. The man who t</span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">hin</span><span class="font6">ks only of himself is about as popular in a community living on irrigated land as a jazz orchestra would be at a funeral. He is entirely out of place. Moreover, it is now known that the old type of irrigation hog who took all the water he could get, disregarding the interests of his neighbor, got smaller crops and did not have his land in as good condition at the end of the season as the man who took only the right quantity.</span></p>

<h5><a name="bookmark7"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark30"></a>Methods of Irrigation</span></h5>
<p><span class="font14">I</span><span class="font6">N THE border method of irrigation the field to be irrigated is divided into strips by low, flat levees extending usually in the direction of the steepest slope. Sufficient water is turned into each strip And allowed to move down the slope in a thin , sheet, moistening the soil to a given depth as it advances toward the lower end. The cost of preparing land for the border method is low as compared with that of most other methods. This method is fully described in Farmers Bulletin No. 1243, obtainable free from the Department of Agriculture at Washington.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the irrigation of potato crops the water is not allowed to come in contact with the tubers at any stage of their growth. Between each two rows there runs a little ditch, which is called an irrigation lateral. The water in this is carried at such a height that it wets the rootlets but cannot reach the potatoes. The consequence is that when the potatoes are dug they are perfectly sound and have exceptional shipping qualities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">To have overhead irrigation a pressure of twenty-live to forty pounds at the head of the sprinkling line is best. The irrigation lines are forty to sixty feet apart, depending on the water pressure, and up to 500 feet in length. At intervals of three or four feet along the pipes there are nozzles from which the water is distributed over the fields in a mistlike gentle shower. When one section has been watered the whole pipe line is rolled on its axis, by means of a lever, and a new space is watered. With any system of irrigation too much watering or too long watering is worse on the crops and on the soil than a prolonged drouth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Many plants can get along with such a little water that it has been proposed to shoot into the soil periodically, at a given distance from each plant, an icicle, made artificially from such limited supplies as might be available. It seems as though this might be practical in some light soils. The ice bullet system is designed to make one gallon of water do the irrigation work of a barrel.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark31"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark32"></a>Conservation of Resources</span></h5>
<div><img src="g_E_19260310_files/g_E_19260310-2.png" alt="" style="width:18pt;height:18pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6">MANKIND is about entering the golden age it seems appropriate that we find so many studying and discussing the conservation of earth’s resources.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Only a few years ago it would have been thought a singular thing to pay heed to the quantity of snow on the mountain tops; but now, in the Pacific Northwest, the snow is carefully measured by means of the snow gauge, and its water content determined, so that the farmers who will depend upon these snows for irrigation purposes can plan their crops accordingly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The farmers of the Northwest commonly refer to the snow caps as white gold. In the spring the local surveyor bores a two-inch hole into the packed drift or snow field to the earthen foundation. Into this is lowered the measuring stick which is also a snow meter, an aluminum spring balance making possible the immediate determination of the water content of any snow depth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">So advanced are the views of some of our conservationists that they even claim that every gallon of water that falls in rain should be stored away until needed. Not only do they wish to keep the waters which are so valuable for plant growth, but they wish to save the fertile soils that are now washed out to sea, and on the other hand they wish to save, as far as possible, the marshes and inland lakes which constitute the natural homes of waterfowl, fishes, fur-bearing animals and other forms of wild life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As a sample of what is taking place, note the changed attitude toward marsh lands. A few years ago the general course was to drain these as quickly as possible, but now it often happens that marsh land is more valuable for muskrat farms, cranberry culture, or something of that sort, than are the more fertile lands that surround it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In actual practice it is found that fifty-six percent of irrigated areas are devoted to the raising of alfalfa, and that such special crops as fruit, cotton, and sugar beets constitute relatively small percentages of these areas, so that alfalfa may he said to be the backbone of irrigation culture. Up to date not four percent of the arid lands of the United States are irrigated. In the year 1909 the total area of irrigated lands in the United States was 10,000,000 acres.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark33"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark34"></a>National Reclamation Program</span></h5>
<p><span class="font14">T</span><span class="font6">HE last government report on irrigation shows that there are now 32,835 irrigated farms, with a population of 125,214, and a town population within the same areas of 324,289. Lands in these areas once held at $10 an acre or less have sold at $300 to $400 an acre, and some as high as $1,500.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In 1902, in the state of Washington, only two carloads of apples left Wenatchee during the whole year. Nineteen years later there were 16,000 carloads shipped from that station in a single season, which was a greater quantity than was produced by any other whole state. This was the result of irrigation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There have been complaints that irrigation has been overdone. The government has been accused of squandering money in the irrigation of worthless or unfit lands from which the farmers could not make enough to repay into the treasury what is really a revolving fund. In other instances the farmers have withheld payment, in the hope that they could contrive to escape it altogether. The government adjusts charges to suit the production.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The government owes it to the Indians to complete the reclamation projects upon Indian reservations. This will involve an expense of something like $32,000,000, and will irrigate an area equal to 1,392,397 acres. It will help the Indians to exist independent of government aid.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the present Congress efforts will be made to adopt a general reclamation program which will include the subjects of drainage of swamp lands in the South, removal of stumps from cut-over lands in the Great Lakes region, restoration of soil in New England states, flood control on the Colorado and other rivers, construction of dams for hydro-electric power, and irrigation projects generally. This ambitious program has the appearance of being designed to gain support from all sections for a drive for irrigation funds for projects &quot;where the government will be the greatest investor and the surest loser.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The principal government irrigation projects to date are at Belle Fourche, (S. D.), North.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Platte (Neb.), Grand Valley and Uncompahgre (Colo.), Rio Grande and Carlsbad (N. M.), Salt River (Ariz.), Strawberry Valley (Utah), Riverton and Shoshone (Wyo.), Huntley, Little Yellowstone, Fort Peck, Milk River, Blackfeet, Sun River and Flathead (Mont.), Minidoka, King Hill and Boise (Ida.), Okanagan and Yakima (Wash.), Umatilla and Klamath (Ore.), Newlands (Nev.), Orland and Imperial Valley (Calif.).</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark35"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark36"></a>Colorado River and imperial Valley</span></h5>
<p><span class="font14">W</span><span class="font6">HAT is now the Imperial Valley was once the Gulf of California. As the gulf became filled with silt from the Colorado river, and the river at length made a new channel for itself farther east and south, the valley came into being which is now the site of one of the richest agricultural developments on the American continent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the year 1924 there were 352,225 acres under cultivation in Imperial county. The 50,000 population had an assessed property valuation of a little less than a thousand dollars a head, and shipped a carload of crops for each inhabitant of the district. This district depends for its existence upon the Colorado river.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Colorado river is like no other on earth. Once a year, in the spring, for about thirty days, while the winter snows are melting, it is a raging, roaring flood-mad stream, tearing at its banks, and carrying such a quantity of silt that every year it builds itself a new bed one foot higher than the old one of the last year. Once, after having created the Imperial Valley, it threatened to destroy it all; and the valley was saved only by shoving into the break in the levee a whole train of cars loaded with stone. No attempt was made to save the cars.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Now the seven states through which the Colorado runs are a unit in asking Congress to tame the Colorado, to protect Imperial Valley, and to make possible the irrigation of an area of desert lands which would support as many people as are now living in the entire United States. This could be done by building at Boulder Canyon a dam some six hundred or seven hundred feet in height. The electric power thereby developed would be half that developed at present in the entire country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Not only would this dam create an inland lake eighty-five miles long, six miles wide and upwards of 500 feet deep, but it would be so much greater than the world’s greatest dam at Assouan, Egypt, that whereas the Assouan dam holds back a sufficient quantity of water to cover 3,500,000 acres with water a foot deep, the Boulder Canyon dam, if constructed, would hold something over nine times as much.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Not 'waiting for the construction of the Boulder Canyon dam, the city of Los Angeles, on its own account, is constructing in the Pacoima Canyon a dam 375 feet high, and which will cost $1,500,000, intended to serve the joint purpose of flood control and for irrigation purposes. The Pacoima creek drains an area of about thirty square miles. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Forty-six percent of the present enormous fruit crop of California is produced on irrigated lands. . &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark37"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark38"></a>Washington and Idaho Projects</span></h5>
<p><span class="font14">W</span><span class="font6">E HAVE already referred to the marvelous results obtained by irrigation in the Wenatchee district of Washington. There have been years in which the average acre yield of irrigated lands in the .Wenatchee valley was over $480 an acre.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the Big&quot; Bend country of Washington there is enough water available in the Columbia river to redeem something more than a million acres, and in due time this will no doubt be done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The diversion of waters from the Snake river has returned untold wealth to the state of Idaho. The American Falls project, centered on that stream, will be completed in about two years and will irrigate a quarter of a million acres of land, as well as create an artificial lake some thirty miles long.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Arrowrock Dam on the Boise river, Idaho, 349 feet high, is said to be at present the highest dam in the world.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark39"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark40"></a>Utah and Arizona Projects</span></h5>
<p><span class="font14">T</span><span class="font6">HE first systematic attempts by Americans at irrigation on a large scale were made by the Mormons in Utah. They entered Salt Lake Valley in 1847 andhave transformed into a para-adise what then was a desert. The productivity is so great that 175,000 inhabitants are maintained on 350,000 acres, or a person for each two acres.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Only recently private capital has reclaimed 7,250 acres of land lying between Salt Lake City and the Great Salt Lake. Tests showed that an</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">apparently desolate and salt-encrusted, tract of land, is capable of great fertility. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In Arizona one man made a fortune and reclaimed an immense territory because he discovered that the water-bearing strata of the San Francisco mountains of northern Arizona could be tapped advantageously at an 8500 foot elevation. The underground rivers of Arizona are commonly called sun-dodgers; for they are so plentiful. They seem to seek to hide their waters from the evaporation which would follow their exposure to the rays of the hot sun. Often they are but a few<sup>T</sup> feet beneath the surface. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There is a subterranean river near Lockhart, Texas, which is said to furnish more water than an adjacent surface river of considerable size. This stream was found by accident, and was located at a point where it comes within only four feet of the parched surface.</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">T</span><span class="font6">HE East has all the water it wants; .sometimes it has too much, hence reclamation in the East takes the form of drainage. One of the most important of eastern drainage projects is that in the Piedmont section of North Carolina, where 30,000 acres which have lain under water for ages are now recognized as the richest lands in the state. Without any kind of fertilizer they will grow unparalleled crops of corn, cotton, grain, hay, potatoes and truck crops.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Mattamuskeet drainage district, still larger, covers 100,000 acres, including a lake bottom of 49,000 acres. In all there are some 150 drainage projects in North Carolina. The increased value of the reclaimed areas, from a health standpoint, is more than an offset to their cost.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Most important of all the drainage projects in the United States is the one which has undertaken the reclamation of Lake Okechobee and the Everglades, and which centers on Miami, Florida. The construction of the drainage canals from Lake Okechobee to the Atlantic Ocean near Miami forcibly brought to light the basis upon which the present boom in Florida real estate actually rests. It was found that the muck soil, three to five feet deep, overlays a stratum of limestone, which makes as nearly</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">ideal soil for a truck garden as could be devised. On this-soil, without fertilizers, three or more crops can be raised annually. The climate is fine, the nights agreeably cool, and malaria is practically unkno wn. Miami is certain to become the I.os Angeles of the East.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There is a great surplus of water in eastern Canada also. Near London, Ontario, are considerable areas of what are called “drowned lands”, which will be very valuable when the drainage of the area is accomplished.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark43"></a>South American and European Projects</span></h5>
<p><span class="font14">I</span><span class="font6">RRIGATION has been practised in the neighborhood of Mendoza, Argentine, for not less than eight hundred years. The works were laid out under the direction of the eighth Inca of Peru, and are still in use. These works reveal the high civilization attained by the Incas. They have now been extended and suffice for the intensive cultivation of 100,000 acres of land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Unique in conception and remarkable in their scale of operations are the reclamation works which have done so much to make Holland what it is. Holland alone of all countries has invaded the ocean, and from time to time erects more and greater dykes to rob the seas of lands which they have covered for ages. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Just at present the Dutch have under way a project that will cost them $185,000,000, which has as its objective the damming and drainage ■of the Zuyder Zee. This body of water, covering 1,350 square miles, is to be enclosed by dams and the lake within reduced to an area of 450 square miles. The balance, something over 900 square miles, will be reclaimed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Experience shows that these lands wrested from the ocean take seven years to reach complete fertility, and in the case of some of them </span><span class="font5">it </span><span class="font6">takes as much as thirty years. The dam will probably be completed by 1934. During the last three generations the Dutch have added to their territory by reclamation 2,000 square miles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Portions of Spain, southern France, and the great plains of northern Italy, particularly the valley of the Po, are indebted to systematic irrigation. Over $10,000,000 were expended in constructing the dikes along the Po river and the reservoirs in which the flood waters are preserved for irrigation purposes. Some of these works were begun in the days of the Roman Empire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Foundation Company of New York is engaging in a' reclamation work' for the Greek government, involving the control of the Vardar river and the drainage of lakes and swamps calculated to bring 260 square miles of land under cultivation.</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">M</span><span class="font6">OST of our readers are familiar with the works of reclamation now under way in Palestine, doubtless to be followed-by more important works soon. One of these plans is to use the Sea of Galilee as storage for a system of irrigation works that will line both banks of the Jordan. The plan is said to be some two thousand years old. A more ambitious plan contemplates the cutting of a canal through from the Mediterranean to the Dead Sea, and transforming the climate of the whole Jordan valley thereby.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">India has 22,500,000 acres of irrigated lands. The British government has completed a vast system of irrigation here in connection with the Ganges river. The canal is two hundred feet wide and ten feet deep, and is carried across four great streams. It almost pays for itself every year. A still more extensive undertaking, the Sutlej project, which will irrigate 3,500,000 acres of excellent farm lands, will be completed in about seven years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">China has maintained extensive irrigation works since the dawn of history. In the province of Szechuan (the Beautiful), a population of 60,000,000 people is supported on approximately 90,000 square miles. These great &quot;works, constructed by Li Ping, about 200 B. C\, were so well planned and superbly built that the original canals have been in constant use until this day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">One of the interesting irrigation developments of China is in the Mongolian desert, where a Belgian lias founded a thriving city of 2,500 families in a district previously uninhabitable,, There are now eighteen European families living in this area. The Chinese call the district “Desert Blossom’’,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In Africa, from time immemorial, the surplus, waters of the Nile have been caught in reservoirs and used for irrigation. One canal is known t® be four thousand years old. It is 230 feet wide on the bottom and carries a current eighteen feet deep. It waters 340,000 acres, and another waters 1,000,000 acres. The soil is so rich that three crops are raised each year. The British are constantly improving and expanding the uses of the Nile for irrigating purposes, all the way to its headwaters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In South Africa the project is being urged of damming the Chobe river and diverting it from its new channel into the old channel, running 500 miles to the south and now utterly obliterated. It is hoped by this means to renew Lake Ngami, which in Livingstone’s day was an inland sea of 50,000 square miles, but which is now dried up. Because of the drying up of this lake the Kalahari Desert has grown in size until it threatens the whole southern end of the continent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">One of the principal irrigation works of Australia is the Mildura pumping project, with Ive batteries of pumps, capable of raising 30,000 cubic feet of water a minute from the sand-submerged Murray river. The Mildura project has 70 miles of mains, 100 miles of laterals and 207 miles of subsidiary channels; and provides irrigation for 45,000 acres. There are many other considerable irrigation projects in the same district.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">Who Gets the Benefit? </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">By Wm. F. Withers</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">I</span><span class="font6">F PUBLIC funds be used to develop power, heat and light from the Colorado river, and to divert the water to the dry, fertile lands adjacent, who would be benefited thereby? The people at large who would be taxed to furnish the funds, or only the owners of lands thus made valuable?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">And if we develop at public expense “The Great Areas of Natural Resources Adjacent to Our .Highways of Travel”, “the mineral, coal and petroleum resources of Alaska and the tropical isles of the Pacific,” if we improve the great rivers, if we build good roads, if we do every thing conceivable to make the earth more productive, would not all of the financial benefit go to the owners of the lands while the rest of the people toil as. always for a bare subsistence? Even an appropriation for education results only in furnishing the exploiting class with efficient help at lower wages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Positively nothing that can be done will lift the masses out of the slough as long as we permit a few people to monopolize the bounties of nature; to call their own what the Creator has provided for all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">People are wont to say that the followers of Henry George regard land value taxation as a panacea. That is far from true. That philosopher stood for nothing less than absolute equality of right to life and liberty, and advocated every true reform; but it is plain that no other reform can avail while we permit private appropriation of rent. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A number of articles in The Golden Age have pointed to this truth, and it was clearly illustrated a short time ago in the story of the Nile improvement; but people so soon forget. They need to be reminded often, and The Golden Age can do effective work on this line. Its readers do not have to be told that the Creator has provided abundantly for the needs of all His creatures; but we do need to be reminded that He has' assigned man the duty of’developing the resources and distributing the products.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">From Our Canadian Correspondent</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">T</span><span class="font6">HAT the Roman Catholic element has not lost any of its power over the Liberal Government of Canada is well illustrated in the disposition recently made of some 20,000 acres of the Saddle Lake Indian Reserve surrendered to the government about a year ago for the purposes of settlement by British immigrants under the new British Settlement Plan. As far as the British immigrant is concerned he will not get much of the land, as the following press report in the Toronto </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Sentinel</span><span class="font6"> clearly shows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The country immediately east of the reserve is a mixed settlement,'the Freneh-Canadians having a slight majority. As soon as it became known that the reserve was to be opened the Freneh-Canadians quietly sent Father Tessier down here to arrange with Hon. Charles Stewart to stop the sale of the land to British settlers and have it sold to local residents, which. means the French settlers; for the British settlers were kept in the dark about selling to local residents. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is well remembered here in Ottawa that Father Tessier spent a good deal of time with the departments concerned. He had to deal with the Soldier Settlement Board and the Immigration Department. It is now learned that after many interviews Father Tessier suc-'-reded in having a new arrangement made whereby the last half of the portion surrendered by the Indians will be sold to the local applicants. Practically every influential man here was interviewed to push the deal through as a favor to the French.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">. It is learned that the greatest secrecy was maintained to keep the information from the British settlers until the French had applied for the whole tract. Word was given out in three of the French Roman Catholic churches in the parish of St. Paul-des-Metis that any of the members of the congregations who wished to get part of this land MAKE APPLICATION TO THE PRIEST, BUT NOT TO SPREAD THE NEWS AROUND. Some of the land, it is reported, has been sold by the priest to French settlers, and the British settlers knew nothing whatever about its being available. The representation made here in Ottawa was that the French settlers desired the land for their sons. In that way the whole area could be taken up before an Englishspeaking settler would know anything about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The questions that arise are—why, in the first place, was this fertile, accessible tract not kept for the original purpose of settling British families; and, in the second place, why does the government allow the public domain to be administered through' a church organization in-/ stead -of through the regular Dominion Land Office?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The whole transaction will be ventilated when Parliament meets, and the ministers affected will have to explain and defend their action.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Sometimes it is well to take an inventory of this dominion and visualize what some day, under proper government, it may become. That Canada ranks with the richest countries in the world is conceded, and that it can support a population of twelve or fifteen times its present one is no idle dream. Even today, with the comparatively isolated efforts made to develop its natural resources, it shows most marvelous returns.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This country has been called the bread basket of the empire with millions of acres of fertile land still awaiting the touch of the plow—agriculture, the backbone of its wealth. It has been claimed that its fisheries could be made to pay its national debt. Six hundred million acres of its surface, one-quarter of the whole country, has been estimated by the Department of the Interior to be covered with forest growth, and one-quarter of this with heavy timber of marketable size.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Many millions of dollars are yielded annually from Canadian furs; while our coal supply is said to be equal to one-sixth of that of the entire world. Canada’s known supply of iron is placed at 600,000,000 tons. Its water power has been estimated at something over 18,000,000 horse-power at ordinary minimum flow, with more than 32,000,000 dependable horse-power for six months in the year. It has oil and natural gas in quantities yet unknown.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There are said to be 200,000,000 acres of land available for agriculture in the Prairie Provinces, and only a comparatively small part of it now under cultivation. Yet Canada’s wheat production approaches that of the Lmited States. While the forest resources are not known, the Dominion Forestry Branch has made an estimate of the country’s supply of saw timber at more than five hundred thousand million feet, board measure, and pulpwood at nearly thirteen hundred million cords.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Canada’s mineral resources are regarded by those who should know as surpassing by far all other lands. Besides gold, silver, copper, iron, zine, platinum and other metals, Canada produces 85 percent of the world’s supply of nickel. It also produces 85 percent of the world’s supply of asbestos, and numerous other non-metalic minerals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Now Northern Ontario is apparently to add to Canada’s wealth by the discovery of the world’s richest deposit of china clay and silica</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">sand. And half the story has not been told, for in many parts of Saskatchewan valuable clay deposits of almost incalculable extent are being revealed by research work, and the whole far north of the province, of the same formation as Northern Ontario, is as yet unexplored.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In view of the marvelous potential wealth here shown to exist, its exploitation for the benefit of a few moneyed men, foreigners in many cases, and by financial interests controlled in foreign countries, is shameful; especially as we must continue to face a constant flow of native or naturalized Canadians from their homeland to foreign countries to seek a living.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">However, that a few steps in the right direction have been taken is shown in the fact that some of the nation’s assets are being developed under national control for the benefit of the people as a whole. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Labor,</span><span class="font6"> a newspaper published in Washington, D. C. by the. Railroad Workers of America, comments on Canada’s forward steps as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Government of Canada is running the biggest, single railroad system in the world, and is beginning to make a financial success of it. It is managing its own merchant marine. The Province of Ontario is developing its water power by public action for the benefit of all the people, and visitors are coining from distant lands to see how it is done. Canada has Government telegraphs and a Government radio. Its farmers are successfully handling a gigantic “wheat pool”, thus ensuring better prices, and are talking about a “flour pool” to mill their wheat and supply the finished product to a hungry world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This, the Toronto </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Globe</span><span class="font6"> says, is very, different from the timid opinion presented by many of our own public men and industrial leaders as to what has been accomplished in the Dominion and of what promises to be accomplished in the near future. It would seem as if in order to obtain a view of the Dominion in the right perspective, it is necessary to go abroad for information regarding Canada. In the words of the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Globe:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The fact is that in no country in the world today is wealth so evenly distributed, the prospect for the ordinary man so attractive or the future of the inhabitants so assured as in Canada. If her people will but be true to her and her destiny, nothing can impede her progress or prevent her attaining her goal as a great and prosperous nation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Concerning the present status of the National Hallway System, conflicting interests tell differing tales. Says the Moose Jaw </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Times,</span><span class="font6"> under the caption “Making Good”:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">For the month of October, 1925, net revenues of Canadian National Railways, after payment of operating expenses, were $8,159,958, ah' increase of $3,466,115 over October 1924, and of $2,974,941 over October 1923.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">For the ten months of 1925, January to October, inclusive, net revenues of the &quot;National System amounted to $20,485,210, as compared with $10,769,664 in the same period of 1924 and $12,144,712 in 1923.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Gross earnings of the system for October, 1925 amounted to $27,175,821, an increase of $4,335,123 as &quot;&nbsp;against the corresponding month of 1924 and an in crease of $918,048 over October 1923. 'For ten months period gross earnings of the system amounted to $196,444,081 as compared with $195,325,323 for the corresponding ten months of 1924, and $206,395,341 for the corresponding months of 1923. Operating expenses of the system were $19,015,863 in October, 1925, as against $18,146,855 in October 1924, and $21,072,756 in October 1923, operating expenses for ten months of 1925 were $175,958,360 and in corresponding periods of 1924 and 1923, they were $184,555,659 and $194,280,290.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Ratio of operating expenses to revenues continues to show marked improvements. In October, 1925, operating ratio was 69.97 percent as compared with 79.45 percent in October 1924; and 80.25 percent in October 'A 1923. Operating ratio for the ten months’ period ot 1925 was 89.59 percent against 94.49 percent in 1924, and 94.13 percent in 1923.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Canadian Nationals are making good. No railway having the national sweep of the Canadian Nationals could make such a record except in a country enjoying a large degree of prosperity. The earnings of our two great railway systems and the sane optimism of Mr. Beatty [President of the C. P. R.] and Sir Henry Thornton [President of the C. N. R.] will help to overcome the injury done the country by Mr. Heighten’s campaign of gloom for political effect. [Mr. Meighen is leader of the Government opposition.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the same newspaper, under the caption “Getting Worse”, the following appears:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">While it is gratifying to learn from Sir Henry Thornton that the operations of the Canadian National Railways are likely to result in a substantial surplus of operating revenue over expenditures, it is impossible to regard with equanimity the enormous increase in the debt of the national lines. According to a statement just issued by the Government, through the Bureau of Statistics, the debt now stands at $2,096,181,513. That figure comprises $1,142,268,435 due to the Dominion Government, with accrued interest, and $913,268,083 due to the public. In 1924 the debt due to the Dominion Government increased $28,085,159 ; due to the public, §&gt;90,814,027, Comparative figures show that during the last six years the debt due to the Dominion Government has increased $140,949,117.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This return bears out the statement made on several occasions that during last year the railway debt increased at approximately the rate of two million dollars a week. It may fairly be asked if any country with the population of Canada can long stand this frightful drain on it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">. It would appear that the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font6"> finds it difficult to determine editorially as to whether the railroad is an asset or a liability. The first extract given was evidently designed to support the Liberal Government, the second possibly a change of sentiment occasioned by receipt of a t^x bill. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;___________</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Times-Herald</span><span class="font6"> newspapers next get down to the presentation of a few figures dealing with national economy. After reviewing the success of the British “Geddes Commission” and the American “Dawes Commission” in restraining enthusiastic departmental spending, it states:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Canada has neglected to do the one thing that must be the foundation of any movement for national economy and reduction of taxation; that is, providing for an examination of all avenues of outlay to ascertain where savings may be made. One result of this lack of expert study of conditions is revealed by a comparison of present civil service costs with those of 1913, in which year more work was being done than now, in most of the Government departments. In 1913, there were in Canada 8,709 Government employes, with salaries of $8,000,000. In 1919, we had 12,742 employes, with salaries of $13,000,000. In 1923, the number was 39,204 employes and the salary list $50,000,000. Here is a $42,000,000 increase in ten years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Calgary </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Herald</span><span class="font6"> says that this is just one set of figures that should make the public think:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Every tax increase and every reduction of taxation affects the prosperity of the individual citizen. Tax money that is unnecessarily taken from the people and spent, removes so much money from their savings, or prevents it going back into reproductive employment. High taxation kills or retards investment of capital, thus restricting development, employment and prosperity. As Mr. Sweatman [former President of the Winnipeg (Man.) Board of Trade] puts it, “the ultimate consumer is the ultimate goat.” Governments do not shed their bad habits easily. An informed, aroused and vigorous public opinion has to insist upon reform.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Coming back again to Canada’s wonderful showing when favorable conditions permit of her producing her wealth: The most recent figures published by the Dominion Government indicated a total wheat crop for Canada approximately 422,000,000 bushels, which is- about 30,000,000 bushels more than its previous estimate, and 160,000,000 greater than the 1924 crop. Says the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Times-Herald</span><span class="font6"> newspapers;</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Government’s provisional estimate as at November 10 of the total value of the chief fodder crops produced during 1925 was $296,653,000, which compared with $277,780,000 for 1924.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Under the Federal Government test a new variety of wheat to be known as “Garnet” has been perfected, and this it is anticipated will prove a boon to the farmers of Western Canada, particularly in the northern areas, as the ripening stage is reached within 100 days of sowing and the danger from frost is minimized. When Marquis wheat was first developed, the period of time between sowing and reaping was reduced from 120 to 110 days, and this resulted in millions of acres of western lands being brought within the wheat belt. A relatively small quantity of the new grain will be available for distribution for sowing next year. While not claimed to be rust resistant, its earlier maturity decreases its susceptibility to disease.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Cattle of good quality continue to meet with a ready demand. With an abundant corn.crop in the United States, particularly in Iowa, and prices much lower than those of a year ago, the possibility of arranging for importations of Canadian feeder cattle to the Middle Western States is being discussed. Shipments of cattle to Great Britain for the first 10 months of the year numbered 87,797, as compared with 67,073 and 48,540 in 1924 and 1923, respectively.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It has been said that when agriculture pays a satisfactory profit the people will go back to the farms. There is now a distinct slackening of migration from the farms to the cities, and signs are not wanting, that satisfactory prices for farm products have prompted many to return to the land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When one contemplates the denudation of the western plains of their tremendous herds of bison which roamed the prairies one hundred years ago, one is apt to deplore the passing of the outstanding zoological phenomena of </span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">Am</span><span class="font6">erica. Canada, however, took steps some years ago to preserve the remnants of the vanishing cattle, and in 1907 the Government purchased from Michael Pablo of Montana 709 members of his herd and gave them pasturage^ and protection in Wainwright (Alberta) National Park. In sixteen years the original 709 have increased to twelve thousand head. Owing to the danger of overstocking the government desired to split the herd and. transport part of it to other-stamping” grounds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Regina </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Post</span><span class="font6"> gives the following report of this operation:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">From time to time a certain number have -been slaughtered and a commercial disposition made of the meat and robes. As a further experiment, during the past summer, over 1,600 yearling and two-year-old buffalo were shipped from Wainwright northward about 700 miles by rail and water to the Wood Buffalo park, near Fort Smith, Northwest Territories. Ten thousand five hundred square miles of natural pasture are included in the Wood Buffalo park, which was primarily set aside for the protection of wild wood buffalo herds. While it is too soon to say positively what the outcome of this experiment will be, the outlook is most encouraging.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The movement of the buffalo from Wainwright began in the early part of June. Their destination was a point known as l.a Butte on the Slave river, .the eastern boundary of the Wood Buffalo park. Substantial corrals and loading platforms were built at. Wainright and weekly shipments of 200 to 250 each were made in special cars divided into sections and fitted with watering and feeding facilities. The first trainload left Wainwright on June 15 and reached the end of steel at Waterways, Alberta, on the 17th. At this point the buffalo were placed in specially constructed corrals where they were watered, fed, and rested for thirty-six hours. They were then reloaded on two barges, and, after an uneventful trip down the Clearwater, Athabasca and Slave rivers, arrived at their destination on June 21. The buffalo were released at the gateway, of their new home by means of an enclosed wharf and laneway from which they raced for a few hundred yards and then settled down to graze on the inviting grass before further exploration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Seven times during the summer' this unique flotilla made the river journey, and during the first week in August the last shipment reached the northern park. Since then the wardens, who for some years have been guarding the wood buffalo against trespassers and who are now responsible for the new arrivals, have reported that the plains and wood buffalo are mingling freely and that there is every prospect of complete amalgamation of the two herds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Considei’ing the ever accelerating rate of increase, with proper protection these herds should constitute, in a few years, another natural resource asset for Canada.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The new immigration policy of the government may produce some good fruit if it is rigidly carried out and the immigrants as carefully handpicked, as seems to be necessary to justify the assistance rendered. Both the Dominion and the British Governments will need to put up larger payments on the assisted passage basis, the immigrants themselves furnishing approximately only $17.00 for passage to Halifax, $25.00 to Winnipeg, $35.00 to Edmonton, and $45 to Vancouver.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Last year 724 families comprising 3600 individuals emigrated to Canada under this scheme, as well as one thousand single farm workers and one thousand household workers. Twelve hundred more families are already in prospect for this year and a corresponding number of single workers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">An interesting comment on the weather “forecasting’’ is contained in a recent editorial in the Toronto </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Globe.</span><span class="font6"> In view of a recent article in The Golden Age concerning this science the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Globe's</span><span class="font6"> comment under the heading “Is the Climate Changing?” is quite pertinent:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Ou the last day of 1925 the Edmonton </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin</span><span class="font4"> announced to the world in large display type that that city was basking in springtime weather, that the whole northern country on the Pacific well up to the Arctic Ocean was enjoying mild, and genial atmospheric conditions, and that the prophets were predicting a permanent change of climate in the region once given over to polar gales and glacial ice. Those long acquainted with, the Far North are. inclined to attribute this phenomenon to “a conspiracy” on the part of the Japanese Current, the Gulf Stream and the chinook winds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">That there is real ground for attributing the genial conditions at present prevailing in Northern Alberta to a permanent change in the climate is to be doubted, but it can readily be understood with what jubilation any such prospect is welcomed by the inhabitants of that Province. Instead of shivering under fur coats with, the thermometer registering 40 degrees below, and still lower during the, long winter days, the. as-, surance of subtropical weather even when Boreas did his worst would be delightful indeed. It would add a valuable asset, too, to the many valuable assets which Alberta now possesses. With mild mountain air blowing all the year round from the ’Rockies, the region would become a vast health resort and an irresistible attraction to the tourist. Millions of acres of rich and fertile land would yet further increase the already immense agricultural possibilities of the Dominion, and the vast Peace River country would prove the strongest lure to the immigrant and the restless element of older Canada.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin</span><span class="font4"> indulges a spirit of optimism which, let us hope, will not soon be blasted by the biting breath of the north wind. It supports the predictions of permanently milder climatic conditions by publishing a despatch f rom Anchorage, Alaska, telling of the return of volcanic activity in Mount KcKinley, and the prevalence there of a springlike atmosphere unparalleled in the experience of the oldest inhabitant. Streams usually ice-bound at this season are reported to be open, and green vegetation has taken the place of snow-bound landscape.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">All this is pleasant, in view of the prophecies of a bitterly cold winter which were made by our “most reliable” weather prophets at the close of last autumn. Of course there are some months of possibly severe weather yet before us, in which Edmonton may have a rude<sub>:</sub> awakening from its dreams of changed climatic conditions. Let us hope, however, that the Japanese Current, the Gulf Stream and the chinooks will persist in their plots to dethrone the boreal tyrant of the Peace River region and endow the Pacific and the whole Northwest with an atmosphere of eternal spring.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There may be more of an element of reliability about governmental weather guesswork than the kind on the patent medicine almanac but it seems as though in practice, the. one has as much chance of being right as the other. They both seem to be responsible for the “lie” in “reliable”. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Children </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">By J. A. Boknet</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font14">M</span><span class="font6">UCH has been said about children, much they readily detect faults and imperfections in has been written about them, and much their neighbors’ children.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6">more can be said and written about them. It has been said that a home without children is like a garden without flowers. Who said that? Was it the parent, or was it the neighbor who has no children ? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Let the children-loving parent answer these questions: If children are so great a blessing in the home, why will the loving heavenly Father, following the Millennium, deprive homes of the blessing of children? Why not have children throughout eternity for the blessing of the people of earth? Does not the heavenly Father know that humankind in general will then be better off without any little children in the homes of men?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">If children are so great a blessing in the home, why do not the loving parents want their offspring always to remain </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">children,</span><span class="font6"> and never grow up to adulthood? If children, as children, are so great a blessing in the home, why do not the loving parents want the children of somebody else in their home? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;„</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Why would not some other person’s child be just as great a blessing in your home as your own children are said to be? If these simple questions are not answerable in the affirmative is it not self-evident that selfishness exists in the heart of the parent and warps his reason in favor of his own flesh and blood?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Parents love their children simply because the children are their own offspring. And because they </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">are</span><span class="font6"> their offspring they are slow to see any faults and imperfections in them, though</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Why are parents thus blind to these simple acts? Would not the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">perfect</span><span class="font6"> man have equal love and appreciation for all children, for his. own and for his neighbors’ alike? Can an imperfect human being realize such unselfish love? Imperfect creatures may vigorously declare that such a proposition is utterly unreasonable and impossible. But what did the perfect Jesus mean when He asked, Who is my mother, my brother, my sister and loved family members? Did He not mean to infer that all people should be alike dear and precious to one another?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Will not such a condition of unselfishness exist after the Millennium? And if so, where will be the need or advantage of children for home blessings (or annoyances) ? Broad-mindedness must here come into play. The narrow mind will file a probable protest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A colt, as a colt, is of no value. A calf, as a calf, is of no value. A chick, as a chick, is of no value; nevertheless they are liked and admired. Then of what real value is a child as a child? Nevertheless the child is loved and cared for. But no one wants his child to remain a child. Why not? I repeat: If children are indeed such blessings in the home why should not parents wish them to remain children and thus continue the home blessing perpetually?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We are largely creatures of environment, and viewpoints are influenced by habits. Parents are not usually worried and disturbed by th©’ nois.e and bustle of their children, as are those who have no children; nor can parents general* ly appreciate the comfort, serenity and quietude of the childless home. They really prefer the noise. The boiler maker feels lonely in quietude.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The childless person is accustomed to a different atmosphere, and is irritated by the din and silliness of restless childhood. He wants aloofness from it. And this the average parent is incapable of comprehending, especially -when the disturbance is caused by his (or her) own offspring.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">While children are being considered a blessing by their parents, may they not be really a nuisance to other people? Do parents ever realize that such may be the case? Anyhow, in the heavenly Father’s wisdom, when the Millennium is over there will be no children, nor shall there be any lack of blessing in the homes of humanity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Were children an essential to human happiness and blessing we may be sure they would always exist. If it were better to always have them in the home the Lord surely ■would have planned such a blessing to be continuous.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We may therefore reach the abstract conclusion that children are not so great a blessing as parents would have us believe; the blessing may be more than offset by care and worry over the little ones.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Some born critics will contend that had there been no children the earth would have been void of men and women, and that were there no children now the earth would soon depopulate. But that is beside the point here discussed. Furthermore, while it is true that throughout the period of Satan’s dominion it was intended that the population should thus increase, nevertheless with the inauguration of Christ’s kingdom of righteousness (now at hand) this will no longer be necessary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Another will say that in the Millennium there will be children by reason of the coming forth from the tomb of all the babies- who have died in infancy since Adam ate the apple. But they will not remain infants; they will all become adults as rapidly as possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">I hold to the point that the allwvise Creator sees fit to abolish children as home comforters after the Millennium; and wh® shall say the world then will not be the better? How strange then will seem the assemblies of the people, without disturbing youngsters! Speakers may say, “Is not this heaven?” And the hearers may respond, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“Amen!''</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">[While noting the points above made, let us also ponder the following: “And they brought young children to him, that he should touch them: and his disciples rebuked those that brought them. But when Jesus saw it, he was much displeased, and said unto them, Suffer the little children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God. Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child, he shall not enter therein. And he took them up in his arms, put his hands upon them and blessed them.” (Mark 10: 13-16)—Ed.]</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">L</span><span class="font6">AST fall a man came to me, saying, “I am the state inspector.” He asked me, if I had in this hotel a steam heating plant. I said, Yes. He visited with me the different apartments and rooms where steam heat is used and then said, ‘Well, you have a real line place and everything looks all right.” With that he closed up his grip and said good bye.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">About ten days later in dropped another man and said, “I am the inspector of heating plants for the state, and I suppose you have a plant in this place.” I said to him, Wes, I have, but what I want to know is, how many of you birds are running around inspecting the same heating plants? There has just been an inspector here.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">He said, “Is that so? What kind of looking man was he?” I tried to describe him. Finally he said, “O yes, I know that fellow. He has nothing to do with my job. His job was inspecting radiators, radiator valves and pipes. He had nothing to do with boilers. My job is inspecting the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">inside</span><span class="font6"> of the boilers. There will be another man following me that will inspect the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">outside</span><span class="font6"> of the boiler.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Perhaps I sprang off the handle, but I told him to tell Inspector No. 3 to not come and bother me, as I would surely throw him out of doors. As a matter of fact the third guy never did show up. I do not know how he checked up on his expense account, but he probably knew how to get by with it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Some Items about Tobacco</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">TN TEN years the manufacture of cigarets in J- the United States increased from seventeen billion to seventy-five billion. A correlated fact is that in soniti of the states the insane population is increasing four times as rapidly as the entire population.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The annual bill for tobacco in the United States would pay every school teacher in the country an annual salary of $4,285. It is, annually, eight times the value of all the farm lands in New England.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Tobacco stimulates the thyroid gland, and eventually exhausts it. No organ of the body has so much to do with beauty as this gland. It is of great importance in nutrition, circulation, blood formation, regulation of the heart and stability of the nervous system. It is. very closely related to the reproductive organs. Smokers automatically cease to be beautiful.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Persons who smoke are liable to become prematurely gray, to lose their hair, to become obese, to develop creases or wrinkles in the skin, to suffer lassitude and loss of memory, and in advanced cases the skin becomes yellow, dry and flabby, bags appear under the eyes, and the face and hands become bloated, with extreme sensitiveness to cold..</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Sterility of both men and women is not an uncommon result of the use of tobacco. It is a direct cause of high blood pressure, due to its formation of adrenalin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The enlightened rulers of heathen Thibet have refused to permit the introduction into their country of the tobacco sent to them by Christian America. Meantime, American cigaret manufacturers have missionaries in China actually engaged in teaching Chinese children how to smoke by thrusting cigarets into their mouths.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Tobacco is especially injurious to musicians. It injures the general nervous system. A tobacco user cannot enjoy music as well as one who does not use it. Tobacco injures the human voice, and the injury is cumulative, descending from father to son.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Tobacco frequently causes cancer of the mouth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There is enough nicotine in the average cigar to kill two normal men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is estimated that one-third of all loss by fire is caused by tobacco.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A leech is instantly killed by sucking the blood of a habitual smoker. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;' 4' &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Nearly two million acres of American land are used annually to cultivate tobacco.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Two thousand seven hundred Americans begin the tobacco habit each day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Our tobacco expense is greater than the cost of the United States government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The annual tobacco expense in the United States would build five Panama canals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Our annual tobacco bill amounts to twenty-five dollars per capita in the United States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The tobacco habit was begun in America, and has extended to every nation on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In Russia, Turkey and Persia, the use of tobacco has been at times punishable by death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In 400 years the tobacco habit has fastened itself upon about half the population of the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Among 412 young smokers examined by a naval enlisting officer at Peoria, Illinois, 298 were rejected.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Babies have been killed by breathing the tobacco smoke with which a smoker filled an unventilated room.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Connie Mack, the famous baseball hero, made it a rule never to employ baseball-league men who use tobacco.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">Glands </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">By Mrs. Walter Ferguson. (In the Indianapolis Times)</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">A</span><span class="font6">RE you paying enough attention to your glands?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is imperative these days, and all sensible people are taking up the study of this latest medical fad. We are all reading and talking and thinking about glands and such glands as, up to a short time ago, few of us knew were in existence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It seems that all over our bodies and especially in our throats there are innumerable very tiny, but extremely important, glands which, like small indefatigable soldiers, must be functioning just exactly right, or there will be something wrong with us and that something will be radical.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Some of these medical experts are always finding a new menace to keep us worked up about. Not so long ago it was your appendix. This hitherto unknown danger had slumbered in our vitals for generations until the doctors started to cutting them out and there was then the most terrible epidemic of appendicitis that has ever been known before or since.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Then we had the tonsils. Nearly all our ailments were traced directly or indirectly to these insignificant bits of human anatomy, and tonsils by the thousands were dug out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">And after that it was our teeth. At our slightest pain we rushed to the dentist and had all our molars yanked out, and the assiduous D. D.’s relieved us of our rheumatism and our angina pectoris as they pulled our teeth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We have been saved from the grave over and over again, but just as fast as we begin to feel secure and think we have a chance to live to a ripe old age somebody else announces that we are in imminent peril from a new source.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Now these glands—it is really alarming what an influence&quot; they exert over you whether you know it or not. If you suddenly start to put on flesh, or if you begin to pine away, it is as likely as not that some gland has gone on a strike. If you are too crazy about the opposite sex, or utterly indifferent to amorous overtures, something is almost certain to be amiss with a gland. If you are coarse and vulgar, or a bit of a moron, or inclined to want to beat your mother-in-law, some one of these pestiferous glands is only hitting on one cylinder. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Whatever you do, do not neglect to study this new menace to mankind. Get one of the numerous books upon the subject and after you have read about the dangers that hang over you, go . right on being carefree and happy, if you can.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But if you do, after all that, you may count upon it—You have gland trouble,</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font10">“Future Probation” Heresy?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font14">T</span><span class="font6">HE Scriptures teach, a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and of the unjust. The object of the resurrection of the unjust can be for no other purpose than that they might have an opportunity to learn the truth, and profiting by it, come to a knowledge of God’s plan so that they might accept God’s arrangement in Christ and ultimately be granted everlasting life. The world’s judgment day is still future. (Acts 17: 31; Isaiah 26:9; Jeremiah 31: 31-34) It seems incredible that there should be any opportunity for anyone beyond the present life. But it only seems so because we have not hitherto seen the magnitude of the plan of salvation.. Paul was called a heretic, and to the ecclesiastical mind of his day such preaching was heresy. (Acts 24:14,15) The same condition obtains today; for the human conception is very narrow, and the ecclesiastical mind is terribly hedged in. “Most men think in bailiwicks, many think in shires, occasionally one thinks in nations, but few only think in hemispheres.” And thinking in hemispheres is only fifty percent efficient.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Concerning “future probation”, or the doctrine of an opportunity of salvation in the resurrection day, we read in the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Signs of the Times </span><span class="font6">(Seventh Day Adventist):</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Any man who believes that beyond the grave is another chance is stepping directly into the toils of Satan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is the evil one’s great delight to have men think that this life is not a probation period in which we prove ourselves fit or unfit for an eternal future. If we go on lulled by this siren song, believing that beyond death there will be another opportunity to accept Christ and His gospel, then Satan knows he has us in his grasp.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A future probation period gives license to evil living in this life; a man may drink booze, gamble, lie, thieve and wnat not, for it matters little; a future place will be more auspicious to right living than this, so we might as well get all we can in any way we can.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Not only do all those who agree with such unscriptural inferences and deductions expressed in the above citation wholly misunderstand the viewpoint of Bible Students but, what is more, the error of their reasoning becomes even more plainly manifest upon an analytical examination of the Scriptures themselves, which do not hold out any such alluring promises called by them “a good time for the wicked and lawless” during Messiah’s one thousand year judg-</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">By F. Leon Scheerer</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">ment rule “with the rod of iron”. For “if the righteous scarcely be saved, where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear ?” were it not for this very provision provided by God’s grace, “to be testified in due time.”—1 Peter 4:18; 1 Timothy 2: 5, 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">To our understanding we find that the Scriptures clearly and unmistakably teach that all those who have failed in the present time to live up to the light and knowledge made available in their respective generation, and to develop themselves in harmony with the principles of righteousness, will be punished with many stripes and eventually, if incorrigible, be “cut off” from the land of the living. (Isaiah 26:10; Acts 3:23; Psalm 52:5) “They shall be as though they had not been.”—Obadiah 16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Pastor Russell distinctly stated and dearly pointed out in his Scriptube Studies, Volume Four, pages 49, 50 (published 1897):</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">God holds men accountable, not only for what they know, but for what they might know . . . for the lessons which experience (their own and others’) is designed to teach; and if men fail to heed the lessons of experience, or wilfully neglect or spurn its precepts, they must suffer the consequences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Still earlier, almost the very opening pages of Scripture Studies, Volume One (published 1886), page 145, we read:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We do not wish to be understood as ignoring the present responsibility of the world, which every man has according to the measure of light enjoyed, whether it be much or little, whether it be the light of nature or of revelation. ... We here merely broach the subject of the world’s present accountability, leaving the particulars for subsequent consideration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the light of the foregoing, written overthirty-five years ago, does not the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Signs of the Times’</span><span class="font6"> statement seem almost like wilful ignorance and perversion of the truth—both of the facts and of God’s Word? The most charitable view that we can take concerning these misstatements of the Adventists is that they “err not knowing the Scriptures” (concerning the two salvations) so clearly taught therein.-— Matthew 22:29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">St. Paul says: “Be not deceived: evil communications corrupt good manners.” “Whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap” (in the resurrection day), “when God shall judge the secrets of men, by Jesus Christ,” and when “every man’s work shall be made manifest”.— 1 Corinthians 15:33; Galatians 6:7; Romans 2:16; 1 Corinthians 3:13.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">872 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6">If “they have sown the wind, . . . they shall reap the whirlwind” (Hosea 8:7), for “they that plow iniquity, and sow wickedness, reap the same”. (Job 4:8) Therefore, “if thou seest the oppression of the poor, and violent perverting of judgment and justice in a province, marvel not at the matter: for he that is higher than the highest regardeth; and there be higher than they.”—Ecclesiastes 5: 8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Note for example the operation of the inerrant law of retribution, as recorded in 2 Chronicles 36:17-21. And did not all these things happen unto Israel for ensamples; i. e., object lessons of eternal principles?—1 Corinthians 10:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We heartily agree with the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Signs of the Times</span><span class="font6"> that it is the evil one’s (mark you, not the Bible Students’) great delight to have men think that this life is not a probation period.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Note, if you please, the significant distinction in the various dispensational periods or seasons of the different ways of salvation, mentioned in the following scriptures, according to the Emphatic Diaglott (Greek-English New Testament), Leeser’s Hebrew, Fenton’s, Moffatt’s and the Revised Versions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Thus saith the Lord, In an acceptable time have I heard thee, and in a day of salvation have I helped thee.”—Isaiah 49: 8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“To proclaim the acceptable year [a year of favor—Moffatt] of the Lord, and the day [a day—Moffatt] of the vengeance of our God; to comfort all that mourn.”—Isaiah 61: 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">2 Corinthians 6: 2 is a quotation from Isaiah 49: 8. “A favorable season,” “a day of salvation,” say Fenton, Weymouth, Rotherham, and the Diaglott; not as the King James or Common Version quotes this verse. It is correctly translated thus: (“For he saith, I have heard thee in </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font6"> time accepted, and in </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font6"> day of salvation have I succored thee; behold, now is </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">an</span><span class="font6"> accepted time; behold now is </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font6"> day of salvation),” and the reason for this distinction is given us in Acts 17:31: “Because he hath appointed a day [of salvation], in the which he will judge the world in righteousness, by that man whom he hath ordained.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We contend nevertheless that the opportunity then will be more auspicious to right living than in this age, for the plain and simple reason that the evil one, Satan, the god of this world, age or dispensation (2 Corinthians 4:4), will be bound during the Messianic day of a thousand years, that he might deceive the nations no more. (Revelation 20: 2, 3) No “roaring . lion” (1 Peter 5:8) will be permitted there to roam, nor will there be any “'ravenous beast”. (Isaiah 35:9) The stumbling stones will be gathered out; the blind eyes will be opened and the deaf ears unstopped; and the wayfaring men, though fools shall not err therein.—Isaiah 35; 5, 8.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">IKEWISE the manner of judgment is clearly shown in 1 Kings 13: 4-6: “And it came to pass, when king Jeroboam heard the saying of the man of God, which had cried against the altar in Bethel, that he put forth his hand from the altar, saying, Lay hold on him. And his hand, which he put forth against him, dried up, so that he could not pull it in again to him. The altar also was rent, and the ashes poured out from the altar, according to the sign Avhich the man of God had given by the word of the Lord. And the king answered and said unto the man of God, Entreat now the face of the Lord thy God, and pray for me, that my hand may be restored me again. And the man of God besought the Lord, and the king’s hand was restored him again, and became as it was before.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Again in 2 Kings 5: 25-27: “But he went in, and stood before his master. And Elisha said unto him, Whence comest thou, Gehazi? And he said, Thy servant went no whither. And he said unto him, Went not mine heart with thee, when the man turned again from his chariot to meet thee? . . . The leprosy therefore of Naa-man shall cleave unto, thee, and unto thy seed for ever. And he went out from his presence a leper as white as snow.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah, we are told in Psalm 9:16, “is known by the judgment which he executeth.” “Thy judgments are as the fight that goeth forth.” (Hosea 6: 5) “When thy judgments are in the earth, the inhabitants of the world [not of heaven or hell] will learn righteousness.” (Isaiah 26: 9) “Thy people shall be willing in the day of thy power.” (Psalm 110:3) These statements are not true at the present time for the obvious reason pointed out in Ecclesiastes 8:11: “Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily, therefore the heart of</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The story is told cf Dr. Clark that while a missionary in India he listened to a song from a band of coolies who had been cutthroats and murderers, but had become converted. The chief one had once been captured and sold as a slave. No master could keep him, he was so' wicked. A missionary bought him with the hope of saving him. Here the coolie heard that the blood saves!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Could it cleanse a murderer?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Yes.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“One who killed five men?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Yes; all sin!” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;' &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“One who killed ten, twenty, thirty?” “Yes, all manner of sin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">. “I am that man.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">His life was transformed. Verily, can man do this, and can God not? (Jeremiah 18:4-6)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“All manner of sin and.blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men; but the blasphemy against the holy spirit shall not be forgiven unto men. And whosoever speaketh a word against the Son of mam, it shall be forgiven him: but whosoever speaketh against the holy spirit, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world [age], neither in the world [age] to come.”—Matthew ' 12:31,32.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">How sweeping and far-reaching is the statement, “All manner of sin and blasphemy” shall be forgiven, even words uttered against the Son of man!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">These Scriptures in themselves furnish conclusive proof that (1) there will be forgiveness not only in this world or age but also in the age.(Greek, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">aion)</span><span class="font6"> to come, and that (2) there will be probation for some of mankind. The Master Himself declared and plainly stated, in Matthew 10:15, that “it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment than for ... ”—Capernaum, Tyre, Sidon, Berlin, London, Rome, Paris, New York, Chicago, etc., because there was less light shining in the days of Sodom and Gomorrah!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Compare with Isaiah 1: 9,10. “Except the Lord of hosts had left us a very small remnant, we should have been as Sodom, and we should have been like unto Gomorrah. Hear the word of the Lord, ye rulers of Sodom; give ear unto the law of our God, ye people of Gomorrah.” When this was spoken these cities were in ashes. It is a prophetic statement. They will yet hear.—Ezekiel 16: 49-63.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jude 7 says: “Even as Sodom and Gomorrah, and the cities about them in'like manner, giving themselves over to fornication, and going after strange flesh, are set forth for an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire.” The fire long since went out, so they are not suffering “eternal fire”, but the vengeance of it, destruction. However, the Scriptures quoted show that they are going to live again.—Compare with Jeremiah 18:1-8.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark78"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark79"></a>God’s Plan of Salvation</span></h5>
<div><img src="g_E_19260310_files/g_E_19260310-4.png" alt="" style="width:15pt;height:18pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6">ET us note some features of Jehovah’s plan of salvation. God “will have all. men to be saved [from Adamic condemnation, from </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">hades, sheol,</span><span class="font6"> the death state], and to come unto the knowledge </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">[epignosis—</span><span class="font6">full discernment] of the truth.” (1 Timothy 2:4) This purpose of Jehovah is also plainly taught in Nineveh’s repentance (Jonah 4:11); in Nebuchadnezzar’s restoration (Daniel 4:27); and in Job’s restoration. ( Job 42:10) All of these scriptures clearly and positively point forward to “the times of restitution of all things, which God hath-spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets”. (Acts 3:19-21) This is the time spoken of when “the creature [humanity] itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption [of sin and death] into the glorious liberty of the children of God”.—Romans 8:21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Note the significant expression, “glorious liberty of the children [church] of God.” It is liberty exceeding by far any proclaimed by Washington, Lincoln, or even Moses. It means “life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness” in its fulness, and unending.—Romans 11:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There is such an overwhelming abundance of corroborative Scriptural testimony in support of this positive, revealed will of God, sealed with His own signet, “Thus saith Jehovah,” that one marvels at the narrowness and blindness of so many otherwise noble and well-meaning people on this stupendous revelation (Romans 11:33) of God’s fulness (Colossians 1: 19: 20), further attested by the following quotations : &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Simeon hath declared how God at the first did visit the Gentiles, to take out of them a people for his name. And to this agree the words of the prophets; as it is written, After this I will return, and will build again the tabernacle of David, which is fallen down; and I will build again the ruins thereof,, and I will set it up: that the residue of men might seek after the Lord, and all the Gentiles, upon whom my name is called, saith the Lord, who doth all these things.”'—Acts 15:14-17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Commenting on this passage, Dr. Gaebelein of New York City has this to say: “There can be no conversion of the world until Christ comes back. The great program revealed in the First Church Council held in Jerusalem makes this clear.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Thou shalt arise, and have mercy upon Zion. . . . When the Lord shall build up Zion, he shall appear in his glory, lie will regard the prayer of the destitute, and not despise their prayer . . . when the people are gathered together, and the kingdoms, to serve the Lord.” This is “written for the generation to come”.—Psalm 102:13,16,17,22,18. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“In that day will I raise up the tabernacle of David that is fallen, and close up the breaches thereof: and I will raise up his ruins, and I will build it as in the days of old.”—Amos 9:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“For I will set mine eyes upon them for good, and I will bring them [the Jews] again to this land; and I will build them, and not pull them down; and I will plant them, and not pluck them up. And I will give them a heart to know’ me, that I am the Lord; and they shall be my people, and I will be their God: for they shall return unto me with their wdiole heart.”—Jeremiah 24:6, 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Surely such things are not done in heaven nor in hell!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“And he said, It is a light thing that thou [prophetic of Messiah] shouldest be my servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob, and to restore the preserved of Israel; I will also give thee for a light to the Gentiles, that thou mayest be my salvation unto the end of the earth. Thus saith the Lord ... to him whom man de-spiseth, to him wdioni the nation abhorreth, . . . Kings shall see and arise, princes also shall worship, because of the Lord that is faithful . . . and he. shall choose thee [the Messiah] .’’—Isaiah 49: 6, 7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Thou shalt raise up the foundations of many generations; and thou shalt be called, The repairer of the breach, The restorer of paths to dwell in.” (Isaiah 58:12) This great work is still future. “And they shall build the old wmstes [ruins], they shall raise up the former desolations, and they shall repair the waste cities, the desolations of many .generations [wrecks from ages of ages—Fenton]. And strangers shall stand and feed your flocks, and the sons of ths alien shall be your plowmen and your rine-dressers. But ye shall be named the priests of the Lord; men shall call you the ministers of our God: ye shall eat the riches of the Gentiles, and in their glory shall ye boast yourselves.” —Isaiah 61:4-6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Lord’s kingdom is yet to be established. When it is—in that day “all nations shall flow unto it”. (Isaiah 2:2) Even death will be sw’allow’ed up in (resurrection) victory (1 Corinthians 15: 55; John 5: 28, 29, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">R. V.;</span><span class="font6"> Isaiah 60: 1-5; 65:17-25; Rev. 22:17), for “the ransomed of the Lord shall return [from the land of the enemy, the grave] and come to Zion with songs, and everlasting joy: . . . sorrow’ and sighing shall flee away.”—Isaiah. 35:10.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">ND w’hat will be the power that will effect such a marvelous change of heart in mankind? Is it poison gas and T. N. T., the nurture of international hatred, of “speaking lies in hypocrisy”, of “teaching for doctrines the commandments of men”, such as “eternal torment” (Jeremiah 7:31), “death ends all probation,” etc.? Air, no, none of these “doctrines of demons” will be tolerated any longer, but instead Jehovah “wall turn unto the people a pure language” (Zephaniah 3:9); and the keynote to the stupendous world-wnde transformation, of mind and heart then to be witnessed lies in the fact that “the people . . . shall be forgiven their iniquity” (Isaiah 33: 24), for by mercy and truth concerning Jehovah’s righteous character and judgments iniquity is purged!—Romans 2: 4; Acts 17:31; Psalm 96: 8-13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But “lie that, being often reproved, hardcneth. his neck, shall suddenly be destroyed [not kept alive any longer], and that without remedy”. (Proverbs 29:1) “He preserve th not the life of the wicked.” (Job 36:6) And a “sinner being an hundred years old, shall be accursed” (Isaiah 65: 20) in the second death from which there is no resurrection. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Let us also recall the equally significant and important typical arrangements concerning the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">second</span><span class="font6"> passover, recorded in Numbers 9:6-14; likewise the general feast following </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">after</span><span class="font6"> the 15th. of Nisan, wdiich lasted seven days, and which is the very feast mentioned in Isaiah 25: 6. All of this is climaxed by the Jubilee arrangement of Leviticus 16, which shall be antityped by a glorious ingathering of the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Heb. 8: 8-13; Romans 8:17-25; Acts 3:19-21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Proclaiming liberty to all mankind who are now slaves to sin and selfishness, and captives of death, is the privilege of those who know God’s truth. “For the earth [not heaven] hath he [God] given to the children of men” (Psalm 115:16), for it was “formed to be inhabited”. (Isaiah 45:18) The earth is God’s footstool (Isaiah 66:1), and He will make the place of his feet glorious. (Isaiah 60:13) Of “the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end.” (Isaiah 9: 6,7; Psalm 37: 29) It is God’s government or kingdom which shall be established (Matthew 6:10), and the Messiah is the King whom God will place over His holy hill to rule in power and great glory; and when Christ finishes His work of restoring the human family back into harmony with God, He will turn the kingdom over to the Father, God Almighty, and then He Himself, with His glorious bride and consort, shall become subject to the Father Almighty, in order that God may be all and in all.—1 Corinthians 15: 28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As God is not saving anyone in ignorance or without faith in the precious blood of Jesus, it is manifest that if there is no such thing as an opportunity for salvation in the resurrection that many of earth’s teeming billions have gone down into the great prison-house of death never to return. Few only are saved in the present lifetime (Matthew 7:14); but Jesus died for all. (Hebrews 2:9) Are we compelled to erroneously conclude that the death of Jesus as the Savior of mankind is measurably a failure? (1 Corinthians 15: 21,22; Romans 5:18-21) Paul did not think so. He wrote: “If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable.” (1 Corinthians, 15:19) If a knowledge of, and acceptance of, the truth becomes a basis for salvation, “and if the righteous scarcely be saved” (1 Peter 4:18) at that, where will the hundreds of millions of so-called Christians spend eternity? And what will become of those who spurn “the wideness of God’s mercy” in providing just such a thing as an opportunity for salvation after death for those who, in the present life, did not have that opportunity? If God in His wisdom was unable to formulate a plan to. reach all mankind, how should we understand the statement of Jesus: “God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that, whosoever believe th in him should not perish, but have everlasting life”? (John 3:16) But God’s resources are sufficient to bring blessings to all the families of the earth.—Genesis 22:15-18; Luke 2:10,11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Let those who deny the Scripturalness of the doctrine of “future probation” study their Bibles; let them forsake “the doctrines and precepts of men”; let them consider their own sorry plight should God not be saving any through ignorance; and let them know assuredly, that not all who profess Christianity and a belief in the historic Christ are in covenant relationship with God and, therefore, are not “ambassadors of Christ” to proclaim His Word of Truth.— 2 Corinthians 5:13-20.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">The Triumph of Righteousness</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">[Radiocast from Watchtower WBBR on a wave length of 272.6 meters, by Judge Rutherford'.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">R</span><span class="font6">IGHTEOUSNESS means the quality or state of being right. It means to give to all their dues and to be free from wrong and injustice toward any one. It means to deal justly and honestly with one’s fellow man. It means to conform oneself to the divine law; to do evil to no one but to do good unto all as opportunity affords.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Neither proof nor argument is needed to establish in the minds of the people that unrighteousness now prevails in this world. It is not unusual to hear a man say concerning commercial business that it is impossible for a man to succeed in business if he deals honestly and justly with his fellow creatures. Often his excuse is that competition is based on dishonesty. It is a well-known fact that the war taught the business men how to profiteer and they have not been willing to unlearn the lesson since the World War. Profiteering continues and the people suffer therefrom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Governments are instituted for the benefit of the governed. It will be conceded by all however that the governing factors are controlled by selfishness. These look well to self and leave the common interest of the people to the last. The governing factors of the nations are made up of big business, big politicians and big preachers. Otherwise stated, it is an unholy alliance of commercial, political and ecclesiastical power.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The political factors do the bidding of the commercial power and the two jointly create the great military systems, and a few enforce the law of the land and oppress the many. The clergy sanctimoniously bless both of these and make the credulous people believe that it is necessary for them to reverently bow and worship at their shrine and take the preachers’ advice as to what kind of government they shall have. The preachers have long been telling the people that these institutions are by divine right and approval.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The public press is supposed to be operated for the purpose of publishing the news of interest to the people that will be for their welfare and upbuilding. The people well know that they do not publish the facts or the truth, unless it serves some selfish interest. The great newspapers are owned by the financial powers and these work together with the political and ecclesiastical factors. There is probably no place on earth where this is quite so marked as in Greater New York.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The commercial and political factors influence the press to publish nothing that will be against their interests, whether for the public welfare or not. The preachers, working hand in glove with the commercial and political factors, insist that the press shall publish nothing about the Bible or the work concerning the spreading of the message of the kingdom of God unless they, the preachers, approve. If some Catholic or Protestant church,, has a social affair, in which no one is particularly interested outside of their own congregation, two or three columns notice will be given in the press about it. Why? Because this system has political influence*. If an ecclesiastical advertiser comes to the city for the purpose of separating the people from' thousands of dollars by means of excitement and collections, but with no purpose or intent of doing the people good, much publicity is given to this through the press.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sub>l</sub> If a public lecture is given by a man who asks neither for money nor members but speaks only for the purpose of enlightening the people concerning the truth as to God’s plan of salvation, and there is tremendous interest shown and great multitudes come to hear, the public press is conspicuous by its silence. The reason is because the clergy say to their allies, You must say nothing about anything that might make us appear as failing to do our duty toward the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A striking illustration: In 1923 it was my privilege to address a public meeting at the New York Madison Square Garden. It was purely a Biblical lecture, advertised to be given as instruction upon the Bible. Every seat in that great auditorium was filled and the people listened attentively for one hour and a half. There were fully 13,000 persons present who manifested much interest and who read the newspapers. Never before had that place been filled when merely a religious lecture was announced. The morning following every newspaper in the city of New York ignored the meeting, with one exception, and that one had a small notice. The same thing happened on other occasions when like audiences crowded the Hippodrome.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">.1. look it upon myself to ascertain the reason. J have some friends amongst the reporters upon the public press. I sent along'.a f riend, a newspaper mail, who visited every paper and got the inside facts. His report was this: ‘’The reporters turned in the copy, hut it was ignored because the higher-ups had sent down the word that nothing should be published unless it was strictly orthodox.” I mention this to show that the public press is not operated for the benefit of the people, and the people know it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Notwithstanding the press makes a pretense of honestly printing the truth, few, if any, of the larger newspapers possess the moral courage to publish the truth. 1 am calling attention to these things merely to show that the great newspapers of the land, which could be operated for the good of mankind, are operated as a rule to spread a knowledge of evil and not a knowledge of things that upbuild humanity. The people are well aware of this fact. The public press wields a power which could.be used for much good. Being controlled and directed by selfish, interests it is used for unrighteousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The presumption is indulged that the courts of the land are tribunals of justice and righteousness. But this is a violent presumption. The greater number of the courts could be well called tribunals of injustice where favoritism is shown io the rich and influential, and where the poor have not a proper and fair consideration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The </span><span class="font6">legislative bodies are presumed to make righteous laws for the benefit of the people, and </span><span class="font5">the </span><span class="font6">presumption is that flic courts will enforce these laws for the benefit of the people. Yet usually both Ilie legislative body and the courts are improperly influenced by selfish interests. The people were induced to believe that prohibition was for the moral uplift of the people in </span><span class="font5">.America, </span><span class="font6">and </span><span class="font5">the </span><span class="font6">law was passed with this in </span><span class="font5">view. Yet in </span><span class="font6">truth and in fact the law was vigorously supported by profiteers who manipulate a great bootlegging enterprise; and the law, instead of being vigorously enforced, is winked at in many places and those entrusted with its enforcement compel men who are found with liquor upon them to surrender it, and then the officers take it and use it for their own enjoyment or sell it to some one else.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There is great injustice and unrighteousness practised among the nations of the earth. God made the earth for man’s habitation. He did not make it for one class of people to oppress another. .Every country however is now desperately preparing to oppress and punish every other country. For the past few days there has been in New York City a great airplane contest with the view of exhibiting the tremendous development in the preparation for war. The airplane is a marvelous thing. God foretold it centuries ago through His prophets. The airplane can be used for great good and for righteousness. But it is being prepared for use chiefly for oppression or destruction of others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">God's prophet long centuries ago foretold these very conditions which we now see. I quote from the words of the Prophet Isaiah.: “And judgment is turned away backward, and justice standetli afar off: for truth is fallen in the street, and equity cannot enter. Yea, truth fail-eth; and he that departeth from evil maketh himself a prey: and the Lord saw it, and it displeased him that there was no judgment.”— Isaiah 59:14,15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">’Who is to blame for this prevalence of unrighteousness in the land? Shall it be charged against or attributed to any one class of people? I answer, No. It would be wrong to array one class against another. When I say that the rich oppress the poor, and the profiteer, the clergy and the politicians work together against the mass, I mean to lay this charge against no special individuals. Man’s condition is such that if there should be taken from the masses some who are now poor and exalted to places of power by means of wealth or political influence these would do no better, if as' well, as the ones who have had long practice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The time has come for men to cease to say harsh things about each other, but to look to the real cause of man’s trouble and then look to the real remedy. What I have said on this occasion about the injustice practised, everybody well, knows to he true; and no one will attempt to successfully gainsay it. But I do not say it for the purpose of inciting one class against another. Amongst men there are none righteous in themselves, and there is a reason for this. Briefly then I set forth the reason for unrighteousness, and that reason is found in the Scriptures and from the experience of the human race.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Biblical account is that God created the first man perfect, in His own image and likeness; that is to say. He endowed man with attributes of wisdom, justice, love and power. Had he remained in harmony with Jehovah God His power would have been used in harmony with love and justice, therefore it would have been wisely used. There would have been no oppressive measures made to enforce against others. There would have been no necessity for the great system that is now maintained by the people to prevent one class from robbing or destroying another.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">God placed the first man in Eden, a perfect hvrne. As an overlord and. helper He placed His mighty creature Lucifer there also. Lucifer be-caihe ambitious to have a government of his own. He saw that man was so constituted that he must worship his benefactor. He also saw that man, in due time, would fill the earth with a race of people. His desire was that he might have the worship of man instead of permitting God to have it. He resorted to fraud and deceit and induced man to violate God's law; and as a result man lost the right to« life and, being sentenced to death, this sentence was enforced against him. The result.has been that every man born into the world has been born im-pc &quot;feet. As the prophet puts it, he was born in sin and shapen in iniquity. Selfishness has ever since prevailed, and for that reason unrighteousness has prevailed in the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It was God’s purpose from the beginning that in His own due time He would establish in the earth a righteous government and that this government should teach man righteousness, lead him in the righteous way, and aid him to come back to the condition of righteousness enjoyed by man prior to his sin. The Lord Jehovah .made a great plan. This plan was made in wisdom, and has been carried out in harmony with justice and love. His justice required Him to ■sentence man to death. Justice required Him to disapprove of all the children of men, because born imperfect. Justice therefore would require each one to die. But the love of God met all these exigencies. It is recorded in John 3: 16: “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever’ believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In no possible way could a righteous government be established until man’s redemption, hence God provided for the redemption of the human race and that at a great sacrifice to Himself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Logos, His beloved Son and the beginning of His creation, willingly permitted His nature to be changed from spirit to human. He came to earth made a man (Hebrews 2: 9), and in God’s due time He &quot;was offered as a sacrifice. His death voluntarily provided the great ransom price. A ransom price was needed because it is the plan of God that man should be redeemed from death and from the power of the grave. This promise He made in Hosea 13:14, which reads: “I will ransom them from the power of the grave; I will redeem them from death.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It was a perfect man who sinned and therefore a perfect man must meet this requirement of the law. In all the earth there was none who could meet this requirement, as is stated in Psalm 49:7: “None of them can by any means redeem his brother, nor give to God a ransom for him.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">For this reason came. Jesus into the world* that He might be a witness to the truth, provide the redemptive sacrifice for man and in due course of time establish a government of righteousness that shall sweep away the refuge of lies and bring to the people the blessings they have so long desired. After Jesus’ death God raised Him up out of death and exalted Him, and He will be in due time the ruler of heaven and earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It was prophetically written of the Lord Jesus and of the righteous government that He should establish, as follows: “For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given, and the government shall be upon his shoulder; and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace. Of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end, upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom to order it, and to establish it with judgment and with justice, from henceforth even for ever. The zeal of the Lord of hosts will perform this.”— Isaiah 9: 6, 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Before however this righteous government could be established it was the plan of God that He should take out from amongst men a people for His name who should be associated with Christ Jesus in His kingdom. For this reason the past 1900 years have been employed in selecting the associates for the Lord Jesus in His righteous government. This selection has taken place in this manner, to wit; God has had the gospel preached concerning His kingdom; and those who have believed the things that they have seen and heard, and who have then consecrated themselves to the Lord and been faithful and obedient to him and continue thus until death, have the promise of participating in the chief resurrection and reigning with Christ in His glorious kingdom. This is plainly stated in Revelation 20: 6, and in many other places in the Scriptures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Lucifer, who. caused the fall of man, thereafter was named Satan the Devil. During all these centuries he has opposed righteousness and planted in the minds and hearts of men selfishness, unrighteousness and wickedness. All the selfishness in the world that is practised by the profiteers, by the dishonest politicians, and by the clergy who fail to teach the truth, was caused and induced by the wrongful influence of Satan the enemy. What the , people must see is that their real enemy is the invisible god of this evil world, Satan the Devil, and that their relief from Iris power and influence is to ally themselves with God’s new government, which is a government of righteousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As the prophecy above quoted states, the government shall be upon His shoulder, that is to say, Christ Jesus, the beloved Son of God, shall be the great Governor of the new and righteous government now being established. There shall be associated with Him the faithful Christians, and this government is to begin with His second coming. The Scriptures show, as has been explained many times over this radio, and otherwise, that the Lord has come, that His first, work is to oust the Devil from his power in heaven, and that the elements are now preparing for the last final conflict on the earth. The preparation for war amongst the nations is the preparation for the great and final conflict which soon shall follow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But now it becomes the duty of the Christian to proclaim to the people the message of the Lord’s kingdom of righteousness, in order that the people might have hope and in order that they might prepare themselves to receive </span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">the</span><span class="font6">s kingdom, which shall be for their blessing. The prophet beautifully states it in Psalm 96: 10-13 as follows: “Say among the nations, that the Lord reigneth: the world also shall be established that </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">it</span><span class="font6"> shall not be moved: he shall judge the people righteously. Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad; let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof. Let the field be joyful, and all that is therein: then shall all j the trees of the wood rejoice before the Lord: for he cometh, for he cometh to judge the earth: he shall judge the world with righteousness, and the people with his truth.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">With the Lord’s kingdom in full sway commercial profiteering will cease. There will be ■ no more necessity for political schemers; and no more will man preach for money and mw- ■ represent God; because the Lord will permit o falsehoods or misrepresentations under His ! reign. The great trouble that is impending now ’ will result in the complete victory for the Lord Jesus Christ, the King of kings and Lord of lords.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This final conflict is described by the Rey-elator in 19:11-16: “And I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse; and he that sat upon him was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he doth judge and make war. His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were-many crowns; and he had a name written, that no man knew but he himself. And he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood: and his name is called The Word of God. And ..fie armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses, clothed in fine linen, white and clean. And out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword, that with it he should smite the nations; and he shall rule them with a rod of iron: and he treadeth the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God. And he hath on his vesture and on his thigh a name written, KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The establishment of the Lord’s kingdom will be a triumph of righteousness over the evil one. The reign of the Lord Jesus will undo all the wickedness, sorrow and suffering that Satan has brought upon the human race during the past centuries. St. Paul wrote concerning this: “The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death. For he hath put all things under his feet. But when he saith, All things are put under him, it is manifest that he is excepted, which did put all things under him.”—1 Corinthians 15:26,27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Speaking of. the triumph of righteousness over evil, God through His prophet Isaiah said: “And he saw that there was no man, and wondered that there was no intercessor; therefore his arm brought salvation unto him; and his righteousness, it sustained him. For he put on righteousness as a breastplate, and an helmet of salvation upon his head; and he put on the garments of vengeance for clothing, and was clad with zeal as a cloke. According to their deeds, accordingly he will repay, fury to his adversaries, recompence to his enemies; to the islands he will repay recompence.”—Isaiah 59: 16-18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The very purpose of the Lord in having the message of His kingdom proclaimed now is that the people- may know that Jehovah is God, that He is all powerful, that justice is the foundation of His throne, and that He will cause the people to be judged in righteousness. Those who hear will be blessed, as the prophet puts it in Psalm 85:9: “Surely his salvation is nigh them that fear him; that glory may dwell in our land.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When the evil influence of the adversary is removed and the eyes of the people are opened to. the fact that God is good and rewards goodness, there will be a great falling away from evil. Profiteering will cease, and fraud and misrepresentation will cease, and injustice will &quot;ease. Under the righteous reign cf the Messiah all the people who learn to do righteously shall be favored with the blessings of life, liberty and happiness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The people long for righteousness. God, through His prophet, describes this longing and the effect that the righteous reign of Christ will have upon the people, when He says: “With my soul have I desired thee in the night; yea, with my spirit within me will I seek thee early: for when thy judgments are in the earth, the inhabitants of the world will learn righteousness.”—Isaiah 26: 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During the reign of Messiah nothing shall be permitted to hurt the people. “But with righteousness shall he judge the poor, and reprove with equity for the meek of the earth: and he shall smite the earth with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips shall he slay the wicked. And righteousness shall be the girdle of his loins, and faithfulness the girdle of his reins.”—Isaiah 11:4,5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The time has come for the people to know that Jehovah is God. Referring to this time He says through His prophet that H® vdll make the crooked places straight and will open the windows of the heavens that He may pour down blessings upon mankind: “Drop down, ye heavens, from above, and- let the skies pour down righteousness; let the earth open, and let them bring forth salvation, and let righteousness spring up together. I the Lord have created it.”—Isaiah 45: 8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Then shall be true, as stated by the prophet in Psalm 85:10-13: “Mercy and truth are met together; righteousness and peace have kissed each other. Truth shall spring out of the earth; and righteousness shall look down from heaven. Yea, the Lord shall give that which is good; and our land shall yield her increase. Righteousness shall go before him, and shall set us in the way of his steps.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There are many millions of people on earth now who are fully aware of the great injustice that is being practised and the great amount of wrong that is done, and these hearts long for a condition of righteousness wherein they may be relieved of oppression and dwell together in happiness. This sincere desire for righteousness shall be realized, but the people must learn that there is only one way it can come and that way is through God’s great plan. He will shortly cause righteousness to triumph and all who follow righteousness shall be blessed with peace and life everlasting.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6"><sup>4S8</sup>While thus undergoing development, the new creature finds that he has to war against the downward tendencies of his own fleshly disposition, against the spirit of the world, and against Satan’s machinations through various instruments. But this warfare is what makes him. strong.. It is .not a warfare with carnal weapons. It is . the power of God<sup>:</sup> working in him;, to war against these enemies, and it is mighty to the pullipg down of-the. strongholds of Wrong. (2 Corinthians 10: 4) It is the great hope of an entrance into the kingdom that enables him, by the Lord’s grace, to battle steadfastly for the right. St. John states: “Every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as he is pure.” (1 John 3:3) These fiery trials through which the Christian passes have the same effect upon him that a fire has upon metal. It burns up the dross and refines the-gold. It has a cleansing effect; and also for this reason the Lord permits it.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">their suffering was for a twofold purpose: (1)' To develop them, which will result to their benefit when they are resurrected as perfect men; and (2) to serve as examples for the church, the followers of Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>491</sup>Jesus said: “And from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffered! violence, and the violent take it by force.” (Matthew 11; 12) Here He showed that the kingdom-of-heaven class, meaning the royal family, suffers violence at the hands of the adversary’s instruments, and that the violent ones take these by force. It was so of Him; it has been so of His followers, as St. Paul writes: “Our hope of you is steadfast, knowing, that as ye are partakers of the sufferings, so shall ye be also of the consolation.”—2 Corinthians 1:7.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6"><sup>4</sup>' God foreordained that all the members of the new creation should be made in the likeness of His beloved Son. (Romans 8:29) This does not take place by meditating upon wrongful things, but by resisting these and keeping the mind upon heavenly things. The Christian now has his face unveiled; that is, he is enabled by his mental vision to understand the things of God’s Word, and when he looks into-the Word, the Bible, he sees reflected from that Word the character likeness of the Lord; and having the Lord’s spirit in him, he is being transformed from one degree of glory to another. The Apostle Paul puts it thus: “We all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the spirit of the Lord.” (2 Corinthians 3:18) The pathway of the Christian is not strewn with flowers or ease or comfort; but as Jesus said, it is a narrow way and few there be that walk in it.—Matthew 7:14.</span></p>

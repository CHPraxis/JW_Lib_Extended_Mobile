<p><span class="font14">I</span><span class="font4">N AN address before the New England Bankers Association, Lewis E. Pierson, prominent in banking circles and in the United States Chamber of Commerce, said, “High production, high wages and high consumption are the cardinal principals of modern American industry; and throughout the world today American industry is competing with the industries of other countries which are proceeding on the theory of low production, low wages and low consumption.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">A</span><span class="font4">CCORDING to John Nevin Sayre, head . of the National Committee on Militarism in Education, the United States is now the most militaristic country. It has taken the lead in establishing military training in schools and colleges. Russia, Japan and Mexico are. following the American example and using the course of the United States as an argument for militarizing their youth.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark40"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark41"></a>Federal Reserve Not Taking Chances</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">I</span><span class="font4">T IS apparent to every visitor to the Federal Reserve Bank building in New York City that no one around there is taking any chances. Every visitor is watched by armed men. The gold reserve of the country is kept in a vault</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">, the walls of which are of steel ten feet thick. The only entrance is through a slot in a vertical cylinder the weight of which is ten tons. Even beyond the cylinder there are other gates and bars protecting the gold.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark42"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark43"></a>Wealth of the United States</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">O</span><span class="font4">F THE $353,000,000,000 estimated wealth of the United States, about $1,000,000,000 are invested in Asia, $2,000,000,000 in Europe, $2,600,000,000 in South America, $2,500,000,000 in Canada, and $1,500,000,000 in Mexico and Central America. The wealth is increasing so rapidly that despite lowering of taxes on a large scale in the last fiscal year, the government had a surplus of $400,000,000 at the end of the year. The national income is put at about $70,000,000,000. One-third of the total wealth is in the land or mineral deposits, one-third in structures, and one-third in personal effects which can be moved around.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">TXTHAT with plaster falling on him in the ’ ’ White House and in his church and in the theatre where he went to worship after the church ceiling was found insecure, matters look as if the fates had it in for Mr. Coolidge. And it looks even more that way, politically. With Iowa, North Dakota and other western states turning away from him and with the exposures of corruption in Pennsylvania, it looks like hard sledding ahead for the present standard-bearer of the Republican party.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark46"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark47"></a>Church Built of Grindstones</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">&quot;PHILADELPHIA has a church built of grindstones, which had first served their time in the making of saws in that city. More than 2,500 grindstones were used’in building the church. Thousands more were used in building a retaining wall several blocks long. Philadelphia has one of the largest saw-making establishments in the world.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark48"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark49"></a>Warm in the West</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">TTP UNTIL the first of August all the eastern part of the United States complained of a cold, backward summer, while the western part of the country found it warmer than usual. The cold belt stretched back from the Gulf Coast aiid the Atlantic seaboard about one thousand mjles, following the shore line with remarkable accuracy at that distance. The edge of the cold belt just included Santa Fe, Fort Smith, St. Louis, Chicago, Green Bay and Marquette. West of those cities it was warmer than usual throughout the spring and summer months.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark50"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark51"></a>Necessity for Reducing Hours of Work</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">T</span><span class="font4">HE Chamber of Commerce sees the necessity for further reductions in hours of work. It calls attention to the fact that while the growth in population is only about sixteen percent above that of 1913, yet facilities for manufacture have increased thirty percent, and a capacity for production exists which is beyond America’s ability to consume. There is an argument here also in behalf of higher wages and smaller profits. Unless the workers are paid good wages they cannot buy the surplus that can be produced.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark52"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark53"></a>Fewer Deaths by Automobiles</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">F</span><span class="font4">OR the first year since the automobile began . to claim its victims 1926 shows thus far fewer killed than in the previous year. The improvement is small but encouraging. The number killed is standing stationary at about 24,000 per year. Even this amount is a goodsized city in itself.</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">I</span><span class="font4">N THE battle for their daily bread in the state of Pennsylvania during the past ten years 24, 699 human beings lost their lives while at work, or suffered injuries which caused their death. In the same state, in the same period, there were 1,811,982 non-fatal accidents. These figures do not include domestic servants or agricultural workers.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">HDHE United States Government Sanitary sur-' vcy of the Coal Mines of Alabama discloses that eighty percent of the coal-mining towns of Alabama have no sidewalks, none have any sewers, less than half have improved streets. Mine-company houses have leaky 'roofs, bad floors and walls often papered with only newspapers. Methods of garbage handling are inadequate; the average town has no bathhouse ; tuberculosis among the workers is prevalant.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">TUST at present the Camden-Philadelphia ^ bridge has the longest span of any suspension bridge in the world. It is 1,750 feet between the towers, and in total length is 1. 82 miles. The cables, thirty inches in diameter, support the roadway 135 feet above the river. The width of the bridge is 125 feet. Its cost was $33, 000, 000. It was built in four and one-half years. The bridge is constructed so as to carry the load if packed solid with trolley cars, electric trains and automobiles. The bridge was formally opened July 4th, 1926.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">'PHILADELPHIA is advertising as one of her standard attractions this summer a very good air service to Washington. Ten planes are employed. The trip between the two cities, which lie 135 miles apart, is made in an hour and a half. The fare one way is $15; round trip $25. The planes carry mail as well as passengers.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">li/TRS. Cyrus H. McCormick, Jr., recently made the run from New York to Chicago, 908 miles, via the Pennsylvania Railroad, in what is said to be record time between the two cities, namely 16 hours, 55 minutes. For some time the Pennsylvania had a train which made the trip regularly in eighteen hours. The present time of the Broadway Limited is. twenty hours. Mrs. McCormick left New York at 5:48 p. m. and reached Chicago the next morning at 9:43. It is estimated that the cost of the special was ovex’ $7,000.</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">O</span><span class="font4">WING to the effective disfranchisement of southern Negroes and to the failure to make a reapportionment every ten years, called for by the Constitution, the curious fact is pointed out that whereas the city of Los Angeles, California, cast more votes for President in 1924 than Georgia, Alabama and Mississippi qombined, yet those southern states have thirty representatives in Congress while Los Angeles has two.</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">F</span><span class="font4">ARMERS are paying a large part of the expense for building roads that other people wear out before the bonds are paid. They are building union schoolhouses, which no doubt are nice to have but which boost taxes to points where the farmer cannot meet the conditions. In 1920 the mortgage indebtedness of the farmers of the country was $3,500,000,000, but today it is $12,250,000,000. It is claimed that the condition of the farmers throughout the country is much worse today than it was five years ago. In view of the prosperous condition of the country as a whole it must be very apparent that the farmer is not getting an adequate share of it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sub>:</sub></span></p>

<p><span class="font14">C</span><span class="font4">ARPHOLITE, said to be the excrement of extinct animals and worth great sums as fertilizer, has been discovered near San Antonio, Texas. The deposit, which is in the form of green sand, is said to be in a layer forty feet thick and covering at least 100 acres. It is said to run about twelve percent potash and twenty-seven percent iron oxide. Besides being a rich fertilizer, the carpholite is said to be an excellent water purifier.</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">W</span><span class="font4">HEN a stethoscope is applied to the hand, and the sound of clenching is amplified, the noise made is said to sound like the running of a tractor over a tin roof. The muscles of the arm and the wrist give forth a sound like a steam roller going into action, while the beating of the human heart sounds like the bell on a Big Ben alarm clock in its distinctness.</span></p>

The ascending smoke is forced through a tank of water which cleanses it of its dust content.</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">I</span><span class="font4">N THE Maine forests, near Machias, the work of turning beeches into rosewood and yellow birches into mahogany goes merrily on. The results are said to defy the detection of even expert lumbermen. The dyes, which are the invention of a German chemist, are said to dye a large tree completely in four days; and the results are permanent. The inventor claims that the dyes do not injure the trees. Any desired shade of color may be had. The work is being carried on under the direction of the University of Maine.</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">S</span><span class="font4">TRANGE as it may seem, one of the most nutritious of soups may be made from potato peelings, which have first been carefully cleaned of all blemishes. The peeling of the potato contains several of the mineral elements which the human body needs. These are lost when the potato is peeled. The best way to prepare potatoes is to bake them.</span></p>

Outside the churches neither priests nor nuns may wear religious garb. They may not acquire or administer property or - capital. They may not open new churches without permission from authorities. The pope wants Catholics everywhere to pray for a change of these orders of the Mexican government, which he alleges are “hypocritical forms of pretended legality”. He also objects to the enforcement of these orders, resulting, as they do, in frequent ejectment from the country of priests or nuns who have violated these laws. The penal code still permits prayers.</span></p>

Today it knows that the most powerful group of anarchists on earth is masquerading under the name of religion. In Mexico this group has deliberately tried to destroy all law and order by using its influence to bring the Mexican government to its knees. The manifesto of the anarchists openly declared that it sought to produce a complete paralysis of social and economic life so that the government may be compelled to submit to its demands. There are still wilder times ahead for Mexico, and the ecclesiastical anarchists are responsible.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Prof. Rhys Carpenter, head of the Department of Archaeology of Bryn Mawr College, near Philadelphia, Pa., was so fortunate as to ’discover about two years ago, on a lonely windswept island off the coast of Spain, the site of the Greek city of Hermoskopeion, the first Greek settlement in Spain.

Tradition told us that Rome was founded by twin brothers, Romulus and Remus, who, abandoned by their mother, were reared in babyhood by a she-wolf which had lost her own offspring. Along came science, which denied the possibility of this, and even questioned whether any such boys ever existed. But in digging deeply under the Emperor Domitian’s palace recently a number of clay tablets were found, sketched with a stylus, on one of which the outlines of Romulus and Remus being fed by a she-wolf were easily discernible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Rome, like Athens, is a treasure house for archaeologists, and it has been built within times sufficiently recent so that som^ of its ancient objects of interest still exist in a fair state of preservation. Part of the Tiber bridge which IToratius defended in the sixth century B. C. is still in use.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">But the center of archaeological interest in Italy is Pompeii, buried in 80 A. D. by a tremendous shower of black ashes belched forth from Vesuvius in the greatest eruption it has ever had. This came upon the city while it was in the heat of an election campaign, throbbing with life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At first the digging into these ruins was done by the old pick and shovel methods; but about ten years ago these gave way to the more tedious but much more valuable methods of Spinazzola, by which all articles, even the fibers of fabric, are uncovered and photographed while in position.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Pompeii was a bustling, up-to-date city. The ruins show that the merchants changed their signs frequently. The signs were in bright colors and of great variety. Huge quantities of election posters have been found. A public laundry had just been completed when it was overwhelmed with the ashes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A Roman soldier, on guard at the gates, was found standing at his post, just where he was placed before the rain of ashes began. In some places walls are frescoed with drawings and paintings which are in the highest degree indecent, showing the low moral condition of the people.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">What is supposed to have been an important archaeological find off the coasts of Esthonia in the Baltic Sea, consists of a quantity of seaweed-covered granite blocks. It is probable, however, that these are merely relics of the days of Peter the Great.

Probably some ship captain bound for that port found it necessary to throw some granite blocks overboard.</span></p>

Stealing was as favorite a pastime of the strong and the greedy in 926 as it is in 1926. But the bankers, the Vikings of today, use lawyers instead of rowboats to help them get away with their ill-gotten plunder. And nowadays an ordinary pile of coin does not satisfy them, either.

But the idea has spread, in some form, throughout the world; serpent worship being common in India and Africa. From Africa it was carried by the slaves to the West Indies and to America, where it features in the voodoo of the blacks and the pow-wows of the bedskins.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Every barber’s pole in our own day is a relio of this serpent worship. At one time the barbers were the surgeons. At length the surgeons set up in a separate business; but the barbers retained the symbol of their ancient deity, now conventionalized in the stripes about the pole. The modern barber probably does not know that he is the occupational descendant of the ancient medicine man. Among the Greeks serpents were cared for in all the temples of JEsculapius, thei god of medicine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The most perfect example of a Druidical temple yet discovered was recently made at Craigs-corry wood, two miles from Beauly, Scotland. Near the temple was found an airtight cyst in which was the body of a Druid warrior, recumbent, with the head pointing due east. When exposed to light and air the bones crumbled at once into dust. Important pre-Christian urns and other items of historical value have been uncovered also at Uriconium, near the River Severn, and near Stratford-on-Avon.</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">O</span><span class="font4">F STILL more recent settlement than Europe, America has relatively little of archaeological interest, although new discoveries are being constantly made regarding the Mound Builders, the Cliff Dwellers, the Aztecs, the Incas, the Mayas, and other races that preceded the red men; and occasionally something is found that is startling.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It has recently been definitely established that the gold which supplied both the Incas and the Aztecs with their enormous stores of the precious metal came from Colombia, from [whence it was transported by caravan south to Peru and north to Mexico. The route north has been traced all the way from Colombia to Mexico.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Midway on the route was the Maya civiliza-. lion. Its calendar ran for 1800 days, at the end of which time a pillar was erected upon which was inscribed the history of the period. Avenues of these pillars, carved from top to bottom, are now being studied. The oldest indicates the 'date of August 3rd, 613 B. C.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Pyramids are found at Teotihuacan and also at Cuernavaca, both near Mexico City, and are well known to tourists. These are probably imitations of the great pyramid at Ghizeh, the traditions of which were carried around to America from Asia by the Japan current route, when America was first settled. The art of embalming was practised by the first settlers of Argentine, which is another indication that they were familiar with Egyptian practices.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The largest cliff dwelling known is said to have been unearthed by the School of American Research of Santa Fe, New Mexico, at a point in the heart of the great southwestern desert. This dwelling is alleged to have contained 1,000 rooms and to have been four or five stories high.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It will be extremely interesting, shortly, when the men who built these ancient cities return from their long sleep and explain to us all the matters which are now so puzzling to the best archaeologists. History can then be reconstructed with precision.</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">S</span><span class="font4">AN FRANCISCO bay is second American port to New York in total value and tonnage of cargo, both foreign and domestic. New Orleans is the second American port to New York in foreign commerce alone, which sometimes leads to the misconception that it is second in total shipping. Seattle is second to New York in imports of foreign goods, and this often leads to a similar misconception. Los Angeles has a heavy tonnage movement, due to the bulk oil cargoes; but the value of commerce is quite low. For example, the total foreign tonnage of Los Angeles for 1925 amounted to 3,750,000 tons and was valued at $122,600,817, while the foreign tonnage of San Francisco for the same year amounted to 3,244,859 tons, valued at $386,417,765. Thus, although the foreign tonnage of Los Angeles slightly exceeds that of San Francisco, the value of the San Francisco tonnage is more than three times as great.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">San Francisco has a heavy coastwise and intercoastal commerce, amounting in 1925 to 24,801,3369 tons, valued at $1,248,947,346, and also a bay and river commerce for the same year of 9,918,000 tons, valued at $668,857,224. The total commerce of San Francisco, therefore, far exceeds that of Los Angeles, amounting in the aggregate to 37,964,228 tons, valued at $2,304,222,335, while the total for Los Angeles is 22, .444,000 tons, valued at $741,911,000.</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">I</span><span class="font4"> HAVE been enjoying The Golden Age ever since its introduction to the public and I scrutinize its statements. Allow me to comment on an item in your issue of June 2, 1926, No. 175, on page 553, under the heading, &quot;Principal Ports of the Nation.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Whoever was your informant as to the principal ports was evidently misinformed or biased in leaving out the traffic of the port of Duluth and Superior as one of the leading ports in the United States. I quote you from a publication prepared by the Chief Engineers of the IT. S. Army, which is prepared with great care in that the master or clerk of every vessel entering or departing from the Duluth-Superior harbor makes a report to the Engineers’ Office covering the name of the vessel, its net registered tonnage, whether light or loaded, and if loaded, what the cargo consists of. This is a requirement under the Act of Congress, approved February 21, 1891, and also of September 22, 1922.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the report for the calendar year 1925, it is shown that the total tonnage of freight received and shipped at the Duluth-Superior harbor aggregated 51,334,641. This shows more than double the amount of the tonnage given in your article for the port of New York. It is barely possible that New York, on account of being situated on the Atlantic coast and belonging to one<sup>!</sup> of the Great Districts of the United States, some of the coasting traffic is not included in the tonnage given for New York. •</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Concerning the values of the imports and exports at the port of Duluth and Superior for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1925, the imports aggregated a value of $1,948,241 and the exports aggregated a value of $64,150,826. These last figures are taken from the Collector of Customs’ report of transactions. The United States Engineers’ report showing the tonnage of the largest ports in the United States for the calendar year of 1925 lists the ports in the following order:</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">A</span><span class="font4">S THE unfortunate writer of the article </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“A</span><span class="font4"> Miniature British Empire in Mississippi”, published some months ago in The Golden Age, I would like to now correct some errors contained therein.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Some two months after this article appeared a Golden Age reader told me that there were some mistakes in my article. He stated that he had known the manager, Prof. Fox, of the Scott plantation for years and knew’ him to be a good man. I found also that this Prof. Fox had been a teacher whom I had known in my childhood, and who then seemed to be very kind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">My informant told me that the roads on these large plantations are posted for the protection of the Negro tenants, as agents would come in from outside and sell them things at exorbitant prices, sometimes taking mortgages on their furniture. As for the tenants slipping away at night if they desired to move, he said those who did this were some who moved on the farm in the late fall or winter, and were supplied from the landowner’s commissary for several months, and wished to leave without paying for the supplies they had obtained.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Beeson farm is owned by the same British company that owns Scott, but w<sup>v</sup>e did not know it when we canvassed there. The roads were posted just as on the other farm. So I asked a Negro to whom I sold some books: “What about these signs?” He looked pleased and said: “Oh, they don’t mean you; you go ahead.” We did well on that plantation. The tenants seemed to have plenty and to be contented.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As I wished to have the testimony of two or more witnesses before ’writing you, I waited to see what I could learn further. We-did not visit Scott again; so I had to glean my information from elsewhere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One day a Negro man stopped us and asked for a ride, and we had not gone far before he told us he worked at Scott. I questioned him about conditions there and he said: “They are good to us,” and confirmed the statements of the Golden Age reader above mentioned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Sometime later I met a Negro woman who was moving from Scott. I thought, “Surely something is wrong.” But when I enquired as. to why she was moving, she quickly responded “I am just tired farming and thought I’d </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">get. off</span><span class="font4"> the farm for this year. If they had not treated me good I sho wouldn’t stayed there nineteen years.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A few weeks ago our next-door neighbor, who is a painter, said to us: “I have been working at Scott some lately. They surely are good to those Negroes up there. Every one of them has an auto.” So I am of the opinion that the bad rumors about Scott were started by some who moved away in the night to keep from paying what they owed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A few days ago an overseer came to us on a plantation to see what we were doing. When I showed him our hooks he remembered buying । some from my husband about two weeks previous, and told us to go right ahead. He advised us, however, to let the overseers on the farms know what we were doing, as they might see our car and think we were selling the tenants something not good for them. We have met only two who seemed to prefer that we leave their premises.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This writing is not in defence of the injustice practised by some land owners; both land owners and tenants are too frequently unjust. We find great comfort in the fact, however, that the Just One will soon be known as the Landlord and Overseer of the whole earth.</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">P</span><span class="font4">ARENTS having children of their own have their hands full to provide for them. They are so compelled by the laws of God and man; and that, chiefly, is the cause for their concentration and attention, devotion and care over their own. It is the trick of nature. And it is from these immediate dealings with his ; own that springs what is apparently a selfish love.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One’s ownership of an object unconsciously (and properly) creates a special kind of love £or it. This rule applies to things inanimate as well.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jesus, of course, was childless. But He, by redemption, was the owner of all born and unborn people; therefore His position was justified.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Moreover, the same is true in other respects. Each one likes his (or her) clothing better than the other fellow’s. Why? Is it because it is selfish? Nay 1 And too, we like our styles today, regardless of how the restored people shall dress at the end of the millennium.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We might ask: If children are no blessing, why did the All-wise Creator give to man at the time of creation the power of procreation? Did He intend this as a curse upon the perfect human race? Reason would teach us that procreation is a part of the Almighty’s plan, and there is not a Bible student nor anyone else who has the authority to criticise this plan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">If children are a nuisance to some people then such have just that much to learn before they shall have become like their Master.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark150"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark151"></a>The Unfair Medium of Exchange </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">By Vaughn Bachman Brohaw</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">A</span><span class="font4">LLOW me to comment on a statement which appeared in your magazine some time ago. <sub>t</sub>You said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The demand that farmers and others receive fair prices for their products seems reasonable. But what is a fair price? When the supply of a product is liberal the public consumes more of it. Then the supply is reduced and prices rise. When the supply of a product is restricted the public avoids it. Then the supply is increased and prices fall. No earthly Solomon can decide today what will be a fair pr’Jee for anything six months hence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">That is true when we speak in terms of our present result unit of transfer. The fact is that we can’t have a truly fair price for anything in terms of a monetary unit, which is in itself a ■'decidedly unfair thing. Such a unit compels some huma.i&gt;s to take more human work than they give in return, thus compelling other humans to give more human work than they receive in return.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The only really fair price for a product is this: As much adult human work as has been stored in that product. That is, the fair price of work is </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">equivalent work</span><span class="font4"> in return. If we all ran our trade transactions on the basis of one hour of human adult work for one hour of adult human work, they would be perfectly fair transactions—supposing, of course, that they were entirely voluntary ones.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">To translate the giving of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">work for work</span><span class="font4"> into monetary terms, we must first make our monetary unit represent nothing but WORK. We can do that by making it represent nothing more or less than one hour of adult human labor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">I</span><span class="font4">N The Golden Age, No. 173, there appeared a short item on goats. I am sorry your correspondent left the impression that the goat is an unpleasant animal to have about. The fact is, there is not so much odor about the goat as there is about the sheep, except during breeding season (when some of the males perfume themselves ydth a musk). But the female could be kept iip anyone’s parlor, like the proverbial Irish pig.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is going to be with the goat as with a great many other things. “In that day,” of which the Bible speaks, people will be educated as to the goats and their value, both as providers of food and of raiment. Goat’s milk is better for infants and invalids than cow’s milk; it is more nearly like mother’s milk and is free from the germs of tuberculosis. Note what the wise man said in Proverbs 27,: 27 on this subject.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Becoming tired of the state’s sending some one around every year or two to fill my thoroughbred Holstein cattle with pus or poison, which they called a “test” to make the cattle “immune” or prove them free from tuberculosis, but which invariably left them in a weakened condition (one calf dying soon after the last “test” and another might as well have died), I decided to try raising milch goats instead. J have been so well pleased in every way with thd' goats that I have sold all my cattle except one cow; and when I can get a few more goats raised (good ones are hard to buy) I will dispose of her.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The goat has been called the poor man’s cow, and milch goats are getting to be in great demand. Their milk has about twice the amount of butter fat as does the cow’s milk. One farmer I know of sells his goat’s milk for forty cents per quart wholesale in Cleveland, 0. Cow’s milk should be put in the same class as white bread. I would like to see a whole page or more of an issue of The Golden Age devoted torthis wonderful animal. The facts on milch goats can be obtained from U. S.

Fess, of Blair, Nebraska, in a letter to the governor of that state, calls his attention to the fact that the official reports show that more than 82 percent of all tubercular cattle sent to the Omaha packing houses were passed for food after all the diseased organs and affected parts were removed. In his letter Dr. Fess said in part:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">1 would not have taken the time to inflict this long letter upon you had it only been a gigantic robbery, as it is; but when it comes to worse than first degree murder, then you will surely hear from, your humble servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The other side of the question, however, is given by Dr. George Starr White in his booK “The Natural Way”, in which he says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Healed tuberculous lesions can be found in nearly every human or other animal autopsy. It has never been proved that tuberculosis is transmissible from humans to animals or from animals to humans.

<p><span class="font14">T</span><span class="font4">HE colloidal hydroxide of aluminum is manufactured in the United States at Villa Park, Illinois. Other plants that make it are located at London, Paris, Budapest, Milan, Toronto, and Berne. I do not know how many other cities have such factories, but these plants are now furnishing the supply of metal aluminum to the world for stomach troubles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The aluminum ‘Works” in these various cities are turning out vast quantities of aluminum hydroxide, making it into a colloidal hydrate so that it can be prescribed in powder and tablet form by the physician.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Aluminum hydroxide is recommended as particularly useful in the treatment of chronic affections of the stomach, dyspepsias, gastric and duodenal ulcer, gastro-sucorrhea and in conditions, characterized by gastralgia, pyrosis, flatulence, acid eructation and other symptoms common to gastric disease.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">If the hydroxide of aluminum is a medicine worthy of the name, then it is made in nearly every home in our land. Aluminum cooking dishes produce such medicine every time they are used for cooking food. When we cook food a short time we get a small amount of the medicine, and the longer the cooking process continues a correspondingly greater amount of medicine is produced.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Acid or alkali foods will extract a greater quantity of the medicine in a given period of time than will other foods, but all foods extract it to some extent whenever aluminum utensils fire used for cooking purposes. Every person </span><span class="font6">ugs </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">By Dr. Chas. T. Betts</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">who eats food prepared and cooked in such dishes takes his medicine. It makes no difference if he wants it or not, if he is ill or if he is well, or whether he needs medicine or whether he does not; and furthermore he does not know how much of a dose he is taking.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">If foods are left standing in aluminum dishes after being cooked, the process of manufacturing the medicine goes right on. It passes over into the food as fast as it is made, so we may be sure to get enough. The Division of Health of the United States under the Treasury Department states that “the metal passes over into the food when aluminum is used as a cooking utensil”, and also cautions against letting food stand in such dishes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">So far as I have been able to learn, no prescription is necessary from a physician in order for the patient to get the medicine from the dinner dishes. But when the patient is already taking it by prescription from his doctor, there is no telling what quantity of the drug he is getting when he is also getting an additional amount from the cooking dishes. So the harm from an overdose may be of greater consequence than the benefits obtained. It is so difficult to learn what all we may be taking by prescription that very few people could know when they are getting hydroxide of aluminum both ways.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At the present time there are great numbers of people who do not believe in taking medicine. We have chiropractors, osteopaths, Christian Scientists, vegetarians, and countless others] but all these take medicine regularly every day if they eat food cooked in aluminum dishes, or food which has stood in such dishes after being cooked. These folks are being medicated just as surely as though they cut or chopped up chunks or slabs of aluminum metal and made medicine out of them to swallow; as is now being done and, I understand, is universally prescribed for certain stomach troubles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I am informed that most makers of automobiles have but one style of car with an aluminum body, on account of the scarcity of the metal, 'due to the vast quantities now being used for making medicine for stomach ills.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">But stomach troubles have increased enormously since the doctors have begun to prescribe aluminum for the afflicted, and if . the present increase continues I judge they will soon be using all the available supply of aluminum to make enough medicine for all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Then the eighty percent of baking powder sold in this country will have to be made of something else than aluminum for their “acidic content”; and we shall have to get along with fewer aluminum auto bodies—and we may have even to give up for medical purposes, whatever of the stuff we may be able to salvage from the scrap heap.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">(Reprinted from an editorial in the Boston </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Advertiser</span><span class="font2"> of May 15, 1926.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">I</span><span class="font4">N Pennsylvania jail a girl of fifteen who was about to become a mother became hysterical, screamed, rattled the barred door. To quiet her, tear gas bombs were thrown into her cell. She became still, very still; she Uied.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Officials—warden, deputy warden, coroner—&gt; are reported “not excited” by the occurrence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Efe' of one wayward child means little, perhaps. That she should be put to death by cold-blooded barbarism in this year of our Lord 1926 is a slap in the face of a Christian society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">I</span><span class="font4">N EVERY foreign country I think of the lines of the old hymn, “The heathen in his blindness bows down to wood and stone.” In every temple in Japan and India people were bowing down to images and paying money to priests. In the Christian cathedrals at Manila and at [Algiers, the people are bowing down to images and paying money to priests.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Buddhists make hundreds, even thousands, of Buddha images for one temple. The. people in India worship not only cows, but images of cows and of bulls. Credit must be given Mohammed for abolishing images of all kinds in the creed he made. The Mohammedan mosques have no images whatsoever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the Christian churches of Manila and of Algiers candles are being wasted a thousand at a time. I cannot see any difference between worshiping a god with Chinese punk and roast duck and worshipping a god with candles. It is time that the human race grew up from its childhood.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark26"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark161"></a>Jesus Never in India</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">A</span><span class="font4"> SUB SCRIBER, a prominent consulting engineer, sends us a clipping respecting a manuscript alleged to have been found in India, which states that Jesus left His parents at twelve years of age and went with merchants to India, where He spent the years until He was twenty-nine in the endeavor “to become perfected in the divine word and for the study of the laws of the Great Buddha”. It also states that He “preached to the Buddhists”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The gentleman who sent us the clipping says, “How well this whole article bears the stamp of Satan!” an observation with which we heartily agree. Did not Christ himself say, “I am not sent but to the lost sheep of the house of Israel”? Did He not say to the Samaritan woman, “Ye worship ye know not what, but we know what we worship”; and would not this have been tenfold more true of the heathen in India?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Moreover, the Scriptures say that after His experience in the temple at twelve years of age, Christ went back to Nazareth and was subject unto His parents. Further, He could not begin His ministry until He was thirty years of age, manhood under the Jewish law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Additionally, and most important of all, Jesus was not commissioned by the heavenly Father until the spirit descended upon Him at Jordan, the day that He was baptized. It was then and afterward, but not before, that II® could say, “The spirit of the Lord God is upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the meek.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">No doubt this seems to the Devil like a very clever scheme to get Christians to do the same as Jesus is supposed to have done, i. e., to “study the teachings of the Great Buddha”, hoping thereby to entrap some in the meshes of this form of demonism; but to us it looks like a clumsy attempt to do something which, as far as Bible Students are concerned, will never get even a start. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark162"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark163"></a>“Aryeh”!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">ROVE all things, hold fast that which is good.” So says St. Paul in 1 Thessalonians 5:21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In a recent article in The Goldex Age, by Henry Ancketill of South Africa under the caption “Language and the First Man,” it was suggested that Psalm 19:1-4 voices the sentiments of Adam’s heart as he “gazed enraptured at the heavens above him”. While J much admired the imaginative mind that penned that article, yet in the light of the canopy theory, I wonder if Adam ever saw the literal heavens at all.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Again, in respect to the poetry of the Hebrew language: It is doubtful if Adam ever spake Hebrew, which no doubt, was one of the languages that came as a result of the confusion of tongues at the “Tower of Babel”, after the flood. Although Abraham is spoken of as being a “Hebrew”, yet we know that he was from Chaldea and therefore undoubtedly spoke Arabian, or Assyrian. Isaiah 23:13 says: ‘The Chaldeans were not, until the Assyrians founded it for them that dwell in the wilderness.<sup>1 </sup>Leeser’s translation makes the rendition even more emphatic.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">[Radiocast from Watchtower WBBR on a wave length of 416.4 meters by Judge Rutherford.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">T</span><span class="font4">HIS station goes on the air tonight for the <sub>(</sub> first time on a wave of 416.4 meters. Because ' pf this change of wave length it is expected that the audience will be somewhat different in personnel. I have been asked to speak on the subject, ‘■‘'The Blessings fob the People During the Millennium”. My sympathies are always with the oppressed, and knowing that there is a better time near at hand I delight to tell the people about it in order that their burdens may be made lighter even now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This station, as you have heard, is operated chiefly by the International Bible Students Association. Some have wondered what is the I. B. S. A. and what is its purpose in operating radio stations. I am pleased to say that it is an association formed for the purpose of instructing the people in the Bible. Believing that the Bible states God’s plan for the redemption, comfort, encouragement and blessing of the people, this Association is directing their minds to that source of knowledge. Believing also that the radio is one of the God-given inventions at this time to disseminate the truth, the Association employs this and other radio stations to send out the message of truth for the consolation of mankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The . Association is not seeking members. It is not trying to get any one to join it. It is making no attempt to get money. It is financed by men and women who love God and who have the interest of their fellow men at heart. It may be pardoned for saying that its purposes and motive are wholly unselfish. The institutions of this world are usually organized for selfish purposes. We therefore may expect some opposition to any association that has only this one object in view; namely, to unselfishly aid the people, and that without asking them for money.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In order that the truth might shine forth in clear contrast with the error it becomes necessary from time to time to use plainness of speech. There is no desire to offend any one. This institution has no quarrel with any person. It must, however, tell the truth, even though the truth w’hen told may greatly offend some. The Association is no respecter of persons, be they Catholic or Protestant, Jew or Gentile, bond or free. Its desire is to do 1 unto all as opportunity may offer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Association is against the Devil because he is the arch enemy of man, the enemy of righteousness and the foe of God. He is employing all his agencies to keep the people in the dark.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This institution stands wholly and unreservedly for Jehovah God, and diligently strives to be a faithful and true witness for Him and His cause. It endeavors to honor God by proclaiming His praises.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This station invites its audience to cooperate with it in getting the message of truth to the people. You can cooperate by inviting your neighbors to sit with you and listen to the program. The religious lectures over this station are based wholly upon the Bible. As I attempt to explain to you on this, occasion the Millennium and the blessings it will bring to the people I hope you will take courage, be refreshed and rejoice. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* ;</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark165"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark166"></a>The Millennium</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">I</span><span class="font4">N the minds of the masses of the people there is a great misunderstanding concerning the Millennium. Some who claim to be teachers of the Word of God, and who should have known better, have either ignorantly or deliberately misrepresented the meaning of the Millennium. They have taught the people that it means some new and fantastic religion by which the minds of men are deceived. The real one who would love to blind the people concerning this, and who has desperately attempted so to do, is Satan, the “god of this world”. 'When we see the purpose and work of the Millennium we can see why Satan is so anxious to keep the people in ignorance of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Our English word “millennium” is derived from the Latin word </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">mills</span><span class="font4"> (meaning one thousand) and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">annus</span><span class="font4"> (a year). Therefore it means a period of time embracing one thousand years. Our English word millennium does not appear in our Bibles, but the period of time represented by that word is definitely and positively stated in the Scriptures. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There is no period of time mentioned in the Bible that is of greater importance to the people than that of the Millennium. The time has</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">now come for the people to understand its proper meaning that they may profit by such knowledge. For this reason many are inquiring : What is meant by the Millennium ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The plan of God concerning man reaches a climax during the Millennium. Briefly note some of the progressive steps of His great program :</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">God made a promise to Abraham, which promise He bound by His oath. In this premise He said to Abraham: “In thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed.” Hore Jehovah definitely settled the matter that He had fixed some time future, during which period of time He would offer to all the families of the earth blessings to those who would be obedient. Since the promise is that the blessing is to come through the “seed”, it is manifest that the “seed” must be first developed. And this God proceeded to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The development of this “seed” Jehovah foreshadowed by various types or pictures, in order that when learned the lessons might be understood by the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">God organized Israel into a nation and gave that nation a perfect code of laws. Among other things He provided for the keeping of certain rest days and years, and arranged that each fiftieth year should be a jubilee, during which year restoration must be made to all who had suffered loss. This was a picture by which He foreshadowed that the time would come, in the operation of His great plan, when He would restore to all the families of the earth that which they had lost, to all who would receive it according to His arrangements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">God promised that a great Ruler should come who should direct the affairs of the world, and that His reign would be in righteousness. Some Scriptural proof is here cited: “Behold, the day is coming, saith the Lord, that I will raise unto David a righteous Branch, and a King shall reign and prosper. ... In his day Judah shall be saved, and Israel shall dwell safely; and this is the name that Jehovah proclaimeth him, Our Righteousness.”—Jeremiah 23:5,6, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Young.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark167"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark168"></a>The Promise of God is Sure</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">T</span><span class="font4">HE promises of God are sure, and must be fulfilled. He promised to redeem mankind in order that, the curse being lifted, He could justly deal with the human race and give them the blessings promised. In due course He sent His beloved Son into the earth, who by His death and resurrection provided the redemptive price.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah then showed that the “seed of promise”, through which the blessings must come, is the Christ, meaning thereby that Jesus Christ is the Head and that the faithful followers of the Lord Jesus Christ should constitute the members of His body, and that all together constituted the “seed” of which God spoke to Abraham and through which the blessings must come.—Galatians 3: 8,16, 27-29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Even the birthplace of the Mighty One who should rule the earth, and under whose reign the blessings must come, was foretold by the prophet in the words: “But thou, Bethlehem Eph-ratah, though thou be little among the thousands of Judah, yet out of thee shall he come forth unto me that is to be ruler in Israel; whose goings forth have been of old, from everlasting.”—Micah 5:2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The prophetic promise of God was that this Mighty Ruler should sit upon His throne and dispense to the people divine blessings. “And speak unto him, saying, Thus speaketh the Lord of hosts, saying, Behold the man whose name is THE BRANCH: and he shall grow up out of his place, and he shall build the temple of the Lord: even he shall build the temple of the Lord; and he shall bear the glory, and shall sit and rule upon his throne; and he shall be a priest upon his throne: and the counsel of peace shall be between them both.”—Zechariah 6:12,13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The “both” here mentioned are Christ Jesus, the Great King, and His faithful followers. To those faithful followers, who overcame by refusing to yield to the Devil or his agencies, the Lord promised: “To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne.”—Revelation 3: 21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">These faithful ones who are here mentioned as overcomers are-the same souls or creatures that have been beheaded, figuratively speaking, by taking the Lord as their Head, and that havb acted as faithful witnesses for the Lord and His kingdom. Concerning them the Revelator saysi</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">&quot;And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given unto them: and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and for the word ,.of God, and which had not worshipped the beast, neither his image, neither had received his mark upon their foreheads, or in their hands; and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years.”—Revelation 20:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Thus the certainty of the period of time during which the King of glory and His church shall reign for the blessing of mankind, is shown; and the duration of that time is definitely fixed as a period of one thousand years, and for that reason called the Millennial reign of Messiah: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark169"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark170"></a>God’s Purpose in His Plan</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">T</span><span class="font4">HE Bible shows that Jehovah, in the carrying out of His great program, has divided His work into periods or epochs of time. Measuring according to that which is already definitely and clearly revealed, it is certain that the seventh thousand-year period was due to begin in 1875. We must not expect, however, everything to transpire at the beginning. The plan of God is progressive, and moves majestically and orderly to its completion. The first forty years of that period of time are known as “the day of his preparation” (Nahum 2:3); that is to say, the period of time during which the faithful followers of the Lord are being prepared and gathered together for His work. It has been within that period of time that Christians, seeking the truth, have left the various denominational systems that had bound them by fixed creeds, man-made, and have earnestly and diligently sought the plain teachings of the Lord’s Word of Truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The purpose of the Millennial reign of Christ is to undo all the, evil that Satan and his agencies have fastened upon the people during the past 6000 years. In the carrying out of this program, evil will be banished from the earth, righteousness shall come to stay, and the people will have proffered to them the things they have long desired; and those rendering themselves in obedience to the divine rules shall inherit the blessings which God has provided for those that love Him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Because of the prevalence of sin and its bane</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">ful </span><span class="font4">effects, the period of time from Eden to the Millennium is designated in the Scriptures as a great dark night. The Prophet Isaiah pictures a messenger of the Lord on watch during that night and another one propounding this question: “Watchman, what of the night?” And to this the watchman replies: “The morning cometh, and also the night,” Tf you will have more information come and ask again.’—Isaiah 21:11,12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Thus the Lord pictures in prophetic phrase some of His faithful truth-seekers watching for the evidences of the breaking dawn of the new day. These watchers have been rewarded by gradually seeing the light of the new order approaching; and as they have inquired for more light and information, they have received it. With the coming of this new era the people have begun to awaken out of darkness to their privileges.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It was in the year 1874 that the first labor organization was founded, looking to the relief of the laboring element from their oppressors. From that time forward there has been a great increase of knowledge and advancement for the betterment of mankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Although the wisdom of men today is no greater than it was one thousand years ago, yet the great increase of invention, labor-saving machinery, and- other devices has made a progress in the past few years that was never dreamed of before. As proof of this I here mention some of the great inventions and advancements made since 1874: Adding machines, aeroplanes, aluminum, antiseptic surgery, artificial dyes, automatic couplers, automobiles, barbed wire, bicycles, carborundum, cash registers, celluloid, correspondence schools, cream separators, Darkest Africa, disc plows, Divine Plan of the Ages, dynamite, electric railways, electric welding, escalators, fireless cookers, gas engines, harvesting machines, illuminating gas, induction motors, linotype, match machines, monotypes, motion pictures, North Pole, Panama Canal, Pasteurization, railway signals, Roentgen rays, shoe sewing-machines, smokeless powder, South Pole, submarines, radium, sky-scrapers, subways, talking machines, telephones, typewriters, vacuum cleaners, wireless telegraphy, and the radio broadcasting apparatus, by which now it is made possible to send the human voice around the earth.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><a name="bookmark171"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark172"></a>Wight of Trouble Present</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">GREEABLE to the prophetic words of the prophet, with the coming of the dawn of the new day there have also come increased darkness and suffering. It is a noticeable fact that just before the break of day it is often the 'darkest. In 1913 it was being said that war was no more possible. In 1914 the darkest warcloud the earth has ever seen hovered over the nations, from which burst forth the greatest 'death-dealing elements that have ever fallen upon men. Seven years have passed since the nations ceased to fight; and yet all the nations are in distress and perplexity, and there is gross darkness in the minds of the people because the leaders in religious thought deny the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">All these things are evidences of the beginning of the Millennium. The increased darkness is due to the fact that Satan, the god of this evil world, in his last desperate stand is trying to turn the minds of the people away from Jehovah and His plan. Satan is making a desperate effort to hold intact the kingdoms on the earth, which have long been ruling selfishly and by oppressive methods.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It was to this time the prophet referred when he wrote: “And in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom shall not be left to other people, but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand forever.”-—Daniel 2:44.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Now we see the kingdoms of this world being dashed to pieces. Many of the kings have already fallen, and others are tottering to their fall. Amongst these is Spain, one of the oldest kingdoms of the earth, with its government now in the hands of a dictator.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark173"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark174"></a>Satan Soon to be Bound</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">I</span><span class="font4">T IS difficult to find leaders in religious thought today who will explain the meaning of the Millennium or tell the people about it. The reason is given by the Apostle Paul; namely, that “the god of this world [Satan] hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, . . . should shine unto them.”—2 Cor. 4: 3, 4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">But soon Satan, the god of this world, will be restrained of his liberty; because this is one of the first works of the Millennium, after his empire has been dashed to pieces, as we read: “And I saw an angel come down from heaven, having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand. And he laid hold on th© dragon, that old serpent, which is the Devil, and Satan, and bound him a thousand years, and cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set a seal upon him, that he should deceive the nations no more.”—Rev. 20:1-3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Darkness, ignorance, superstition, and crime go hand in hand. Enlightenment, education along proper lines, life, peace, and happiness are the very opposite. Notwithstanding the fact that the twentieth century is known as the period of the greatest enlightenment, yet there are millions of people steeped in grossest ignorance; and crime and wickedness of the vilest sort are ever on the increase. The ignorance concerning God’s Word and His plan of salvation and blessing is appalling. Even the great majority of those who claim to be teachers of His Word are totally blinded with reference to God’s plan, the chief reason being that the evil one, Satan, has blinded their minds.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark175"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark176"></a>Light and Truth Dispel Darkness</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">O</span><span class="font4">NE of the greatest blessings that will come to the people early in the Millennium is a great increase of intelligence and enlightenment. The prophet describes the Lora’s appearing as the Sun of Righteousness with healing in His beams and declares that He will dispel darkness from the earth and illuminate the minds of the people. As they increase in intelligence they will begin to see God’s way of blessing them, and the mass of humanity will readily respond, and those who love wickedness and hate righteousness shall be eliminated from the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The people,will gradually learn that all the riches of understanding and blessing must and do proceed from God, and that these are ministered to them through the Saviour, our Lord Jesus Christ. This knowledge will continue to increase; “for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea.”—Isaiah 11: 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When the knowledge of the Lord has thus been disseminated amongst the people, then will come to pass the prophetic words uttered by Jeremiah: “And they shall teach no more every man his neighbor, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for they shall all know me, from the least of them unto the greatest of them, saith the Lord: for I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more.”—Jeremiah 31: 34.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Wars between nations and peoples have been due to their ignorance and superstition, induced by the wicked influence of Satan. When they learn that Christ Jesus, the great Prince of Peace, is reigning and that obedience to Him w<sup>7</sup>ill bring blessings to them, then “many nations shall come, and say, Come, and let us go up to the kingdom of the Lord, and to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths; for the law shall go forth of Zion, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem. And he shall judge among many people, and rebuke strong nations afar off; and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning-hooks: nation shall not lift up a sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.” -—Micah 4: 2, 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the present hour of darkness and sorrow on the earth, instead of trying to alleviate the sufferings of the poor, the rich and the mighty go on in their wicked way of profiteering. They own the lands and the houses, and the masses toil for a mere existence. The Millennial reign will bring about an exactly different condition from this; because Christ will reign in righteousness and break the power of the oppressor. Then they “shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig tree; and none shall make them afraid: for the mouth of the Lord of hosts hath spoken it”.—Micah 4: 4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“They shall build houses and inhabit them, and they shall plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them; they shall not build and another inhabit; they shall not plant, and another eat: for as the days of a tree are the days of my people, and mine elect shall long enjoy the work of their hands. They shall not labor in vain.”—Isaiah 65: 21-23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the reign of Satan as the god of the evil world, the proud and haughty have held the poor under; and concerning them the prophet says: “And now wrn call the proud happy; yea, they that work wickedness are set up; yea, they that tempt God are even delivered.” (Malachi 3:15) But during the reign of Christ “all the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly, shall be {destroyed as] stubble”.—Malachi 4:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In further corroboration of this, the Lord has declared that every one who will not be obedient to the great Messiah during His reign shall be destroyed with an everlasting destruction. He shall no more exist.—Acts 3:19, 23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Millennial Reign Will Bring Health</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19261006_files/g_E_19261006-10.png" alt="" style="width:16pt;height:18pt;">

<p><span class="font4">URING the dark night of sin, sickness has prevailed amongst the human family. Man has resorted to every known means to stay the ravaging hand of disease, but in his effort he has failed. During the Millennial reign of Christ disease and sickness shall be destroyed; because God has promised to bless the people with health and strength. Through His prophet the Lord says: “And the inhabitant shall not say, I am sick.” (Isaiah 33:24) Again, says the prophet of God: “Behold, I bring it health and cure; and I will cure them, and will reveal unto them the abundance of peace and truth.” (Jeremiah 33:6) Then will the drug stores cease to find any one to whom to sell their products. The doctors will no more find people upon whom to practise. But even the druggists and the doctors will rejoice because they themselves will be strong and healthy and glad to engage in some other vocation; probably they will till the soil and beautify their own homes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Not a day passes now without a funeral. Some loved one has died, leaving behind others to mourn his or her loss. God has promised to redeem man from death and to destroy death and the grave.—Hosea 13:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">. The Millennial reign of Christ will accomplish this very purpose. That which is desired above all things else is life everlasting in happiness. Death is the greatest enemy to man. The Millennial reign of Christ will bring life everlasting to all the obedient ones of the human race. A knowledge of this fact is essential to the people. Jesus said: “This is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.” (John 17: 3) Again says the Apostle Paul: “There is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus, who gave himself a ransom for all, ..to be testified in clue time.” And again he says: “This is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour; who will have all men, to be saved, and to come unto the [accurate, Gr.] knowledge of the truth.”—<sup>1 </sup>1 Timothy 2: 5, 6, 3,4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Thus we see that the knowledge of the Lord and of His arrangements, and obedience to that knowledge, are essential to life. For this reason Jehovah sent His beloved Son into the earth. Jesus declared that He came that the people might have life (John 10:10); that He might give himself a ransom for the people. (Matthew 20: 28) During the reign of Christ everyone will be brought to a knowledge of the truth, and every one will have an opportunity to receive the truth and be obedient to it. Life everlasting will depend upon one’s obedience to the Lord; because Jesus said: “Verily, verily, I say unto you, If a man keep my saying, he shall never see death.”—John 8:51.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Millennial reign has already begun. The powers of Satan are doomed, and soon the restoration blessings of man will begin. There are millions of people now living on earth who will witness the beginning of these restoration blessings. The apostle plainly states that during that reign the Lord will restore all things .concerning which all the holy prophets foretold. Each one of the prophets foretold the restoration of obedient men to human perfection. In view of the fact that we stand now at the very opening of this wonderful day, and that there are millions of people now on earth who will witness its beginning, we can appreciate the words of Jesus when He said r “Whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die.”—John 11: 26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The theory advanced by the so-called savants of our time that man is a creature of evolution, and that he will continue to evolve himself upwards until he comes to ' a perfect state, is sheer nonsense. Their theory is directly opposed to every part of the Word of God, and denies the Millennial reign, as well as the great ransom sacrifice.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">ONCERNING these so-called savants, or men who are wise in their own conceits,</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19261006_files/g_E_19261006-11.png" alt="" style="width:14pt;height:19pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font4">God’s prophet says: “The wisdom of their wise men shall perish, and the understanding of their prudent men shall be hid.”—Isa. 29:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">If these wise men would turn their minds to the Lord and would use their faculties now to teach the misguided people the truth, they could be a help to mankind. Again says God’s prophet : “Seek ye the Lord while he may be found; call ye upon him while he is near. Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let him return unto the Lord, and he will have mercy upon him: and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.” (Isaiah 55:6,7) “For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, saith the Lord. For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts.” (Isaiah 55: 8, 9) What a rebuke to the savants!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">God has promised the redemption and deliverance and blessing of mankind, and has appointed a day, namely, the Millennial reign of Christ, during which these blessings shall be fully enjoyed.—Acts 17: 31.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">These promises must be fulfilled. We are today standing at the very portals of the day that shall mark a complete fulfilment. So surely as the Lord has promised it, it shall come to pass, as He says: “For as the rain cometh down, and the snow, from heaven, and returneth not thither, but watereth the earth, and maketh it bring forth and bud, that it may give seed to the sowrnr, and bread to the eater; so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth: it shall not return unto me void; but it shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it.” —Isaiah 55:10,11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Neither will the world be destroyed, as some have foolishly said. God has declared that He made the earth for man’s habitation, that He created it not in vain, that the earth abideth forever. (Isaiah 45:12,18) He has promised that the earth shall be made glorious and a fit habitation for man, that it shall become as the garden of Eden (Ezekiel 36: 34, 36), and that this shall be accomplished during the reign of Christ. He plainly says that during that time streams of water shall break forth in the wilderness and desert places; and that these will cause the vegetation of the earth to grow and that earth will be made beautiful.—Isa. 35: 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Briefly summing up, the Millennial reign of Christ is at the door; yea, it is already begun. It will result in peace and prosperity, in life and happiness and joy to the people. It will mark a time when ‘weeds and thistles and thorns shall disappear, and when man shall till the soil and shall see it produce the beautiful flowers and the life-giving fruits. The climatic conditions will be changed for the betterment of mankind. Families long separated by death will be restored and united again. Each family of the obedient ones brought to a condition of life and happiness will dwell together in peace, prosperity and joy. They shall be afraid of neither sickness nor death. There will be nothing for them to fear; but having come into full harmony with God, they will with joy and happiness serve Him for evermore.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">’As an assurance that these will continue to abide in this state of happiness the Lord says: “I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts: and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people: and they shall not teach every man his neighbor, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for all shall know me, from the least to the greatest. For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more.”—Hebrews 8:10-12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">God has graciously brought to the attention of man, just at the opening of this wonderful age, many marvelous inventions. Amongst other things is the radio, by which means now the human voice is transmitted through space, even around the earth. In the early part of the reign of Christ the faithful prophets of old— Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and others—will be resurrected as perfect human beings, and made princes, or rulers in the earth. No longer will the people be left in doubt as to which political party to support. No longer will politicians juggle with the rights of the people. No longer will profiteers control the great political parties, and elect whom they may desire. No longer will false prophets and preachers misrepresent the Bible, and confuse the people as to what they shall believe. The Lord will speak to the people through the instrumentality of His earthly representatives.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The day, therefore, is not far distant when Abraham will stand on Mount Zion and, by means of the radio or even some more improved instrument, speak with authority; and his words will be heard by the peoples in every part of the earth. And as he speaks the message from the great Messiah, the King of kings and Lord of lords, all the people who hear and obey shall live and rejoice in the blessings that they have. Seeing,then, that we are at the very beginning of this wonderful time, with confidence it can be said: “Millions now living will never die.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is a precious privilege of man to tell this good news to his fellow creatures. If your heart has been made glad by hearing it, then tell it to some one else and make that one glad.</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">I</span><span class="font4">T IS a common thing for so-called scientists to do everything humanly possible to show their contempt for the Creator and for those who love and appreciate Him and who revere the works of His hands.

<p><span class="font4">The announced plans of these self-confessed atheists is to gather orang-outans, chimpanzees, gorillas and possibly gibbons, and to endeavor to hybridize these with humanity, the orang-outans with the yellow race, the gorilla with the black race and the chimpanzee with the white race.</span></p>

<p><a name="bookmark28"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark181"></a>A'Model Prayer</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">[Radiocast from Watchtower WBBR on a wave length of 416.4 meters hy Judge Rutherford.J</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">I</span><span class="font4">N THE examination of the subject this morning we learned from the Scriptures that prayer is the privilege of the child of God, that the Christian may pray to God in harmony with His Word with full confidence that his prayer will be answered. We also learned that the sinner may cry unto the Lord for mercy; and that the Lord will hear his petition and lead him to the point where he may have the opportunity to consecrate himself unto God, to the end that he may become the son of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">For a long period of time the Gentiles did not have the privilege of praying to God with the expectation of having their prayers answered. That privilege had been granted the Jews under their law covenant; and when Christ came this privilege was granted to all Jews who accepted Him. It was not until three and one-half years after the resurrection of our Lord that the way was open for Gentiles to be followers in the Master’s footsteps. It is written (Acts 10:1, 2): “There was a certain man in Caesarea, called Cornelius, a centurion of the band called the Italian band, a devout man, and one that feared God with all his house, which gave much alms to the people, and prayed to God alway.” Flere was a man who was devout; but the Lord waited' His own good time to hear his prayer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Lord then sent to Cornelius a- messenger who said (Acts 10:4): “Thy prayers and thine alms are come up for a memorial before God?’ Undoubtedly Cornelius had consecrated himself to God by agreeing to do Jehovah’s will and now the time had come when he should receive a blessing. The Lord God therefore sent Peter to him; and when Peter appeared before Cornelius it is written (Acts 10:34-36), “Then Peter opened his mouth, and said, Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons : but in every nation he that feareth him, and work-eth righteousness, is accepted with him. The word which God sent unto the children of Israel, preaching peace, by Jesus Christ: (he is Lord of all).” Then Peter proceeded to tell Cornelius of the divine plan, and Cornelius became a Christian. He was the first Gentile that had this privilege.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Since then every Gentile who has taken a similar course of seeking the Lord has found Him., provided of course his seeking was diligeni in honesty and in truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Now what is the proper method for, Christians to use in praying ? This answer should be found in the Scriptures and nowhere else. “And it came to pass, that as he was praying in a certain place, when he ceased, one of his disciples said unto him, Lord, teach us to pray, as John also taught his disciples.” Jesus answered (Matthew 6:9): “After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name.” It is observed that here lie directed that the prayer shall be addressed to Jehovah God, who shall be addressed as Father. This does not mean the fatherhood of God to all mankind nor the brotherhood of all men, as some men have foolishly taught. Jehovah God is the Father to only those who have been begotten of His spirit and this’ after a full consecration to do His will. These are the ones spoken of by St. Peter in 2 Peter 1:3, 4: “Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God, and of Jesus our Lord, according as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue; whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises; that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">They are the same ones mentioned by St. John (1 John 3:1, 2): “Behold what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God: therefore the world knoweth us not, because it knew him not. Beloved, now are we the sons of God; and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him: for we shall see him as he is.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Of necessity this rule of prayer excludes all those who are not sons of God. The prayer, after thus addressing Jehovah, acknowledges Flim as the great eternal God and that His name is sacred, that He is worthy to receive all praise and adoration. It shows great reverence on behalf of the Christian for the great Jehovah. There is nothing about it that would warrant one in the conclusion that the petitioner could irreverently rush into the presence of the Almighty. How different this from what we often hear some arrogant person publicly praying and telling God what He should do!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth as in heaven.” This expression means that the petitioner expresses himself in full harmony with God’s holy will, that he desires</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">' the coming of God’s kingdom, that this kingdom may rule in the earth to the end that the will </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font4">God might be done in the earth and that the will of God might be done in heaven. He recognizes the injustice, sickness and sorrow in the earth&gt; and that the kingdom of God is the only ■relief for this; and thus he expresses his humble sincere desire to see God’s will operating in all the others of earth instead of that which control selfish men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">’ It is not an uncommon thing to hear clergymen say that the present kingdoms of this earth are here by divine right and that therefore they represent God. This is directly' contrary to what Jesus said. When He stood before Pilate He said: “My kingdom is not of this world.” The reason why He said that was because for a long period of time Satan had been the god of this world. Jesus was teaching His disciples to keep their hearts in harmony with Himself and to patiently wait and pray for the time coming when the kingdom of God should be established and that the will of God should be 'done here. It expresses a hope that in God’s due time His kingdom will be established for the benefit of mankind. The presumption is that the one who thus prays seeks to ascertain the will of God by studying His Word and that from the Word of God he sees that in God’s due time Christ shall take charge of the affairs in earth, that He will bind Satan that he may deceive the nations no more, and that He will establish peace and righteousness amongst men that they may be brought back into harmony with God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This has really been the desire of the true and faithful Christian throughout the age. He has not been praying God to convert the world, because he knew from the Word of God that it was not God’s time to do this. He has been praying that God’s will and plan should be carried out; and He knew from God’s Word that His plan is to establish His kingdom amongst men. For this reason the true Christian is zealous in telling other people about that kingdom, that they might have a hope of relief from</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">present sufferings and for the blessings that would come through the ministration of that kingdom. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. ■ j</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Give us this day our daily bread.” This means both literal food and the things which are necessary to feed the mind. The Christian is a new creature in Christ. A creature consists of mind, will, heart and organism. The organism of the new creature is flesh and blood, like that of other men. This organism requires daily food for sustenance. It is entirely proper that he should request these things of the Father, because it is the will of God that we should ask and receive as He sees it is for our good. The Christian does not ask that he be given houses and lands and factories and great quantities of money, but he asks his Father to provide his daily needs. He asks in confidence, because Jehovah God has promised that His little ones shall not suffer for the things that are necessary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is therefore entirely proper for the child of God to daily ask his heavenly Father to provide for him food and raiment that may be necessary, to the end that he might serve the Lord. This of course implies that he will be thankful for what he does receive and that he will delight each day to express his thanksgiving both by word and by action. The child of God grows as he feeds his mind upon the precious things of the divine plan. He has a command from the Lord to be not conformed to this world but to be transformed by the renewing of the mind. (Romans 12:2) This means that the child of God will study the Bible, God’s Word; and that as he studies he will ask the heavenly Father to feed him upon the precious things thereof, that in due time he may have a vision or a clearer understanding of its great truths. Every true child of God has experienced this blessed privilege. As he studies the Lord’s Word, confidently trusting in Him, the Lord leads him into wider fields of understanding and fulfills to him His precious promises. “The path of the just, is as a shining light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day.”—Proverb 4:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Lord Jesus said concerning the new creature : “Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word of God.” (Luke 4: 4) The Christian therefore will properly be asking for the things needful for his development as a Christian in harmony with God’s will. Jesus then proceeds in the model prayer thus:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us.” This is a searching test for the Christian. If some one has done him an injury and he feels resentment and refuses to forgive such an one, he cannot conscientiously approach Jehovah God in prayer and ask to be forgiven. This teaches the Christian to be merciful and kind, and to look upon the afflictions of his fellow creature with sympathy and be willing to forgive whenever forgiveness is asked. If we are not willing to thus forgive, we cannot expect our Lord to forgive us. We have to come to the Lord for forgiveness frequently, acknowledging our shortcomings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">St. Peter asked Jesus ’how often he should forgive an offender, as it is written in Matthew 18:21,22: “Then came Peter to him, and said, Lord, how oft shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? till seven times ? Jesus saith unto him, I say not unto thee, Until seven times; but, Until seventy times seven.” This really means that we should never refuse to forgive an offender where that offender asks for forgiveness. Our Lord and Master stands as the Advocate of the Christian; and while this is no warrant for a Christian to do a wrong, if he does commit a wrong he has the privilege of going to God in prayer and asking help. (1 John 2:1, 2) He should cultivate the disposition of doing the same toward his fellow creatures. The prayer continues: ■</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.” God does not lead anyone into temptation. The King James version does not here give a clear rendering. Other translations read: “Abandon us not in temptation, but deliver us from the evil one.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We observe that when the Lord Jesus had made a consecration and had spent forty days in the mountain then, the Devil was permitted to tempt Him. (Luke 4:1-4) He was therefore put to a test as to whether or not He would prove His loyalty and faithfulness to God under the test. He withstood the test and proved His faithfulness. The Apostle Peter tells us in 1 Peter 2:21: “For even hereunto were ye called: because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps.” In corroboration of this St. Paul declares: “For whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth.” (Hebrews 12: 6, 7) Chastisement here means discipline or test. The test must come to each one, that he may have the opportunity to prove his faithfulness to God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Concerning those who are faithful under the test it is written in James 1:12: “Blessed is the man that endureth temptation: for when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath promised to them that love him.” God does not tempt any man, but He permits the test to be put before man. The Christian is to pray that the Lord God will not abandon him in that test but will sustain him, and he may have faith and confidence that the Lord will deliver him. This is really a time of temptation, temptation the apostle writes (Hebrews 4:14-Concerning the Christian’s privilege in time of 16): “Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession. For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin. Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The words in the above quotation, “For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever,” are not in the old manuscripts. These are an interpolation, and evidently this was done at the instigation of Satan to aid his emissaries to foist upon the people the thought that the kingdoms of this earth belong to God. It is inconsistent with the first part of the prayer: “Thy kingdom come.” The time has come, however, when the Lord is assuming His power and beginning His reign. Still it is proper for the Christian to continue this prayer until Satan is ousted completely and God’s will is done in the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The above is a model prayer, and outlines generally the things for which the Christian is privileged to pray. Other scriptures specifically name things for which a Christian may pray. For instance it is proper that he should pray for a greater measure of the holy spirit, as Jesus states in Luke 11:13: that is to say, he desires more and more to grow into the likeness of the Lord, that he may have greater powers of discernment of the divine plan and greater ability to perform his duties and obligations unto God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">j</span><span class="font4"> The Christian lacks wisdom. Wisdom means $he applying of knowledge according to the divine standard. It means the possession of a Sane mind, and the exercising of that mind in parmony with the divine will. Itps written in yames 1: 5, 6: “If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him. But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea, driven iWith the wind and tossed.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It would be useless for a man to ask for something if he did not try to cooperate with the Lord. God has said to him in substance: T have laid down in my Word specific rules. Search the Scriptures.’ Now if we try to search out these great truths in the Bible and try diligently to apply them and ask the Lord to help us apply । them according to His will, this He will do. If we are in doubt, then we are doubting the Lord; and a lack of faith is destructive to growth on the part of a Christian.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is prqper for us to pray for our brethren in Christ. The apostle says in Ephesians 6:18: “Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverence and supplication for all saints.” Satan the enemy tries to plant discord amongst the brethren. If we are praying for one another, then we are looking out for the interests of one another; and we thwart Satan in his wicked purposes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The apostle addresses the Christian in 1 Thessalonians 5:17: “Pray without ceasing.” Shall this be understood to mean that we are to pray all the time! It does not mean that we are to audibly utter prayer at all times, because we must engage in many other things. What it really means is the Christian’s whole life will be such that he is expressing himself with gratitude and thanksgiving in his daily walk, thanking God for what he has, and having in mind always his obligation to God and his dependence upon Him and requesting His continued favor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">David gave utterance to many model prayers. One of these is found recorded in Psalm 103: 2: “Bless the Lord, 0 my soul, and forget not all his benefits.” It is a happy thought with which to awake on every morning, as the light first dawns in our eyes, to thank the Lord God for all the benefits He has bestowed upon us. It is impossible for us to remember all of these benefits. The Lord would not have us forget them all; but if we remember the mercies and loving kindness that God has bestowed upon us, then it keeps us near unto the Lord and holds the Christian in sweet fellowship with God, and with Christ our Redeemer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The distinction between prayer and thanksgiving is that prayer is a petition asking a favor or benefit, whereas thanksgiving is expressing gratitude for what has already been received. An example of the latter is found in the words of David when he wrote (Psalm 18:1-3): “I will love thee, 0 Lord, my strength. The Lord is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer; my God, my strength, in whom I will trust; my buckler, and the horn of my salvation, and my high tower. I will call upon the Lord, who is worthy to be praised: so shall I be saved from mine enemies.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The more the Christian understands his privileges of prayer, the sweeter is that relationship between himself and his heavenly Father and the greater is his desire to withdraw to some quiet or secret place and commune with God in prayer. He does not wish to attempt to dictate to Jehovah what He should do nor even to assume such a thing; but he has a sincere desire to observe the admonition of the apostle who wrote: “Humble yourself therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time.”—1 Peter 5:6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Again we read (Romans 12:12): “Rejoicing in hope: patient in tribulation; continuing instant in prayer.” This precludes the thought that we must assume a sanctimonious air and stand before others and utter long prayers. Jesus says that prayers uttered in such manner are uttered for show.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Christian may be suddenly confronted with danger in a crowded street or in any other place; and it is his privilege to instantly lift his heart in prayer to God for protection. He does not have to go to a priest or preacher and have him do the praying for him. In fact, prayer is a personal privilege which belongs to the child of God; and the promise of the Lord is that this privilege shall be enjoyed at any and all times. Each Christian abiding in Christ may claim with confidence the prayer uttered by David in Psalm 17: 8: “Keep me as the apple of the eye ; hide me under the shadow of thy wings.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">With Issue Number 60 we began running Judge Itutherord’s new book, “The Harp of God”, with accompanying questions, taking place of both Advanced and Juvenile Bible Studies which have been hitherto published.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>653</sup> God made a covenant with the nation of Israel, by which covenant He promised to give life to all who would keep that covenant. (Leviticus 18:5) The Israelites, like others of Adam’s offspring, having been born sinners and imperfect, could not keep this covenant; therefore could not get life through it. The specific reasons are: (1) Because the ransom-sacrifice had not yet been given; (2) because of the imperfections of the human race and the imperfections of Moses the mediator of the covenant it yielded life to none of the nation of Israel. (Romans 8:3) There was a twofold purpose for this law covenant being made. One was, that it might serve as a schoolmaster to lead Israel to Christ (Galatians 3: 24); and the other, to foreshadow abetter or new law covenant arrangement which God would make through His beloved Son Christ Jesus. (Hebrews 10:1; 8: 5) Christ is the great high priest; and by His fulfilling the divine purposes, He is now the mediator of a better covenant, the new covenant, which God purposes to make for man’s benefit, (Hebrews 8: 6; 9:15) When the church is glorified and the kingdom set up, then the blood (merit) of Christ will be applied for the sealing of the new covenant, through which covenant promised blessings are to be extended to the human race.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>854</sup> After these days, then—after the gathering ri'of the Christ class or new creation—this covenant is to be made, as St. Paul states: “Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah; not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt; because they continued not in my covenant, and’ I regarded them not, saith the Lord. For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">after those days,</span><span class="font4"> saith the Lord; I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts; and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people; and they shall not teach every man his neighbor, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for all shall know me, from the least to the greatest. For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more.”—Hebrews 8: 8-12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>655</sup> Under this new covenant the whole human race shall have the opportunity to come back to God through Christ the mediator. Mark that it is plainly-stated that during the time of restoration God will put His laws into their minds, and write them in their hearts, and will be to them a God and they shall be to Him a people; for He will be merciful to them, and their sins and iniquities He will remember no more. This could mean nothing less than the taking away ofi the imperfections of the obedient and restoring them to a righteous condition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>550</sup> Following the glorification of the church and the making of the new covenant, Abraham<sup>1</sup>, Isaac, Jacob, David, Barak, Jepthse, and the prophets (all of whom we term faithful worthies), the Lord has promised shall be brought forth from the tomb, being given a better resurrection. (Hebrews 11) These shall be princes, rulers, or legal representatives of the Christ, in the earth; and through them the Lord will establish a righteous government in the earth. (Psalm 45:16; Isaiah 32:1) And then! “out of Zion [the Christ, invisible to men] shall go forth the law, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem”—the headquarters of Christ’s visible representatives.</span></p>

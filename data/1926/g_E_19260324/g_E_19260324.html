<h4><a name="bookmark31"></a><span class="font0"><a name="bookmark32"></a>Some Items on Archaeology</span></h4>
<p><span class="font12">A</span><span class="font7">T THE risk of inviting criticism from some of our readers who know more about this subject than we do, we venture the presentation of some data on archaeology which we believe will be of interest to many. The investigation of past civilizations is fascinating, but the current press comments on such subjects are often so sensational and misleading that in the effort to pick out the truth one is liable to go astray.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The true archasologist arrives at his conclusions slowly. Of interest to him are the remains of art, architecture, monuments, inscriptions, literature, language, implements, customs, traditions and anything that will throw light upon the past. Every archaeological &quot;find” is valuable and has some relation to every other such find and to the sum total of human knowledge, but its value cannot be appraised too easily or too quickly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The modern achievements in archaeology were largely based upon the discovery in 1799, near Rosetta, Egypt, of what is called the Rosetta Stone. For centuries scholars had been trying to decipher the hieroglyphics of Egypt but had been unable to master the alphabet. But on the Rosetta Stone, brought to light by one of Napoleon’s engineers while engaged in excavating the foundation for a fortification, was found a Greek translation of an hieroglyph which proved to be the key that unlocked the language and history of ancient Egypt. Hence we begin our archaeological story in Egypt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Finding of Tut-ankh-amen</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19260324_files/g_E_19260324-3.png" alt="" style="width:15pt;height:18pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">VERYBODY has heard of the finding of Tut-ankh-amen, the most celebrated archaeological item of recent years; perhaps more celebrated than really important. There is some reason to suspect that the annual publicity attending this matter for the past three years has had as its partial object the attracting of tourists to Egypt.,</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Egyptians of Tut-ankh-amen’s time were heathen, of course, and held to the heathen belief that every man has a second self, a </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Ka,</span><span class="font7"> or soul, or spirit, created within him, which at his death is free to wander at will. And because a Ka might continue to get hungry, and must have a place to live, the Egyptians of Tut-ankh-amen’s time embalmed some food for him and also put up some pictures of the dead at the entrance of the tomb, so that the Ka would not go wandering around over the earth and not know who he was or where he belonged.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">All this is very foolish, of course; almost as foolish as some of the immortal soul and hellfire prattle that our own ancestors of the dark ages and more recent times have amused themselves with; but in each case it was the best they knew. It merely illustrated the power of Satan and his friends to deceive and blind the minds of men—work in which they are adepts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Not to speak too lightly of what is strictly </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font7">grave subject, it is said on good authority that those who tasted some of the embalmed beef that had been laid in Tut’s tomb did not find it very palatable. It was in an excellent state of preservation, but neither the embalming fluid nor age had improved its flavor; and if Tut’s Ka enjoyed it he must have had a perverted appetite.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Shortly after the discovery of Tut’s tomb, one of the discoverers, Lord Carnarvon, died from an insect’s bite; and superstition was rife for a time, even among some scientists, that Tut’s Ka or ghost had gotten busy and finished him. Lord Carnarvon had been engaged in archaeological work in the Valley of the Kings for sixteen years before his death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It took three seasons to reach the body of King Tut who, by the way, was but a child when he died; and even before the body was found a dull silk season was turned into an exceedingly profitable one—Egyptian silks sud</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">denly becoming the </span><span class="font7">rage everywhere. When Tut’s solid gold burial case was finally reached it was found to be so heavy that it required eight men to lift it. Though uncovered months ago, it was not actually transported to the Museum at Cairo until late in January of this year. It is the most elaborate burial case known to archaeology.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font7">ear - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i . ,Z _</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">The wealth of bracelets, jewel-covered clothes and the contents of royal jewel chests sewed into the mummy’s clothing left the excavators and spectators blase as these objects were taken out hour after hour by the handful. It is said that any one of these articles would in the past have been regarded as the gem of any national collection. The mummy wore sandals of pure gold and had golden stalls on all the finger and toe nails. Gold stars were placed to mark the heart and lungs. King Tut was' a lad about fifteen years old at the time of his death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Hopes of a Future Life</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19260324_files/g_E_19260324-4.png" alt="" style="width:14pt;height:18pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">HE ancient Egyptians had a very real hope of a future life, and in it we can see some principles of truth even though most of it was error. They expected that at some future date the Ka or soul would return to the body and bring about a second life, this time everlasting. It was for this reason that they so carefully preserved the bodies of their dead, so that the Ka might have a place to come. The word mummy is derived from a w<sup>T</sup>ord meaning '‘pitch”, a substance much used today in the embalming of people of the middle class. In the middle ages pieces of mummy were used as medicine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Egyptians seemed to think either that </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font7">average Ka would forget much of what he once knew, or else that a Ka is not so bright as he ought to be; because it was the custom to place in the tomb with the mummy such playthings as miniature granaries, gardens, stables, breweries, slaughter houses, carpenter shops and other adjuncts of life. Perhaps this was </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">done </span><span class="font7">so that the restored man would have some patterns and tools at hand and know how to go about things when the time came to live again. Puppets were also buried with these articles, shown in the act of performing various household arts and duties in the fields and on the water; the idea evidently being that by study</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">ing </span><span class="font7">these the returned Ka could get a line on what he was expected to do in order to make a living.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Moreover, a Ka was supposed to need a little assistance in getting about on his spiritual journeys; hence, in at least one tomb there was found a sun ship, embellished with gold and jewels, in which a certain queen was expected to make her trips through the heavens. What a shock it will be to that lady Ka when some time she comes to look for her sun ship where it was left in the Egyptian sands, and finds that some inconsiderate soul has lugged it off to a museum, w’here perhaps she may have to pay a quarter to get even a look at it again I</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Leptis Magna, Carthage, Utica</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19260324_files/g_E_19260324-5.png" alt="" style="width:17pt;height:18pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">NOTHER recent and most interesting archaeological discovery in northern Africa was the uncovering, two years ago by Italian explorers and scientists, of the city of Leptis Magna, where it has lain buried beneath the sands and the waters of the Mediterranean for two thousand years. This city was the birthplace of the Roman emperor Septimius Severus, and at one time had 300,000 inhabitants..</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The city is, in places, forty to fifty feet beneath the sands, so that its recovery will take a long time; but enough has already been brought to light to reveal the fact that Leptis Magna was an imperial city of great distinction. Perhaps 200 pillars of the size of those in the Parthenon will be found intact. Some have already been uncovered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There are marble quays, a lighthouse, baths of marble and stone, and large pipes still intact which carried hot water to the steam rooms; also floors of decorated tile and flagstone, carved ornaments, statuary, stone settees, benches and tables galore.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The findings at Carthage suggest the thought that the Romans were justified in wiping out the city. This is not because the Carthaginians were the most luxurious people of antiquity, but because they were the most bloody and barbaric. No one specially resents the discoveries that the Carthaginians used rouge and face powder, lip sticks, pencils for darkening the eyebrows, bronze mirrors, perfumery, beads, hairpins, bracelets, necklaces, razors, spectacles and nail-scissors, also organs and infants’ hand-painted feeding bottles; for all these discoveries sound as though they might have been made in</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Boston or New York or Chicago or Los Angeles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But the thing that arouses the antipathy of mankind against the ancient Carthaginians is that they allowed themselves to be bulldozed by their priests into believing that they could escape eternal torture for themselves by torturing their children. The archaeologists have found hundreds of urns containing the remains of babies that were burned to death at the command of these pagan priests.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">More cruel even than the death by fire was the placing of the nuns or ‘'brides of the church” on luxurious cushions laid in the lap of Baal, after which the priests would depart, seal the great stone doors behind them, and then turn lions loose to roam the temple floor. The terror-stricken nuns could then either remain on the cushions and slowly starve to death or choose the quicker method of casting themselves to the hungry beasts below. In heathen customs like these originated the devilish doctrines of purgatory and hell fire which are taught even today.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The findings at Utica were much like those at Carthage, except that at Utica there was found a quantity of clay pipes which needed only stems to make them ready for use. Some of them were new, having never been used, while others had already been smoked, the interiors being blackened by fire. Utica was a center for the manufacture of pottery.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Recent Finds in Palestine</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">T</span><span class="font7">HE whole world is now being combed by archa;ological expeditions as never before. Among the places to which special attention is being given is Palestine, where every year and almost every month fresh proof as to the authenticity of the Bible is being added. In adjacent countries the name Abram has been found upon contract tablets of his time and in his old home town. On the walls of the temple of Karnak, Egypt, King Shishak, contemporary of Solomon’s son, Behoboam, recorded the names of the towns captured by him in Judah as told in the Bible.—1 Kings 14: 25, 26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In Palestine itself, at the eastern end of the valley of Jezreel, overlooking the valley of the Jordan, excavators have recently uncovered the House of Ashtaroth, mentioned in the Old Testament, the very building in which the victorious Philistines hung the armor of King Saul</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">after his death. The Biblical name of </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">the place </span><span class="font7">was Beth-Shan. Its present name is Beisan. Names of towns in Palestine have changed but little in 4,000 years. . &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Archaeologists succeeded in opening the </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">tomb </span><span class="font7">of Absalom about a year ago, and in doing so found another tomb which is believed to be that of King Jehoshaphat, but they were unable to continue their explorations because of the threatening attitude of the natives, who did not wish the tombs disturbed. Orthodox Jews spit at the tomb of Absalom when they pass it, in memory of his hateful treatment of his father David.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is claimed that evidence is now at hand that the time Mount Zion is Mount Ophel, in the southeastern part of Jerusalem, and that millions of Jews, Mohammedans and Christians have been turning their faces in the wrong direction. It is thought that the tombs of both David and Solomon may yet be found in this quarter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A recent discovery in Jerusalem was the burial place of Antiochus, first cousin of Herod the Great, probably one of the men charged with the slaughter of the babes at Bethlehem.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At present there are hundreds of workmen engaged in archaeological excavations in Palestine. Their work is often confined to a single location for months or years, because the ruins of one generation constituted the building materials of the next. It is claimed that in one place in Palestine there are evidences of about 150 thicknesses of relics of human habitation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Palestine was a favorite warring ground of Egyptians, Babylonians, Crusaders and Turks. The central point of these battles was the small transverse ridge cutting across the valleys and ranges and forming a natural barrier between Asia and Africa. This barrier was named by the Hebrews Megiddo, or Battle of the Mountain, and by the Greeks Armageddon, meaning the same thing. When General Allenby took Palestine away from the Turks, he did it by seizing this ridge. A literal battle of Armageddon was fought there in the summer of 1918. The fortresses which have crowned the heights of Armageddon are at present the subject of a five-year archaeological expedition financed by John D. Rockefeller and supervised by Prof. C. S. Fisher, formerly of the University af Pennsylvania, as field director.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Digging Up Abrahams Home Town .</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">TT IS now about twenty-five years since the</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">University of Pennsylvania began work in Mesopotamia. Years ago they located Abraham’s old town, Ur of the Chaldees, and even found his name on some of the tablets unearthed there. At present Ur’s Ziggurat or Tower of Babel is being unearthed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Every important town in Mesopotamia in Abraham's time had its city Avails and in the center of the city its Ziggurat, or staged tower, or Tower of Babel, to which the natives hoped to flee in case they saw the flood of Noah’s day returning. It should be remembered that Shem, the son of Noah, was contemporaneous with Abraham, in fact he outlived Abraham by twenty-three years; and the recollection of the devastation wrought by the flood would still be prominent in the minds of all. No doubt Noah was personally acquainted with Terah, the father of Abraham, as they lived contemporaneously for 128 years. Noah, in fact, died only two years before Abraham was born.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The account in Genesis, where it says of the builders of the towers of Babel that “they had brick for stone and slime had they for mortar”, agrees with the facts. There is no stone in Mesopotamia, The use of brick is universal. The men of Abraham’s time were familiar with and made use of the principle of the bricklayer’s arch. They also had ruled ledgers for keeping accounts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At Kish, once the capital of Mesopotamia, was found the oldest known pen. It is a bone six inches long, with a triangular section and pared ends. After a little practice, one of the archg'oiogists was able to use it in making cuneiform inscriptions on clay with considerable rapidity. One find of special value was an ancient museum, supposed to have been the property of the daughter of the last king of Babylon. She did not know when she gathered together the materials for her museum how interesting they would he for people living twenty-live hundred years after.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is said that one hall of the palace of the kings of Kish was 700 feet long. A stairway was found which is believed to be the oldest in existence. In an adjoining room the decorations consisted of inlaid slate panels, shorving the habits and customs of the people. They employed the arts of writing, metallurgy, glazing, engraving and brickmaking. There are traces here and there of an elaborate irrigation system.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The ruins of this palace cover a ground area of about three acres. It is one of the most mag-nificant specimens of architecture that has yet been excavated in any land. When we read of the work done by the ancients we find ourselves wondering how our friends who hold to the evolution theory explain the existence of these ruins. But perhaps our friends do not know of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Elsewhere in Asia Minor</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">O</span><span class="font7">NE of the most interesting of recent archeological discoveries is the finding of records of the Hittites, several times mentioned in the Bible but at one time thought by some scholars to have been an insignificant people. They are now known to have been a mighty race. From the study of the cuneiform characters engraved by ancient scribes on the clay tablets which formed the official archives of that nation, their language has now been recovered. The recovery of the Hittite language revealed the common origin of the Sanscrit of India, the Persian, Greek, Teutonic, Latin, Celtic, Slavic and other tongues. Eleven thousand Hittite tablets have been recovered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A hundred years ago the ancient city of Troy ■was a myth. Now the city has been dug to its foundations. References to the siege of Troy have been found in the eleven thousand Hittite tablets above mentioned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It was an American archaeologist who excavated the ancient city of Sardis. Among the more than two thousand objects excavated were coins of Croesus, minted 600 B. C. The whole American find has been stolen and shipped away. Antique shops in various parts of the world are being watched for their appearance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At Ephesus has been found the tomb of St. Luke, and here also St. John is said to have been buried. Scientists are now hunting in Ephesus to see what can be recovered that will throw light upon the Amazons who ruled the city hundreds of years before Alexander the Great was born. The temple of Diana, in Ephesus, designed by the architect Dinocrates, was 400 feet long, 200 feet wide, with 128 pillars each 60 feet high. It required 120 years to build that temple. Though destroyed by the Goths in 262 A. D., parts of it are still in existence.</span></p>

Sometimes as many as three hundred uninvited young men have found their way into some of the parties given by New York’s financial high steppers. The latest practice is to check them up at the door. If not on the list they do not get in. Another trouble, experienced mainly in Florida, is that there are so many crooks this season that it is not safe to wear real jewels; so the society ladies have been compelled to wear glass imitations.</span></p>

She wanted her former master to see all of her wonderful family and swam the Rhine back and forth, with a puppy in her mouth each time. This so touched the new owner that he gave the dog and her family back to the original owner. The dog was so exhausted at the end of the thirteenth crossing that it was necessary to administer stimuWts to resuscitate her.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">rpiIE thing that happens when there is a so-called materialization of a dead person is that the demon who has the medium under his control draws out of the medium’s body a quantity of living cells, in much the same way that a rubber band is stretched out; and the medium temporarily loses weight as a ’ consequence. With this material, called ectoplasm, the demon fashions the bodies which appear; but in point of fact these bodies are always connected with the medium and are really part of her life. The whole exhibition of materialization is so repulsive that it is seldom done except in the dark or in dimly-lighted apartments. The power is altogether the power of demons, or devils, as the Scriptures commonly call them. Conan Doyle is authority for the statement that these ectoplasmic emanations from the bodies of mediums may and do go about a full-sized room, while the medium herself remains unconscious.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">I</span><span class="font7">N YOUR issue of The Golden Age dated</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">February 11th, 1925, pages 292,293, under the caption, “Teaching the Young Idea How to Shoot,” you make the following statements:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the Appalachian, mountains, covering parts of Virginia, West Virginia, North Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Tennessee and Kentucky, are about 5,000,000 native-born Americans, the descendants of English, Scotch, and Irish pioneers, who are now’ illiterates. It was poverty that drove them to this condition. In some counties in Kentucky there are people who have never seen a railroad; and in Bound, Caney Creek and Knott counties only ten years ago there were no schools at all. This condition is being gradually corrected, however.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Golden Age has evidently been misinformed with reference to the counties mentioned, and I feel sure it will be glad to correct the erroneous impression given its readers by the above quotation. The writer is not ashamed to confess that he is a native of the region referred to and frequently visits it. He can, therefore, speak with authority on the subject.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In the first place, permit me to say that there is no Caney Creek </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">county</span><span class="font7"> in the State. There is a. community which goes by that name in Morgan county, and the people there enjoyed the advantage of common schools and newspapers more than thirty years ago. Many of the leading citizens in that neighborhood are graduates of Hazel Green Academy; and the people, on the whole, are well-informed. I visited that part of the state recently and delivered Bible lectures, and incidentally inquired with reference to this matter, and received assurances along this line which I consider reliable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As to Rowmn county, misspelled in your article “Round” county, I know from personal knowledge that the Morehead Normal School, Morehead, Rowan Co., Ky., was in existence twenty-five years ago. I quote from a letter to the writer from the President of that institution:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The school with which I am now connected was made, about one year ago, by the State Legislature, into a State Normal School and about half a million dollars appropriated for buildings, etc. The old Morehead Normal was a church school conducted by the Disciples of Christ, and was founded in 1887 by Mrs. P. E. Button and her son through the liberality of Colonel AV. T. Withers, of Lexington, Kentucky. For the last thirty years there have been in Rowan county about fifty common schools. At the present time the number is fifty-four. The public school in the town of Morehead has a building which cost about $30,000, and has about four hundred pupils, including high school.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Secretary of the Board of Regents of the Morehead Normal is Judge A. IV. Young, whose brother, Judge William A. Young, ranked high as one of the leading legal lights of the country for three decades. And he was reared and educated in Morehead. I knew him personally, and feel that this should be taken as good proof of the efficiency of our educational methods in the mountains.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">With reference to Knott county, I wish to say that the Hindman Settlement-School, Hindman, Knott County, Kentucky, was founded twenty-three years ago; and the number of pupils has increased every year, until they number today about 325 in the grades and 100 in the high school, not to mention the twenty or thirty in kindergarten.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">For more than twenty years boys and girls from the town and country round about have been studying the same books as the boys and girls beyond the mountain barrier. During this period they have come in and enrolled from remote “branches” where there were no schools, to stay in the Settlement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Today the effect of this work can be seen all over the mountain districts. The girls have studied home-making with their other studies, and they could teach the city flapper a thing- or two about cooking and other household duties. The boys have had manual training and practical farming along with their regular courses, and today when one travels through the hills, no insignificant part of the scenery are the pretty bungalows which dot the hillsides, owned and lived in by many of the students.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Graduates of the Hindman School can be found at Berea, State University, Center, Science Hill, Richmond, Exeter and Harvard. Many of them are teaching in country schools and raising the standard of education throughout the mountains.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">Miss May Stone of Louisville, and Miss Katherine Petitt, who has since founded Pine Mountain School, started the Hindman School twenty-three years ago. At that time there was a school there which was in charge of a Prof. Clark. Later he opened another school for older boys and girls, which was finally burnt and not rebuilt. There are other schools growing up in the vicinity of Hindman, founded on the same plan: one on Carr Creek and one at St. Nicholas. The Hindman School is incorporated, and is endorsed by the National Information Bureau, Inc., New York City.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Some of the illiteracy which you mention is of course voluntary, and those who prefer ignorance to enlightenment often cast reflection on the intelligence of others. The missionary will photograph the ignorant and imbecile and exhibit such pictures as representative of the whole people, which is utterly false and misleading. Thus the exception is taken for the rule in many cases, where the missionary represents the natives as peculiar in dress, custom, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is manifestly unfair for one to select a family which is mentally below par and hold it up to the gaze of the world as a fair sample of the community in which that family happens to reside; yet this is frequently done. It would be about as accurate for me to say that the city of Washington is insane because it has a St. Elizabeth’s.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A missionary met a young mountaineer lad riding a corv along the public road “just for fun”, and she straightway went home and spread the report that the mountain people ride cows! She mentioned the boy and his novel mode of conveyance, but overlooked the horseback riders, the run-abouts, the Fords. Studebakers and Chevrolets!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is my belief that there are few persons of normal intellect in the mountains who could not educate themselves if they so desired. Of course, the desire for an education must be strong-enough to outweigh all opposing thoughts and overcome them before one can hope to make progress, and this would apply to anyone regardless of environment or advantages. The inherently lazy will not study. The proverb is often heard in the mountains, “You can lead a hc-rse to water, but you can’t make Iris drink”; and it is likewise true that we can lead one to the Pierian springs of knowledge and such can refuse to partake.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Advantages of the Mountaineers</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">HP HE average mountain boy or girl of today ■*- enjoys much more advantage than Abraham Lincoln did, and lie was a Kentucky mountaineer by birth. He spent the formative, </span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">im</span><span class="font7">pressionable period, of his life in the mountains; and from this point of view, was a Kentuckian and a mountaineer. But he wanted education, and he got it. Every other mountaineer has the same privilege, and better opportunities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The present governor of Kentucky, William J. Fields, whom I know personally, is a native of Carter county, a mountain section in every sense of the word. And doubtless the governor, like the writer, has split rails, husked corn, and done everything else that Lincoln did, except run a flatboat, and neither feels that he has been contaminated thereby.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Even Christ was born in a manger. Let us have done with the idea that one is inferior merely because he grew up out of the soil, for the natural product is always better than the artificial.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Many of the young mountain folks have now caught the modern spirit of progress and are being despised by the less ambitious because of their superior attainments. Their “inferiority complex” is aroused, and consequently they have become haters of all progress and enlightenment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Such delight in mouthing the expression that “education is ruining the world”, because it has overthrown some of the old superstitions and uprooted false ideals and theories of life. Their provincial views are endangered thereby and threatened with destruction, and they deeply resent it. But some surrender after more mature reflection, and join the other camp.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Of course, there is often a physical or mental cause for illiteracy. Many who are unambitious and unprogressive fall into this category. Hookworm spells failure for thousands. Lack of sex education brings both physical, mental and moral ruin upon other thousands. A campaign of education in this direction alone would bring most gratifying results. But there is a crying-need for this kind of enlightemnent everywhere, and the danger referred to is one which besets </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">all </span><span class="font7">children </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">arriving at the </span><span class="font7">age of puberty, </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font7">is not confined to any one section alone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Poverty has been a factor in the equation, but it is incorrect to say that “it was poverty that drove them to this condition”. Poverty is rather an incentive to progress. It was so in Lincoln’s case, and it has been true in thousands of other cases.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The sons of rich parents seldom contribute anything of real value to the world’s progress. It is a well known fact that the higher institutions of learning are often frequented by such, chiefly for the social and business advantages accruing therefrom. They have become social clubs for rich young men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The mountain people on the whole, I would say, get more real enjoyment out of life than the average city dweller. They lead a more wholesome life in almost every sense. They breathe purer air, eat better food, get an abundance of outdoor exercise, and many of them live in cleaner and better homes than millions of metropolitan tenement dwellers enjoy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Almost every mountain family owns one or more horses, or an auto. They raise their own foodstuffs, meats, etc., and send the surplus to market, thus swelling their bank account. Oil, coal and gas development has brought wealth and comfort to thousands of mountain folk, and has given employment to other thousands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Take the matter of the healthful and pleasurable sport of horseback riding: How many whitecollar workers in our large cities </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">can afford a </span><span class="font7">horse? Few, if any. The expense would </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">be pro</span><span class="font7">hibitive in most cases. And how many city workers are at liberty to take a week off from their labors any time they may choose? The mountaineer and his family, as a rule, work whenever they feel like it, and rest when they desire to do so. Luxury of this kind is simply unknown among the masses generally; in fact it is unattainable under present commercial conditions. In this respect alone, the mountain folks enjoy a priceless advantage over the average city dweller.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The fact is, there is too much public sympathy wasted on the “ignorant mountaineer”. The ones who really need the sympathy are locked up in mines, factories, sweatshops and other industrial hells of “civilization”, where they eke out a bare and thoroughly miserable existence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Let the mountain missionaries forget their false “religion” and devote their energies to ameliorating the condition of the industrial slaves of the big cities; and when this is done, if there is any time left, they might then try to help the “poor mountaineer”. Big business will serve a better purpose if it will turn its attention to benefitting its own workers, instead of shedding crocodile tears over a liberty-loving, , contented and prosperous country people whom meanwhile it steadily seeks to devour.</span></p>

<h5><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font10"><a name="bookmark37"></a>From a Subscriber in Hongkong</span></h5>
<p><span class="font12">S</span><span class="font7">HORTLY before the Prince of Wales reached here on his Far Eastern tour to Japan, we had </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font7">seamen’s strike, which lasted about two months. It </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">grew</span><span class="font7"> to such an enormous extent that every Chinese employe—clerks, office-boys, servants, laborers, plumbers, litters, engineers, tram, bus and motor drivers, scavengers, sanitary coolies, rickshaw runners, both private and public—went out on strike, leaving the European population to shift for themselves. Markets and shops were closed down or run by volunteers. Hotels and restaurants were serving meals cafeteria style.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">You cannot imagine the inconvenience and -discomfort all this brought to Europeans. We had to shop, cook, wash and wash-up, scavenge, run blisses and cars, patrol the streets by day and night, keep the electric plant going, run the ferries, slaughter, milk the cattle, run the dairy farms and markets; all this in addition to carrying on business as usual where necessary. There were oyer 150 steamers, all oceangoing vessels, heldmp in port. A special launch toured the harbor, supplying cooked meals daily to the European engineers and officers on board each ship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The population of Hongkong is only one percent European; the Chinese population numbers three-quarters of a million. Had the government of Hongkong been firm and held out for only one week longer the Chinese strikers would have given in and not enforced their demands of nearly one-third increase in wages and the restoration of all the Chinese labor guilds that were disbanded by the government during the strike. But owing to the fact that the Prince of Wales was due to arrive shortly, the home authorities gave in to all the Chinese demands, and great was the general jubilation of the strikers over what they considered to be their victory over the British rule.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The news spread like wildfire throughout China, and now after three years we are faced with a general boycott of the British and British goods in China. The general hardship of the masses since the overthrow of the Mancha dynasty and the great war, the whole country being torn and rent asunder by marauding bandits and military generals, has been erroneously and maliciously attributed to the presence of the foreigner in China.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">With no settled form of government any-</span></p>

<div>
<p><span class="font7">where in China, it was an easy matter for a handful of students to start the fire of hatred towards all foreigners and the British in particular, over a very small matter in a Japanese cotton mill in Shanghai. This discontent, fanned to a flame of hatred, began in Shanghai and, fed by an undercurrent of Bolshevism or Socialism propagated by Russians, has quickly spread throughout the whole of China. Hongkong too has been caught in the vortex of this storm, and another general strike now exists here. The majority of foreign missionaries throughout China have had to vacate their stations, and numbers have returned to America via Hongkong. No doubt you have heard of this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The feeling of hatred ran very high in Canton, the southern capital of China; so much so that all the foreigners, especially the British, with the exception of a few Russians flying the Soviet flag and a few Germans wearing certain armlets and flying the old German flag, were expelled and ordered to leave the city.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It was on the 23rd of June, 1925, that a great procession of Chinese guilds and students, followed by cadets, volunteers and soldiers carrying rifles and fixed bayonets and loaded chambers, marched through Canton and along the Bund, past the French and British Settlement of Shameen. Shameen is a small island in the river, and is separated from the city of Canton by a narrow creek spanned by only two bridges, the new French bridge of reinforced concrete and the old British wooden bridge. When these Chinese cadets and armed soldiers were opposite the British bridge, two rifle shots were fired at the British Consul-General, Mr. Jameson who, with the Naval Commander, was standing near the British bridge watching the procession. This was a signal for all the armed party to open fire on Shameen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As if obeying a word of command they all turned to the left and faced Shameen, then leveling their rifles they commenced firing. The Consul and others, who were unarmed observers on Shameen, had no other alternative but to duck down under cover or to run for shelter. A French merchant, M. Pasquir, was killed and the Commissioner of Customs, Mr. Edwards, was wounded, before the British marines could reply.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Cantonese were quite unaware that there was an armed squad on Shameen. They had</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">hoped to rush the bridge and take Shameen, and they had an army of 4,000 soldiers waiting not far away to come up later and help them wipe out the foreigners. But when the British marines began to play machine guns over them they were all routed. Still some more daring ones carried on snipe-shooting from the roofs of buildings and from behind pillars on </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font7">Canton side until their ammunition </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">was ex</span><span class="font7">pended or until they fell when their hidden position was discovered by the British marines </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">on </span><span class="font7">Shameen.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark25"></a><span class="font10"><a name="bookmark38"></a>Impressions of the Province of Quebec </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">By Gerald Barry</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7">TT IS said that first impressions last the longest. While this may not be invariably true, it is certainly a fact that the distinctive traits and peculiarities of a people are more quickly noticed by a stranger than by one.who has been accustomed to them all his life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The French Canadian people of the Province of Quebec possess many lovable traits, and as the writer has spent the past year amongst them in their principal cities, Quebec, Montreal, Hull, Three Rivers, Sorel, St. Hyacinthe and Sherbrooke, as well as visiting them in some of their country places, the purpose of this article is to record briefly the impressions he has gained of them whilst living among them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The city of Quebec is an old-fashioned place in many respects. It is divided into the upper town, built high up on the rock extending towards the Plains of Abraham on the south, and in which live almost all of the Englishspeaking population of the city, and the lower town, which lies at the foot of the Rock of Quebec on the north side, and is almost exclusively French.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Power of the Pope</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19260324_files/g_E_19260324-18.png" alt="" style="width:14pt;height:18pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">HE Roman Catholic Church has a great hold upon the people of the city of Quebec, as it has also upon the people throughout the whole Province. While residing in Quebec the writer witnessed one of the spectacular processions of the Roman Catholic Church. Planks were placed against the curb on either side of the streets down which the procession was to pass, to which were nailed evergreen trees, about five or six feet high; and the houses also were decorated with flags suitable to the occasion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At the head of the procession walked a young man bearing a large crucifix; he was followed by altar boys and, shortly afterwards, by a number of priests. A little further along in the procession came a company of “zouaves” (soldiers of the pope); following them came </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">two </span><span class="font7">young men scattering flowers on the road, and two others walking backward who carried censers containing incense which they waved in front of the pope’s representative, who followed them, walking underneath a large canopy which was supported at the corners by four poles borne by the hands of four men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The pope's representative carried the holy sacrament, which was contained in a fan-shaped receptacle and which he held in front of his face. Behind him came a number of gentlemen with top hats, and many other gentlemen, ladies and young folks, all dressed in their Sunday best, which ended the procession.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This surely furnishes the key to the reason why the Province of Quebec has not progressed equally with the other parts of Canada; the Church of Rome, with its perpetuation of ancient superstitions, has been the retarding factor. When the yoke of the Church of Rome has been lifted from the shoulders of the- French Canadians they will surely make wonderful progress in every direction, for they are a bright and intelligent people. Their faces generally reveal character, intelligence, and decision; when educated, they possess the ability to reason logically and deeply, and to make quick decisions; but they need the stabilizing influence of the Word of God and a knowledge of His great divine plan of the ages. Thank God that the day is dawning when all mankind, from the least of them unto the greatest of them, will know Him as a God of love.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Montreal</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">M</span><span class="font7">ONTREAL, with its population of nearly </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font7">million, is one of the great cities of the world. It is not simply one big city, but consists of a group of cognate municipalities—West-mount, Verdun, Montreal West, Montreal East, Outremont, etc.—all of which go to make ujj Greater Montreal, somewhat on the order of </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Greater New </span><span class="font7">York. A large cross has been, </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">erected on the </span><span class="font7">top of Mount Royal, facing the city, which is lit up by electricity at night and which, it is claimed, can be seen from any part of the island.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Montreal has the reputation of being a wicked city. It has an extensive &quot;red light” district, and there is a great deal of open wickedness and vice. An investigation has been going on before'Justice Coderre recently, and a judicial inquiry into the city police administration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Montreal and Quebec are the two ports mainly used in summer by the Atlantic steamship lines between Canada and Great Britain and Europe. Approached on an Atlantic liner at dusk, when all the lights of the city suddenly come into view as the vessel rounds the bend in the St. Lawrence river, Quebec is a most magnificent sight. Just before reaching the city, one sees on the north side of the St. Lawrence the celebrated Montmorency Falls.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Ail through the Province of Quebec, in the railway stations, post offices and other public buildings, all notices are printed in both English and French; and in the cities and along the lines of travel many of the people can speak both languages, though in the country places very little English is heard, especially among the old folks. It is quite interesting to sometimes hear young children speaking fluently in both languages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There is a considerable Jewish population in the city of Montreal. The Jews seem to be a qniet and orderly class of people, and manifest, a noticeable lack of that spirit of bad temper and violence which is so often exhibited by the sons of Japheth. Doubtless their long period of chastisement at the hand of the Lord has mellowed their national characteristics and made them more meek and submissive, and thus has prepared them for the great blessings that are shortly to come to them through Christ’s kingdom.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark39"></a><span class="font10"><a name="bookmark40"></a>Sea Gulls in Colorado </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">By J. A. Boknet</span></h5>
<p><span class="font12">E</span><span class="font7">IGHT miles out from the town of Greeley (named after Horace Greeley, who said, &quot;Go west, young man, go west”) there lives a family named Farr, on a half section of farm' land including a lake of thirty acres. The chief croppage thereabouts are sugar beets, beans and alfalfa, together with stock raising. The land is quite level and abounds in China pheasants and magpies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">During August, 1925, there appeared throughout that section of Colorado grasshoppers in such, vast numbers that the entire croppage on the FaiT farm was threatened with destruction, and there seemed to&gt; be no remedy or means of relief from the grasshopper scourged</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Farr family are members of the International Bible Students Association. They prayed earnestly for grace to bear the affliction and for relief therefrom as might best please the Lord. They prayed not in vain: for suddenly there appeared over the Farr ranch, from some unknown quarter, thousands and thousands of seagulls, until the sky was darkened by their numbers in flight.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">These birds settled upon the fields of the ranch and feasted on the hordes of grasshoppers and then resorted to the lake nearby, only to return to the fields and continue to eat grasshoppers; until at the end of two weeks there was scarcely a. grasshopper to be found on the place. The gulls visited some portions of adjacent ranches, but not to any great extent. No one seemed to know from whence those gulls came, nor whither they went after their two weeks’ visit. The crops were saved and the. Farr family greatly rejoiced. Mr. Farr forbade people disturbing the birds either in the fields or on the lake as long as they remained. ■ The Farr family regards the gull visit as of divine providence. Never has there been such an occurrence in that district before. There is no water suitable for sea-gulls within a thousand miles of Colorado. What- then is the reasonable explanation for the strange visit of these sea birds by thousands upon thousands to this distant inland section just as that time? Who can answer?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">[Similar and equally opportune visits of sea-gulls have been made to crop-threatened fields in Utah. Nevertheless, we think the foregoing visitation of gulls was in answer to prayer. Perhaps it was so in Utah. —Ed.] &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">Negative Gravitation</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">N</span><span class="font7">OTHING that is good is impossible. The wildest dreams of yesterday are more than fulfilled today. And so, with the reader’s permission, I will now give free rein to fancy and indulge in the wild flights of fantasy concerning the possibilities of tomorrow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">I am not a scientist, and it is to be expected that certain readers will present objections to many of my statements. But many “impossible” things have eventually become possible. Certainly all obstacles to progress will be overcome with time. The Creator has blessings in store for mankind above what we can ask or even think; and all the things herein dreamed of may yet become a beneficent reality.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">I have intended writing this fantasy ever since reading Prof. Hartshorn’s reverie in The Got.twn Arm, No. 138, concerning the extraction of nitrogen from the air, which I believe will some day bo accomplished somewhat along the lines he suggests. But the wreck of the Shenandoah was the immediate cause of my writing what follows.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">To begin with, there is one inconsistency in the Hartshorn article referred to, which should be noted. The statement is made that an airplane might fly up to a height sufficient to let the earth turn beneath it, so that one might rise at Boston in the morning and come down in China for supper. With an airplane or helicopter such as he suggests this is impossible even with the present density of the air; and with the extraction of nitrogen therefrom it would be still more unthinkable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Our atmosphere is composed of gases, all of which have weight of varying densities. The lighter gases are driven higher by the heavier ones. Nevertheless, all are pulled toward the earth by gravitation. The weight of the gases above tends to pack the gases below, which gives the air at the surface of the earth a greater density.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The weight of a column of air at sea-level amounts to approximately 14.7 pounds to the square inch. As you rise the atmosphere becomes rarer and the weight or pressure less. For example, the pressure at three miles is a little more than one-half what it is at sea-level; at six miles, one-fourth; at nine miles, oneeighth; at fifteen miles, one-thirtieth; while at thirty-five miles it is calculated to be only one-thirty thousandth,</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">By M. J. Adams</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">An airplane can only go as high as the lifting power (density) of the air and the speed and power of the motor will permit. Similarly, a dirigible can only rise to the point where the weight of the dirigible does not exceed the weight of the air which it displaces. This point is called “the ceiling”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A dirigible can throw off ballast and go higher as a result of its decreased weight, but there is an inevitable “ceiling' above; which it cannot go. And as the atmosphere, at such comparatively low altitudes, is held tightly to the earth and therefore revolves with the planet, the machine will travel with the earth even though it might, as the helicopter, remain stationary relative to the air about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We are, of course, discussing the matter from the standpoint of the present composition of our atmosphere, which is eighty percent nitrogen. If this nitrogen is extracted from the air and fixed in the soil in the form of nitrates, as Prof. Hartshorn suggests, the weight or pressure of air at sea-level would be reduced to about three pounds per square inch, and tin; height to which airplanes and dirigibles could rise would be reduced accordingly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This would make the air at the surface much rarer, but breathing would not be laborious at high altitudes as at present, since the air would be almost pure oxygen and would give a lightness and exhilaration to life not now known. As the extraction of nitrogen will be gradual, the human body will have ample time to adjust itself to the new conditions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This will result in many changes, such as a different boiling and freezing point of all liquids, new scale barometers, etc. One special benefit will be in the increased ease of obtaining a condition of partial or total vacuum, so necessary in scientific work. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">A.</span><span class="font7"> complete vacuum under present conditions has never been attained.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">However, Prof. Hartshorn had the right idea about rising and letting the earth move beneath us. 'Where is there any sense anyhow in trying to outrun the earth, spending all our energy going west when the earth is going east and will do our traveling for us ? But his mistake was in the means to be used to elevate us. That power is </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">negative gravitation.</span><span class="font7"> But I am getting ahead of my story.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Years ago I read Jules Verne’s “'Trip to the Moon”, wherein a projectile, with several oe-</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">cupants, was shot at the moon hut missed it and returned to the earth and fell into the ocean. But a little thought will show the futility of this method of inter-planetary transportation. If a force could be generated sufficient to propel a vehicle with occupants toward Mars so as to get them beyond the point where the earth’s attraction was greater than that of Mars, then the vehicle would fall toward Mars with ever-increasing velocity and land with a smash which would be fatal, even if the occupants had not already been killed by the initial “shot” that started them on their journey. Furthermore, friction with the gaseous envelope which surrounds each planet would doubtless reduce them to a cinder, as is the case with meteorites coming into contact with our earth’s atmosphere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It may, of course, be argued that the gravitational attraction of Mars is less than that of the earth, since Mars is smaller; but falling from a height of a few million miles even on Mars would make a terrific impact. If we should assume that an object might be accurately projected toward a smaller object such as the moon, with such a nicety that all of the force would be spent just as it passed from the attraction of the earth to that of the moon, and that it would fall to the moon lightly as a result of the moon’s slight attraction, yet we must admit that a return trip from the moon to the earth would be out of the question by any such means of conveyance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">I firmly believe that after the thousand-year reign of Christ is completed and the approved ones of earth are manifest, interplanetary transportation will be possible, but not by explosive force. Instead of a disastrously sudden takeoff, then a slowing up in interplanetary space, followed by a disastrous fall at destination, the reverse is what is desired—slow speeds when leaving and approaching planets and extremely rapid speeds in space. This ideal condition can be obtained only with </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">negative gravitation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The fact that everything on earth falls to the ground has, of course, been known ever since man has existed—some 6053 years. But only recently, comparatively speaking, did Newton discover that the law governing it applied to the whole universe. Every atom of matter exerts an attractive force on every other atom of matter, which varies directly as to mass and inversely as the square of the distance between </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This discovery by Newton brought up the question as to why the earth and other planets of our system do not fall into the sun. This led to the recognition of that counter force, centrifugal motion, as applied to planetary systems. Had the planets been given a purely circular orbit, the sun’s attraction would have converted their course into spirals and they would have ultimately landed in old Sol’s lap.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But the planets travel in ellipses, with the sun in one of the foci; hence a planet falls for half of its orbit, whips around the sun at its maximum speed, and then climbs away for the remainder of its period, only to fall again and repeat the cycle—the centrifugal motion at its perihelion, or near point, keeping it ever a<sup>A</sup>vay from the sun.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Whenever the gravitational force is greater than the centrifugal, consolidation of matter occurs. Occasionally our sun captures a comet; and as ' such comets from time to time pass through the atmospheres of the planets, some of their matter is lost in the form of meteors, etc. This occurring in all planetary systems and operating for ages might eventually result in a gradual consolidation of all matter in the universe, were it not for </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">negative gravitation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Gravitation is attraction. It is closely allied with, if not the same as, magnetism. Now a magnet has a positive and a negative pole. Like poles repel and unlike poles attract, and the force of the repulsion is equal to-the force of the attraction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The earth is a great magnet and man has never been able to generate a force sufficient to overcome its mighty pull. Yet there is a negative or repelling force in magnetism. So should there be in gravitation. But where is such a powerful agency to be found? Only recently has it been discovered, and as yet it is unharnessed. In fact, nowhere have I seen it analyzed or defined. The name “Negative Gravitation”, as applied to this repelling force, is my own.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Let us first theorize as to the nature of this negative force. As gravitation (positive) is a tendency of matter to draw<sup>7</sup> together, so the negative force would be a tendency of matter to fly apart. This newly found force has been indefinitely called “radiant energy”, or “radio-activity”, but nobody knows just what it consists of.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Scientists for many years had marveled that the sun can continually throw off such enormous amounts of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">energy</span><span class="font7"> without being rapidly consumed through combustion of its elements. But it is now known that very little of the sun’s heat is due to crude combustion. Practically all of it is “radiant energy”, due to the breaking up of its atoms and the tendency of the positive and negative electrons to fly apart in all directions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As a gram of radium can throw off enormous amounts of energy for two thousand years and then only be half consumed, one can begin to realize that the sun which is throwing off energy only from its surface atoms, will last a long time yet; but not forever. Our sun is yellow, which indicates middle-age. White suns are young, red ones old.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">While gravitation tends to an ultimate consolidation of all matter, the negative force (radiation) tends to disintegration, resulting in a perpetual balance of the universe throughout, the ages. Truly a wonderful being is our Creator!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">With the unlocking of the atom, upon which problem scientists are now working with a measure of progress, will come wonderful things from the use of negative gravitation. Let us consider a few interesting possibilities. Yes, I know I am still dreaming; but remember, the dreams of yesterday are the realities of today.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Future Travel (?)</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19260324_files/g_E_19260324-19.png" alt="" style="width:12pt;height:19pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">INCE the earth rotates from west to east, making one complete revolution every twenty-four hours, it is apparent that if you could rise above the earth and stand still (pushing yourself from the planet instead of being shot from it by an explosion or rising by air density as at present), within twelve hours you could come down at a point on the earth’s surface directly opposite where you started.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But suppose you wished to go north or south? The earth has both a north and a south magnetic pole. Like poles repel and unlike attract. If man succeeds in devising a way to control the attractive and repulsive forces of magnetism, then one force may pull you north and the other south, even as the earth’s motion may carry you east or west. With a little practice man might combine the two motions and make a “bee line” for any desired destination. Therefore, it may ultimately become possible to go anywhere on the earth’s surface within twenty-four hours. But this is only one future possibility.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">You will probably notice that western travel apparently would have an advantage over eastern travel, as it would take only one hour to go fifteen degrees west, whereas in order to go fifteen degrees east you would have to wait until the earth had made almost a complete revolution under you, or twenty-three hours. And this, too, is reckoning without considering our own momentum or “inertia” as it is called, which at the equator (surface) would be about a thousand miles per hour eastward under present conditions. This eastward momentum would now practically nullify the westward drift; hence it would be necessary to overcome our momentum in some manner.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Of course you might go north or south to either of the poles and then slip back on the proper longitude. Or by rising to a great height and drifting in a circle of greater circumference, your relative eastward momentum in degrees of longitude would be lessened and your westward drift more pronounced. This is, of course, assuming that you, with your oxygen bag for breathing, have risen above the earth’s atmosphere and its friction, and that your weight is still slightly positive. If your weight were negative you would fly off the earth entirely. Man must be careful with his use of negative gravitation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But let us consider for a moment this matter of weight, for therein lies the solution to the problem of future transportation. Weight is merely the attraction of the earth, the downward pull of gravity. It is greatest at the surface of the earth, where the entire mass of the earth pulls toward its center.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In a deep mine, you weigh slightly less than at the surface, as the mass of earth above you counteracts in part the pull of the mass from beneath. On a high mountain you also weigh slightly less than at sea level. This is because you are then farther away from the general mass of the earth. On Mars you would weigh less than on the earth, because Mars is a somewhat smaller planet. On the moon you would weigh much less, and on the asteroids (some of which are only a few miles in diameter) you would weigh practically nothing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Now assume that you are standing on the earth and holding a 100-pound weight. Then suppose that by means of negative gravitation you should neutralize this to the extent that your combined weight is reduced to only one pound. Now if you should turn loose the 100-pound weight your own weight would then be negative, and you would rise above the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The amount of momentum attained by a body depends upon both its mass and its rate of motion. Friction is also involved. The dense air at the surface because of its weight, revolves with the earth. But as ypu rise higher into the helium and hydrogen strata the atomic weight or mass becomes less, and the gravitational attraction is also less on account of the distance; hence the upper gases would tend by reason of friction to lag behind and form a spiral, especially at the equator, where the rotational speed of the planet is greatest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Therefore, by negative gravitation you would not only lose weight, you would also lose your eastward momentum or inertia and wmuld follow the spiral course of the lighter gases as you rise. By then regulating your weight you could, after reaching the place in the spiral directly over the point where you wish to visit, simply descend at your destination in much less than twenty-four hours, regardless of its direction from your starting point. When ready to alight, you may simply turn off the current and drop like a shot for a while, then let yourself down easy when nearing the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">No Accidents Then</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">M</span><span class="font7">ANY have wondered how accidents would be avoided during Christ’s kingdom, since we are told that nothing shall then hurt or destroy. Most accidents are due to gravitation and its effects. Falling from aeroplanes (including the negative gravity type—the heavier-than-air machines will then be obsolete), etc., may be avoided by an individual negative gravity device.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Scientists tell us that there is enough atomic energy in a finger-nail to propel a battleship. The people of the future may carry a little of this energy around with them, and if they fall down an elevator shaft they can let themselves down easy. Then they can turn on a little more and go back up. The day may not be far distant when anybody can instantly reduce his weight at will, making it equal to that of the air about him, so that he can float like a feather if he prefers. No danger of falling down stairs </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">them</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Another source of accidents is collision. But if two autos with occupants each suddenly reduced their weight to only a few ounces above atmospheric pressure when approaching each other, they would bound apart like toy balloons and no one would be hurt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Another way would be for all autos or landtraveling vehicles to be magnetically charged so that they would actually repel each other when in danger of colliding. Such a safety device might be made to work automatically.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Friction, the cause of wear and tear of machinery, may be reduced to nil in the future by means of negative gravitation. With machinery weighing nothing there could be no wear and tear, and machines would last forever; besides, less power would be needed for propulsion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Take our present heavy locomotives. They must necessarily weigh many tons in order to get traction enough to start a heavy train. But with negative gravitation invoked a child could push a whole trainload of cars with one hand. A car weighing 100,000 pounds gross could have 99,999 pounds negative force applied and thus reduce its net weight to one pound. Of course, it would be necessary to caution all concerned to-shut off the negative power before unloading; otherwise as soon as a few pounds are taken out somebody would have to go up and get the car and bring it back to earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In this day of cash and carry, what a. blessing it would be to have the weight of our parcels nullified. Sweat of face came as a result of the curse, and it is going when the curse is fully removed. And articles then will not have to be made ’weaker to get lightness; they could actually have a greater tensile strength than at present. The Shenandoah could have used the stronger steel needed for its framework and yet have no weight at all. It could, in fact, have slipped above the storm and not needed any additional bracing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In the happy ages of the future physical beings may be able to take inter-planetary, .interstellar, and even inter-universal journeys (if we apply the word “universe” to our own galaxy as distinguished from other known galaxies far removed from our own). It will doubtless take man a thousand years or more to get well acquainted with this earth. Then he may wish to visit the other members of the solar system, relatively close to home. Some may not be habitable for many thousands of years but others may have life upon them now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Such journeys, even at the speed attainable through negative gravitation, may take a considerable period of time: and, of course, supplies of oxygen, food, heat, etc., would have to be provided. This may not be an insurmountable difficulty. It is in inter-stellar travel that incomprehensibly vast distances would be involved; and it may appear that man, thougluen-joying eternal life, would surely starve on any such journey which might require centuries to make. But here our future scientists employing forces now unknown to us may, under guidance of the Creator of all things, solve the matter in short order. It may take a million years for some of these accomplishments, but what is that to beings perennially young? They will have eternity before them, with no need for hurry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As each star radiates energy it loses a part of its mass. Some are losing weight more rapidly than others. Astronomers tell us that every star is moving either toward us or from us. Therefore in the millions of years yet future, when our Sun gradually grows smaller through, radiation, it will, together with its planetary system, be gradually pulled toward some larger sun with its satellites. When the earth gets close enough, men may then flit across the intervening space and make tours of some now most distant twinkier. Certainly there will be enough surprises in store for man, so that life will not become monotonous in the long ages of eternity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Some stars are binary; that is, they consist of two suns revolving around each other. The variable star Algol, has a dark companion which 1ms apparently about burned out. Some distant day this earth may be in another solar family, with perhaps two suns to obey, and sharing another cycle of movement toward still more distant scenes in space. Eternity is a long time, and much can happen within its folds.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">Right Foods R?/ </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Two Colporteur Lassies (England')</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">T</span><span class="font7">IIIS is written in praise of an article which appeared in your valuable magazine not long ago, entitled “Right Foods”. We now laugh at all advertisements about reducing fat, getting rid of nerves, fatigue and other disorder and abnormality.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We have been following Mr. Stewart’s advice, beginning every meal with </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">fruit</span><span class="font7"> and then proceeding with vegetables and the more solid foods. In consequence, when we have had a drink and some prunes or figs we want nothing further for breakfast, and arc ready to do a good morning’s out-door work until 12: 30 p. rn. We walk, cycle, carry books and canvass, advertising the coming kingdom of righteousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">An apple or a large tomato, a date sandwich and a small cheese sandwich make an excellent lunch; and fruits, vegetables, nuts, fish, egg or milk products will furnish a satisfying supper.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We now rejoice in an absence of that hungry feeling, and enjoy a freshness of mind and body that we did not previously experience. We heartily recommend to those of your readers who wish to make the most of themselves that they reread carefully the whole article above referred to, and give its suggestions a month’s trial.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Strong tea, white flour products, manufactured sugar and fat meats have now become positively distasteful. We fem warmer on a breakfast of stewed prunes than we formerly did on a dish of eggs and bacon. We wish Tub Golden- Age the success it deserves, and we were never more thankful for an article on health, than for the one we here refer to. It is I grand not to longer fear coarse skin, body <sup>1 </sup>odors, obesity, nasal catarrh and bad colds, as heretofore.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We would like to add that our cost of living lias increased but very, very slightly with our alteration in diet; and that is more than counterbalanced by the saving in medicines and in doctor’s bills.

<h5><a name="bookmark41"></a><span class="font10"><a name="bookmark42"></a>Salesmanship as a Civilizer </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">By M. C. Harbeck</span></h5>
<p><span class="font12">H</span><span class="font7">AVING sold, with a fair degree of success, auto accessories, building material, electrical appliances and stocks and bonds, in the face of keen competition, and also religious books against the influence of narrow-minded bigots, I feel authorized to speak concerning the rules of the selling game which as a vocation will test the mettle of any man or woman and call for the best and highest mental and moral qualities any human being may possess.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As an experience to measure a character and to develope a disposition, I know' of no better profession than the art of canvassing from house to house, of meeting your fellow men face to face-, the high and the lowly, of adjusting yourself to the many varied conditions, of becoming all things to all men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In theoretical and technical books on salesmanship the transaction of a sale is properly described as consisting of (1) the approach, (2) the argument, and (3) the close; I will deal with the subject in that order.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Approach</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">I</span><span class="font7">N THE majority of cases the approach determines the success of a sale. The object of the approach is to establish a line of pleasing contact between the salesman and his prospective buyer. Before there can be an exchange^ of merchandise and money, there must be first an agreeable exchange of thoughts and words or a psychological contact. Therefore as you, the salesman, approach the prospect, you are being judged before the bar of your prospect’s sense of justice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Does your face bear the mark of honesty? Does your voice ring with the tone of sincerity? Do your eyes shine with the radiant sparkle of truth and knowledge concerning the goodness of your proposition? Are your lips eager to tell the message of importance? Do you manifest a sympathetic understanding of the need of your customer? And does your manner, walk and dress carry dignity? Briefly, does your personality inspire confidence?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">No matter how little you may know of the theory and philosophy of salesmanship, if you are honest and sincere your face and voice will tell the tale without much studied effort. Moreover, if you are also conscious of the merit and importance of your mission, because of personal experience, you will demand an audience and in most cases will be received kindly. But your dignified attitude must be toned down somewhat by a cheerful smile and a gentle, courteous demeanor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Now, having stood the test of personality during the first moment, you must find as quickly as possible a point of mutual interest. Agree with thine adversary quickly. Admire your prospect for his judgment as a business man, for his desire of good value, economy plus quality, for his place in the community. Give </span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">him </span><span class="font7">credit for something without compromising the truth. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">If your prospect be a woman, commend her for her knowledge, her efficiency as a housekeeper, for her children or for her pets. Draw your prospect out and find his or her hobby, then direct the conversation to your proposition along the shortest route from the discovered point of mutual interest. Above all things be amiable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Argument '</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">T</span><span class="font7">HE argument, in order to be successful, must accomplish three things:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Firstly, your customer must be made to admit directly or indirectly his interest in your conversation, thereby establishing the fact that he needs and wants the article you have, or at least something similar to what you sell. Let your customer consent on general principles that art, music, labor-saving devices, information contained in books or under whatever head you can classify your particular article, is necessary and desirable to human life, peace and happiness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Secondly, you must prove to your prospect that in the general field of want your merchandise in a most remarkable and economical way fills his very need, and will satisfy both his present and future requirement along that line. Here you should bring in the testimony of local, satisfied patrons; and with increasing enthusiasm add your own personal experience, thus painting before the mental vision of your customer a colorful, vivid picture of desire, glowing with the promise of immediate fulfilment and radiant with the joy of possession.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Thirdly, in a tactful way, without bragging or without speaking disparagingly of the wares</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">of your competitors, you must bring your argument to a. successful close, by turning the merchandise over to your prospect, meanwhile making the purchaser feel that his decision to buy reveals good judgment of value and economy. Assume the attitude that your customer has already decided upon the purchase, because in your mind the actual transaction of buying follows as naturally upon the manifestation of interest as a plum falls off the tree when the wind blows. Use the bellows until the iron is hot, then stop blowing and get busy handing over the contract and the fountain pen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">'The Close</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">M</span><span class="font7">ANY salesmen lose out by trying to close a sale with such silly questions as, Why don’t you buy? Or, Will you take this? when the psychological or the favorable moment is past. As soon as curiosity has crystallized into a measure of interest and desire, which the salesman must watch with keenest anticipation, the time for action has come. Further questions regarding the state of mind of your customer, or trying to impart more information to satisfy the aroused interest, is like throwing water on the fire. The curiosity and desire of your prospect must not be satisfied except by the actual purchase.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Above all things your attitude must be without fear and suspicion. “The fear of man bring-eth a snare.” Confidence in yourself begets the same in the man you are talking to, enthusiasm will arouse interest, logic will appeal to reason, admission of desire in looks and words or silent approval will be followed by a deed—the signature on the dotted line.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">However, if your customer happens to be of ■ the fairer sex, the case is more complicated, for no mere man ever fathomed the intricate psychology of a woman’s mind. It is woman’s prerogative to change her mind rather quickly. If she wall, she will, but it she wont, she wont. Yet nearly all women have two vulnerable points. But before I mention them, I want to waive all personal responsibility.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The poet said, Wanity, thy name is woman.” Therefore, (1) if thou would st be a good salesman remember her vanity. (2) Woman dearly loves a bargain. The newspapers have reported it time and again that the police were called when women stormed a bargain counter. Emphasize the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">bargain</span><span class="font7"> part.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Summarizing my rules for successful selling, I would repeat the famous words of an unknown knight of the road, who rode the iron horse : “Sell yourself first and then sell what you have.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In your approach display frankness and amiability. But do not visit too long, just long enough to establish a pleasing contact. Let your argument be brief and brimful of interesting facts in question form, glowing with the fire of enthusiasm; just long enough to kindle the light of interest and the flame of desire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Finally, in your close, at the right moment, manifest unaffected confidence. Let your demeanor rather than your words call forth action on the part of your customer. Thus, with the voice of gentle persuasion, draw the fish to the shore—the most natural sequence after the bait has been swallowed. But, in case the fish happens to be female use a larger bait. Y<sup>T</sup>ou may have to offer “a pretty silver spoon free”. Play the bargain-feature, talk more and say less; but I claim to be no authority on selling goods to women.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">My concluding advice, gained in the school of practical experience, is this: Do not monopolize the conversation, let your customer talk some too, especially if he is a she. Show your culture. The selling game is good training for anybody, but especially for married people. It civilizes.</span></p>

<h5><a name="bookmark43"></a><span class="font10"><a name="bookmark44"></a>Prayer</span></h5>
<p><span class="font5">[Radiocast from Watchtower WBBR on a wave length of 272.6 meters, by Judge Rutherford.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">O</span><span class="font7">NE of the greatest privileges the Christian enjoys is that of prayer to God. Offered in harmony with the Word of God, and with confidence in God and in His Word, an answer may be confidently expected. Not every one has the privilege of prayer. One’s privilege may be different at different times. It is therefore important to have an understanding of the subject matter as outlined in the Word of God that we may understand who has the privilege of prayer and under what circumstances.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Prayer is a petition asking for relief or favor. If intelligently made it is addressed to One possessing the power and ability to grant the relief or favor desired. A comprehensive definition of prayer therefore is: A petition asking for relief or favor, addressed to a being or creature possessing the power or authority to grant such relief or favor. God is all-powerful. He possesses the power and authority to grant relief, therefore a petition addressed to Jehovah, according to His will as expressed in His Word, may receive favorable consideration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Many of the peoples of earth address their prayers to stones or statues made of wood, or to other inanimate objects. Some turn wheels and consider that as prayer, while others count beads as they repeat some words and believe that is prayer. Such prayers are worse than useless. They are never answered. Many prostrate themselves in a prayerful attitude before images of wood or stone or before some inanimate object in the form of a cross, believing that the presence of such object will aid them in their prayers. Such prayers are offered without a proper understanding of the Scriptures. The people who offer these prayers are not to be blamed, and what is here said is not said for the purpose of ridicule, but that the attention of seekers for truth may be called to the privilege of praying to God, the Giver of every good and perfect gift.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Who May Pray</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">OES every person have the privilege of approaching God in prayer? They have not</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19260324_files/g_E_19260324-20.png" alt="" style="width:17pt;height:18pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">They may pray, but with no expectation of having their prayers answered. The Apostle Peter, under inspiration, wrote: ‘Tor the eyes of the Lord are over the righteous, and his ears are open unto their prayers: but the face of the Lord is against them that do evil.” (1 Peter 3:12) By this authority is seen that only the righteous have the privilege of prayer. Such may present their petitions to God and expect to be heard and answered according to His holy will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Does not the sinner have the privilege of prayer? If one who is a sinner, going in the way of sin, repents (which means to change his mind and his course of action) and desires the mercy of God, he may call upon God for* mercy; and if he follows God’s appointed way he may come into harmony with God and later enjoy the privilege of prayer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">An example of a sinner praying to God is found in the Scriptures. We read: “And the publican, standing afar off, rvould not lift up SO' much as his eyes unto heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying, God be merciful to me a sinner.” (Luke 18:13) It will be observed, however, that this sinner had not the full privilege of prayer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Scriptures show that it is only the child of God that can approach Him, addressing Him as Father, and expect to receive an answer to his prayer. And who is righteous and how does one become righteous? The Psalmist says: “They are all gone aside, they are all together become filthy; there is none that doeth good, no, not one.” (Psalm 14: 3) Again the Psalmist declares that all were born in sin and shapen in iniquity. This is corroborated by the Apostle Paul’s statement in Romans 5:12: “Wherefore as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned.” All are born sinners, but the Lord God has provided a way for sinners to return to Him. Faith is the first thing essential. St. Paul expresses it thus, in Hebrews 11: 6: “But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Abraham is called the “father of the faithful”. Because of his faith God counted him as righteous. This is proven by the words of St. Paul, in Romans 4: 20-22: “He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but was strong in faith, giving glory to God; And</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">being fully persuaded that, what he had promised, he was able also to perforin. And therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Abraham had the privilege of prayer to God because he was a friend of God, so considered by reason of his faith and obedience. Likewise Isa* c and Jacob and other of the prophets had the privilege of prayer. God made a covenant with the people of Israel, and as long as that-people tried to keep that covenant they had the privilege of praying to God and He heard their prayers. Israel is designated in the Scriptures as the house of servants. With the Israelites God's law covenant operated as </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font7"> friend or pedagogue to lead them to- Christ. When Christ came those of the nation of Israel who accepted Hirn as the Anointed One were transferred from the house of servants to the house of sons, and all such who became members of the house of sons were granted the privilege of prayer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">House of Sons</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">M</span><span class="font7">OSES was the head of the house of servants, and that house had a limited privilege oi prayer to God. That house was typical of the house of sons. Jesus Christ is the head of the house of sons. “And Moses verily was faithful in all his house, as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after; but Christ as a son over his own house; whose house are we, if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end.”-—Hebrews 3: 5, 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Sons have the privilege of addressing the Father. The Lord Jesus often prayed, addressing Jehovah God as Father. The disciples of John had the privilege of praying, as the servants of God, but they did not understand how to pray as the followers of Christ; so we read: “And it came to pass, that as he was praying in a certain place, when he ceased, one of his disciples said unto him, Lord, teach us to pray, as John also taught his disciples.” (Luke 11:1) Jesus on that occasion instructed them in the proper manner to pray. Before considering that model prayer let us first determine how one may become a son of God and thus enjoy the privileges that go with sonship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In John 14:6 w’e read: “Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, and the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.” Thus we see that not even a Jew could come to God after the first advent of Christ, except through Christ Jesus, because Christ Jesus is the Son of God and is the Way that God has provided that all shall come to Him and into harmony with Him. In Matthew 16: 24 Jesus said: “If any man will come- after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.” The steps therefore to become a son of God are as follows: (1) Faith in Jehovah as the great eternal God; (2) faith in the Lord Jesus as th© Redeemer of mankind, that His shed blood provided the ransom price; then (3) a full consecration to do God’s holy will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Consecration means that one, in substance, says to Jehovah that having faith in Him and in the Lord Jesus Christ, he agrees to do the will of God, trusting in the merit of Jesus’ sacrifice. The next step is justification, which means to be made right with God. Those who are justified by faith through the blood of Christ are no longer aliens from God but have peace with Him, as St. Paul states in Romans 5:1: “Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Then such an one is begotten by Jehovah, by His holy spirit, as recorded in James 1:18: “Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures.” Then in 1 Peter 1:3, 4, we read: “Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, to an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reserved in heaven for you.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Begetting means the beginning. This marks the coming into Christ. The apostle says in Romans 8:1,14,15: “There is, therefore, now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the spirit. . . . Foi as many as are led by the spirit of God, they are the sons of God. For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have received the spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.” Thus it is seen that all such have the privilege of addressing Jehovah as Father, and these are they who have the privilege of prayer as the sons of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Can a Mohammedan or other heathen pray to God and expect relief? I answer, No, bec.?use such do not believe in the Lord Jesus Christ as the great Redeemer of man and as the Way of coining to God. Why is it necessary to believe on the Lord Jesus Christ- as the Redeemer? Because all the human family became sinners by reason of Adam’s disobedience to God. God provided for the death of Hi.- beloved Son, that through the merit of his sacrifice Adam and his offspring might be relieved from the effects of the judgment of condemnation. God does not force this privilege upon any one but grants it only to those who come and ask, as sinners, that- they might be relieved of their difficulties and come into harmony with Him through Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It follows then that if anyone comes in any other way except through Christ lie would not be received. The Scriptures leave no doubt about this because we read in Acts 4:12: “For there is none other name under heaven, given among men, whereby we must be saved.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">What then shall we say about Modernists? The Modernist clergymen specifically say that they do not believe that man fell because of sin: nor do they even believe that God created man, but say that he is a creature of evolution, that man is now gradually evoluting. They say they do not believe that the blood of Jesus was shed as a redemptive price for man, hence they have no faith in the ransom sacrifice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But these Modernists often stand in the pulpit and pray. Do they have the privilege of prayer or are their prayers heard? We can judge this only by the Scriptures, and when the Scriptures plainly say that no man can come unto God except through Christ Jesus then it follows conclusively that the man who neither believes in the fall of Adam nor the redemptive price, nor in Christ Jesus as the great Redeemer, could have no privilege of prayer whatsoever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Does this mean that the prayers of doctors of divinity, who class themselves as Modernists and are such, and who pray in public, are not heard by the Lord/ It could mean nothing else. The prayer of such in public or otherwise is a mockery. But do not these have the privilege of prayer even as much as would a sinner? This question can be answered by an instance recorded in the Scriptures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In Jesus’ time there were clergymen who claimed to represent God. In Luke 18:10-14 we read: “Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee, and the other a. publican. The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself: G od, I thank thee that I am not as other men are, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican: I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I possess. And the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up he-much as his eyes unto heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying, God be merciful to me a sinner. I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather than the other: for every one that exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Place of Prayer &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">TN J KSITS’ day the ecclesiastical element, particularly the scribes and the Pharisees who claimed to represent God, took much pleasure in walking on the streets in long robes or appearing in the synagogues in such and receiving greetings, and in occupying the chief rooms at the feasts. They also delighted to pray, standing in the synagogues and on the street corners. Jesus said these were hypocrites, that they were praying to be seen of men, and that they had their reward, because men saw them and might sa.y: How wonderfully pious are these men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">After 1800 or more years this class of men have not passed from the earth but rather they have increased in numbers. The words of Jesus seem now quite appropriate. (Luke 20:46,47) “Beware of the scribes, which desire to walk in long robes, and love greetings in the markets, and the highest seats in the synagogues, and the chief rooms at feasts; which devour widows’ houses, and for a show make long prayers: the same shall receive greater condemnation.” (Matthew 6: 5) “And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There is a time and a place for everything. God does not judge one according to the place where he prays but judges him according to his purpose and intent. If his prayer is uttered in a public place that others might hear and remark upon the piety of the one praying, then such a one may receive the reward of commendation of others; but he does not receive the approval of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There are certain conditions in which it would be proper to pray in public. Where there is a public assembly of Christian people for the purpose of holding a public worship it would be entirely appropriate for the leader, or some consevlated Christian in the presence of all, to act as the spokesman to give expression of thanksgiving to God for His manifold blessings, and to ask His guidance in the consideration of matters in which the assembly is to participate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It should be remembered always that prayer is offered not to the people but to- Jehovah. God. Only God can grant the answer to prayer. If therefore there is a thing in which the public assembly is equally and jointly interested, and all desire to ask the same thing, it would be proper then for one to utter audibly this prayer, that the minds of all might be guided likewise. Where there is a mixed audience or many who do not believe the Lord, and the one<sup>1</sup> serving desires to pray, it would be far better for him and more in keeping with the Scriptures if he should pray privately.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There is a distinction between prayer and thanksgiving. Prayer is defined above. Thanksgiving means to give expression of gratitude for favors and blessings received. It is proper for all people to express their gratitude to the Giver of every good and perfect gift. For a leader of a public assembly, however, to stand up before the people and tell Jehovah God what he is expected to do is not only presumptuous but it is often blasphemous. Long prayers uttered in the presence of others are generally uttered for the purpose of attracting attention to the speaker. We may be sure that Jehovah does not hear and. answer such prayers. Oft-times the leader prays because he loves to hear his own voice, that others might comment upon his eloquence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A few years ago a minister of wide reputation prayed before a Boston audience, and the day following the public press used these words: “His prayer was generally acknowledged to be one of the finest ever offered to a Boston audience.” There was perhaps more truth than poetry in this published report. It was manifest that the prayer was offered to the audience and not to Jehovah God. It is quite probable also that it did not go above the heads of that audience and brought no answer from God. </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">There </span><span class="font7">is no instance recorded in the Scriptures where God approves those who attempt to approach His throne in an arrogant way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Lord Jesus left no doubt as to where the Christian should pray. He said: “But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father, which seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly.” (Matthew 6:6) If you desire a special favor at the hands of some earthly ruler you would not wish to call a public assembly of the people and loudly announce in their presence your requests addressed to the ruler. You would much prefer to have a secret audience with him, that you might present your matter in a better way. Since prayers are addressed to Jehovah the effectual prayer is that petition which is secretly presented to Him in the name of Jesus Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The question has been propounded as to why the lecturers who speak on religious subjects over this radio station WBBR do not utter public prayer. That question may be. answered by asking another. Would such prayer be considered as uttered for the benefit of the hearers or that those -who hear might commend the speaker for the prayer? God could hear the prayer just as well whether it is merely thought or spoken aloud. Those who use this radio station for Bible lectures, pray before attempting to deliver their lectures, but they always pray secretly. We believe this is more in keeping with the Lord’s command.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">If others desire to pray publicly over the radio, that is their privilege. This is not in accord with our understanding of the Scriptures. Praying in public is for the purpose of leading the minds of those who are present and who desire to join their minds and hearts in prayer.. The radio audience is an unseen audience. Many of these may not desire to pray. They may be hearing for the first time the Word of the Lord, and might be inclined to class the leader with those Pharisees whom Jesus mentioned as praying in public places.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Shortly after Jesus had been baptized in the Jordan He desired to pray to God before the selecting of the twelve whom He should use. Be it noted that He did not stand up to pray before the multitude, but it is recorded of Him: “And it came to pass in those days, that he </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">went </span><span class="font7">out </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">info a </span><span class="font7">mountain to pray, and continued all night in prayer </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">to</span><span class="font7"> God. And when it was day, he called unto him his disciples: and of them he chose twelve, whom also he named apostles.” —Luke 6:12,13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It was not unusual for the Lord Jesus to withdraw to a secret place for prayer. He did not utter prayers for the benefit of the multitude, that they might hear Him. Concerning this we read: '■'And when he had sent the multitudes away, he went up into a mountain apart to pray: and when the evening* was come, he was there a-lone.” (Matthew 14: 23) He held sweet and precious communion with Uis heavenly Father by means of prayer. This is true of each loyal and faithful follower of the Lord Jesus. To h</span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">im </span><span class="font7">prayer is a sacred privilege.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">If it becomes necessary or appropriate to pray in public, no one who is a time Christian would hesitate to do this. The point is, it seems more appropriate where a child of God has a petition to present to his Father that he do it either secretly or in company with others of like precious faith, that the minds of such may be solemnly set upon the thing that is sought in the name of the Master.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Long Prayers</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">I</span><span class="font7">S THERE any virtue in a long prayer?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Might we expect the Lord to hear and answer a prayer if we repeated it time and time again? Many good and honest people are told that if they will repeat their prayers so many times each day, and count the number by going over a string of beads, that this will result to them in many blessings. Undoubtedly they are honest in their endeavors, but the trouble is that they are not advised as to what the teaching of the Bible is upon the point. Jesus said in instructing His disciples to pray: “But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking. Be not ye therefore like unto them: for your Father knoweth what things ye have need of before ye ask him.”—■ Matthew 6: 7, 8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is not necessary to tell the All-wise Creator time and time again about our heart’s desire. As the Lord here stated: Our Father knows in advance what things we have need of. The question then may arise, Why ask Him at all if He knows what we need? The answer to that</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">is this: God is a just, wise and loving God. </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">He </span><span class="font7">does not force anything upon another. He desires His children to learn certain lessons and to express themselves in full harmony with His will and always to desire His blessings before He bestows them. Any good parent can see the ■wisdom of this. If he wishes to properly train his child he will prefer to see the child first request a thing that is needed and then, if his wisdom suggests that the child is in need of the thing asked for, he takes a delight in giving it. Jesus lays down the rule when He says: “And I say unto you, Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you. For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knoeketh it shall be opened.”.....-Luke</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">11:9,10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">To Whom Should We Pray?</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19260324_files/g_E_19260324-21.png" alt="" style="width:18pt;height:19pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">S HERETOFORE stated, the Jews prayed to God because they were servants of God under the terms of the law covenant. The Christian is directed to pray to Jehovah God and address Him as Father. Only those who are the sons of God have this privilege. The Lord Jesus lays down the rule definitely, in John 15:16, that the petition must be presented in His name: “Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye should go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain: that 'whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you.” Again He said, in John 14:6: “I am the way, and the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This fixes the rule then as to who can come to God and to whom the Christian must present his petition or prayer. Necessarily it excludes unbelievers and also those who claim to be Christian and yet who deny God’s Word and His plan of redemption. It cannot be said that because a man poses before the public as a minister or preacher he has the privilege of praying to God. He may or may not have. When the Lord Jesus was on earth the scribes and Pharisees were the most zealous of all in claiming to represent God. Without doubt their prayers were not heard by Jehovah, for the reason that Jesus said of and concerning them in John 8: 42-44: “If God were your Father, ye would love me: for I proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of myself, but he sent me. Why do ye not understand my speech? even because ye cannot hear my word. Ye are <sup>;</sup> of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own : for he is a liar, and the father of it.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There are many men today who pose before ■' .e people as ministers of the Word of God and yet who have no hesitancy in denying God, denying the Bible as His Word, denying the . fall of man, and denying the Lord Jesus as the great Redeemer. Let the people judge whether or not they want such men to direct their thoughts in prayer. It is not my prerogative to judge men. I can only call attention to the divine rule laid down in the Bible and then let each one judge for himself according to such rule.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">If it appeals to your mind that a man who refuses to believe God can pray to God then join with him in prayer. If he believes such a one to be a hypocrite then he should not join with him in prayer. Prayer is a precious and sacred privilege, enjoyed only by those who have faith in and who love God and who strive to serve Him. No man can approach God in prayer and expect to be heard, unless he has first learned of his own insignificance and that the Lord is infinitely superior, and that God is perfect in wisdom, justice, love and power.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Would it not be proper to pray to Jesus? This would not be improper for a Christian to do, because Jehovah God has committed to Jesus all power in heaven and in earth; but the Lord Jesus Himself directed the Christian that when he prays he should say: “Our Father, who art in heaven,” and then that he should ask in the name of Jesus, the beloved Son of God. He says, (John 15: 7): “If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you.” By this we understand that the Christian </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">alone has the </span><span class="font7">privilege here mentioned. He must </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">be in Christ, </span><span class="font7">in that he has been begotten and anointed of </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font7">holy spirit and now is a new creature; and he who abides in that blessed condition and the Word of God abides in him, then he may ask what he will and it shall be done unto him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But mark the conditions. If the Word of God abides in him then the Christian will ask only in harmony with the will of God, and not ask something contrary to God’s expressed will. (John 14:13,14) “And ’whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Sen. If ye shah, ask any thing in my name, I will do it.” By this text then we see that it is proper for the child of God to address his prayer to Jehovah, the Father, and in the name of the Son, Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Would it be proper then for a Christian to pray to God that a sinner be converted and brought into His church? The answer is, No, for the reason that the church is the body of Christ. God himself is selecting the members of the body of Christ. It would not be proper to ask Him to select some one who was not inclined toward the Lord. But some one might have a loved member of his family that he wanted to become a Christian. Would not it be proper for him to pray for such an one to become a Christian ? It would not. It would be proper for him to pray that his beloved friend might have brought to his attention such a knowledge of God’s truth that he might turn his heart to the Lord, but it is for the Lord Himself to make the selection of those who are His.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We must remember that God is not trying to convert the world. The whole work of the past 1900 years has been merely to preach the gospel, that those who desire to follow the Lord </span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">mi</span><span class="font7">ght do so. Now the message is going forth that the people might have a knowledge that God’s kingdom is at hand, to the end that they </span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">mi</span><span class="font7">ght voluntarily turn their minds to the Lord </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font7">worship and serve Him.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7"><sup>492</sup>But why should the Christian suffer? you may ask. And the apostles answer: ‘‘Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which. J.,, tp try you, as though some strange thing happened unto you: hut rejoice, inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ’s sufferings; that, wk i his glory shall be revealed, ye may be glad also with exceeding joy. If ye he reproached for the name of Christ, happy are ye; for the spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you: on their part he is evil spoken of, but on your part he is lorified. . . . Yet if any man suffer as a Chris-Jan, let him not be ashamed; but let him glorify God on this behalf.” (1 Peter 4:12-14, 16) “It became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings. For both he that sancti-fieth and they who are sanctified are all of one: for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren.”—He brews 2:10,11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>493</sup>Again the Apostle Paul shows that the Christian does not complain because of persecu-t:on and suffering; neither does he murmur against God. But the true sentiment of his heart i: expressed in the words of the apostle: “We glory in tribulation also, knowing that tribulat on worketh patience; and patience, experience; and experience, hope; and hope maketh not ashamed, because the love of God is shed abroad ii our hearts by the holy spirit which is given unto us.” (Romans 5: 3-5) Again says the apostle : “I reckon that the sufferings of this present line are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us.”—Rom. 8:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>494</sup>No true Christian would expect to be without suffering or chastisements from the Lord, because these are evidences that he is a follower of Jesus and a son of God. It is one of the ways in which the spirit of the Lord testifies to us that we are His. (Hebrews 12:2-11; Romans 8... 16,17) These sufferings of the Christian come from various agencies. The Christian suffers by being misunderstood. His motives </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">3</span><span class="font7"> re presumed to be wrong. He is sometimes charged with sedition because he does not desire to join with peoples of the world in engaging in war to destroy human lives; sometimes persecuted by false brethren, and sometimes by those who are ignorant. But all these afflictions he endures patiently, gladly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>495</sup>St. Paul probably suffered as much or more than any follower of Christ. He suffered shipwreck, imprisonment, his back was flogged on three occasions at least, he was stoned and dragged out by the wayside and left for dead; and notwithstanding all these afflictions he wrote: “For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory while we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen.” (2 Corinthians 4:17,18) He was looking forward to the glory that shall follow, as should all Christians—not only </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">some </span><span class="font7">glory, but a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory. The Christian delights to meditate upon the promises given in God's Word concerning this glory.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark5"></a><span class="font13"><a name="bookmark30"></a>A Few Items About a Few Cities</span></h4>
<p><span class="font17">T</span><span class="font8">O MOST humans of healthy mind a green field surrounded with a hedge of beautiful trees is more attractive than a vista of bricks, roofs, chimneys and sewer vents; and there seems little doubt that the hideous agglomerations of population as we have known them, and as they still, exist, will cease under the arrangements that will be in force during the Messiah’s reign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">There arc some who love nature so much and the works of man so little that they seem to even hate the cities. Thus Emile Verhaereu serins to view them in “Les Aubes” (The Dawn). We quote a few Unes of his work, as translated by Arthur Symons:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Oh, these cities! these cities!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">And their tumults and their outcries</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Anel their vrih’ *uries and their insolent attitudes Against the brotherhood of man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Oh, these cities! and their wrath against the skies, And their most terrible, most bestial show;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">And their stocked market of old sins,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">And their vile shops,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Where wreath, in knots of golden grapes,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">All the unclean desires,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As, on a time, garlands of flowery breasts</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Wreathed the white bodies of Diana’s maids.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">These cities!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The sense of youth is withered up in them;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The sense of heroism is sapped in them;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The sense of justice, as a useless thing, is cast away from them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Oh, these cities I these cities I</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">They spread themselves abroad like heaps of rottenness,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Like soft or vehement breeds of aliens</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Whose mouths and suckers wait to suck</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The noble blood of all the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Oh, you cities!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Without you we should still be strong, healthy and tranquil;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Without you our daughters would not be prostitutes, Nor our sons soldiers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">You have soiled us with your ideas and your vices, And it is you who let war loose upon us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Henry Ford is an acknowledged disrespecter of cities. It must be admitted that his products have added much, to the charm of country life. He plans to do more, having in mind the distribution of his factories throughout smaller towns and villages where the townspeople and adjacent fanners may have work without leaving their rural surroundings. Mr. Ford thinks it a pity, and so do we, that the farmers’ products have to bo transported to the big cities to be milled or manipulated before they are transported again to the smaller communities to be sold back to the fanner.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">We have net heard how Frank A. Vanderlip, New York banker, made out, but we recall that about five years ago he bought tin entire village in New Jersey, an old, tumbled-down country community a hundred years old, with the avowed intention of transforming it into a desirable place to remain. The trouble with these small places is that the inhabitants spend so much time discussing the petty personal affairs of their neighbors, and are so sound asleep on their feet, that they do not know they are alive.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark31"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark32"></a>Importance of City Planning</span></h6>
<p><span class="font8">TT IS a good thing that somebody pays some A attention to city planning inasmuch as three-fourths of all the inhabitants of the states oast of the Mississippi and north of the Ohio and the Potomac'are already divorced from farm life. In New York state only one-tenth of the people are still engaged in agricultural pursuits. The rest are city dwellers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font8">mere glance at the transportation problem presented by automobile traffic suggests at once that most cities need to be wiped out and rebuilt if the situation is to be properly met. But </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">that </span><span class="font8">is not practical; hence we </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">find </span><span class="font8">rapid </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">transit </span><span class="font8">engineers, architects, landscape engineers, </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">rail</span><span class="font8">way engineers, sewer engineers, dock </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">builders </span><span class="font8">and vehicular </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">traffic </span><span class="font8">engineers getting </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">in closet</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">■ and closer touch ■with each other, as they necessarily must if present cities are to survive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">All existing cities were planned long before the advent of the automobile. Philadelphia was laid out by Penn in 1682, Washington by L’En-fant in 1800, New York in 1807, the present Paris in 1850. Washington and Paris are unique in that every street leads to a public building, a park, or a circle with its statue or monument. Atlantic City is the best of them all. Go there once and you will know why.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">City planners now are saying some things that a few years ago would have caused people to question their sanity. They are talking of ripping out whole rows of blocks through the downtown districts of such cities as New York, which cost millions of dollars to build, so as to accommodate the ever-increasing automobile traffic. They are also talking of consolidating the buildings of several city blocks into one great structure, so that the roof may be used as a landing place for flying machines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It has even been seriously proposed by a distinguished engineer, a former president of the American Society of Heating and Ventilating Engineers, that the whole city should be roofed over with glass. Hrs argument is that the inhabitants of such a city would require no overcoats, no winter underwear, no raincoats, no umbrellas, no overshoes, no windows in their houses, no heavy blankets on their beds; and that the economy thus effected would more than pay for the cost of the roof. Children could play in the parks the year around. The temperature could be held at whatever point the citizens voted to have it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">; The Tallest and the Busiest</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">T</span><span class="font8">HE tallest and the busiest city in the world is New York. New Yorkers say that it is the largest. Londoners say that London is the largest. It all depends upon where the line is drawn. New Yorkers like to draw the line at nineteen miles from the City Hall, because -when they draw it there they win; but if London’s boundary is extended a few miles, London wins. The population of each of these cities, with their suburbs, is about 8,000,000; and it is too much.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It seems unreal that in a country fifteen hundred miles wide and three thousand miles long, and with a total population of some 120,000,000, more than five percent should live in the restricted area of a single city. Not only is that true in the present, but New York is growing with the greatest rapidity of any city in the country. It is freely predicted that in another twenty-five years it will have a population of 15,000,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The pedestrian congestion of New York streets finds no parallel elsewhere. It is claimed that the busiest pedestrian corner in the world is Fifth Avenue and Forty-Second street, where the daily average passing in all four directions and on all eight sidewalks is calculated at 200,-000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A multitude of the world’s largest cities lie in the same general latitude as New York. Constantinople, Rome, Madrid, Boston, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Buffalo, Cleveland, Detroit, Chicago, are some of these, with many others not mentioned which lie near the same general zone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">New York is one of the loneliest places on earth. It is a hard place in which to make friends and to hold them. To be sure it has plenty of hotels; 140 of them have rooms for 50,000 guests. But unless you have plenty of money you would be about as welcome in one of them as the pope would be in Belfast, or a Bible Student at the Vatican.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark33"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark34"></a>And Chicago is Big, Too</span></h6>
<p><span class="font8">HICAGO was already a city of 29,000 people when the first railroad entered it, on</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19260210_files/g_E_19260210-2.png" alt="" style="width:14pt;height:19pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font8">October 10th, 1848. Only forty-five years later, in 1893, it housed what up until that time was by far the most splendid world’s fair ever held. The architectural and landscape effects of that exposition were a revelation and an inspiration to the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">There are those who think that some day Chicago will be the largest city in the world, for the reason that it is now the greatest railroad center; it lies in the center of the largest and richest agricultural district on the planet; it is surrounded on all sides with fabulously rich coal deposits; and it is determined to be a seaport, via the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence river, even though the ice will shut it off about five months in the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">City planners in the Middle West are giving serious thought to the planning of Chicago as a city 125 miles long, stretching along the lake front all the way from Milwaukee to some point in Indiana, and reaching back fan-shaped some forty miles into the surrounding country. The thirty-eight railroads which terminate in Chicago operate more than 109,000 miles of track, or more than all the railroad track in Germany, Holland, Sweden, Denmark, France and the British Isles combined.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Much of the most valuable real estate in Chicago is in territory which a generation ago was half a mile out in Lake Michigan. The courts have held that riparian rights extend indefinitely out into the water; and many fortunes have been made in Chicago, Cleveland, Atlantic City and elsewhere through the judicious placing of piling so that the winds and waves would create new lands far out from shore. The ground reclaimed on the Chicago front since 1821 is estimated at 130,680,000 square feet; and this ground at present, with the improvements on it, has a value far in excess of $150,000,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Chicago is a safe enough place if you are dead; but if you are alive you may get killed any time. A. friend reports having witnessed two holdups in Chicago on a single visit. A guest of the Adventurers’ Club of that city a few years ago said that he was anxious to get back to the ; ngles of Equatorial Africa, among the roaring ions, trumpeting elephants, and sociable hippopotami and rhinoceri, rather than take any more chances dodging trolleys, automobiles and holdup men in the Loop district.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Many More Big Cities</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">T</span><span class="font8">HERE are many more big cities in the United States besides New York and Chicago; and some day we may write them up, but not now. There is no letup in the drift of the people cityward. More than a quarter of the population of the country now live in 68 cities having a population of 100,000 or more, and more than a third live in cities of over 25,000 inhabitants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">There are a few double-cities, i. e., cities connected by great bridges, and destined to be one municipality. Thus there are Duluth-Superior; St. Paul-Minneapolis; St. Louis-East St. Louis; Tampa-St. Petersburg; Kansas City, Mo.-Kan-sas City, Kans.; Philadelphia-Camden; and eventually New York-Jersey City.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Washington claims to be the most beautiful city in the world; but Oxford, Edinburgh and Paris would contest the claim. Springfield, Mo., </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">has a </span><span class="font8">toy city of 1200 playhouses built by the schoolchildren of that city on a scale of one inch to the foot. This miniature city has streets, parks, electric lights, and is a complete replica of a large-sized city.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Detroit has a city hall which is unique in the fact that here the blind and the crippled are given employment and made self-supporting. Tacoma has its own light and water plant, which private interests sold to the city about thirty years ago when the Seattle boom was on, because they had lost faith in the city. But Tacoma has thriven, and the plants are successful enterprises. Tacoma supplies light at five cents, cooking current at one cent, and heating current at one-half cent a kilowatt hour.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">How the Cities Spend their Money</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">M</span><span class="font8">OST of the large cities of the country are living beyond their incomes. They are mortgaging the future to pay for the present^ piling up bonds upon which their children wall be expected to pay interest, without ever being permitted to pay off the principal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Of the ten largest cities in the country the per capita expense of the city management annually is as follows: Boston $35, Pittsburgh $30, New York $28, Los Angeles $27, Philadelphia $25, St. Louis $23, Chicago $23, Detroit $21, Cleveland $21, Baltimore $16. The expense of running New York is over four times as much as it was in 1898, when Greater New York was formed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">.An examination of the details seems to show that Boston, Pittsburgh, and New York are liberal in every department of expenditures. Philadelphia seems to try to economize on schools, libraries, health and fire; St. Louis on pensions, health and sewers; Los Angeles on pensions, recreation, police and sewers; Chicago on highways, schools, libraries and fire; Detroit on highways and charities; Cleveland on recreation, charities, police and fire; Baltimore on everything, but especially on schools, libraries and health.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Residents of these cities will be better able to judge what is implied by these figures. The expenditure of money in a given department does not always mean efficiency, nor does the withholding of it from a department necessarily mean inefficiency. In most cities an immense sum goes out in directions which only the poll* ticians could explain,</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark35"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark36"></a>The Heart of Britain</span></h6>
<p><span class="font17">T</span><span class="font8">HE heart of the British Empire is London, named by the Welsh, so it is said, the name meaning &quot;Pool Hill”. The pool was a widening of the Thames convenient for shipping; the hill Was probably the elevation upon which the 5?ower of London stands. It is said that no city in the world presents such extremes of wealth Mid poverty as are to be seen in London. No city could be finer than the western part of London, while the eastern part presents scenes of indescribable dirt, squalor and misery.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">London was a prominent city in the days of Nero. In the days of Constantine it extended along the Thames for a mile west of the Tower. It is itself a seaport, and ships of all nations come into its harbor, but the usual access to the city is by rail from any one of a dozen ports.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It has been stated in Parliament that three hundred tons of soot fall every year on each square mile of London, a quantity sufficient to build a pyramid four times as high as the famous clock tower over the Houses of Parliament. But with all its fogs and soot there is no place in the world that has such a hold upon the British mind. The following from the so-called </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">'Children's Newspaper</span><span class="font8"> (which is really a very fine newspaper for adults) gives the British point of view :.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">Throughout Paris there are numerous open centers called places. From these places boulevards and avenues radiate in every direction, like the spokes from a hub. Napoleon, the prize butcher, was the originator of this idea. His thought was that in ease of trouble with the populace he could plant his cannon in these places and sweep the streets more effectively.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Paris is generally considered the most attractive large city. It is the city whence originates most of the styles aped throughout Christendom. It was the first to recognize the value of plate-glass windows. The department store, so common all over America, originated in Paris.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">For a thousand years Paris was the largest city in the world. London did not overtake it until the middle of the nineteenth century. No city was ever so rich in books, libraries and literary treasures as Paris. For many years it has housed the world’s highest structure, the Eiffel Tower. There are dozens of fountains throughout the city which are works of art. One of the charms of the city is the famous parade ground, Champ de Mars, running through the heart of the city in a broad band to the Seine.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">Berlin grew from a collection of islands in the River Spree; and from these islands which are connected by broad bridges, and which still form the center of the city, it has extended far out over the sandy plains until it is now the third city in Europe, being exceeded in population only by London and Paris. The central part of the largest island’ was once the site of a castle, but is now a pleasure garden for the public, adorned with monuments and statues and surrounded partly by the old Royal Palace and the Old Museum.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Before the World War the University of Berlin, with 13,000 students, was the greatest in the world. The famous Berlin street Enter den Linden (Under the Lindens) is a very busy modern thoroughfare with no linden or other trees in sight in any photograph we have ever seen.- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Berlin, which once had no beggars, now shines in the ranks of beggary, along with Vienna and Naples.

<p><span class="font8">Before the Celts went into the British Isles, long before the time of Christ, they are said to have founded the city of Vienna, which for so long time stood as the center of German culture and civilization. The Romans had a fort there. It was a gathering point for the Crusaders in their march to the Holy Land. The Imperial Library contains the richest collection of apparel and jewelry to be seen in Europe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Vienna is the symbol of royalty, of aristocracy, of Roman Catholicism, of music and of the dance. For many years it had the largest proportion of illegitimate births of any great city in the world. It suffered terribly from the World War. In 1920, in the effort to provide fuel for the populace, a beautiful forest park of 150 acres -was completely destroyed. Even as late as a year ago the suicides exceeded a hundred a month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Prague, the capital of Czecho-Slovakia, formerly part of Austria, and its richest province, is said to be the most beautifully situated of any large city in Europe.

It is a vast museum of archaeology.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Naples, the chief city of Italy, is situated on the Bay of Naples, 160 miles southeast of Rome, in one of the most beautiful settings of any city in the world. On account of numerous earthquakes the buildings are of unusual solidity. The winter climate is perfect. The city’s milkmen drive their flocks around the narrow streets and milk their goats at the customers’ doors, in pails which the customer provides. No bottles are necessary, and there is no question about the milk being fresh. Naples is the center of the world's trade in coral jewelry. The University of Naples is 700 years old.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Athens, capital of Greece, stands for art, sculpture, architecture. It was built on a collection of hills five miles back from the harbor, with which it was once connected by a lane 550 feet in width. The walls which enclosed the lane were so broad and massive that their tops served as carriage roads. The Athenians extended their sway over all Greece and made their capital the most magnificent city of the ancient world. Just now they are installing 200,000 American bathtubs.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">Damascus, the oldest city in the world, is mentioned in Genesis 14:15 and was therefore standing in Abraham’s time. The city owes its location to the Abana river, a mountain stream with a cold, swift, deep current, which rushes eastward into the plain which its waters have converted into a paradise. The appearance of the city from a distance is very impressive. It is now noted especially for its gold and silver embroidery and jewelry. There are several good hotels, but in order to get a hot bath in any of them notice must be given twelve hours in advance. The street cars have special compartments for veiled women. Most of the streets are crooked.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Cairo, the largest city in Africa, is the educational center of the Moslem world. The University of Cairo is one of the world’s largest educational institutions and the oldest of them all. Cairo was founded in the year 640 A. D.</span></p>

The Kaaba, which contains the sacred black stone which fell from heaven (?), is opened only two or three times a year. No person not a Moslem may view it on pain of death, nor even enter the city itself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Every Moslem is supposed to visit Mecca once. To be present at the great annual festival means that every prayer then offered counts for more than a thousand offered elsewhere! It is estimated that about 100,000 pilgrims gather at the annual fair and fete. As soon as the trading and the religious service are over, they disperse, and the city remains comparatively solitary and empty for another year.</span></p>

Soup kitchens had to be opened. Strike breakers were being brought in by the operators. The operators offered arbitration; but the miners demand a conference, pointing out that inasmuch as the operator does not arbitrate the price at which he sells his coal, it is unreasonable to compel the miner to arbitrate the price at which he will sell his labor.

The weather was unfavorable in all the northern states—Maine, New York, Minnesota, Michigan and Wisconsin —where the bulk of the crop is grown. The 1925 yield in Pennsylvania is the more noteworthy because the acreage was actually less than the year before, while the crop was almost exactly the same. The shortage this season has been so great that, potatoes have been shipped into the Philadelphia market from North Dakota, Nebraska, Idaho and even Washington.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">Some Properties of Radio Waves</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font8">T IG-HT rays and radio waves in general obey the same natural laws. That is, just as a ray of light can be projected through space, reflected, refracted, absorbed, polarized, so radio waves can be propagated likewise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is the purpose of this article to discuss briefly some of these pecuhar properties of radio waves and note some of the possible causes for the variation in the intensity of the received signal at different points of reception, though these may be at equal distances from the transmitting station but in different directions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">First of all, consider the antenna at a transmitting station. This antenna is elevated in space and is connected through the transmitting machine directly to earth, or to its equivalent, a counterpoise. The transmitting machine sets up in this antenna an alternating current which oscillates at a very high frequency between the antenna and earth. The frequency of this oscillating current determines the wave length of that particular station.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Now, when this antenna is charged by such an oscillating current, it sets up in the surrounding region two primary fields, one an electrostatic and the other an electromagnetic field, which radiate out into space in all directions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">These two fields, when near to the antenna, are in space quadrature and out of time phase. That is, one field, the electromagnetic, exists in a horizontal plane about the antenna as centered ; while the other, the electrostatic exists in a vertical plane from antenna to earth. These two fields are thus displaced 90° in space. They are out of time phase in the sense that during an instant when one field has its maximum value the other will be at its minimum V'JLue, and corresponding instantaneous values will have the same phase relationship throughout an entire period.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Such conditions exist near the antenna only. At a distance the relationship is entirely different. The two fields approach each other in time phase while their relative positions in space change greatly, depending upon the nature of the space traveled, over.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The kind of soil, the mineral content of the earth, the proportion of land to water, the contour of the earth’s surface, the state of earth’s magnetic field, the temperature and humidity of the atmosphere, and even the time of</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">By Balph H. Leffler</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">day and season-of year all greatly influence the relationship and character of these radiated fields or waves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Additionally, the local surroundings of the receiving station have a marked effect. For instance, a receiving station located in a large city surrounded with steel structures of all kinds will experience an entirely different result in reception than will one located on the top of a hill in the open country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">To simplify the situation and to aid our conception of the nature of propagation of radio waves through space let only one radiated field be considered, say the electrostatic, the one which exists about the antenna in a vertical plane. Also let this electrostatic field be considered to exist in lines of force extending as meridians from the antenna to earth and traveling away from it at the speed of light, namely, 186,000 miles per second. Now let it be considered that at any particular point away from the antenna these vertical lines of force are constantly changing in value at a rate depending upon the frequency of the radiated wave. With this picture in mind, let us see what are some of the possible variations in the shape of the electrostatic field as it moves across the earth’s surface.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">As these lines of force travel away from the antenna they no longer maintain their vertical position but instead incline themselves in such a way that they lean away from the vertical, the inclination being such that the top portion of the wave is farther away from the transmitter than the lower portion next to the earth. This inclination is caused by the absorption or drag effect of trees, vegetation, hills, mountains, etc., upon the lower portion of the wave. The portion of the wave next to the earth’s surface thus lags behind the portion in the upper atmosphere.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark113"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark114"></a>Poor Reception Accounted For</span></h6>
<div><img src="g_E_19260210_files/g_E_19260210-12.png" alt="" style="width:12pt;height:19pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font8">HOULD this inclination of the lines of force be to such an extent that they become nearly horizontal to the earth’s surface, it is seen that a receiving station located in such a region relative to the transmitting station could not hear that station very well. Especially will this be true if the receiving station uses an antenna which.is relatively long with respect to its height. Should the receiving station he using a loop or a relatively high, vertical antenna, the station could then be heard very well.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The same causes which act to shift these lines of force out of a vertical position in a direction away from the transmitting station will also cause them to be inclined in a direction transverse to the plane of propagation or in any intermediate position. The direction these waves are shifted depends entirely upon the angular relationship between the wave and the obstructing medium.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">What has been said regarding the electrostatic field can also be said about the electromagnetic field. Both fields can be shifted out of their true positions, either in a direction towards each other or in a direction in opposition to each other, depending upon the nature of the obstruction and its angular position with respect to the wave.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is possible for the two fields to be so shifted that they will be 180° out of phase, or in opposition to each other. It would be impossible for a receiving set in such a region to hear the transmitting station. Again, in other regions these two fields can be so shifted that they will be in phase with each other, in which case the transmitting station could be heard exceptionally well.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In a preceding parag’raph an absorption effect was noted. An instance is called to mind where this effect was particularly noticeable. A certain broadcasting station was using a comparatively short wave in the broadcasting band. When on the air but a few weeks it was soon learned that the station was not reaching out well to a distance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Investigation disclosed the fact that in the immediate neighborhood of the station there were many tall buildings having steel framework which had a natural period of oscillation, or were ‘Tuned” to approximately the same wave as the station was using. This of course caused much of the radiated energy to be absorbed and thus a diminution of the wave at a distance. This station later changed its wave to a higher value. It was then soon learned that the station was “getting out” much better, even though using the same amount of power. At a receiving station the same kind of absorption by steel structures and wires can take place to a marked extent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Again, this electrostatic field radiated from a transmitter can suffer another effect due to reflection. Just as a beam of light can be made to impinge upon a mirror and its direction of travel thus changed, so radio waves can be reflected by objects in their plane of propagation. A mountain containing, large deposits of metalic ores will cause a great change in the direction of travel of radio waves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Likewise, a long coast line between the salt water of an ocean and the dry land of a continent will reflect the radiated wave to an extent depending upon the relative position of the transmitting station to the coast line and the direction the wave is traveling. Radio Compass stations along such coast lines regularly make corrections in their readings due to this effect.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark115"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark116"></a>The Heaviside Reflector</span></h6>
<div><img src="g_E_19260210_files/g_E_19260210-13.png" alt="" style="width:18pt;height:18pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font8">NOTHER example of reflection is that due to the so-called Heaviside layer in the upper atmosphere surrounding the earth. At an altitude variously estimated to be from 75 to 200 kilometers above the earth there is supposed to exist a heavily ionized or conducting ring around the earth known as the Heaviside layer. This layer behaves much the same with respect to radio waves as a concave mirror surrounding the earth would to light waves. Some of the energy radiated upward from a transmitting antenna impinges upon this reflecting medium at an angle causing it to be reflected downward again, or even to be refracted and polarized as light would when reflected from a mirror. This reflected wave can then be heard by a receiving station located a great distance away while other receivers located much nearer the transmitter would be totally deaf, because beyond the range of this reflected wave.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">These phenomena of reflection, refraction, absorption and polarization depend greatly upon the frequency of the radiated wave, or in other words, upon the wave length. As a general thing, the higher the frequency, or the shorter the wave length, the more pronounced will these effects be.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Instances are on record where small, low-powered transmitting stations working on a wave length of forty meters or less, have been heard on the opposite side of the earth. Other transmitters using waves several thousand meters long required hundreds of kilowatts to cover the same distance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The only explanation for this phenomenon at present is that the small station radiated a high angle, high frequency, energy component which was reflected by the Heaviside layer and thus lost little energy by absorption which otherwise would have taken place had the waves traveled on the earth’s surface.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">ADIO waves encounter another peculiar effect. Aviators occasionally report having encountered “holes” while flying through the air. That is, under certain atmospheric conditions voids or regions of partial vacua are created in the atmosphere. These give the airplanes a sensation similar to driving over a bumpy road, due to the plane dropping a distance each time a void is encountered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Likewise, some such condition seems to exist in the “ether”, or in whatever the medium is for the propagation of electric waves. There are regions in the United States and elsewhere, where radio waves cannot penetrate, regardless of the power or wave length used. In these regions or voids, either the medium that carries the waves is absent or else there exists some sort of neutralizing effect which as yet cannot be explained.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">As the new day dawns no doubt the infant prodigy, radio, will grow to maturity and perform many hitherto unknown services for the good of mankind. Today it is used largely as a means of communication and entertainment. Tomorrow, people will not merely talk to their neighbors a thousand or more miles away, but they will be able to see each other by radio while they converse. Success has already been attained in crude experiments along this line, both still and moving pictures having been transmitted by radio.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Today radio can be used to control airplanes, vehicles, steamships or submarines at a distance, without a man aboard. Tomorrow it not only will do that but will-furnish the motive power as well. As the world continues to enter upon the new day more and more will the peoples of earth rejoice and be glad for the power and majesty of their Great King, who has provided this and all the other means for their comfort and use.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark119"></a><span class="font12"><a name="bookmark120"></a>The Magellanic Clouds </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">By J. L. Boiling</span></h5>
<p><span class="font17">S</span><span class="font8">OME months ago the Harvard Observatory issued in quick succession three circulars on the Magellanic Clouds, from which we glean the following interesting and awe-inspiring facts:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">These mysterious, shining clouds, seen in the South Seas by the first circumnavigators of the globe, are really universes within themselves, so vast in extent that they stagger the strongest imagination. In fact, it is impossible for the human mind to gain anything but a slight apprehension of their magnitude and magnificence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Early explorers told thrilling stories of these luminous clouds which can be seen in a dark quarter of the heavens, giving the impression that they are fragments thrown off the Galaxy. Nearby is the Southern Cross, which swings around the South Pole—a real cross, of blazing effulgence. Does not this represent and remind us of the Cross of Christ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">An Arabian astronomer named these clouds “The White Ox” about the middle of the tenth century. Herschel made a careful study of them on the Cape of Good Hope, but in recent years only has considerable been learned concerning them. Photography has been a great aid in this work, of course, which was not known in Herschel’s time. Both clouds are oval in shape.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Th- larger cloud is six or seven degrees across, and is said to cover about forty square degrees of sky. The smaller cloud is about three degrees across, and covers about ten square degrees of sky. To the naked, unaided eye they present a nebulous appearance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Thirty-one kiloparsecs is given as the distance of the Small Cloud from the earth. A parsec is nineteen trillion miles. A thousand parsecs made one kiloparsec; hence, thirty-one kiloparsecs give us the astounding figure of 589 quadrillion miles, or more than six thousand times the distance from the earth to the sun.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Think of traveling to this universe. You start, and cover the some 94,000,000 miles to the sun, and repeat this six thousand times in the course of your journey! Going at the incredible speed of 94,000,000 miles a year, it would require the length of time since Adam to complete the journey!</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Illustrations for the purpose of conveying to the finite mind anything like an adequate com-prenension of such distances are weak and mean nothing. We simply cannot grasp it, although the faint apprehension of it gained by meditation is sufficient to give us a thrill of awe and reverence for the Almighty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">This small cloud is two kiloparsecs in diameter, or fifty times the distance from our planet to the Hyades, or 38,000 trillion miles in diameter. It is composed of a vast host of stars. Among its multitudes, running well up into hundreds of thousands, there are some 300 suns, each one of which is fifty thousand times brighter and more glorious than our effulgent orb of day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Moreover, we find in this universe about two hundred and sixty thousand stars, many of them being at least a hundred times brighter than our sun. The 300 suns referred to are the brightest objects yet found by astronomers.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark121"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark122"></a>Celestial Glory</span></h6>
<p><span class="font17">T</span><span class="font8">HE Bible says that the church, when glorified in the first resurrection, and clothed with the divine nature, immortality, will shine </span><span class="font8" style="text-decoration:underline;">lik</span><span class="font8">e the sun. Daniel speaks of this wise class, who through voluntary obedience and sacrifice of their human life and its rights and privileges, win the promised reward, and will shine “like the firmament”. Explosions of incandescent gas on the sun’s surface throw the flames of indescribable brilliancy to a height of 50,000 miles; and the glory of the church in the presence of Jehovah is likened unto this effulgent spectacle! Now this is a natural illustration, and it is not a Scriptural supposition that the glory of any natural phenomena could equal the celestial glory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Paul affirms this when he says: &quot;There are also celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial: but the glory of the celestial is one, and the glory of the terrestrial is another”—inferior. The thought here is that there is a vast difference between the earthly glory and heavenly glory, and this applies to both person and environment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The surroundings in heaven are indescribably grand, insomuch that the Bible makes no attempt to describe them. And the same is true with reference to the glory and grandeur of personality of heavenly beings. &quot;It doth not yet appeal* what we shall be” when changed and “clothed upon” when “immortality is swallowed up of life”. But we shall.be like Jesus—not the Man Jesus, but the Divine Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Now the thought we are trying to express is this: Since the most glorious of natural phenomena is inferior to the heavenly, we could with perfect propriety and reason .suppose that the glory of the church will be vastly grander than any glory on the natural plane, in the natural worlds and suns.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Our Lord merely selected the sun as an illustration, because it is the most luminous object in the heavens by reason of its close proximity to us; that is, it is the brightest thing within range of natural sight because of its closeness. If He had used the Magellanic Clouds as an illustration, His disciples would not have appreciated it; but we can suppose that the glory of the church will far excel that of these clouds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In other words, the combined brilliancy and glory of the 300 suns mentioned, each of which is fifty thousand times brighter than our sun, will pale before the brightness of God’s pflory expressed in the church, the 144,000 men and women who make their calling and election sure to a place in the heavenly kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">So wonderful is heaven and its beings that when Nicodemus asked for information regarding it, our Lord refused to attempt any description, knowing that the natural mind cannot understand it. The spirit-begotten see it merely “through a glass darkly”, but what they see overawes them and heartens them to a continued effort in the race for the prize.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark123"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark124"></a>Saul’s Glimpse of Glory</span></h6>
<p><span class="font17">O</span><span class="font8">NE can gaze at the sun when at its zenith in a cloudless sky, without any permanent injury to the eyes, provided the gaze is not too prolonged. The result will be, however, that the eyes will fill with tears and the sight will be temporarily darkened. But it is inadvisable and useless to attempt this, and we merely give it for the sake of comparison.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">When Saul of Tarsus was struck down by the glory of the Lord while en route to Damascus, he tells us that “suddenly there shined round about him a light from heaven: and he fell to the earth, and heard a voice saying unto him, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? ... I am Jesus, whom thou persecutest: ... And he trembling and astonished said, Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?&quot; And the Lord instructed him what to do. “And the men which journeyed with him stood speechless, hearing a voice, but seeing no man. And Saul arose from the earth; and when his eyes were opened, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">he saw no man: </span><span class="font8">but they led him by the hand, and brought him into Damascus. And he was three days without sight, and neither did eat nor drink.” (Acts *1:3-9) His sight was partially restored by-a miracle. We say partially, because the Bible intimates that his eyes were weak afterwards.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">When Paul was rebuked for denouncing “God’s high priest”, he replied, “I wist not, brethren, that he was the high priest.” Yet he was standing very near the high priest, whose attire would indicate his office. This proves conclusively that Paul was partially blind. Later he “perceived”, after being in the midst of the assembly for some time, “that the one part were Sadducees, and the other Pharisees,” and took advantage of this knowledge to create a division between them. This further confirms the fact of Ids semi-blindness caused by a glimpse of Christ Jesus.—-Acts 23:1-10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In Acts 22:6-11 and 26:12-19 are two more accounts of the same experience. Note the expressions : “I saw in the way a light from heaven, above the brightness of the sun, shining round about me”; and “I could not see for the glory of that light”.—Acts 26:13; 22:11.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark125"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark126"></a>Majesty and Power</span></h6>
<p><span class="font17">T</span><span class="font8">HUS we see, and are enabled to contrast the difference between natural and supernatural brightness and glory. Paul simply caught a fleeting glimpse of the Lord as He is since God glorified Him, “the King eternal, immortal, invisible,&quot; whom no man hath, seen or can see. We also see in this the majesty of God’s power: He took our Lord Jesus when in oblivion, non-existent, and brought Him out of this state!</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Referring. to this, the greatest creative act of Jehovah, the apostle speaks of “the exceeding greatness of his power to us-ward who believe, according to the ivorking of his mighty power, which he wrought in Christ, when he raised him from the dead” and exalted Him “far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come”. (Ephesians 1:19-21.) The same power is now operative in changing and glorifying the church.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">This is one of those sublime passages which cannot be read and thought upon too often. The Being who can bring one out of nothing, so that he will know and recognize himself as the same identical being who passed into death, is worthy in every sense of the worship and adoration of all created intelligences.</span></p>

<h5><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font12"><a name="bookmark127"></a>Why China is in Ferment</span></h5>
<p><span class="font5">(From the American Federation of Labor News Letter)</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">T</span><span class="font8">HE present crisis in China, so fraught with the gravest consequences to the peace of the world, has its immediate cause in the shooting of a number of unarmed students by foreign police, in Shanghai on May 30.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">This statement is made by the commission on church and race relations of the Federal Council of the Churches of Christ in America.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The churchmen say that Chinese laborers were employed by Japanese mill owners, and the former demanded better treatment, &quot;especially for the women workers.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">During a strike demonstration a Japanese employer fired into the crowd and killed a Chinese worker.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“A number of the Chinese laborers were arrested by the foreign police and sentenced by the Shanghai mixed court for damage done to machinery and for violence. Nothing was done, however, either by the police or by the court concerning the Chinese who had been killed. A memorial service was held for the dead man and a number of Chinese students participated in it, as well as in the preceding strike activities. The meeting was broken up by the foreign police, who also arrested six students.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">As a protest, students and workers came to the police station and demanded that justice be done and insisted that the students who were held in jail be released.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“The British officer shouted to the crowd to disperse. According to his own testimony he</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">gave the order in English; and a few seconds afterward gave an order to shoot. Four students were killed outright and a large number wounded, five of these dying of their wounds later. Some schools and colleges in Shanghai were closed. Searches were made of Chinese households. Shooting, even with machine guns, was carried on by the police in some parts of the city, and more Chinese were killed and wounded. Throughout the period, not a single foreign police officer was killed or seriously wounded.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The churchmen quote numerous witnesses who blame the foreign police fof the murderous affair. The diplomatic corps in Peking sent a delegation of six to Shanghai to investigate the incident, but the result has not been made public.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“According to report,” the churchmen say, “they placed the blame upon the British police and the administrators of the foreign settlement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“A most unjustifiable phase of the whole affair is that to this day, no authoritative investigation has been made public by the foreign na-nations and no apology offered. Fuel was added by the shooting of Chinese by foreign troops at Hankow and Canton.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The murders have developed a nation-wide boycott by the Chinese against alien domination in general and against British and Japanese business in particular. It is stated that the boycott has resulted in British losses of approximately $1,000,000 a day.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">W</span><span class="font8">ITH a view to helping the oil men of this state keep out of litigation and therefore out of trouble, delay and ruin, Judge Charles H. Jenkins, former Justice of the Court of Civil Appeals of Austin, Texas, proposed the following paragraphs which have actually been inserted in some of the oil contracts now in use in that state:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The essence of this contract is the development for </span><span class="font8">oil </span><span class="font6">and gas on the properties herein conveyed, and the carrying out of the obligations to the original Lessor, ■which Lessee in good faith agrees to do, and the submission to a Board of Arbitration of all questions in </span><span class="font8">dispute,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">For the purpose of avoiding the necessity of preparing a long and specifically detailed contract as </span><span class="font8">to </span><span class="font6">the duties of the parties hereto it is specifically agreed that as equity and justice are the aims herein sought, to be accomplished by the reasonable development </span><span class="font8">of </span><span class="font6">the property herein conveyed, so that Lessor herein </span><span class="font8">as </span><span class="font6">well as the original landowner may receive the royalties from oil or gas to which each of them are justly entitled, it is hereby agreed that an Arbitration Board herein provided for, shall be the sole judge as to what shall constitute reasonable development, </span><span class="font8">and as </span><span class="font6">to all </span><span class="font8">other </span><span class="font6">questions of fact, and such decision shall be read into this contract, and be as binding on the parties hereto </span><span class="font8">as if written herein at the time of signing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the event any difference arises between the parties hereto as to the obligations each to the other, it is agreed that both parties shall sign a written request to the County or District Judge of Bexar County, Texas, or to some other person to be agreed upon, and if no such person can be agreed upon, then the County Judge, and if he fails or refuses to act, then any District Judge, shall select nine (9) men of intelligence and well known high moral character from a list of thirty (30) men who shall be furnished by said contestants. Each contestant may furnish to the Judge the names of fifteen (15) intelligent business men of high moral character, and from the list of thirty (30) names so furnished the Judge shall select nine (9) men, a list of whose names shall be furnished to the contestants. Each contestant may strike out three (3) names, and the first three men whose names appear unstricken on said list shall be the arbitrators, who shall decide the points then at issue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Each contestant must sign an agreement each with the other not to communicate in any way, either directly or indirectly, with any arbitrator except when in session, and both contestants or their representative is present.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Each contestant shall state his own case in person' or by his personal representative, and may present as many as 10 witnesses in substantiation of his case; each contestant shall bear the expense of his own witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">No lawyer shall be permitted to be present at any session of the arbitrators, nor to participate in any way in the settlement, nor shall any arbitrator confer with any lawyer as to the legality or illegality of the questions that may be involved, such questions being left with the contestants.^</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The decision of the Arbitrators shall be in writing, and a copy shall be delivered to each contestant. From the verdict of the Arbitrators there shall be no appeals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">No one who is </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font6"> lawyer, or who has ever studied law, or who is holding any public office shall be eligible as an arbitrator: thus eliminating technicalities and legal phases. Time and money will thus be saved to both parties.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Each of the contestants agrees to submit their differences to an Arbitration Board as herein provided, and to abide by the decision of such Board as rendered, and a refusal on the part of either contestant to so submit or to abide will be an admission on the part of such contestant that he is wholly in the wrong, and acknowledged damages to his contestee in the sum of $5000.00 as punitive damages, which he hereby agrees to pay within thirty (30) days after refusal to submit or to abide by the action of said Arbitration Board, as the ease may be.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The contestants shall share equally the expense of tha Arbitration, but if it appears to either contestant that the questions submitted are more for the purpose of harassment and expense than to settle questions of equity and justice as between man and man, then either contestant may ask the Arbitration Board to assess tha cost to the losing party. Each arbitrator shall be entitled to $15.00 per day or for any fraction of more than one-half (^) day. time to apply only for time actually engaged, but not to run during the time any question may be held under advisement.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark129"></a><span class="font12"><a name="bookmark130"></a>Going Without Breakfast </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">By </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;">m.</span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;"> Chamberlin</span></h5>
<p><span class="font17">I</span><span class="font8"> HAVE been thinking quite a little about a recent, article on foods, where the writer advises his readers to go without breakfast. That advice is good for some, but bad for others. I have heard that quite a few of the traveling speakers go without breakfast; and I can well understand, that with so little exercise and with a bountiful table set before them almost daily, they do not feel the need of three meals a day. Under those conditions I would require but very light meals; but if I went without any I would rather go without the evening meal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">I do not think that we can lay down hard and fast rules on diet; each one must fit things in to suit his or her own case. When I was a child my daily morning meal was far too light—just bread and marmalade or buttered toast, dinner at noon, and a light evening meal of just bread and butter, and sometimes a piece of cake. When for a season I was taking music lessons, before noon I was fatigued to the point of exhaustion; I could always do better work in the afternoon after a square meal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Years ago I tried the two meals a day and it did not work well. There are some strong-minded women who will lay the law down and say that hubby and son must go without breakfast for the future, but it will make trouble in the home. This course is all right where husband and wife see alike; but if they do not it' does not look right to me to force it. I heard of a woman who was actually giving her infant’ child, nothing but tomato juice. The authorities got after Ker. Another friend is going without breakfast, which is of course her business and not mine. But she wants to make disciples of all the rest of us; and because we do not see alike, she takes a “holier-than-thou” attitude.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Years ago I adopted a system that suits my own case. I do not eat bread and potatoes at the same meal. I have discarded flour gravies, fried foods, and rich foods, and eat plenty of fruit and vegetables with some meat, the latter only once a day, at noon; no pastry; rye bread or some other kind of health bread. I never touch coffee, and drink just one cup of tea a day, and that at the morning meal. We are three in the family, and are all agreed on this subject. I have no cooking to do in the evening. But when my boy went to school at a distance, having to take a cold lunch with, him, then we had to have d’nner in the evening; and I was never well unuer those conditions. When he got through school, I was able to go back to having dinner at noon. We rise at 5 a. m. and retire about 9: 30 or 10 p. m.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Another reason why I do not favor going without breakfast, except under certain conditions, is that by the time the noon meal is served the person is so hungry that if he is not careful he will eat too fast and too much. It was not poverty that caused my meagre meals when I was small, but a parent who had peculiar ideas in respect to diet. If I asked for an egg I was quoted scripture, such as “the glutton shall come to poverty”. My peculiar experiences make me fight shy of extremists. ,</span></p>

I tried all the old-fashioned remedies, but still had the colds. I was told to try cold air baths and did so, not caring if it killed or cured me; but it has cured me so effectively that I can say I have not had a cold for three years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Winter and summer, mornings and evenings, I strip naked and go through a few simple exercises, such as bobbing up and down fifteen oi* twenty times. This fans you in good shape. Try it if you want to keep from catching colds. I am past sixty-five years of age, but fear no weather now, as I no longer am subject to colds.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">A</span><span class="font8"> RECENT news dispatch from Moscow says: “All churches, convents and religious buildings have been whitewashed by order of the Soviet government.” How appropriate 1 For a long time these buildings have been “the habitation of devils, and the hold of every foul spirit, and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird”. (Revelation. 18:2) At last the Russian people, through the power that came into their hands as a. result of the downfall of the czarist regime, kicked out the “unclean and hateful birds” that long had been preying upon them. And now, Us has long been recognized as the most effective way to renovate bird coops, they give these buildings a whitewashing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">One would almost think that these soviets had turned Bible students and were perfectly familiar with what the Revelator said about Babylon. But this is unlikely. Nevertheless they recognize the character of the clergy and “pillars of the church” as that of unclean and hateful birds; hence they treat them, and the buildings that have housed them, accordingly. What a wmnderful confirmation that God used a most appropriate symbol when He labeled the clergy and their supporters thus! Need it surprise anyone that the reactionists of the United States will be all the more violently opposed to this government’s recognizing Soviet Russia!</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">An agreement has been reached between the Vatican, Blair and Company and the Chase National Bank </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">at </span><span class="font6">New York City, establishing a $1,500,000 credit for tha Vatican in New York. Arrangements for the credit were consummated in a letter sent by the papal secretary, Cardinal Gasparri, to the New York bank on October 11, stating that the Vatican was delighted with agreements for credit with Blair and Company, and also especially with the Chase National Bank. Cardinal Gasparri wrote that the conditions under which the credit was granted, considering the exigencies of the market, were tempered by a sentiment of devotion to the Holy See. Cardinal Hayes of New York has been authorized to sign the agreement on behalf of the Vatican.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Tins million and a, half dollars is but the addition of a small fiber to one of the strands which form the mighty golden cable of twenty-four billion dollars by which the United States government and her financial institutions are inextricably “enmeshed&quot; in “foreign entanglements&quot;. The sole purpose of this loan, which undoubtedly will be followed by others, is to insure acquiescence from the moneyed power of this country (the real government of th© United States) to the politic! al ambitions of the Roman Catholic hierarchy, and military assistance and protection in time of need.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Surely the Vatican is not borrowing this money because of a real financial need on its part. The unhumiliating and “dignified''' way would be to increase the price of masses and holy candles. Anyone knows that the increasing of holy candles one-half cent more per candle, or the mere ordering of Roman Catholics to purchase another candle, would enable the Vatican to realize several million dollars in less time than it has taken to negotiate a loan in Wall Street. Now that the American loan has been negotiated with “the holy father” it will not be surprising to learn that the Swiss guard at the Vatican has been augmented by United States marines.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">K</span><span class="font8"> NOTHER worth-while item of information is that four hurried trips were made by Mr. J. Pierrepont Morgan to the White House some time ago. When the president was ,in New York City a few days ago, he referred to big business before the New York Chamber of Commerce and said that if they try to get a strangle-hold on the government they will bring down upon their heads “the hornets’ nest of trust-busting and government interference which were found necessary at times in the past”. Then the president assured them that there are no such things as “trusts”. To quote from the Los Angeles </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Record:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The humor of it must have secretly taxed the waistbands of his [Coolidge’s] hearers to the limit; for of course they had to look serious over the frightful threat in order to convince the reporters that Calvin had uttered something mors that would go thundering down the ages,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The “dissolved”’ old Standard Oil octopus must ba trembling in all its profitable tentacles. The Mellon family aluminum cinch, with its fingers in every kitehen in the land, must groan in agony over prospects of Attorney General Sargent hornet-nesting Andy Mellon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The railroad merger promoters, the Great Electric Power trust, the coal barons, the Continental Bakers’ combine, the Wall Street owners of the railroads, the Chicago “pit”, the purified meat trust and such, which are right now part of the. government or brazenly defying the government, must be shaking in their patent leather boots. Calvin has warned every one of them that if they go any further he will, slap the trust-busting of the past on them, &amp;&nbsp;regular hornets’ nest—-full of butterflies.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">?&quot; It is a painful duty to record this signal failure of </span><span class="font8">Mr. </span><span class="font6">Coolidge and to recognize that he has fallen under . the sway of Roman Catholic suggestion, as did President Wilson. The Roman press boasts that his speech will bring him a million Catholic votes. If instead his speech had aligned a million Papal votes against him, 'America would be better pleased. When Mr. Coolidge paid honors to the Holy Name Society and feasted Cardinal O’Connell in the White House he gave signs of his condition. Poster Stearns, son of Frank Stearns, the President's most intimate friend, is a Roman Catholic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This phenomenon, recurring so often, of a Protestant American, reared in good surroundings and seemingly fitted to understand the spirit of Americanism yet falling under the mental control of pwery, requires </span><span class="font8">ex</span><span class="font6">planation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The fact is that control of a man’s mind can be gained by adepts in the art of telepathic suggestion and occult mental manipulation. For more than 200 years the Jesuit order has made evil and malignant use of its knowledge that a means of exerting hypnotic mental influence exists, by which the thoughts of a person against whom this unseen but potent current of thought is directed can be guided and influenced. ... President Coolidge, in voicing the identical sentiments which the Roman Catholic hierarchy desires him to voice, plainly shows to the enlightened observer that he is becoming subject to Jesuit control and has already fallen under it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">A Pageant of Truth </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">By Rev. G. A. Studdert-Kennedy, M. A. </span><span class="font5">(Reprinted from the British magazine, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">John Bull)</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">A</span><span class="font8"> PAGEANT of modern war as it is might not be beautiful, but it would be wholesome.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">First might come the fighting troops in gasmasks, with goggles all complete, sweating, gasping, cursing inwardly the beastly things as they tramped beneath their packs. With them would march the special instructors in methods of swift and silent killing, the men who teach us how to kick a man in the vital parts after you have seised him from behind and thrown </span><span class="font8" style="text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font8"> down, and how to drive a bayonet in far . enough, but not too far, so that you can quickly pull it out and ram it Into someone else’s stomach.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Next to them might come the men for whom the war was really glorious—the profiteers and all who did the government on army contracts. They </span><span class="font8" style="text-decoration:underline;">mi</span><span class="font8">ght come in their cars, with their names, titles and decorations displayed outside.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Next to them might come the glorious array of unemployed. They ought to have a place of honor because they paid for the war, and suffered to save British credit, and allow us to pay our debts without asking anything of our debtors. They might carry a banner with “God save Bethnal Green and give us homes for fires to burn in&quot; on it, and the band might play “Land of Hope and Glory”; it would be very suitable; they know all about hope and glory—especially hope.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Next we might have a contingent from the </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">lunatic asylums </span><span class="font8">with keepers in attendance. All the men that were driven mad by the war, and the women, too; there are lots of them hidden away, gibbering, raving and muttering blasphemies to themselves all day long.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">They might be followed by the crippled and diseased, with a special body of men and women who became infected with disease, the curse of modern armies, with the blind and rickety children they have had since the war to improve the race and make up for the loss on the battlefield.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Then come the children whose lives were maimed and bodies crippled by the air-raids, carrying flowers for the women and children who were killed. These might be drawn from all the nations involved, and would include a number of “enemy” children who were crippled by our gallant air force doing their duty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">After them might come the widows, and with them all the women and girls who must go all their lives with empty arms-because their proper mates were butchered in the glorious war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The rest of the procession might be composed of representatives of the best liars among the nations, all those who wrote up the slanders, misrepresentations, spurious atrocities, and barefaced falsehoods that go to make up war propaganda and fan the passions of the people into a good strong flame of hatred and of fear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Finally, all the politicians who made the peace, and thus made quite certain of another war, might come bearing an illuminated copy of the Treaty of Versailles as an offering at the Cenotaph.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">All that is bitter, but it would not be as bitter as the truth. There could not be a pageant of truth, because men and women could not bear it. It would be brutal, blasphemous, cruel, sensual, foul and filthy beyond the power of language to express.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark25"></a><span class="font12"><a name="bookmark141"></a>Is “Trinity” Doctrine False? </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">By p. </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;">k. PqoI&amp;</span></h5>
<p><span class="font17">I</span><span class="font8">N The Golden Age, March 28th, 1923, page</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">415, Studies in The Harp of Gon, is found some wonderful information. This study shows it to be an unwarranted conclusion that Jesus was God Himself. Can it be that the “Trinity” doctrine is false? How reasonable to believe that God the Father is not his own Son, but that Jesus, another person, is the Son of God I We read: “Again Jesus said: It is also written in your law, that the testimony of two men is true. I am one that bear witness of myself, and the Father that sent me beareth witness of me.” (John 8:17,18) Thus Jesus definitely fixes the fact that he and the Father are separate and distinct beings. This passage should be conclusive to such students as have weighed all evidence on the subject.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">But not all Bible students get a comprehensive view on the subjects they study. They segregate. Some take one small text and build a theory on it, instead of including all similar passages and getting a view that will harmonize all. So when we quote, “I and my Father are one” (John 10:30), we should include the prayer of Jesus, “That they also my be one in us: . . . even as [in the same way] we are one.” (John 17:21, 22) We should also include that man and wife are one (Genesis 2:24; Matthew 19:5), “And they twain shall be one flesh.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">We can easily see how man and wife are one, when it comes to maintaining a home and bring-</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">• '_____________________________________________ ing up a family; but when taken literally, that they are one in person, essence and substance, we do violence to reason, mathematics, and common sense. If we violate every attribute of the human mind, then there is no way left to determine whether we know anything or not. So these scriptures must not be segregated nor made a basis for a theory, but harmonized according to reason and common sense.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">There is another important fact shown in the Scriptures, which illustrates the fallacy of the trinity theory. I will put it in the form of a question. If Jesus was God Himself, why did He not have the holy spirit before His baptism? All four of the Gospels state that Jesus received the holy spirit after baptism. (Matthew 3:16; Mark 1:10; Luke 3:21,22; John 1: 32-34) So, either Jesus did not have the holy spirit before baptism or, if He did, then He did not receive the holy spirit after baptism, although it is so stated in the Scriptures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It does seem that if Jesus had been God Himself, Jesus would have had the holy spirit at all times; But the Scriptures speak to the contrary, and the Gospels show that neither Jesus nor the apostles performed miracles until after they had received the power from on high. Jesus never claimed to be equal with God, as trinitarians would have us believe. On the contrary He plainly declared, “The Father is greater than I.”—John 14:28.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font12"><a name="bookmark142"></a>When Lincoln Worried</span></h5>
<p><span class="font17">T</span><span class="font8">HE wise lawyer, Abraham Lincoln, is reported to have said this about the ferocious attacks which were so frequently made upon him:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">If I </span><span class="font6">were trying to read, much less answer all </span><span class="font8">the </span><span class="font6">attacks made on me, this shop might well be closed for any other business.

<p><span class="font8">Following Lincoln’s example, we waste very little time over attacks made upon us, or the things we believe or do.

<h5><a name="bookmark26"></a><span class="font12"><a name="bookmark143"></a>Whom Do You Honor?</span></h5>
<p><span class="font5">(Radiocast from Watchtower W8BR on a wave teagth of 2T2.6 meters, by Judge Rutherford.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">T</span><span class="font8">HE purpose of these lectures is not to hold up any one to ridicule nor to harshly criticize any one. The purpose is to point out the truth that each one may be able to have a proper vision of himself and God’s plan, that he might take the course which will be to his best interests. We are all prone to error because of our imperfections; and the better we can understand the Lord and His way and follow as He has directed, the better shall we all be.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">St. Paul, the inspired witness of God, in Romans 13:7 admonishes us to give honor to him to whom honor is due. The question, Whom do you honor? implies that there is some one who receives the highest honor that you can pay. But, one may properly ask, how may we know to whom the greatest honor is due? I think that we shall agree that this can be best understood by a clear knowledge of what is the truth. The Bible is the* truth, and we should weigh the evidence offered by the standard of the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Honor means a manifestation of reverence and respect toward one because of a supposed or real worth. If of real worth it means that such one possesses dignity, beauty, excellence and majesty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Men love to be honored. The quality of ap-probativeness in each man causes liim to love honor. .Honor is bestowed upon many who are not worthy of it. There are others who are worthy of -some honor and who douiot receive it. </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font8">prophet has no honor in his own vicinity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Sometimes honor is bestowed gladly. When so done love is usually the prompting cause. There are other instances in which honor is bestowed by reason of duress, either directly or indirectly exerted. There are times when man is honored by others because it is thought to be policy so to do. Where true honor is merited and gladly bestowed love is the moving cause. Such honor is the only kind that is wortily bestowed or received.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">- The tendency is, and has always been with the world, to honor men who are great heroes in war. Shortly following the World War there came to America a man who had gained the ferocious •.itle of “Tiger”. Great honor was bestowed upon him by the American people. It was doubtless deemed good policy so to do. It woukl hctoly be proper to say that real love</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">of the people for such an one prompted the honor. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">About the same time there came to America the generalissimo who had led the Allied armies in the bloodiest conflict of the ages. Millions of poor souls had gone down in a terrible death while he remained in the rear. Great tribute was paid to him because, figuratively speaking, there dangled from his belt the scalps of many poor human beings, whose life blood had been spilled at his command.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">There are other instances in which men receive great plaudits. Some time ago there came to America a great clergyman. When he and red in the city of New York hundreds of thousands turned out to pay him tribute. He came garbed in all his garments of glory and beauty. Many bands of music, were playing, and banners flying in his honor, while the multitude bowed before him, and many kissed his hand and the hems of his garments. The politicians and the financiers took their places in the procession, that they might catch some of the reflected glory. The public press carried many glowing accounts of this wonderful reception of a man. He was supposed to be the representative of the. Prince of Peace; yet he had been in the foremost ranks of those advocating the World War which had filled the earth with widows and orphans, and drenched the ground with tears and human blood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">What a contrast when the Prince of Peace was on earth! Ecclesiastics of His time led the rabble to dishonor Him. I dare say if Jesus Christ should arrive at the New York harbor today and with His twelve apostles humbly inarch up Broadway, teaching the doctrines of peace and love and good will in opposition to war, He would be spurned and ignored by many and probably arrested before He had reached Twenty-Third street.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">There must be a reason for this. There is a reason. Why are honor and glory bestowed upon financiers who rob the people? Why upon warriors who fill the earth with sorrow and distress? Why upon politicians who resort to fraud and bribery to gain high office? Why do men bestow honor upon men who claim to represent the Master, yet who are proud and heady and who have waxed rich by taking the pennies from the poor?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">These facts are stated and these questions asked in order that our minds may be focused upon the real cause. We must go back further than the present selfish generation. The cause originated long, long centuries ago. It is found in the Bible account of creation and what followed thereafter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Scriptures inform us that the Logos was the beginning of God’s creation. Thereafter the Logos served as the active agent of Jehovah in the creation of all things. Amongst the other creatures created was Lucifer. He is described in the Scriptures as being a wonderfully beautiful creature. Without doubt the Logos was just as beautiful or even more so, but Lucifer was more showy. The Prophet Ezekiel in 28:13,17, describes Lucifer thus: “Every precious stone was- thy covering. . . . Thine heart was lifted up because of thy beauty.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">These two sons of God, the Logos and Lucifer, are designated in the Scriptures as “the Morning Stars”, the bright shining ones. There was a great celebration held in heaven at the time when God laid the foundation of the earth as a habitation for man. The Scriptures indicate that all the sons of God came together, at Jehovah’s command; and that when God announced the creation of the earth these Morning Stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy.—Job 38: 4-7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">One of these sons, Lucifer, became disloyal. The other son, the Logos, has ever remained, and ever will be, loyal to His Father, Jehovah God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">God made Eden, a beautiful park or place on the . earth. He then planted a garden eastward in Eden; and then created a perfect man and put him in Eden. Then He made a perfect woman to be man’s companion; and in Eden He placed Lucifer as overlord or overseer of man. The entire organization was Jehovah’s, created for His own glory and pleasure and for the benefit of His creatures. All were dutybound to honor Jehovah because honor was due Him. Love should have prompted everyone to thus honor Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font8">wicked, traitorous ambition sprang up in </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font8">heart of Lucifer. He conceived the thought of turning away man from Jehovah that he, Lucifer, might receive the honor and glory to Which God was justly entluiea. To accomplish this he resorted </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">to lying and fraud. He </span><span class="font8">deceived</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Eve and induced her to violate the law of Jehovah, the penalty for which had been announced as death. Adam joined her in the transgression ; and Jehovah, in carrying out His just and righteous laws, sentenced them to death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Jehovah degraded Lucifer by giving to him the names of Dragon, Serpent, Satan, the Devil, all of which bespeak his wicked disposition and mark the course, that he would take. God did not take away from him, however, at the time the right to be overlord of man, but drove man from the beautiful Eden and caused him to feed upon the elements of the earth, which gradually produced his death, during which time his children were born. Lucifer proceeded in his nefarious course and diligently put forth his efforts to turn the minds of the creatures of Jehovah away from God that he, Lucifer, might receive the honor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">God organized the nation of Israel, and gave to that people a code of perfect laws for their own benefit, and established the true religion. God well knew that those who worshiped Him would be kept away from the course of wickedness. Satan had induced the other nations to turn away from God. Yielding to the seductive influence of Satan and his agencies the nation of Israel fell away from God; and in the year 606 B. C. Satan became the god of the entire world. St. Paul speaks of him in 2 Corinthians 4:3,4 as “the god of this world”. The Lord Jesus refers to him as the prince of the world. Satan is particularly marked with selfishness, wickedness, pride and ambition. He has planted malice, hatred, ill-will and murder in the hearts of men, and has induced the ruling factors of the world to oppress the pe&quot; de, to engage in bloody war, and to indulge in intrigue to keep the people subject to him. It is Satan that pushes forward selfish organizations and subtly induces mankind to worship war heroes, worship men who have arrogated to themselves the power and honor of Jehovah. Thus Satan has turned the minds of the people away from the true and living God. He has even planted in the minds of the mass of humanity the thought that God is merely a blind force. He has induced many to say, “There is no God.” '</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The great Jehovah has not interfered with Satan in taking this course until God’s due time. He has waited to give man an opportunity to see the baneful effects of sin; and the time has come now that Jehovah will get Himself a name by teaching the people the truth in His own good way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Jehovah is the great God, besides whom there is none. He is the great First Cause, the Author and Creator of all things that are good. He is the Author of the great plan of salvation for man, which He is working out in His own sovereign way. His true and faithful and loyal Son, Christ Jesus, is Executor of this great plan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The psalmist tells us (Psa. 14:1): “The fool has said in his heart, There is no God.” It is Satan that has induced man to be such a fool. If man would stop and consider a moment the things that he sees about him, he must conclude there is a great, wise and loving Creator. For a moment let us behold the trees, waving their arms to the music of the winds. Mark the flowers that grow out of the soil, yielding to the vibrations of the sun and giving forth their sweet perfume. Note the little birds that fly through the air, warbling their songs of praise. See the great rivers that wind their way through hill and vale and on to the mighty ocean. Mark its waves with power irrestible, moved by the influence of the moon. Behold the sun that lights the earth by day and gives life to the vegetation of earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">And then mark man, a creature fearfully and wonderfully made. Who created all these things? Did they come by mere chance? The answer is that Jehovah God, the great First Cause, created the heavens and earth and the fulness thereof. His creation, the moon and the stars, the planets moving noiselessly along their fixed orbits, each bespeaks His majesty, His glory and His power. The psalmist, commenting upon these wonders of Jehovah’s creation, exclaimed: “O Lord, how manifold are thy works! in wisdom hast thou made them all: the earth is full of thy riches. So is this great and wide sea, wherein are things creeping innumerable, both small and great beasts.”—Psalm 104:24,25.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In Jehovah reside the attributes of wisdom, justice, love and power in equal and exact balance. He is love. Love is the perfect expression of unselfishness.' In every act He has expressed Himself unselfishly in behalf of man. While His justice required Him to put man to death for a violation of His law, unselfishly Jehovah planned to redeem man from death and, when the human race had received a full and complete lesson in the baneful effects of sin, to offer to mankind ? full and free opportunity to be restored to strength, health, happiness and life everlasting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In making this provision for man’s salvation from the evil effects of sin, Jehovah God made the great sacrifice of giving His beloved Son. Not that He forced this upon His Son, but He offered His loyal and beloved Son, the Logos, afterwards named Jesus, the privilege of carrying out His plan to provide redemption for the humankind. It was the love of God that prompted Him thus to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is written: “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”—John 3:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Life is the dearest thing to any creature. The entire human race was headed to complete destruction. God’s love provided this great gift, the Apostle Paul-refers to it as the unspeakable gift of God. Again the same writer, in Bomans 6:23, said that life is a gift from God, through Jesus Christ our Lord. He who provided this great gift could have been prompted by nothing else but unselfishness, which is perfect love.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Is not then God the one worthy to be honored ? In Bevelation 4:10,11 we are given a picture of the faithful ones in heaven, giving honor and praise to Jehovah for His manifold goodness. “The four and twenty elders fall down before him that sat on the throne, and worship him that liveth for ever and ever, and cast their crowns before the throne, saying, Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honour and power: for thou hast created all things, and for thy pleasure they are and were created.”</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark144"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark145"></a>Whom Do You Honor?</span></h6>
<p><span class="font17">I</span><span class="font8">N DETERMINING the question as to whom we should honor, surely there is no example that we could follow so well and properly as that of Jesus Christ. Even the Modernists admit that Jesus was a great teacher and a mighty man. Even the Jews admit that He was a great philosopher and teacher. The Christians recognize Him as the Redeemer and Savior of the world, the Son of the living God. These are told that they are called to walk in His footsteps because He left them an example.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">If the Lord Jesus is a worthy example for Christians, then surely He is a worthy example for all. If we find that men on earth are pursuing a course contrary to that which the Lord Jesus took, and by so doing they are receiving honor and glory, we should ask ourselves, Are they receiving honor and glory properly? Are the people properly bestowing this honor upon them? There are men on earth in high clerical positions. They are the ecclesiastics. When the profiteers and politicians assemble and provide for war, and the armies are brought together, these great ecclesiastics are called in and invoke the blessing upon the warring factions. They usually come garbed in their glorious robes, with great sanctimonious air. The mighty and the strong do them honor because they are supposed to be blessing the efforts of those who go out to kill.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">When the war is over, and the portraits of the warriors are painted, the clergymen are shown standing by the general and the captain. Amidst those who have taken human lives stand the same clergymen who receive the honor and plaudits of men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">These same clergymen have arrogated to themselves the power that belongs to Jehovah. They claim to be able to forgive sins, and receive money from the poor upon the pretext of praying their dead friends out of the place of suffering. They solicit and receive the honor of men. Was that the course of Jesus? Let us keep in mind that Jesus is the true, faithful and loyal Son of Jehovah God, the great active agent of Jehovah in the creation of all things, the one whom Jehovah honors above all others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">When Jesus came to earth He did not come with great pomp, with bands playing and banners flying. Nor did the clergy of His time receive him -with honor. He came proclaiming the honor of His Father. He said to the people, as written in Matthew 11:28, 29: &quot;Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.” John 5:30, 31: </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">“I</span><span class="font8"> can of mine own self do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is just: because I seek not mine own will, but the will of the Father which hath sent me. If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Because Jesus preached God’s message of love and His kingdom, the clergy of His time accused Him of having a devil. In John 8:49, 50 we read: “Jesus ant., cred, I have not a devil; but I honour my Father, and ye do dishonour me. And I seek not min® own glory: there is one that seeketh and judgeth.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Who had induced the Pharisees and the scribes to take their selfish course and to dishonor God? Jesus answered this question plainly when He said to them: <sup>&lt;</sup>Tf God were your Father, ye would love me: for I proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of myself, but he sent me. Why do ye not understand my speech? even because ye cannot hear my word. Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it.”—John 8: 42-44.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Satan, the disloyal son of God, has always dishonored Jehovah’s name. His purpose has always been to turn the minds of the people away from Jehovah. He is the god of this world. (2 Corinthians 4:4) He is the one that has caused wars, trouble and strife. He is the one who has induced man to build up organizations that bestow honor and glory upon men and take it away from God, who is justly entitled thereto.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">We should ask ourselves then, Am I bestowing my honor upon men or am I bestowing my honor upon God? Shall I be influenced by the great evil one, or shall I be influenced by the great mighty and good One, Christ Jesus, the loyal and beloved Son of God?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The psalmist advised us what course to take when he wrote: “Give unto the Lord [Jehovah] the glory due unto his name.”—Psalm 29: 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">When Jesus was on earth He was not honored of men. On the contrary He was dishonored amongst men because He honored God. It is written concerning Him in Psalm 69: 7, 8: “Because for thy sake I have borne reproach: shame hath covered my face. I am become a stranger unto my brethren, and an alien unto my mother’s children.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The true and faithful Christian, follower in the footsteps of Jesus, has not been honored of men; for he has honored God, and has refused to honor the Devil’s organization or any part of it. The Lord foretold in His Word it would be thus. The reason is that Satan has been the god of this world all through the Gospel Age, while the Christians have been in course of development; and it is Satan and his organization that have induced men to worship men</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark146"></a><span class="font12"><a name="bookmark147"></a>n. QOLDEN AQE</span></h5>
<p><span class="font8">in order that the minds of the people might be turned away from. God. For this reason the people have been kept in ignorance of the truth. Now the time has come for the people to learn th© truth: and when the peoples of this earth learn the real truth, when they known that Jehovah is the great loving’ God, who has made provision for them, and that Satan and his emissaries are their real enemies, then they will give honor and glory to Jehovah, to whom honor and glory are du®.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">- The popularity of Christians cannot com® until the Lord’s kingdom is established. Th® Lord told them in advance ‘That wo must through much, tribulation enter into the kingdom&quot;. But when His kingdom is established, and the people know the truth, then they will be honored and be a glory to Jehovah mid to His beloved Son. Jehovah God has bestowed the greatest honor upon His beloved Son and has provided that the bride of Christ shall share that honor with Him.</span></p>

<div>
<p><span class="font8">resistance of the church has shown their </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">love </span><span class="font8">and devotion to the Lord and thus developed characters that are pleasing unto him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>4SS</sup>When one first becomes a Christian he does not usually suffer so much as later, when he is more developed. He is at first designated in the Scriptures as a babe in Christ. As we deal with babes, so our heavenly Father deals with His baby children. As earthly babes are fed upon milk and other light diets, so is one when he first becomes a Christian; and his experiences are in harmony therewith, as the Apostle Peter says: &quot;As newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby.”— 1 Peter 2: 2.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font8">&quot;‘<sup>S0</sup>A boy or a girl in school who is being trained for a special purposeis required to have some hard mental exercise in order to develop the mind. For this reason many mathematical problems are required of the pupil; and other lessons are required to develop the mental faculties. One who is training for a race or other physical contest is required to have some strenuous experiences. With stronger reasoning are these principles true relative to the members of the new creation. These are being trained for the high and exalted position of membership in the royal family of heaven. Hence we may not be surprised to find often that their training is quite severe. The understanding of this requirement enables one to appreciate why Christians have never been popular and why they have suffered so much during the past nineteen centuries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">. <sup>4S1</sup>The psalmist wrote concerning the new creation: </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">“I</span><span class="font8"> am become a stranger unto my brethren, and an alien unto my mother’s children. For the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up; and the reproaches of them that reproached thee are fallen upon me.” (Psalm 69:8,9) Jesus became a stranger to the Jews in this, that they despised and rejected Him. Because of His zeal for the heavenly Father’s great plan, His earthly life was consumed. Satan had reproached Jehovah from the time of Eden; and now these reproaches fell upon Jesus. We should expect the body members to have similar experiences. And so the apostle quotes this text and applies it to those who are the followers of Jesus, saying, &quot;For even Christ pleased not himself; but, as it is written, The reproaches of them that reproached thee fell on me.”—Romans 15:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">'’‘•'■'Cod is a great economist. He makes the wrath of men and other creatures to result to His own praise. Satan and his seed have always persecuted and buffeted the Christians, and Jehovah has caused this persecution to result in the development of the members of the body of Christ. He could have prevented the church from suffering at Ss&quot; x’s hands had He desired </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">so </span><span class="font8">to do; but by being permitted to buffet them with trying experiences, Satan has demonstrated his own depraved character, and the</span></p>

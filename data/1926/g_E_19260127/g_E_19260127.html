<p><span class="font12">Study Your Life Insurance </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">By M. E. Riemer</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">T</span><span class="font7">HE above heading is the title of one of Roger can think that they are really getting something W. Babson’s letters to his clients, the finan- for nothing; but in fact they are paying very</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">cial gods of this country. If this advice is financially profitable and beneficial to them, why will it not be proportionately so to all holders of life insurance policies ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One writer has said: “There is nothing in which so much money is involved and upon which the welfare of so many people is dependent as life insurance.” So we will not argue its benefits which, I feel sure, are manifest on every side and to all of us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Of all the institutions of this world is there any one that smacks more of sacrifice, love and self-denial on behalf of others than does pure protection life insurance? As originally planned life insurance was a pure protection measure in behalf of one’s dependents, the “left-behinds”. Of this kind of life insurance Mr. Babson says that it is “a form of applied religion, where a group of people unite and all contribute to help the unfortunate one”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The predictions of the “housetop saints” of life insurance are that the time will come when insurance will return to this original form. This time will come when the debauch of investment insurance will have passed away and either when people will think or when law-makers appointed to protect them are forced to their duty.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark32"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark33"></a>Modern or Investment Insurance</span></h4>
<div><img src="g_E_19260127_files/g_E_19260127-2.png" alt="" style="width:15pt;height:18pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">UT noble as this institution was, selfishness has prostituted it; and the evil seed sown has brought forth its evil fruitage to all concerned. The statements, “What do I get out of it?” and “I do not want to put my money into anything that I have to die to beat”, have caused pure life insurance almost to disappear from the earth, or to so formulate itself that the golden straw could be drawn through the mouths of the greedy and selfish so that they dearly for the little they get or leave to their dependents. We refer to so-called investment insurance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Why should such a necessary thing as the protection of one’s wife and children be tampered with by adding features which militate </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">a</span><span class="font7">gainst the very purpose of life insurance, such as investment features, and which make this much-needed protection so costly that those w’ho need it most cannot take sufficient of it to really bring the needed protection to their families? Investment insurance is from 100 percent to 400 percent and 800 percent higher than pure protection life insurance. One has said of investment life insurance that “the more you pay for it the less of it you have”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Why are not these investment features added to fire, automobile and liability insurance? Simply because the one paying the premium gets the protection. In life insurance the protection is for some one else; and to satisfy the selfishness of the individual paying but getting nothing, these investment features are added; and he pays dearly for them. If he gets the benefit of the investment, his beneficiaries lose the protection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Under the caption of this article, and in heavy type, Mr. Babson states: “Clients, however, who have the self-control to save of their own accord need not purchase life insurance as an investment. Buy life insurance as protection, the same as you would buy fire insurance or automobile insurance, but think twice before buying it as an investment.” This last statement should be underlined, and we shall </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">en</span><span class="font7">deavor to substantiate it in what follows. <sup>;</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is the purpose of this article to show the reader why investment insurance is so expensive, also to point out how he may, if he haa been led into this trap by high-pressure sales-</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">men with glib tongues, get back some of the hard-earned cash he Jias been .talked out of, which in some cases mounts up into the thousands of dollars, and still keep his dependents under as much insurance protection at less cost and oftentimes at no cost at all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Since, for the most part, the readers of The Golden Age are of that class who are using what they are and have in behalf of their fellow men, we feel that at least a &quot;part of this regained money will be -used to invite the golden age of blessing nearer, and hasten its advent to this poor groaning creation, -</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark34"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark35"></a>What Investment Insurance Means -</span></h4>
<p><span class="font15">D</span><span class="font7">URING the year 1922, the total income of 260 life companies, as given by the official Insurance Year Book .was ^,137,294,355. During that year they paid out to policy holders only $1,006,931,734, thus leaving in their hands for the year 1922 alone, $1,130,362,621. Less than half of what the public paid was realized by them as benefits.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">While all life insurance is 'assessment insurance, investment insurance is additionally an assessment upon a man's iestate at death, to pay his insurance money to, in some instances, as much as almost 100 percent of the face value of the policy. In other words, investment insurance is making your insurance company a joint participator with your left-behind dependents to the extent of, in some cases, as much as 50 percent. Again, it oftentimes robs the wife and orphans of all the insurance originally intended for them. Investment life insurance also makes the cost of insurance so high that the necessary amount cannot be carried upon one’s self to the loss of the widow and orphans.' We shall endeavor to prove this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Investment insurance is any kind of life insurance other than pure protection, or straight life insurance. Any policy carrying cash surrender, or loan values is investment insurance. Under this heading come the endowment policies, in 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 year terms; also the limited payment life insurance policies for the same year periods and ordinary life policies. These are practically the only policies written by the so-called old-line companies, with the exception of the term/policies and the yearly renewal step-rate policies.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark36"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark37"></a>The Life Insurance Bargain Counter</span></h4>
<p><span class="font7">fpO STUDY life insurance both as investment and as pure protection we will introduce them under the names of The Skinner Life Insurance Company and The Blesser Life Insurance Company. Under the Skinner Company will be represented all investment insurance companies; under the Blesser Company, a<sup>1</sup>’ straight or pure protection life insurance companies; and the rates used for each will be those of the most representative company in each class.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Skinner Company has the following prices at which $1000 of life insurance is offered to a man thirty-five years of age:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><sub>v</sub> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annual </span><span class="font5">Premium</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Ten-Year Term &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$ 14.50</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark38"><span class="font5">Twenty-Year Term</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark39"><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Whole Life &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">,</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark40"><span class="font5">Twenty-Pay </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Life</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark41"><span class="font5">Fifteen-Pay Life ,</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark42"><span class="font5">Twenty-Year Endowment</span></a></p>
<p><span class="font5">Fifteen-Year Endowment &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;' ' 69.52</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Ten-Year Endowment &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;105.87</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Foregoing we find $1000 of life insurance presented at eight different prices under term, whole life, limited-pay life, and endowment life insurance. Let us translate this into the cloth<sub>?</sub> ing business, letting a suit of clothes take the place of the $1000 life insurance, the prices at which it is offered indicating the kind of policy being illustrated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">After you have picked out the suit you want, the salesman offers you the following methods of payment:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If you take the suit in ten days the cost will be $14.50.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If you want twenty days in which to callfor it $16.24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If you want to call and get it any time you please, then you must pay $28.11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If you want to call for it any .time, and also desire the privilege of returning it before wearing it and receiving $20 in exchange for it, the price is $38.34.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If you want the suit and in addition want a chance on an overcoat of the same value, and in case you win .the overcoat you lose.the suit, then I must charge you $105.87.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">What would you think of a firm offering a suit at such an array of prices, or of a shoe dealer having eight or ten prices for the same pair of shoes?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Let us suppose that eight men all thirty-five years of age, A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H, should each take out one of these policies with the Skinner Company, for $1000; A taking a 10-year term policy, B a 20-year term policy, and so on down the list respectively to H, who took the 10-year endowment policy. And let us also suppose that they all died from a pestilence during the tenth year of their policy life. Each would leave behind just $1000 in insurance, regardless of how much each had paid, whether it was $14.50 per year or $105.87 per year. Let us note the various amounts each paid for $1000 of insurance: A $145.00; B $162.40; C $383.40; D 383.40; E 459.10; F 519.10; G $695.20; and H $1058.70. II would have paid in 58.70 more than he leaves in insurance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Now, if the Skinner Company solicits insurance for $1000 for ten years at $14.50 per year, it must make money at that rate; and it does, for insurance would not be offered at that price unless it were not only self-sustaining but profitable. How much then does each of the other seven kinds of policies bring in to the plethoric purse of the Skinner Company?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Counting money worth 4 percent interest, , compounded annually (whereas the insurance companies make 6 percent and more on their investments), the sum each would donate over and above the $145.00 which A would pay in in ten years to the Skinner Company for the cost of his insurance, would be as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A $145.00</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">B 145.00 plus $ 21.73 C 145.00 ” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;45.08</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">D 145.00 ” &nbsp;&nbsp;297.76</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">E 145.00 ” &nbsp;&nbsp;392.31 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">F 145.00 ” &nbsp;&nbsp;467.25</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">G 145.00 ” &nbsp;&nbsp;687.20</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">H 145.00 ” 1141.21</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">&quot; Now notice that the amounts in the righthand column are additional to the $145 at which A got his insurance. These ad.ded amounts, are, therefore, absolute donations to the company or, in other words, they represent assessments against the policy holder with which to pay his own insurance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Note also that H, who carried an endowment policy, in his anxiety to get the $1000 himself instead of leaving it to his dependents, actually paid out $1,141.20 more than it would have cost him to leave $1000 to his beneficiary. In other words, had H taken a ten-year term policy at $14.50 per year, same as A, and then placed the </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">difference between this and what he paid for an </span><span class="font7">endowment policy into a savings bank giving him 4 percent interest compounded annually, his widow would have received at his death the full $1000 life insurance, and the bank account would have also netted her in the meantime $1,141.20, giving her in all $2,141.20; whereas the Skinner Company gave her $1000 on the endowment policy and has the $1,141.20 for itself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Now what is true of II and the miserable unbusinesslike bargain he got in his endowment policy, is true of all holders of investment insurance policies; and that in proportion to tha amounts paid as premiums above what straight life insurance really costs per year. Fortunately these sums can be regained by a proper manipulation of one’s insurance, be the policies three or thirty years old, as I shall herein show.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark17"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark43"></a>The Loan Value of Insurance Policies</span></h4>
<p><span class="font7">ITT let us examine further into the “good” features of this investment insurance.</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19260127_files/g_E_19260127-3.png" alt="" style="width:15pt;height:18pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">Let us note their loan values. We will suppose that D took the twenty-pay life policy at the age of twenty-five and has paid his 20th and last payment. He now feels like Jack Horner, commending his wisdom and prudence in making such a good investment. But unlike J ack, who took out a plum, D has just put in his last plum. D, now forty-five years of age, becomes hard pressed for money; he wants to buy an auto; and seeing that he has a $500 loan value in his insurance policy, he borrows this amount from the Skinner Company and pays 6 percent on the money, which is $30 per year. Like 90 percent of all policy holders who borrow upon a policy, D never paid back the money. Some three or four years later D, having suffered an auto accident, is brought home dead. After his burial his wife looks up his $1000 life insurance policy and finds that she can realize only $500 upon it, the other $500 having been borrowed by D three or four years previously.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">All this time D had been paying $30.00 a year to maintain this $500 insurance upon his life. He could have merely accepted the $500 loan and let his insurance lapse; but to maintain the $500 insurance he, must pay $30 a year interest on it. At this rate D has been paying for insurance at the rate of $60 per $1000. When he started at the age of twenty-five he paid $31.80 per $1000; but now, after having finished </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">his</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Iasi </span><span class="font7">payment (?) he must continue to pay and pay double; that is, he must pay $30 interest on $500, or at the rate of $60 per $1000. A fine investment this!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Let us suppose that after D had carried his policy for fifteen years he borrowed $340 on it, which was its loan value at that time. He must continue to pay $31.80 premium for $1000 insurance but has only 660 insurance actually. In addition thereto he must pay $20.40 interest on the $340 he has borrowed, making in all $52.20 per year for his $660 life insurance. At this rate he pays $80.00 for $1000 life insurance, whereas when starting he paid $31.80 per $1000. Note well how cheap (?) it gets the longer you have it! Truly, the more you pay the less you have.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“But,” says D, “my policy has a cash surrender value”; meaning that at any time after the third year he can surrender his policy and by </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">cancelling his insurance</span><span class="font7"> accept a certain amount </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font7">cash instead. At the end of the 20th year* when it is paid up, he insists, it will have a cash value of $500. But let us see how much of a bargain this is. How comes this policy to have this cash surrender value in it? Answer:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Above the paying for $1000 of life insurance, </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">or </span><span class="font7">very nearly that, D has been paying enough in addition which at only 3 percent interest has matured an amount of $500 in twenty years. This is called a reserve, and is a feature of each investment life insurance policy. Now if </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">D </span><span class="font7">wants this amount at any time he loses all his insurance that he has been paying for. If he leaves this cash with the company and dies, his beneficiary gets only the insurance he has been paying for and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">the company appropriates </span><span class="font7">to itself the reserve or the cash surrender value he has been accumulating, which at maturity is about 50 percent of the face value of the policy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In.other words, when D dies he makes the insurance company a participator in his estate to the extent of the cash surrender value in his policy. When he paid his first premium his policy made to his beneficiary became his will to her; and as he (by paying excessive premiums) accumulated the cash value therein in addition to paying for his life insurance he was increasing the insurance company’s part therein, until at its maturity or at his death the policy vested the company with the full rights </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">io </span><span class="font7">this cash surrender value or reserve, thus making the company a joint participator in his will along with his left-behinds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Now upon maturity D’s policy has $500 cash value and $500 insurance in it. He can get the $500 if he will consent to losing the $500 insurance. He must leave the $500 cash to keep the $500 insurance. To anyone, $500 is worth $30. per year, which is 6 percent interest on that amount. This $500 left with the company makes D pay $30 per year for his $500 insurance, or $60 a year per $1000. Of course there are some “dividends”, but these are not contracted for in the policy and so are not to be depended upon. We will treat the matter of dividends later; but in no case do the dividends make the investment a paying one to the insured.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark44"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark45"></a>Pure Protection Life Insurance</span></h4>
<p><span class="font7">ET us suppose that D at the age of twenty-five years had taken a policy with the Blesser</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19260127_files/g_E_19260127-4.png" alt="" style="width:15pt;height:18pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">Company for $1000 straight life insurance. His annual premium would have been $12.55, instead of the Skinner Company’s assessment of $31.80—a saving of $19.25 per year. Instead of putting this $19.25 into the Skinner Insurance Company's funds he places it.in a savings account at 4 percent interest, compounded annually, and after twenty years finds he has $596 in the bank. <sup>1</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Now to get this money he simply asks his banker for it, and receives it; and his insurance is in no wise affected. He need not borrow it; for it is his own money. Hence there is no interest to pay. Having this $596 in his hands, he still has $1000 life insurance in the Blesser Company. Instead of paying the Skinner Company $30 for $500 insurance, he pays the Bless-er Company $12.55 for $1000 insurance, or about one-fifth of the Skinner Company’s rate. And instead of making the Skinner’ Company , a beneficiary in his insurance testament to the , extent of $500 (the cash value of his policy with them) thus robbing lais family of the amount, D leaves $1000 insurance for his widow with the Blesser Company, and $596 in his bank account, totaling $1596 to the widow instead of $1000 . as with the Skinner Company’s policy. -</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">If D with his policy in the Blesser Company places his $596 at 6 percent interest, which is very easily done, it nets him $35.76 per year. He then pays out of this sum $12.55 for his insurance and has $23.21 to add to his savings account, or to use as a good Golden Age reader would use it. Thus having taken out pure protection life insurance and taking charge of his own investment, he has insurance not only self-sustaining, hut has the cash value in his own name and control. Furthermore he receives as interest from his banker a nice additional sum of $23.21 each year, larger than any -o-called insurance dividend would ever be, which he can use as he pleases; and he is not required to </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">pay</span><span class="font7"> 6 percent for the use of his own money as with the Skinner Company’s policy, but can </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">get</span><span class="font7"> 6 percent on it himself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">If D takes out an investment policy on the 20-pay plan, he makes the Skinner Insurance Company his banker as well as his insurance custodian; and while the Skinner Company assumes both roles it cannot or will not fulfil both for him. He must choose between his insurance protection for Iris family on the one hand, and his cash value in his policy, on the other. To keep his insurance in force he must forfeit his cash, the Skinner Company acting as insurance custodian. To get his cash value he must lose his insurance, the Skinner Company acting as his banker. So it is plainly evident that both roles are impossible; for the Skinner Company while claiming to serve in both capacities, fulfils only one. If a banker appropriates . your investments to his own funds he would soon be serving time in Atlanta or Leavenworth; but an Insurance Company with its complicated investment scheme which takes advantage of legal technicalities, is perfectly immune. Would </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font7">sane person, understanding such a contract, enter therein?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When D keeps the insurance business and the investment business separate, by taking life insurance in the Blesser Company and placing his savings money with the banker, he or his beneficiary will receive full value of both the insurance and the investment, which is the logical and proper way to do.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark46"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark47"></a>Evils of Cash Surrender Values</span></h4>
<div><img src="g_E_19260127_files/g_E_19260127-5.png" alt="" style="width:14pt;height:19pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">ASH surrender and loan values attached to life insurance are a detriment to the very purpose which life insurance is intended to serve, viz., protection for the left-behind ones. Borrowing upon one’s insurance policy is called in insurance circles “Borrowing from the wid</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">ow </span><span class="font7">and orphans”. Statistics show that nine out of ten who thus borrow on their policy never pay the loan back. Since the widow's insurance money is minus the amount of the loan the husband has really borrowed from his widow- and never pays her back; and we all know that very seldom is a father over-insured, especially among the common people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Cash surrender values are more tempting the larger they become; and when an automobile fever or an oil fever or some other investment craze takes hold of a man he -will usually sacrifice his insurance to get the cash surrender value out of his policy. How many times has </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font7">widow found, to her sorrow and to the loss of her children in educational necessities, that the expected insurance money was either entirely gone or greatly reduced through the husband’s having made use of these good (?) investment features in his policy I</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">If a man cannot care for his family out of his salary and must therefore use up some of his insurance policy value in a loan, how can he expect his -widow to make a go of it when his salary stops entirely at his death and his insurance is minus the loan he made on it and did not pay back? These investment features only tend to thwart the real purpose and blessing that pure-life insurance was intended to bring. How many widows have wished that their husbands’ insurance policies had had no loan nor surrender values attached!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">For one to get the best of the Skinner insurance Company’s policy contract he must do the impossible—he must die to leave his insurance money to his family, and he must live to keep the insurance company from appropriating his cash accumulations to their own funds. Since he cannot do both, he is bound to lose one or the other. Why enter into a contract where you are bound to lose, which is the case in every investment life insurance policy?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The cash surrender value of a policy varies in proportion to the age of entry, the land of policy, and the number of years in force. The ordinary or whole life policies have the lowest cash value, the limited-pay life policies coming next, and the endowment policies having the largest cash value. These cash values are simply accumulations of what you have paid above what pure protection life insurance would have cost you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">I have before me a list of the fifty-five largest companies in the United States, and opposite</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">w &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sub>s</sub> n. </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">QOLDEN AQE &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<sup>am</sup>'&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">each </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">company Is amount of the total cash surrender values of the policies they had in </span><span class="font7">force during 1923. These amounts are really appalling. One company holds more than one and one-quarter billion dollars which really belong to the people and which are subject to their demand at any time they awaken to their privilege or need of it. If this is not withdrawn by </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font7">people it will be need, instead of the company’s funds, to pay their insurance policies at death. Many of these companies quote these investment figures to show how financially strong they are. But these investments do not belong to the companies and= therefore do not represent </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">an </span><span class="font7">item of strength hut rather the reverse. They represent a weak spot in these companies, which may yet prove to be their undoing in this dawn of that terrible day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Golden Age readers know what to expect in the not distant future, in respect to the overthrow of present institutions in a great time of trouble. Let us suppose that a real financial calamity or panic should visit this country, which -is not unlikely. Then suppose the securities in which a great insurance company has invested $1,250,000,000 of the people’s money would immediately shrink to a fraction of their par value. After this financial stringency has been on the people a short time their ready cash would become exhausted. Then they would look up their insurance policies and realize what they have of cash value in them, and would make a simultaneous demand upon the companies for these sums.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">How could these companies pay these sums, with securities dropped to say 50 percent of normal? Their inability to turn their securities into cash to pay back the investments of their policy holders would render the companies insolvent ; and the policy holders would lose not only their cash values but their insurance as ■Well. So a company doing otherwise a normal insurance business may be bankrupted over night by its investment business. Greed, having changed insurance, originally a benevolent institution, into a selfish banking business, may bring its own destruction upon itself as well as </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font7">loss to the greedy demanders of investment insurance yho cry, What do I get out of it? &quot;So are the ways of everyone that is greedy of gain; which take th away the. life of the owners </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">thereof'.’’—Proverbs 1:19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">There are about 260 life insurance companies </span><span class="font7">in the United States. ’Hie fifty-five largest ones hold in the way of cash surrender values on policies over $8,000,000,000 of the people’s money, which is almost t wice-as much money as there is currency in circulation in our country. How much all the 260 companies hold would be interesting information. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&gt;</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Since these’cash surrender values are accruea from big charges for life insurance in addition to the real cost of insurance, they plainly appear as assessments of the individuals to pay their own insurance; and yet these very companies cry down assessment insurance, when in fact all insurance is assessment. Since the so-called dividend money is larger or smaller according to the increased or lessened expenses of the companies, it is plainly evident that they assess the people yearly, as well as in a lump sum with a vengeance when the policy holder’s cash value is seized upon at his. death to make up his insurance money for his beneficiary. While doubly andgrossly assessing their clients, they have the audacity to cry down &quot;assessment” insurance!</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark48"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark49"></a>How to Realize on the Bad Investment</span></h4>
<p><span class="font15">I</span><span class="font7">N THE article referred to foregoing, Mr.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Babson cites the following illustration of what it meant to one man to study his life insurance. The case was that of a man fortyeight years of age, who had just completed his last payment on a $10,000 life insurance policy on the 20-pay plan. He was pleased to think that he had finished his installments and had such a good bargain. But Mr. Babson called to his attention the fact that he had a cash surrender value of $5,340 in his policy, and that by taking the cash and surrendering his policy he could place this $5,340 out on 6 percent interest, which would net him $320 per year; and that he could then take out $10,000 in pure protection life insurance for only $317 per year, leaving him $3 to the good. Then should he die, he would leave $15,340 behind, instead of $10,000, and thus increase his estate $5,340, or more than 50 percent of what his insurance was, and at not one single cent cost to himself. The &quot;dividends” which he would lose in the transaction, Mr. Babson showed would be a negligible quantity. Mr. Babson also laid stress on the matter of getting </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">his new </span><span class="font7">policy before sur-</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Tendering the old, to Be sure he could pass the physical examination.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In proportion to the age of entry, the kind of policy, and the length of time in force, all so-called investment insurance policies have these cash surrender values, with the exception of term policies. And amounts of cash proportionate to that in the case cited by Mr. Babson are possible from all such policies. But one should make sure that he can stand the physical examination to get a new life policy of pure protection insurance before cancelling his Skinner policy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“But,” someone will say, “insurance companies cannot carry on -without the funds represented in cash surrender values.” To prove to the contrary, let me cite the case of the insurance company whose rates for life insurance are given under the name of the Blesser Life Insurance Company. This company charges $12.55 for $1,030 life insurance as its yearly premium for age twenty-five. Where the Skinner Company charges $28.11 for ordinary life insurance per year at age thirty-five, the Blesser Company charges $17.68; yet the Blesser Company ranks second in safety of all the fifty-five largest insurance companies in the United States. By this is meant that there is only one company that has more money per $1,000 of insurance in force with which to pay risks than the Blesser Company. The company whose rates are used under the name of the Skinner Company, has a little more than one-half as much money with which to pay death claims per $1,000 of insurance in force as the Blesser Company has, though its rates are almost double that of the Blesser Company. Manifestly the Skinner Company’s excessive premium income goes to pay extravagant “expenses”, huge salaries to officials, etc.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark50"></a>Rate-Making Explained</span></h4>
<div><img src="g_E_19260127_files/g_E_19260127-6.png" alt="" style="width:15pt;height:18pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">O ILLUSTRATE how rate-making is done and also to show how insurance companies can make a “go of it” and also a profit on such reasonable rates as </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">real</span><span class="font7"> life insurance protection costs, we will explain that the American Mortality Table shows how many people out of each age will die each year per 1000 individuals. At thirty-five years of age 8.95 people out of each 1000 will die at that age. Now if the 1000 each pay only $8.95 per year per $1000 there will be $8,950 ; and thus $1000 insurance can be paid for each death, out of the premiums </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">on </span><span class="font7">1000 policies issued at this rate. Each </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">addi</span><span class="font7">tional 1000 policies would net the company </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">a </span><span class="font7">profit of $8950 in premiums annually.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Similarly at age of forty-five there will be 11.16 deaths in a thousand, making the rate $11.16 per 1000 of insurance. At the age of fifty, there will be 13.78 deaths per 1000, making the premium $13.78 per $1000 of insurance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Now to give a flat rate that does not increase, a mean or average rate is made of all the rates; and this is the level mortuary premium. Thus we see that at the lower ages more must be paid than is due according to the natural death rate, and that those who take out insurance young and do not live to a ripe old age have paid the insurance company too much money.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Now to this natural premium </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font7"> insurance companies add an amount to take care of the expense of keeping the insurance in force, and thus a pure protection insurance premium is arrived at. But the investment insurance companies of the Skinner type add a reserve premium to this, which makes up the loan and cash surrender values; and on top of this so-called “safety money” is still added a premium from which the so-called dividends are paid to the lucky (?) investor. (But more of this dividend business later.) This entire amount makes the big fat premium of the investment policy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Since, as pointed out above, the giving of </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font7">level premium throughout life makes all who do not attain a good old age pay more than they should, we can see one fruitful source of income or profit. Furthermore, insurance examinations keep out the poor list; and only healthy, sound people get insurance. Hence very few insurance companies have a death rate as high as fifty percent of what the premium will allow, called the expected death rate. Here we see where more of their money comes from.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Science, hygiene and dietetics have lengthened the span of life beyond what was common when this mortality table was figured, which was some sixty years ago. Again the large amount of lapses adds to their funds. Out of 1000 taking but life insurance 577 drop their policies before death, leaving only 423 death claims to pay out of each 1000 policies issued. All these factors tend to make premiums in mutual pure protection companies low compared with </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">re</span><span class="font7">suits received; but they seem to have no effect upon investment insurance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In taking out life insurance as pure protection, which is the cheapest and best, see that the policy has neither cash surrender nor loan values. Term insurance has lower premiums; but since we know not how long it may be needed, it is not best to take this form. If the proper company is found one can get a whole life or ordinary life policy for about what a twenty year term policy will cost, and the premium will be sufficiently low that it will not ■work a hardship upon anyone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In a pure protection life insurance company of the Blesser type there is only one rate for insurance no matter what kind of insurance you take, be it an ordinary life, a 20-pay life, or an endowment Life policy. Any money put into a protection life policy, above the regular life rate, is not forfeited to the company but at the time of death is added to the face of policy with 4 percent interest compounded annually. Or it will be given to you at any time upon demand, with interest; and in no wise is your insurance affected, this being maintained at the regular insurance rate.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark51"></a>Dividends—Refunds</span></h4>
<p><span class="font15">N</span><span class="font7">OW with reference to the dividends let me add a word of explanation. Almost all of us have had experience with dividends and know by actual experience what they have amounted to in the past; but no company will place in their contract or policy a specified amount promised for the future. Dividends are not to be depended upon. They fluctuate; and during the late war, it is said, they disappeared in some instances entirely.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The word dividend as used in connection with an insurance policy is absolutely a misnomer; so much so that some states have ruled against the use of this name and require that they be rightfully named </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">refunds.</span><span class="font7"> The name dividend is chosen artfully so that the unsophisticated can be made to believe that they have an investment in their life insurance policy; and such get a real “kick” out of their investment^), so complete has the deception been made. The fact is, these “dividends” are nothing but the returning of overcharges—the pulling of a sweetened straw through the policy holders’ mouths. People say that if they sell investment insurance there must be dividends, too. Both terms are misnomers and delusive. Since all insurance is in reality assessment insurance^ the dividend scheme has been invented to blindfold the people so they can be assessed </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">yearly </span><span class="font7">for their insurance w’ithout knowing it, being made to think that they have a dividend-paying investment. To realize how successful these companies have been one needs only to listen to the dividend talk indulged in and note the large amount of investment insurance that is sold yearly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In every life insurance premium there is, in addition to the other items referred to above, an amount for expense, for maintaining the policy in effect, called expense money. But not desiring to confine themselves to this stipulated amount, and fearing the cost of life insurance may advance sometime through unforeseen circumstances arising, the so-called investment insurance companies have added another amount from which the so-called dividends are paid, called in the inner circle “safety money”. It is from this so-called safety money that the excessive expenditures, above the stipulated expense money in the premium, are paid. As this expenditure increases the so-called dividends decrease, and vice versa.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">To show how thrifty these companies are in spending money, 202 life insurance companies, in 1923, exceeded their expense allowance in their premiums by the sum of $58,461,026. In 1924, there were 210 companies that exceeded their expense allowance by $75,416,021. Policy holders had to pay for this prodigality. If the companies would have held their expenses down to their allowances in 1924, a total of $75,416,021 more would have had be to handed back to the people as refunds, as required by law, from premium overcharges, called by the high-sounding name of dividends.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This “safety money” acts as a sort of buffer between the policy holder and the company, by which the companies can give full rein to their marvelous' spending powers, and through which they can keep the policy holder believing he has a dividend-paying investment. The president of a western life insurance company in addressing his agents said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Dividends can be paid only because the premiums collected were too high, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">it is in no sense a profit.</span><span class="font5"> To get dividends </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">one must literally buy them, the increased premium paid being the price.</span><span class="font5"> Dividends are merely the return of that part of the premium in excess of the amount necessary for the company to pay all its expenses and losses and to set aside the .required reserve.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">How wonderful all this is! Just take note: You pay all the expenses; you pay the losses (that is, your own insurance) and also your cash surrender and loan values. You get one of these and then get the thrill of thinking that what is left, if any, is a “dividend”; that is, if you do not know any better. Cannot a person with only half an eye see that this is purely an assessment arrangement, the price of insurance varying as the dividends fluctuate?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In event that unforeseen circumstances such as famine, pestilences, wars, etc., should force the cost of insurance up, the so-called dividends would go down; and when these dividends would reach the zero mark, no more money being available from the policy holder, the company would be bankrupt and the insurance would be lost; whereas if the so-called level premium, which is anything but what its name implies, did not limit the assessment, a little more may tide over a crisis and save all for the policy holder and later possibly return to normal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Whenever spendthrift organizations, such </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">as </span><span class="font7">the investment insurance companies have proven themselves to be, are given an amount such as the “safety money”, throughout all the lengths and breadths of which they may let their prodigality meander at will without fear of legal restraint, you can bet your last dollar that expenses will not be held down to anything like the minimum; and statistics bear out this </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">fact.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One insurance paper, which incidentally has ceased to exist, doubtless due to its unappreciated activities in showing up existing conditions, tabulated the expenditures of the leading insurance companies and showed how much each company expended to keep $1000 of insurance in force per year. The company whose rates are quoted above under the name of the Blesser Company ranked first of all the companies in economy, spending $2.85 per year to keep $1000 of insurance in force. This company makes no premium charge for more than its economical expenditures, and consequently pays no dividends. It limits itself to its allowances. It has a true level premium. Among the other companies the expense to keep $1000 of insurance in. force per year runs as high as $15.31. So one can see for how little insurance can be maintained, and also how much can be spent to maintain it if sufficient latitude is given in the “safety money”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">In a </span><span class="font7">late issue of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Literary. Digest</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> and </span><span class="font7">also in the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Pictorial IlevLiv</span><span class="font7"> there appeared a full-page advertisement of an insurance company calling itself the largest, in which the entire page. was used to advertise investments; while its supposed business of life insurance was never once touched upon. The 'words Life Insurance appeared only when the company name was used. How many other publications were used for this ad is not known, but the amounts expended for these two pages are indeed no widow’s mite.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Public utilities, state and national, exist to investigate and regulate public serving institutions and their charges. But the largest and most universal servant of the people, -the insurance business, goes uninvestigated and unregulated. Probably some of this “safety money” that is not returned as so-called dividends is used to make and keep the companies sale from investigation and regulation.

In a catechism for Fascists, put out with his approval, Italy is putting forth claims for territory now held by France, Britain, Switzerland and Austria. Having dominated their own country so completely, the followers of Mussolini may try it abroad and really start something. It would be interesting, for instance, to see what would happen if some wild Fascists should try to seize Malta, as the Mussolini catechism seems to suggest would be the proper thing to do. It would be quickly apparent that the British lion is a very real animal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Was Mussolini Plot a Frame-up?</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">T</span><span class="font7">HE Slavs declare that the alleged plot on Mussolini’s life, from which Mussolini escaped, and for which the pope gave thanks and arranged Te Deums throughout Italy, was not a plot at all, but a deliberate frame-up by Mussolini, intended to get himself looked upon as a hero in the eyes of the people. It would fit in well with the Matteoti murder, the specially made lace uniform and some other things of Mussolini design. At any rate, the Jugoslavs are infuriated at the charge that they had anything to do with it, and have retaliated by mobbing Italians generally throughout the country, burning Italian flags and doing other provoca-five acts, for which they subsequently apologized.</span></p>

In the case of Great Britain, the average rate of interest over <sup>z</sup>a period of sixty-two years is about three and three-eighths percent. The difference in terms represents Britain’s greater ability to pay. Italian citizens in America are much pleased with the settlement effected.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">“LEAVE THESE LUNATICS TO THEMSELVES”</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">A few days ago at the shipyards at Walker-on-Tyne, Great Britain launched a naval vessel of 35,000 tons, costing $35,000,000.

It is evident, however, that the European powers are still . convinced that they must be ready for a conflict.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">France is said to be keeping up an elaborate military establishment, despite the fact that she is not paying </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font5">debts incurred in the Great War. Most of the other nations suspect Germany Of arming clandestinely ; while Russia is maintaining a gigantic army, partly for the purpose of giving state jobs to an otherwise pauper population, but also with an idea that some day she might go about the task of imposing her communistic will upon her neighbors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Contemplation of this spectacle in Europe cannot fail to impress one that the wise people and the fortunate ones live on this side of the Atlantic, where the most of the swashbucklers are dead or else so discredited that they no longer disturb the trend of peaceful attention that permeates this continent. Also, we should make sure that impossible European lunatics are left to themselves in their mad appetite for war.

<p><span class="font7">DETERMINED attempt is being made to find out not “where the flies go in winter time” but where the halibuts go at least some of the time:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Science is endeavoring to find out the secrets of the halibut family. For years the habits of this important commercial fish have been a matter of considerable mystery; and the government decided that such a great deal depended on a thorough knowledge of the halibut’s origin, wanderings and customs that it would be </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">worth </span><span class="font5">while to make an investigation.</span></p>

The Toronto </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Star</span><span class="font7"> is an ardent protagonist, and in the present Ontario HydroElectric Commission is a further source of hope that this vast project might be proceeded with. An interesting item for comparison purposes appears in the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Star:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Supporters of the deep St. Lawrence ship channel project should take courage from the latest report of the traffic of the Manchester ship canal. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This canal is only thirty-five and one-half miles long and serves only one port. Yet last year it carried </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">5,</span><span class="font5">181,000 tons of freight having a value of $500,000,000. That was the best year’s -business since the canal was opened. Yet ever since 1915 the canal has paid dividends on a capital outlay of nearly $100,000,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The part of the St. Lawrence that has to be canalized in order to carry ships of 15,000 tons displacement is not forty-five miles long. The cost, leaving out the expense of setting up huge electrical generation works, would not be more than $200,000,000. Many lake ports would be served by the improvement. And a large proportion of the, agricultural and industrial products of a vast continent would use it and be exchanged for imports from all quarters of the globe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Financiers would give their eye-teeth to get the franchise rights for developing electric energy on the St. Lawrence. That indicates how attractive the St. Lawrence project is as a power scheme. But the navigation feature of the project is even more gilt-edged.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The people of this. continent cannot afford to overlook the benefits that the combined navigation and power enterprise offers them. Tens of millions of wealth are going to waste yearly in unharnessed water power, and tens of millions of dollars are being paid out needlessly by farmers and other shippers in. the form of excessive freight rates.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">On these nine subjects in a given time there were received from contributors a number of articles which, collectively, when weighed on the postal scales, tipped the beam at fourteen ounces, or a little less than one pound.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There is one more subject in which the magazine is interested; namely, Religion and Philosophy. Very few articles can be used in this department, as it is chiefly devoted to publishing the radio discourses of Judge Rutherford, and there is little religious space remaining.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">, But on this one subject, in the same time above referred to, there were received from contributors a number of articles which, collectively, when weighed on the postal scales, tipped the beam at fifty-three ounces or over three pounds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">What should the editor infer from this? Viewed mathematically the ratio would be something like this, allowing that the religious contributions were sent in to fill the one-half of that one department which is open, viz:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">14: 53: : 9: %</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Anybody can see that this proportion is very much lop-sided. If the contributors fairly represent the general interest of the subscribers, then the subscribers wish to see in the columns of the magazine 106 inches of religious matter to every fourteen inches of other items connected with the world which God made and over which they hope to reign for a thousand years. Is this correct?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Some of our subscribers have even gone so far as to indicate that in their eyes it. is an impiety for a certain contributor to write of earth.-ly works of the Creator, querying whether he could no longer find subjects connected with the Sdivine plan upon which to use his pen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">■ Do you wish the total reading matter on the aforementioned nine important subjects of human thought cut down to practically nothing in each issue and the religious subjects; which are already so well covered in another journal, <sup>J</sup> expanded so as practically to fill this magazine?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Or are you also interested in your Creator’s</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">earthly works and in the subjects that will al- -ways engage the major part of the attention of your fellow men? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Is there anything evil or unclean or improper or unwholesome in considering the purely mundane affairs of this earth which the Creator has filled with so many interesting creatures and so many interesting problems? Is “religion” the only subject you wish to have discussed?</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark161"></a><span class="font11"><a name="bookmark162"></a>More About “Handling the Kiddies” </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">By </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;">a.</span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;"> x. Swain (England)</span></h3>
<p><span class="font15">Y</span><span class="font7">OUR recent article on “Handling the Kiddies”, by J. A. Bohnet reminds me of some remarks heard from our late Service Director, himself a bachelor, on how elders should deal with their wives. If Evangelist Bohnet really puts such methods as he describes into practice as he travels up and down the country, the problem of “Handling the Kiddies” would resolve itself into wonderment—not that it was so badly done, but that it was done at all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Over in England parental control, though not all that it should be,-seems to be better than in America. But Mr. Bohnet even in America, would better be like the cobbler and stick to his last—addressing congregations and otherwise edifying his brethren—and leave the training and bringing up of the children to those to whom the responsibility belongs. We are quite prepared to admit, of course, that that responsibility is not always wisely and judicially discharged.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Here I would like to make a statement which I am not sure The Golden Age will wish to print: There is so much talk of “service work”, among Bible Students, that an unbalanced mind (And whose is not?) is likely to neglect obvious home duties in order to be, as they would say, faithful and to sell as many books as possible. I was glad to see in the October 1st Watch Tower a note of warning along this line, and </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font7">think it is one that is very much needed. One ©f the most obvious duties of parents is the training of their children; but too often, instead of the home being the center of activity and an outside influence for good, it is shamefully neglected. In this matter members of the </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">I.</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> B. S. A. </span><span class="font7">have not much cause to comment on those in the nominal churches. I am not suggesting confining activities to the home, but it is a poor advertisement of the coming kingdom for Christians to leave their own doorsteps dirty while running around cleaning other peoples’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As for Mr. Bohnet’s method: If he should come into my home and start bribing my children to do as they were told, leaving me with the option of further bribing them to induce obedience, I would prefer his room to his presence. Eurthermore, his expressed attitude of wagering in behalf of the four unruly boys would seem to be a tacit placing of himself on the side of rebellion and disorder as against those who are rightfully in authority.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Was not Mr. Bohnet really securing temporary peace and quiet for himself at the expense of the parents, who have to deal with the boys ever afterward? He says that as a result of his bribery they “respected and obeyed” him. I doubt it. They obeyed; but </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">respect</span><span class="font7"> is not won by bribery. As for the child of five, Mr. Bohnet’s action, and attitude was an impertinence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">With regard to the babies: Granted that both children needed cold water and cooling, such drastic action as his was likely to have very serious results; and he would not be on the spot to do the nursing and to undo the very dangerous consequences which might follow upon his lack of experience.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The correctness of the general principles of winning the goodwill and cooperation of children, and of giving infants that which soothes and cools them, is not in question. But Mr. Bohnet should be old enough and wise enough to know that his ignorance in carrying out the principle is immense, and might leave very serious after effects.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It has often been commented upon that grandparents, who have brought their own children up very strictly, will continually spoil their grandchildren and treat them as though they were playthings. Why is this? Is it not that they lack the feeling of responsibility? If they win the child’s cupboard love by feeding it at odd times with sweets, biscuits, etc., in defiance of the parents’ expressed wishes, they have not to nurse it, discipline and ■wash it or attend to its soiled clothes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">However, I have come to the conclusion that no representative of the I. B. S. A. would possibly seriously advocate such course of action as set forth in Mr. Bohnet’s article, and I believe he was simply doing a little “leg pulling”. He must have his little joke and probably wanted to see what sort of storm he could raise. Perhaps this is his method of calling attention to the fact that, if consecrated men and women marry and have children, it is their responsibility to bring up those children in the fear of the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It was once said to me by a mother: “I told my children that I did not ask for their love. I asked or demanded their respect and obedience; and these given, their love would follow as the night the day.” I think she was right. If consecrated fathers would see to it that they are in deed and in truth the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">heads</span><span class="font7"> and the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">priests</span><span class="font7"> of their households, that they love their wives as Christ loves the church; if consecrated mothers -would seek to train their children wisely and well and to reverence the husband; and then if both would work </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">together</span><span class="font7"> for the wellbeing of home and children, there -would be little difficulty in the proper training of those children, even in this liberty-loving age.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">An old Scottish woman once said: “Talk about children being strong-willed! They are </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">self-willed;</span><span class="font7"> and that self-will needs training. No child is strong-willed or self-willed enough to stand against the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">combined</span><span class="font7"> wills of the father and the mother.” Christian homes where there are children, with the father and the mother frequently out at classes or in service work to the extent that children are neglected or untrained, should not be. I am not criticising service in any form, if rightly carried out; but parents who provide not for their own—for their mental training as well as for their stomachs’ filling, have denied the faith. “A little thing is a little thing, but faithfulness in little things is a very </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">big</span><span class="font7"> thing.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This may sound to some as if I am judging. those -who go out in service work for the kingdom’s sake. But I do not mean it as such. Each Christian must decide for himself or herself as to how much or how best his time can be spent in the interests of the incoming kingdom. No one can decide for another. To his own master he stands or falls. As for neglecting our children: No one need put that cap on if it does not fit. The point is simply this with regard to “Handling the Kiddies”: No consecrated children of God should incur the responsibilities of married life unless prepared to carry out those responsibilities to the best of their ability. If the truth finds us with young children, then we shall best serve the kingdom interests by making the proper training of our children the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">first </span><span class="font7">though not the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">only</span><span class="font7"> mortgage on our time. Of course, some people, with the best of intentions and desires, seem to have no idea at all of how to train children. But they should strive to find out. And those -who have found out will not likely agree with the methods set forth in the Bohnet article.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font11"><a name="bookmark163"></a>Another Bachelor Offers Parental Advice</span></h3>
<p><span class="font15">W</span><span class="font7">ITH further reference to the article in your issue of October 21st, on the management of children, which contains some good advice:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">I have read many articles on the subject, and long wished to give my view, but never did so until now. I am more than seventy years old, have been in more than twenty states, and have met children of every class, bad and worse—and a few good, obedient ones; and I have observed how various parents managed them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">While their training may sometimes begin before birth, yet I have never found a baby under six months old but that wished to please its admirers. Hence, when a baby does anything mean or naughty, if the grown-ups laugh over it, baby ■will try to do the same thing again. But &quot;if every one frowns or looks displeased it will not be likely to repeat the act.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">So the main thing to do to have obedient children is for the parents always to watch themselves and not let their giggle box turn over every time the baby is laughably naughty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">No matter how funny may be the thing the ■child does or says, let no one laugh while the child can see him, but let every one frown if the word or act of the child is not right. - In this way any child can be taught to do right and to shun wrong.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">I never saw obedience developed in a child by telling it. twice to do a thing before making it obey, either by using the rod or by giving it a displeased and rebuking look. “Spare the rod, and ruin the child” is a true proverb. ‘If thou beat thy child with the rod, he shall not die [on account of the -whipping], but thou shalt save his soul from hell,’ is the Bible’s instruction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There is a great difference between merely “beating” and “whipping”, however. You might beat a child to death, but if you fail to make ■ it do what you said, you have not whipped it. <sup>! </sup>To whip means to conquer, not merely to beat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Never speak ill to a child nor quarrel with it nor scold it. Kindness is better than anger. You can catch more flies with a spoonful of honey than with a pint of vinegar. You will never And obedient children where one parent corrects and the other takes the child’s part; or where they allow the child to talk back or keep on whining or complaining. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-------- -------</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">To tame any animal always use kindness first, but you will be compelled to use harsh means where disobedience persists. Human beings are the highest order of animals, and must be controlled by the same rule.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">. Some parents quarrel with their children, and threaten fifty times a day to use the whip, but never do so. In such instances the child sees that the parents are lying and consequently it loses all confidence and does not belive anything its parents say.</span></p>

<p><span class="font15">I</span><span class="font7"> HAVE just read the article by the farmer’s wife in The Golden Age. She has turned one side of the shield and showed the farm hand as she found him. Now let me turn the shield around and show the farm owner as I have found him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Mr. Farmhand was brought up on a farm, is honest, sober, dependable and experienced. And, by the way, experience in a farm hand is searce-ly worth a dime as far as the difference in wages is concerned. For the love of God’s outdoors, and to give our children the advantage of the same&lt;we have lived on a farm as tenants for about twenty years. And during the twenty years of scrimping and saving we have not enough ahead to buy a decent coffin if it should be needed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Fully one-half of the farm owners will break any contract they have made -with a hand if it suits their convenience to do so. Besides that, they expect the hired man to work out in rain er snow; for which he merely gets straight time, same as in good weather. And he is often required to put in from one-third to one-half </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">days </span><span class="font7">Sunday feeding stock, without any pay.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Holidays usually are unknown to the farm hand, except Christmas day, and for this he often loses his wages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The house in which the farm hand lives is generally small, ugly and unpainted; with no conveniences and no fruit nor shade trees.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The farmer provides a horse with which his children may ride to school. But the farm hand’s children can walk through rain, snow, or mud, from one<sub>;</sub> to three miles, until at the age of ten or twelve years they can hardly sit oh a horse, much leSk ride one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">While the farm band and his children have a hard time on a farm, the farm hand’s wife has a harder one—-fio neighbors, no friends as a rule. Socially she is nothing. The attitude that others generally assume toward her would be amusing if it were not disgusting. Sometimes she is really superior in intelligence and character to those who look on her with scorn because of her poverty. I have quite often found one or two good souls in a neighborhood, who were real neighbors. But the wife of the boss is not one of these as a rule.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">And now about the broken contracts and </span><span class="font7">/other things which the farm hand and his family must endure. Here is our experience:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Farmer No. 1. Farm hand had an attach of heart trouble. Farmer broke contract and made him move. Move cost $50, which wiped out his .savings. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Farmer No. 2. Made contract with hired man for a year. His son decided to marry, so our contract was brushed aside and we had to move in the middle of winter, with a six-weeks old baby that took pneumonia as a result.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Farmer No 3. Hired my husband on straight time. It rained frequently, so farmer forgot the straight time agreement and for rainy days just paid for the hours of good weather—onefourth or one-half day, whatever it might be. I had to limit expenditures to three and one-third cents each per meal, for provisions for our family.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Farmer No. 4. Agreed, as part of hired man’s pay, to feed some pigs for him. But when we moved lie kept back $25 for pig feed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Farmer No. 5. Made big promises to induce us to come. Cost us $60 to make the move to get there. Farmer agreed to raise wages in the spring and to give us tw<sup>r</sup>o acres of ground for true, patches. But when spring came the faian-er cut wages instead of raising them, and the truck patch he offered us was a mile and a half from the house and of no account. The same farmer was sold out in summer and insisted that -we move and leave our garden; and he kept back half a month’s wages from my husband before he gave possession of . place to the new owner one month later.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Farmer No. 6. This man was honest as to wages, but suddenly took a notion to move the house we lived in, just after I had cleaned house, made my garden and set the incubator. He notified us on Saturday that they would move the house on Monday. They came, tore down the flues, and piled all my furniture helter-skelter into two little rooms. What could not go into the two rooms was piled in the granaries and barns. We had to live in the house while it was being moved. We had no heat except a small oil stove. The floors had big cracks in them; where, there were no carpets you could look down through and see the ground.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">They were a wee' moving that house. Then they put it into a My field behind a hedge fence. It had a twenty-acre field for a yard, and not a tree near, with the garden now a long walk from the house. This was early in the spring, and the flues were not put up until Decoration Day. When the children came in wet from their mile and a half walk from school I had to undress them and put them to bed, in order to get them warm.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">If the farmer wants good men to work for him, let him make a home-like place for them to live. It does not cost much more to make the tenant houses a little larger, with plenty of windows and a little pantry. Then let him provide a garden large enough, and a few fruit trees, apples, cherries and plums, with some nice grape-vines; and put in a good yard fence. Instead of that, farmers sell their hand fruit at market price; but they have enough waste or half-tended land on their farms to pay many times, over for the improvements suggested. If they would provide these things, then they could get the. better class of laborers, instead of driving them to town to live.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">If I did not believe that the Lord’s kingdom is near, when all things will be straightened out, I would try to see that each of my boys goes to town and learns a trade; for there is just a bare living and no conveniences for the farmhand’s family nowadays; and conditions will likely get worse instead of better. But the kingdom is just at the door, and our Lord will see that all get justice—the farm-hand and the farmer, too. Then every man shall sit under his own vine and his own fig tree, and none shall make them afraid.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Thank God! Satan’s empire is falling; and on its ruins Christ will build an empire that •will give lasting peace to all. And what the church is learning now, the whole world will learn under that grand and glorious rule, namely, the great lesson of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">love.</span><span class="font7"> And love will seek to do to others as we would have others do to us. -</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark166"></a><span class="font11"><a name="bookmark167"></a>The Foundation of the True Church</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4">IXadlocast from Watchtower WBBR on a wave length of 272.6 meters, by Judge Rutherford.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">D</span><span class="font7">URING the past 1800 years a great amount of animosity lias been aroused, by the discussion of religious questions. This should not be so. Men and women should honestly and without prejudice seek the truth. It is the,truth that sanctifies. Error never does any good work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jesus prayed to His Father concerning His followers thus: “Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth.” (John 17:17) Now if we claim to be followers of Christ Jesus, we should seek the truth from the Word of God always with an open mind, willing to be convinced of the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Much I shall have to say on this occasion will differ from what many good Catholics believe. But this should furnish no reason for animosity. I assure my hearers that I shall not discuss men, but only the teachings of men as compared with the Word of God. I am persuaded that there are millions of good Catholics who desire to know the truth and who believe that not all the truth is to be found in the teachings of men. Let us then, without prejudice, examine the Scriptures and, finding the truth, gladly accept it as from the Lord and not from men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Catholic church has long taught, and still teaches, that St. Peter is the foundation of the true church, that the popes of Rome in the order named are the successors to St. Peter and that therefore the Roman Catholic church is the true church. If this teaching is true and correct, then all of us should want to be Catholic. If a thing is right there is no advantage in fighting against it. On the other hand if the teaching is found to be wrong, what advantage is there in holding to such teachings? That I may not be misunderstood in stating what the Catholic church teaches on this question I quote from a book written by Cardinal Gibbons on ”“The Faith of Our Fathers”.. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">On page 92, paragraph one, the cardinal says: “The Catholic Church teaches also, that our Lord conferred on St. Peter the first place of honor and jurisdiction in the government of His whole Church, and that the same spiritual supremacy has always resided in the Popes, or Bishops of Rome, as being the successors of St. Peter. Consequently, to be true followers of Christ all Christians, both among the clergy and the laity, must be in communion with the</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">See of Rome, where Peter rules in the person of his successor.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">And again on page 95 of his book the venerable cardinal says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“To my mind the New Testament establishes nd doctrine, unless it satisfies every candid reader that our Lord gave plenipotentiary powers to Peter to govern the whole Church.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This teaching concerning Peter being the foundation and chief one of the Catholic church is based upon a conversation between our Lord and His disciples. This conversation is recorded in Matthew 16:13-18. Jesus said to His disciples: ‘Whom say ye that I am? And Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God. And Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-jona; for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven. And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter; and upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Then the learned cardinal says: “Here we find Peter confessing the Divinity of Christ, and in reward for that confession he is honored with the promise of the Primacy.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Now with all due deference to the cardinal I hold that these words of the Master do not at all prove what the cardinal claims they do and what is taught by the Catholic church. I hope my listeners will follow me and examine the texts of the Bible as I proceed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It will be noticed here that Jesus propounded the question to His disciples: “Whom say ye that I am?” Why should He be asking them such a question ? The answer is: That He might definitely fix in their minds that He was the great One who God had promised through the prophets should come; that is to say, the great Messiah or the Christo</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Peter gave the correct answer to our Lord’s question, namely: “Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.” To this reply Jesus said to Peter: ‘Men have not told you this truth, but it has been revealed to you by my Father which is in heaven.’ Then our Lord uttered the significant words: “Thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In the ancient language in which this text was originally spoken or written the word here translated Peter is from the word </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Petros,</span><span class="font7"> which means a piece of stone ; and the word rock used in the verse, “On this rock I will build my church,” is from the original word </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">petra,</span><span class="font7"> which means a mass of rock or stone, whether used literally or figuratively. A mass of rock or stone is used as a foundation upon which a building is erected. Used in a figurative sense it means the foundation truth upon which something is builded.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">To what then did our Lord refer when He said: “On this rock I will build my church”? It is quite manifest that He referred to the great truth stated by St. Peter, to wit: “Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.” The facts show that it could not have referred to anything else, because this was the subject matter under discussion. ■</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jesus did not say to Peter: “You are the foundation upon which I will build this building.” But lie drew out of Peter the answer to His question that He, Jesus, is The Christ; and Jesus replied: 'Upon this foundation, this mass of truth which you have spoken, which God has revealed to you, I will build my church.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">If we can find from other scriptures about which there can be no question that Jesus is the foundation and chief stone of the church, then we ought to for ever settle the question that He referred to this great truth of Himself to be the Christ, and to nothing else.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">St. Paul, the greatest of all the apostles, so understood it. He wrote that the foundation of the church is Christ Jesus, the Son of the living God. In 1 Corinthians, the third chapter, Paul is addressing members of the early church. Some of these claimed to be followers of Apollos, others claimed to follow Paul, while still others claimed to follow other men; just as today some are Catholic and some are Protestant. Then he adds: “Ye are Gold’s building.” “For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ.”—1 Cor. 3:9,11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Then the apostle, speaking as the mouthpiece of God, with the evident purpose of meeting the arguments of wise men who should live thereafter, says in verses 19 to 23 of this same chapter: “For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God: for it is written, He taketh the wise in their own craftiness. And again, The Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain. Therefore let no man glory in</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Paul here specially mentions Peter, </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">because </span><span class="font7">the name Cephas was one of the names of </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Pe</span><span class="font7">ter; and he plainly says that we are not </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font7">glory in men, but that Christ is the foundation and He alone, and that all things proceed from Him. The wisdom of men has subsequently taught that Peter is the foundation of </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font7">church and that other men have succeeded him in office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Of course the Lord foreknew how the great adversary would attempt to blind the minds of men and turn them away from the truth; and He forewarned the Christians against this very ’ thing through the words of'St. Paul.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Mark you here St. Paul says: “Other foundation can no man lay than . . . Jesus Christ” our Lord. The Catholic church has laid a different foundation, because it teaches that St. Peter is the foundation stone upon which Christ' builded His church.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The words of Cardinal Gibbons, as appears on page 97 of his book, paragraph one, are as follows: “Jesus, our Lord, founded but one church, which He was pleased to build on Peter. Therefore, any church that does not recognize Peter as its foundation stone is not the' Church of Christ, and therefore cannot stand, for it is not the work of God.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Let every one choose between the words of St. Paul and the words of the cardinal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Again St. Paul says in 1 Timothy 3:15: “The church of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth.” Mark that Paul did not say that the Cathode Church’ is the true church; because at that time the Catholic church was not in existence. What he does say here is that the church of God is the foundation for the truth.. Then the question arises, What is the true Church? St. Paul answers that in Colossian# 1:18 and 19: “And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">have </span><span class="font7">. the preeminence. For it pleased the Father </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">that </span><span class="font7">in him should all fullness dwell.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">And then in the 24th verse Paul says </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">that </span><span class="font7">the church is the body of Christ. Again </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font7">same apostle in Hebrews 12:23 says: </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The </span><span class="font7">“church of the firstborn, which are written </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font7">heaven,” This does not say any church system Whose names are written on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">;. Again in Ephesians 1:22 and 23 the same apostle says that God hath put all things under . the feet of Christ and given Him to be the Head over all things </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">to the church, which is His body. </span><span class="font7">Again in Ephesians 5:23 the same apostle says: “Christ is the head of the church.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Word of the Lord declares that by the mouth of two or more witnesses shall all things be established; and when the Lord produces two competent witnesses whom He approves, their testimony ought to be sufficient as against all others. St. Paul is one; now I introduce the testimony of another witness. The competency of this witness surely no Catholic can call in question; because this witness is St. Peter himself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">How did Peter understand this matter when the Lord addressed him, or afterwards when he was enlightened by the holy spirit? On the day of Pentecost St. Peter said (Acts 4:10-12): “Be it known unto you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye crucified, whom God raised from the dead, even by him doth this man stand here before you whole. This is the stone which was set at nought of you builders, which is become the head of the corner.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Here the Apostle Peter definitely states that Christ Himself is the stone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Subsequently St. Peter wrote to the church; and in his first epistle, he makes this matter so clear that a wayfaring man need not err therein. He begins this chapter by calling upon all to lay aside all malice and prejudice. His words are:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Wherefore laying aside all malice, and all guile, and hypocrisies, and envies, and all evil speakings, as newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby : if so be ye have tasted that the Lord is gracious. To whom coming, as Unto a' living stone, disallowed indeed of men, but chosen of God, and precious, . . . wherefore also it is contained in the scripture, Behold, I lay in Sion a chief corner stone, elect, precious: and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded. Unto you therefore which believe he is precious: but unto them which be disobedient, the stone which the builders disallowed, the same is made the head of the corner, and a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offence, even to them which stumble at the word, being disobedient ; whereunto also they were appointed: ye also, as living stones, are built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer up sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.”—1 Peter 2:1-4, 6-8,5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Here the Apostle Peter, to whom Jesus addressed the words in question, four times men- -tions Christ Jesus as the stone. He quotes from the prophet (Isaiah 28:16) where God had foretold that Christ the Messiah would be the chief corner stone, or foundation of the church. Therefore we have three witnesses, St. Paul, St. Peter, and the Prophet Isaiah; and surely every follower of Christ would accept their testimony, even as against the testimony of the venerable Cardinal Gibbons or any other man who has written on the subject.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark168"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark169"></a>One Church</span></h4>
<p><span class="font7">TS THEBE any Scriptural authority for the A existence of the Catholic church? There is none. Is there any Scriptural authority for the existence of the Protestant church? There is none. And why do I say that? Because the Scriptures declare that there is but one church, and that church is the body of Christ. Without doubt there are some Catholics who are true, faithful followers of Christ Jesus, and therefore a part of His body; and the same would apply to some Protestants. But there is no Scriptural authority to say that the Catholic church as an organization, or the Protestant church as an organization, is the church of Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The great foundation truth uttered by St. Peter when addressing our Lord, “Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God,” is the mass of stone or solid foundation upon which Christ has builded His church; and this is conclusively proven by the testimony of the three inspired witnesses above quoted.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark27"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark170"></a>How io Become a Member</span></h4>
<p><span class="font15">C</span><span class="font7">AN anyone by merely joining the Catholic or the Protestant church become a member of the true church? I answer: No. Membership in the true church is obtained in just one way; and that is the Lord’s way. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. <sub>;</sub> ,</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Briefly stated, it is this: One must realize that he is a sinner and desire to have his sins forgiven. As stated by our Lord, no man comes to the Lord except the Father draw him; thus</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font7">is he drawn. Then Jesus said: “No man come tn unto the Father but by me.” (John 6: 44; 14: 6) He must therefore believe that Jesus is his. Redeemer; and believing that, he must consecrate himself to do God’s will. This is shown by. Jesus’ words in Matthew 16: 24, which He uttered at the same time that He was talking to Peter. One must then be justified by Jehovah, as the apostle states in Romans 5:1,9; 8:31. He is then begotten by Jehovah, as stated by St. Peter in 1 Peter 1:3, 4 and 2 Peter 1: 4 and by St. James in Chapter 1, verse 18. This represents his baptism into Christ, as stated by . the Apostle Paul in Romans 6: 3-5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Now he is a new creature in Christ and a member of the church. (Romans 8:1-17; 2 Corinthians 5:17) He is now being builded up as a living stone in the building of God, of which Christ is the foundation. But in order to participate in glory Jesus said: “Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life.”—-Revelation 2:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">St. Peter is neither the foundation nor the head of the church. That being true, no man who has lived on the earth since could possibly be the successor of St. Peter as the head of the church. It follows, then, that there is no authority for the claim that the pope is the head of the church, with all due deference to his royal highness. St. Peter is one of the living stones in the church of God, of which Christ is the foundation and chief corner stone. Let: us give honor to the One to whom honor is due.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Gates of Hell</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">J</span><span class="font7">ES US on this same occasion said to S t. Peter: “L<sup>T</sup>pon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.” (Matt. 16:18) What is meant by that expression ? Does it mean that the Catholic system shall never fall? Surely that is not what it means; because the Scriptures show that the Catholic church is a part of the religious systems of this world, all of which will disappear to make way for the complete establishment of the kingdom of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The word “hell” here used is from the Greek word </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">hades,</span><span class="font7"> which means the grave, tomb or state of death. Surely our Lord did not here mean that none of His followers should enter death. It will be conceded by all that St. Peter died, that the disciples all went into death, that</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">Christians for 1900 years have been dying. It is even true that the Lord Jesus Himself went to hell. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At Pentecost St. Peter used the following words concerning the Master.- Quoting from the prophet he said (Acts 2:30-32): “Therefore being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him, that of the fruit of his loins, according to the flesh, he would raise up Christ to sit on his throne; he, seeing this before, spake of the resurrection of Christ, that his soul was not left in hell, neither his flesh did see corruption. This Jesus hath God raised up, whereof we all are witnesses.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Other scriptures show that Jesus was in hell for three days, and then was resurrected. It will be noticed, however, that this text says that the gates of hell shall not prevail against the church. What this really means is that all of those 'who will overcome and ultimately become members of-the church, shall not be held in the tomb or in the state of death. These participate in the first resurrection and thereby gain the complete victory over death. Over such death hath no power. As God raised up Christ Jesus , from the dead, so He will raise up all the faithful members of Christ’s, body, His church.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Apostle Paul in discussing the resurrection of the dead in 1 Corinthians 15:20 says: “But now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the firstfruits of them that slept.” And then the same apostle, speaking of the resurrection of the members of the body, says that all the true faithful ones shall be resurrected at the second coming of the Lord. The 23rd verse reads: “But every man in his own order; Christ the firstfruits; afterward they that are Christ’s at his coming.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Then Paul adds in the same chapter, verses 51 to 55: “Behold, I show you a mystery: We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed. For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality. So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory. O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory?” And thus he shows that hell, death and</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">the tomb' shall not prevail against those who are of Christ’s church. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">And now I submit to all fair-minded ones who</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">really want to know the truth, whether they be Catholic or Protestant, Jew or Gentile, that briefly summed up out Lord’s words are these: That he, Christ Jesus, is the Foundation Stone and Head of the church; that the church consists of His body members; that their names arc written in heaven, and not on any earthly church book, and surely not written by any man; that the church is cleansed not by men but by the Lord; that those who are faithful unto death shall participate in the first resurrection and that over such death shall have no power, therefore death or hell shall not prevail against them; and that Jesus . was . teaching .. these great truths to Peter on the occasion He did, so that afterwards when St. Peter’s mind was illuminated by the holy spirit he would understand what the Lord meant. Peter did understand what was meant and taught the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Why then should we follow the teachings of -men, and permit ourselves to be blinded to God’s way of bringing life and happiness to mankind ? Would it not be more in keeping with good judgment in our own interests if we would seek diligently to know the truth and follow the truth, without regard to whether it upsets the teachings of men or not? Let us worship God, not men, nor man-made systems.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark171"></a><span class="font0"><a name="bookmark172"></a>STUDIES IN THE “HARP OF GOD” ( </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>D</sup>^TEST<sup>H</sup>BOOK*<sup>D S</sup> )</span></h3>
<p><span class="font16">«</span><span class="font4"> .With issue Number 60 we began running Judge Rutherord’s new book, n | | “The Harp of God”, with accompanying questions, taking place of botli JrSf* Advanced and Juvenile Bible Studies which have been hitherto published.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>476</sup>This message of Christ Jesus, the crucified One, the selection of the church and the setting up of His kingdom, was a stumbling block to the Jews; they could not understand; they would not believe. And to most of the Gentiles it seemed foolishness. It was not foolishness, however. It was the greatest wisdom. A few have responded to this divine wisdom. The man, however, who thought himself wiso would not become a follower of Jesus. It was not a popular thing. And so it has ever been throughout the Gospel Age that those who have really come to the Lord, made $ consecration and followed in His footsteps, have been the meek and lowly of heart, who are anxious to know the Lord and His great plan. Hence St. Paul writes: “For ye see your calling, brethren, how that not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, are called; but God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty; and base things of the world, and things which are despised, hath God chosen, yea, and tilings which are not, to bring to nought things that are; that no flesh should glory in his presence.” •—1 Corinthians 1:26-29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>477</sup>The thought here is that ultimately no creature will eve? be standing in Jehovah’s presence boasting of what he did; but that all those who compose the church will realize that all they have came to them as a gracious gift from Jehovah. To those who have really had the desire to know and serve the Lord the call has been and is beautiful indeed. Such have been thrilled with the gracious words’of Jehovah spoken through His prophet, inviting them to become members of the royal family of heaven. The psalmist wrote: “Hearken, O daughter, and consider, and incline thine ear; forget also thine own people, and thy father’s house; so shall the king greatly desire thy beauty; for he is thy Lord, and worship thou him.”—Psalm 45:10,11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>478</sup>As Jesus is the Son of God, so the church, the bride of Christ, is the daughter of God. Hence the psalmist speaks to her here, inviting those who are to become the daughter to forget their own people and their earthly father’s house and earnestly and willingly follow in the Master’s footsteps. These are invited to worship the Lord and grow in His likeness and thereby become beautiful; and it is that beauty, the character likeness of the Lord, that He desires.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>479</sup>The development of the church is not an instantaneous matter. It is a gradual process. Some have erroneously thought and taught that a man might be wicked all his life and then on his deathbed confess his sins, accept Christ, become a Christian and die and go immediately to heaven. There is no scripture that warrants such a conclusion. Time is required for the development of the Christian. He must first repent ; that is to say, become displeased 'with the wrongful course of the world, change his own course and seek the Lord. He must become converted, turn away from a wrongful course and turn to the Lord. He must be drawn to the Lord Jesus, make a full consecration, be accepted of the Lord, presented to the Father, justified, and begotten of the holy spirit, before he becomes a new creature; and from that time forward he must develop. He must have the opportunity to pass through, and must pass through, many experiences and by these experiences learn the lessons that God desires the members of the new creation to learn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">QUESTIONS ON “THE HARP OF GOD”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">How did the Jews as a people receive the message of Christ and Him crucified? fl 476.</span></p>

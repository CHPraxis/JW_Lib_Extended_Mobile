<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn">Life begins at conception.

<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sn"><strong>• Why does the Bible speak favorably of silence?</strong></p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sn">It shows that silence can be a mark of respect, an aid to meditation, and an evidence of discretion and discernment. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:37:7-19:37:7" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ps. 37:7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:63:6-19:63:6" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 63:6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:11:12-20:11:12" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> Prov. 11:12</a>)<wbr />—5/15, pages 3-5.</p>

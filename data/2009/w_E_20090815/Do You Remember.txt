Do You Remember?
Have you appreciated reading the recent issues of The Watchtower? Well, see if you can answer the following questions:
• Is a resurrection possible if a developing child dies before it is born?
Life begins at conception. Jehovah can resurrect individuals of whatever stage of life because “all things are possible with God.” (Mark 10:27) But the Bible does not directly say whether he will resurrect unborn children who died in the womb.—4/15, pages 12, 13.
• Why can we benefit from noting ants, rock badgers, locusts, and gecko lizards?
These four illustrate instinctive wisdom. Thus, they magnify God’s wisdom. (Prov. 30:24-28)—4/15, pages 16-19.
• Of what is the year 2009 a centennial for Jehovah’s Witnesses?
In 1909 the headquarters of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society, the legal arm of the publishing organization used by Jehovah’s Witnesses, was moved from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, to Brooklyn, New York, where it continues active.—5/1, pages 22-24.
• Why does the Bible speak favorably of silence?
It shows that silence can be a mark of respect, an aid to meditation, and an evidence of discretion and discernment. (Ps. 37:7; 63:6; Prov. 11:12)—5/15, pages 3-5.
• What do John Wycliffe, William Tyndale, Robert Morrison, and Adoniram Judson have in common?
All of them loved God’s Word and translated it into languages that common people could read. The first two did so into English, Morrison into Chinese, and Judson into Burmese (Myanmar).—6/1, pages 8-11.
• How many Judean kings showed outstanding zeal for God’s house?
Nineteen kings ruled over the southern kingdom of Judah, and four were noteworthy for such zeal—Asa, Jehoshaphat, Hezekiah, and Josiah.—6/15, pages 7-11.
• Do all anointed Christians on earth share in providing spiritual food?
No. All who are anointed with God’s spirit are part of the faithful and discreet slave class, but those making up the Governing Body oversee the spiritual feeding.—6/15, pages 22-24.
• Why did Roman soldiers view Jesus’ inner garment as desirable?
The soldiers at Jesus’ execution did not divide his garment into pieces. Usually, such a tunic was made by sewing together two pieces of fabric, but Jesus’ garment was seamless, making it more valuable.—7/1, page 22.
• Why can it be said that love was a key difference between Jesus’ approach and that of the religious leaders?
Rather than loving the common people, those leaders despised them. Moreover, they did not love God. Jesus loved his Father and was moved with pity for the people. (Matt. 9:36) He was warm, sympathetic, and kind toward them.—7/15, page 15.
• Why can managing money be a challenge in marriage, and what can help couples to succeed?
Disagreements over money are often about trust or fear, and marriage mates may have different backgrounds. Four keys to success are: Learn to talk calmly about money, agree on how income will be viewed, write down a family budget, and decide who will do what.—8/1, pages 10-12.

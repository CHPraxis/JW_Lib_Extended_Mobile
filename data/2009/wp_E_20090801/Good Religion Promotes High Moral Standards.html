<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">GOOD religion elevates our thinking and shows us how to improve our conduct. It supports us in the struggle to do what is right and brings out the best in us. How do we know that good religion does that?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Notice what the apostle Paul wrote to first-century Christians who lived in Corinth, Greece. That ancient city was notorious for its immoral lifestyle. Paul warned: “Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor male prostitutes nor homosexual offenders nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God.” Then Paul added: “And that is what some of you were. But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:6:9-46:6:11" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 6:9-11</a>, <em>The Holy Bible<wbr />—New International Version</em>) Imagine—<wbr />good religion helped some who were formerly without moral standards to become clean and upright servants of God!</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">By contrast, the Bible warns: “The time will come when people will not listen to sound doctrine, but will follow their own desires and will collect for themselves more and more teachers who will tell them what they are itching to hear.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/55:4:3-55:4:3" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Timothy 4:3</a>, <em>Today’s English Version.</em></p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">How do the religions that you know of measure up in this regard? Do they uphold the Bible’s high moral standards? Or do they water down the clear counsel found in God’s Word, telling people only “what they are itching to hear”?</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">To help you determine whether a particular religion is producing good fruit, why not take the time to answer the following questions?</p>

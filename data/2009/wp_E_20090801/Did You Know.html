<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"><strong>Who were the scribes who opposed Jesus?</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">During his ministry, Jesus encountered scribes not only in Jerusalem but also in smaller towns and villages. Outside of Jerusalem<wbr />—and even in Jewish communities outside of Palestine—<wbr />such men were minor officials, learned in the Law, who may have served as copyists or local judges.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/41:2:6-41:2:6" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Mark 2:6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/41:9:14-41:9:14" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 9:14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:5:17-42:5:21" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> Luke 5:17-21</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">In Jerusalem, scribes were closely associated with Jewish government. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:16:21-40:16:21" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matthew 16:21</a>) Their role there, says <em>The Anchor Bible Dictionary, </em>“seems to be as associates of the priests, both in judicial proceeding and enforcement of Jewish custom and law, and ongoing business in the Sanhedrin.” As high-ranking teachers of the Law, some of these scribes were actually members of the Sanhedrin, or Jewish high court. They served along with the chief priests and Pharisees.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Most often, the scribes appear as Jesus’ religious opponents. However, some did not oppose him. For example, one scribe told Jesus: “I will follow you wherever you are about to go.” Jesus said to another: “You are not far from the kingdom of God.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:8:19-40:8:19" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matthew 8:19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/41:12:28-41:12:34" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Mark 12:28-34</a>.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn"><strong>What did it mean for a person to be anointed?</strong></p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">In the Middle East in Bible times, greasing a person’s head with oil was a sign of favor toward him or an act of hospitality toward a guest. Generally, the oil used was olive oil with perfume added to it. The Hebrews also poured oil on a person’s head, or anointed him, when he was officially appointed to a special position of authority. Aaron, for example, was anointed upon being appointed to serve as high priest. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/3:8:12-3:8:12" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Leviticus 8:12</a>) In the case of King David, “Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him . . . , and the spirit of Jehovah began to be operative upon David from that day forward.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/9:16:13-9:16:13" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 Samuel 16:13</a>.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">In the Hebrew language, the term used for such anointing is <em>ma·shachʹ, </em>from which the word <em>ma·shiʹach, </em>or Messiah, is derived. The corresponding Greek word is <em>khriʹo, </em>from which comes <em>khri·stosʹ, </em>or Christ. Thus, Aaron and David each can be referred to as a messiah, or an anointed one. Moses too is called a christ, or an anointed one, in the sense that God appointed him to serve as His representative.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:11:24-58:11:26" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Hebrews 11:24-26</a>.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Jesus of Nazareth was personally appointed by God to a position of great authority. Rather than being anointed with literal oil, Jesus was anointed with God’s holy spirit. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:3:16-40:3:16" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Matthew 3:16</a>) As Jehovah’s chosen Anointed One, Jesus is properly referred to as the Messiah, or Christ.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:4:18-42:4:18" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Luke 4:18</a>.</p>

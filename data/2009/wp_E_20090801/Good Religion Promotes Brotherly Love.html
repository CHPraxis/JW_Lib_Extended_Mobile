<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">“HE WHO does not love does not know God; for God is love,” states the Bible. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/62:4:8-62:4:8" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 John 4:8</a>, <em>New Catholic Edition of the Holy Bible</em>) Good religion, therefore, should promote brotherly love.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Many religions do an admirable job of caring for the sick, the elderly, and the poor. They encourage their members to apply the counsel of the apostle John, who wrote: “Suppose someone has enough to live and sees a brother or sister in need, but does not help. Then God’s love is not living in that person. My children, we should love people not only with words and talk, but by our actions <span id="page7" class="pageNum" data-no="7" data-before-text="7"></span>and true caring.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/62:3:17-62:3:18" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 John 3:17, 18</a>, <em>New Century Version.</em></p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">What happens, though, when nations go to war? Should God’s command to “love thy neighbour as thyself” be applied in times of peace but be suspended when a politician or a king chooses to fight a neighbor nation?<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:22:39-40:22:39" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matthew 22:39</a>, <em>King James Version.</em></p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Jesus said: “By this all men will know that you are my disciples, if you love one another.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:13:35-43:13:35" data-bid="4-1" class="b">John 13:35</a>, <em>New International Version</em>) As you answer the following questions, ask yourself, ‘Do members of this religion display love toward all men at all times not only with words but also with actions?’</p>

<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">When soldiers came to arrest Jesus, the apostle Peter drew a weapon to defend him. However, Jesus said: “Put your sword back in its place.

<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">The apostle John wrote: “You can tell God’s children from the devil’s children, because those who belong to the devil refuse to do right or to love each other.

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb"><strong>WHAT THE BIBLE TEACHES: </strong>After witnessing Jesus’ ability to perform miracles, some wanted him to become involved in local politics. His response? “Jesus, knowing that they intended to come and make him king by force, withdrew again to a mountain by himself.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:6:15-43:6:15" data-bid="8-1" class="b">John 6:15</a>, <em>NIV.</em></p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">When Jesus was arrested and falsely accused of being a political agitator, he replied: “My kingdom is not of this world. If my kingdom were of this world, my servants would have been fighting, that I might not be delivered over to the Jews.

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb"><strong>WHAT THE BIBLE TEACHES: </strong>When the first uncircumcised non-Jews became Christians, the apostle Peter remarked: “God doesn’t show favoritism, but in every nation the person who fears Him and does righteousness is acceptable to Him.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:10:34-44:10:35" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Acts 10:34, 35</a>, <em>Holman Christian Standard Bible.</em></p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">Writing to first-century Christians, James said: “My friends, if you have faith in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ, you won’t treat some people better than others. Suppose a rich person wearing fancy clothes and a gold ring comes to one of your meetings. And suppose a poor person dressed in worn-out clothes also comes. You must not give the best seat to the one in fancy clothes and tell the one who is poor to stand at the side or sit on the floor. That is the same as saying that some people are better than others, and you would be acting like a crooked judge.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/59:2:1-59:2:4" data-bid="12-1" class="b">James 2:1-4</a>, <em>CEV.</em></p>

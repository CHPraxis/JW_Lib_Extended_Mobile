When making return visits on interested people, including those who attend the Memorial or other theocratic events but who are not actively associated with the congregation, concentrate on starting studies using the <em>Bible Teach </em>book. <strong>June: </strong><em>What Does the Bible Really Teach? </em>If householders already have the book, publishers may offer any 192-page book published prior to 1992. <strong>July and August: </strong>Any 32-page brochures that are in stock except <em>How Can Blood Save Your Life?</em>, <em>Jehovah’s Witnesses and Education, </em>and <em>Jehovah’s Witnesses​</em>—<em>Who Are They? What Do They Believe?</em></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn">▪ The meeting schedule for the week preceding the week of the “Keep on the Watch!” District Convention may be adjusted to review counsel and reminders about attending the convention. A month or two following your convention, a local needs part may be used to review convention points that the publishers have found to be helpful in the ministry.</p>

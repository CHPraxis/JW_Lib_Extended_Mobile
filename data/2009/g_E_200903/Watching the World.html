<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">As the human population in Africa increases, wildlife habitat decreases, resulting in “frequent and often violent contact,” says the Cape Town journal <em>Africa Geographic. </em>Lions, in particular, “appear to have identified humans as prey.” In Tanzania, for example, lions have killed at least 70 people each year since 1990. In some cases, reports the journal, lion prides are even “specialising in humans, seizing people from the front porches of huts and tearing through thatched roofs and loose mud walls.”</p>

<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">University of Chicago archaeologists working in southern Egypt have unearthed seven ancient grain bins, the largest known in that land. Artifacts found nearby enabled archaeologists to date the silos to between 1630 and 1520 B.C.E. If the dating is accurate, the bins existed in the days of Moses. The circular, mud-brick bins, 18 to 21 feet <strong>[5.5 to 6.5 m] </strong>in diameter and probably at least 25 feet <strong>[7.5 m] </strong>tall, were part of a local administrative center. The university’s report on the find says that such centers “functioned as places where the agricultural wealth of the Nile valley was mobilized for the state. Grain as currency provided the sinews of power for the phar[ao]hs.” The report added that “because grain was a form of currency, the silos functioned as a bank and a food source.”</p>

<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Researchers at the Swedish Royal Institute of Technology have developed a method of producing paper from wood cellulose that preserves the natural strength of its fibers. The normal mechanical processing of wood pulp in papermaking damages its tiny cellulose fibers and greatly reduces their strength. But the Swedish team succeeded in breaking down the pulp with enzymes and then gently separating its cellulose fibers in water, using a mechanical beater. When the undamaged fibers are drained, they bond into networks, producing sheets of paper with a yield strength greater than cast iron and almost as great as structural steel.</p>

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">PLANTS and animals face growing threats all over the world. Some scientists calculate that thousands of species become extinct every year. Fortunately, mountain ranges provide a vital refuge for plants and animals that used to flourish over wider areas. Even in these bastions, though, pollution and human encroachment pose a threat. Perhaps nowhere else is this more evident than in Europe, one of the most densely populated parts of the planet.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">In the Pyrenees, a mountain range dividing France from Spain, several national parks serve to provide refuge for the local flora and fauna. In these protected areas, visitors get a chance to see what has become a last frontier for many endangered species. Let us look briefly at what these parks offer.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="ss"><strong>Species Fighting for Survival</strong></p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><strong>Flowers. </strong>Some of the most beautiful wildflowers grow at altitudes above 5,000 feet <strong>[1,500 m]</strong>. Snow gentians and <strong>trumpet gentians (1), </strong>with their vivid-blue petals, carpet slopes well above the tree line. Farther down the slopes, nestled among beech trees, a grove of endangered <strong>lady’s-slipper orchids (2) </strong>still flourishes. Hundreds of nature lovers visit this grove every year, so local forestry wardens mount guard 14 hours a day to ensure that these precious flowers are not damaged or uprooted.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><strong>Butterflies. </strong>Unspoiled alpine meadows with abundant wildflowers provide a refuge for colorful butterflies. The large <strong>Apollo butterfly (3), </strong>with its vivid-red wing spots, flutters among the thistles. Smaller flowers receive constant visits from blue butterflies and <strong>copper butterflies (4) </strong>of the Lycaenidae family. Painted-lady and tortoiseshell butterflies briskly patrol the higher slopes.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><strong>Animals. </strong>Many of the larger mammals of Europe once roamed over vast tracts of the continent. But some have been hunted almost to extinction. Wolves, bears, <strong>lynx (5), </strong>bison, chamois, and <strong>mountain goats (6) </strong>now survive in just a few mountain ranges or in the far north. The majestic animals in these Pyrenean reserves offer a vivid reminder of the wildlife that once abounded in these mountains. Some thoughtful visitors wonder what the future holds for the few that remain.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">We have reason to be confident that the Creator, Jehovah, the One “to whom the peaks of the mountains belong,” cares about the wildlife of the mountains. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:95:4-19:95:4" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 95:4</a>) In one of the psalms, God says: “To me belongs every wild animal of the forest, the beasts upon a thousand mountains. I well know every winged creature of the mountains.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:50:10-19:50:11" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Psalm 50:10, 11</a>) Jehovah’s concern for the earth and its creatures gives us every reason to believe that he will never allow the beasts of the mountains to disappear.</p>

The “Appointed Time” Is Near
LIKE the prophet Habakkuk, the disciples of Jesus yearned to see an end to suffering. Having learned what the Kingdom of God would do to correct matters on earth, they asked Jesus: “When will these things be, and what will be the sign of your presence [in Kingdom power] and of the conclusion of the system of things?” (Matthew 24:3) In reply, Jesus said that only Jehovah God knew the precise time when the Kingdom would take full control of the earth. (Matthew 24:36; Mark 13:32) However, Jesus and others did foretell certain developments that would show that the time was near.—See box at right.
Would you not agree that these things are commonplace today? Jesus also foretold that an educational work would be accomplished earth wide. He said: “This good news of the kingdom will be preached in all the inhabited earth for a witness to all the nations; and then the end will come.”—Matthew 24:14.
That is exactly what is happening today. Jehovah’s Witnesses are doing that work. In some 236 lands, more than seven million Witnesses are telling people what the Kingdom will do, and they are helping them to conform to the righteous requirements of God, whose will it is to end suffering and pain. Continue to learn about God’s Kingdom, and you will have the prospect of living in a world without suffering—forever.

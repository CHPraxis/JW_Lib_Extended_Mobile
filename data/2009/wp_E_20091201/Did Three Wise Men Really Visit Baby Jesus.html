<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Christmastime lore from South America to Eastern Europe to Asia depicts a Nativity scene with three kings, or wise men, bearing precious gifts for the babe Jesus. Is this story true? Does it line up with the facts? Let us see.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Two Gospels, Matthew and Luke, chronicle the birth of Jesus. These accounts show that only lowly shepherds from nearby fields visited Jesus at his birth. The so-called kings, or wise men, were in reality astrologers, not royalty, and they are not numbered. The astrologers did not journey to the side of a newborn in a manger but arrived when Jesus was a child and was living in a house. Their presence even jeopardized the life of Jesus!</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Look closely at the account of Jesus’ birth by Bible writer Luke, and you will find that it says: “There were . . . shepherds living out of doors and keeping watches in the night over their flocks. And suddenly Jehovah’s angel stood by them, and . . . said to them: ‘. . . You will find an infant bound in cloth bands and lying in a manger.’ . . . And they went with haste and found Mary as well as Joseph, and the infant lying in the manger.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:2:8-42:2:16" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Luke 2:8-16</a>.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Only Joseph, Mary, and the shepherds were present with baby Jesus. No one else is listed in Luke’s report.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Now examine the account at <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:2:1-40:2:11" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matthew 2:1-11</a> from the King James Bible: “Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king, behold, there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem . . . And when they were come into the house, they saw the young child with Mary his mother.”</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Notice that the account states just “wise men,” not <em>“three </em>wise men,” and that they first traveled from the east to Jerusalem, not to the birth city of Jesus, Bethlehem. By the time they finally reached Bethlehem, Jesus was a “young child”<wbr />—no longer a baby—<wbr />and no longer in a stable but in a house.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Also, while the King James Bible uses the words “wise men” in describing these visitors, other translations use “Magi” or “astrologers.” According to <em>A Handbook on the Gospel of Matthew, </em>the expression “wise men” translates “a Greek noun which originally referred to Persian priests who were experts in astrology.” And <em>The Expanded Vine’s Expository Dictionary of New Testament Words </em>defines the word as “a wizard, sorcerer, a pretender to magic powers, a professor of the arts of witchcraft.”</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Although astrology and witchcraft are still popular today, the Bible warns against their use. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:47:13-23:47:15" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Isaiah 47:13-15</a>) They are forms of spiritism and are practices that Jehovah God abhors. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/5:18:10-5:18:12" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 18:10-12</a>) That is why no angel of God announced the birth of Jesus to the astrologers. However, by means of divine intervention in a dream, they were warned not to report back to wicked King Herod, since he sought to kill Jesus. So “they withdrew to their country by another way.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:2:11-40:2:16" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Matthew 2:11-16</a>.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Would true Christians want to perpetuate a fabled Nativity that distorts the truth surrounding the birth of Jesus? Surely the answer is no.</p>

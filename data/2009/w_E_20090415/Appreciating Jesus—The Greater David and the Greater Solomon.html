<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu">1, 2. From a human point of view, why was it surprising that Samuel was instructed to anoint David as king?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb">HE DID not look like a king. Rather, to the prophet Samuel, he appeared to be nothing more than a young shepherd boy. Moreover, his hometown, Bethlehem, was not of great prominence. It was described as “too little to get to be among the thousands of Judah.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/33:5:2-33:5:2" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Mic. 5:2</a>) Nevertheless, this apparently insignificant young man from a small town was about to be anointed by the prophet Samuel as the future king of Israel.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>Young David was not the first son that his father, Jesse, presented to Samuel to be anointed; neither was he the second or third. David, the last of eight boys born to Jesse, was not even present when Samuel came to <span id="page29" class="pageNum" data-no="29" data-before-text="29"></span>Jesse’s household to anoint one of that faithful man’s sons as the next king of the land. But David was Jehovah’s choice, and that was what counted.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/9:16:1-9:16:10" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Sam. 16:1-10</a>.</p>

<p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>Jehovah saw what Samuel could not see. God could discern David’s heart condition, and it was pleasing to him. With God, it is not the mere outward appearance that matters; it is what a person really is on the inside. (<em>Read </em><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/9:16:7-9:16:7" data-bid="4-1" class="b"><em>1 Samuel 16:7</em></a><em>.</em>) So when Samuel learned that Jehovah had not chosen any of the seven older sons of Jesse, he asked that the youngest be brought in from the pastures. The account says: “Accordingly [Jesse] sent and had [David] come. Now he was ruddy, a young man with beautiful eyes and handsome in appearance. Then Jehovah said: ‘Get up, anoint him, for this is he!’ Accordingly Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him in the midst of his brothers. And the spirit of Jehovah began to be operative upon David from that day forward.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/9:16:12-9:16:13" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 Sam. 16:12, 13</a>.</p>

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>Jesus, like David, was born in Bethlehem, some 1,100 years after David’s time. In the eyes of many, Jesus too did not look like a king. That is, he was not the kind of king that many in Israel hoped for. Yet, like David, he was Jehovah’s choice. He, like David, was beloved by Jehovah.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:3:22-42:3:22" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Luke 3:22</a>) In Jesus’ case too, ‘the spirit of Jehovah became operative upon him.’</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>The parallels between the two continue.

<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><sup>8 </sup>As king, David was a resolute warrior who protected the land of God’s people, and “Jehovah kept saving David wherever he went.” Under David’s leadership, the nation’s boundaries were extended from the river of Egypt to the river Euphrates. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/10:8:1-10:8:14" data-bid="17-1" class="b">2 Sam. 8:1-14</a>) In Jehovah’s strength, he became a most powerful ruler.

After that, “he went forth conquering.” Yes, like David, Jesus is a conquering king. Shortly after he was installed as King of God’s Kingdom, he conquered Satan in battle and hurled him and his demons down to the earth. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:12:7-66:12:9" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Rev. 12:7-9</a>) His victorious ride will continue until he will “complete his conquest,” completely destroying Satan’s wicked system.<wbr />—<em>Read </em><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:19:11-66:19:11" data-bid="23-1" class="b"><em>Revelation 19:11,</em></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:19:19-66:19:21" data-bid="23-2" class="b"> <em>19-21</em></a><em>.</em></p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:2:1-20:2:5" data-bid="39-1" class="b">Prov. 2:1-5</a>) Further, we need to persevere in asking God for wisdom.

As obedient humans enjoy peace to an unprecedented degree under Jesus’ rule, they will gradually be “set free from enslavement to corruption” until they reach human perfection. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:8:21-45:8:21" data-bid="50-1" class="b">Rom. 8:21</a>) After they pass the final test at the end of the Thousand Year Reign, “the meek ones themselves will possess the earth, and they will indeed find their exquisite delight in the abundance of peace.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:37:11-19:37:11" data-bid="51-1" class="b">Ps. 37:11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:20:7-66:20:10" data-bid="51-2" class="b"> Rev. 20:7-10</a>) Truly, Christ Jesus’ rule will surpass Solomon’s in ways we cannot yet imagine!</p>
<p id="p28" data-pid="28" data-rel-pid="[53]" class="sb"><sup>20 </sup>As Israel rejoiced under the oversight of Moses, David, and Solomon, we will rejoice even more under Christ’s rulership. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/11:8:66-11:8:66" data-bid="52-1" class="b">1 Ki. 8:66</a>) All thanks to Jehovah for providing us with his only-begotten Son<wbr />—the Greater Moses, David, and Solomon!</p>

<div id="fn1" class="fcc"><p id="p30" data-pid="30">The name David probably means “Beloved.” At the time of Jesus’ baptism and again at his transfiguration, Jehovah spoke from heaven calling him “my Son, the beloved.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:3:17-40:3:17" data-bid="53-1" class="b">Matt. 3:17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:17:5-40:17:5" data-bid="53-2" class="b"> 17:5</a>.</p></div>
<div id="fn2" class="fcc"><p id="p31" data-pid="31">At the same time, David became like a trusting lamb. He looked to the Great Shepherd, Jehovah, for protection and guidance. “Jehovah is my Shepherd,” he said with complete confidence. “I shall lack nothing.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:23:1-19:23:1" data-bid="54-1" class="b">Ps. 23:1</a>) John the Baptizer identified Jesus as “the Lamb of God.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:1:29-43:1:29" data-bid="55-1" class="b">John 1:29</a>.</p></div>

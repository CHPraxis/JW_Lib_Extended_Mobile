Purpose of Study Articles
Study Articles 1, 2  PAGES 3-11
These articles discuss why Jehovah allowed Satan to subject Job to a series of trials and what helped Job to keep his integrity. They also explain how we, like Job, can remain faithful and thus make Jehovah’s heart rejoice.
Study Article 3  PAGES 15-19
The creative works of Jehovah reveal various aspects of his personality. By considering created things, we can learn valuable lessons. In this article, we will consider four examples of Jehovah’s creation and discuss what lessons they contain.
Study Articles 4, 5  PAGES 24-32
Bible accounts of the lives of certain faithful men who lived before Jesus show that there are striking similarities between those men and Jesus. In these two articles, we will consider Moses, David, and Solomon and see how the accounts of their lives deepen our appreciation for Jesus’ role in God’s purpose.

In our day-to-day life, we face many situations in which it might seem simpler, more convenient, or even more compassionate to say something that is not true or to put matters in a way that misleads. Why do true Christians need to resist any temptation to do so? What will help you in this regard?
Study Article 4  PAGES 20-24

<p id="p1" data-pid="1" class="st"><span id="page3" class="pageNum" data-no="3" data-before-text="3"></span><strong>Who Is God?</strong></p>
<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">HOW would you answer that question? Some feel that they know God well<wbr />—that he is a close friend. Others view God more as a distant relative. They believe that he exists but know little about him. If you believe in God, how would you answer the questions listed below?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="si"><strong>1. Is God a real person?</strong></p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="si"><strong>2. Does God have a name?</strong></p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="si"><strong>3. Is Jesus Almighty God?</strong></p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="si"><strong>4. Does God care about me?</strong></p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="si"><strong>5. Does God accept all forms of worship?</strong></p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">If you ask others to answer these questions, you will likely receive an astonishing array of responses. Little wonder, then, that myths and wrong perceptions have developed concerning God.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="ss"><strong>Why the Answers Matter</strong></p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">While speaking with a religious woman he met at a well, Jesus Christ emphasized the need to know the truth about God. This woman, a Samaritan, acknowledged that Jesus was a prophet. But something bothered her. Jesus’ religion was different from hers. When she expressed this concern, Jesus plainly said to her: “You worship what you do not know.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:4:19-43:4:22" data-bid="1-1" class="b">John 4:19-22</a>) Obviously, Jesus felt that not all religious people truly know God.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb"><span id="page4" class="pageNum" data-no="4" data-before-text="4"></span>Does Jesus’ statement mean that no one can really know God? No. Jesus went on to say to this woman: “True worshipers will worship the Father with spirit and truth, for, indeed, the Father is looking for suchlike ones to worship him.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:4:23-43:4:23" data-bid="2-1" class="b">John 4:23</a>) Are you among those who worship God “with spirit and truth”?</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">It is of utmost importance for you to make sure of the answer to that question. Why? Jesus highlighted the need for accurate knowledge when he prayed: “This means everlasting life, their taking in knowledge of you, the only true God, and of the one whom you sent forth, Jesus Christ.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:17:3-43:17:3" data-bid="3-1" class="b">John 17:3</a>) Yes, your very prospects for future life are closely connected with your knowing the truth about God!</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Is it really possible to know the truth about God? Yes, it is! How, then, can you find it? Jesus said this about himself: “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:14:6-43:14:6" data-bid="4-1" class="b">John 14:6</a>) He also stated: “Who the Father is, no one knows but the Son, and he to whom the Son is willing to reveal him.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:10:22-42:10:22" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Luke 10:22</a>.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">So the key to knowing God is found in the teachings of Jesus Christ, the Son of God. In fact, Jesus promises us: “If you hold to my teaching, you are really my disciples. Then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:8:31-43:8:32" data-bid="6-1" class="b">John 8:31, 32</a>, <em>The Holy Bible—<wbr />New International Version.</em></p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">How, then, would Jesus answer the five questions raised earlier?</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sa"><strong>Common answers:</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sv">▪ “He is everywhere, in everything. He is like the wind.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sv">▪ “He is an indefinable intelligence, an abstract force.”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sa"><strong>What did Jesus say?</strong></p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sv">▪ “In the house of my Father there are many abodes.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:14:2-43:14:2" data-bid="1-1" class="b">John 14:2</a>) Jesus spoke of God as having a figurative house, or dwelling place.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sv">▪ “I came out from the Father and have come into the world. Further, I am leaving the world and am going my way to the Father.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:16:28-43:16:28" data-bid="2-1" class="b">John 16:28</a>) Jesus believed that God is an actual Person living in a specific location.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">JESUS never referred to God as some abstract force. On the contrary, he talked to God and prayed to him. He often called Jehovah his heavenly Father, a term revealing his deep intimacy with God.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:8:19-43:8:19" data-bid="3-1" class="b">John 8:19,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:8:38-43:8:38" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 38,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:8:54-43:8:54" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> 54</a>.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">It is true that “no man has seen God at any time” and that “God is a Spirit.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:1:18-43:1:18" data-bid="4-1" class="b">John 1:18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:4:24-43:4:24" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 4:24</a>) But this does not mean that he is without any type of body or form. The Bible tells us: “If there is a physical body, there is also a spiritual one.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:15:44-46:15:44" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 15:44</a>) So does Jehovah have a spiritual body?</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Yes. When Jesus was resurrected, he “entered . . . into heaven itself, now to appear before the person of God for us.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:9:24-58:9:24" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Hebrews 9:24</a>) This teaches us two important facts about God. First, he has a place of dwelling. Second, he is a Person, not simply an indefinable force that resides everywhere.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">How, then, can God’s influence be felt everywhere? God can send his holy spirit, or power in action, to any place in the universe. Like a father who extends his hand to console and support his children, God extends his holy spirit to accomplish his purpose.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:104:30-19:104:30" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Psalm 104:30;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:139:7-19:139:7" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 139:7</a>.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">Because God is a Person, he also has a personality with likes and dislikes<wbr />—even feelings. The Bible tells us that he loves his people, rejoices in his works, hates idolatry, and feels hurt over wickedness. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:6:6-1:6:6" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Genesis 6:6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/5:16:22-5:16:22" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> Deuteronomy 16:22;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/11:10:9-11:10:9" data-bid="8-3" class="b"> 1 Kings 10:9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:104:31-19:104:31" data-bid="8-4" class="b"> Psalm 104:31</a>) At <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/54:1:11-54:1:11" data-bid="9-1" class="b">1 Timothy 1:11</a>, he is called “the happy God.” No wonder Jesus said that we can learn to love this God with our whole heart!<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/41:12:30-41:12:30" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Mark 12:30</a>.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span></p>

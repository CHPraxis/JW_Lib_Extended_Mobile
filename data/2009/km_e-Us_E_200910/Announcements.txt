▪ The yearly Theocratic Ministry School Schedule will no longer be provided as an insert in Our Kingdom Ministry. Instead, each congregation will receive the yearly schedule, and one copy of the schedule should be posted on the information board at the Kingdom Hall. Another copy will be retained by the school overseer for his use in making assignments. Publishers will continue to receive their personal copy of Our Kingdom Ministry each month, and it will show the schedule for the weekly Congregation Bible Study, the Theocratic Ministry School, and the Service Meeting.
▪ Starting the week of March 1, 2010, the book “Come Be My Follower” will be considered at the Congregation Bible Study. Congregations needing a supply of these books should request them on their next literature request.

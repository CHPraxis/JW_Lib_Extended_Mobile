▪ What should you do if directed to stop preaching?
In some instances, the police have approached publishers who were sharing in some form of the ministry, informed them that they were violating the law, and directed them to stop. You should promptly and politely leave the territory if directed to do so. (Matt. 5:41; Phil. 4:5) Do not try to resolve matters on your own by getting involved in a discussion about our legal rights. If it is possible, tactfully obtain the badge number of the police officer and the number of his precinct. Thereafter, promptly inform the elders, who will then contact the branch office about the incident. Similarly, if you are asked to leave an apartment building or complex by the superintendent or any other apartment representative, you should comply immediately and inform the elders. A mild and humble manner of dealing with those in authority can do much to prevent unnecessary difficulties.​—Prov. 15:1; Rom. 12:18.

▪ Literature offer for July and August: Any 32-page brochures that are in stock except How Can Blood Save Your Life?, Jehovah’s Witnesses and Education, and Jehovah’s Witnesses​—Who Are They? What Do They Believe? September: What Does the Bible Really Teach? Endeavor to start Bible studies on the initial call. Show how householders can benefit from the book by briefly demonstrating a Bible study. October: The Watchtower and Awake! magazines. Where interest is shown, present and discuss the tract Would You Like to Know the Truth? If householders already have the tract, endeavor to start a Bible study.
▪ Since August has five full weekends, it would be an excellent month to auxiliary pioneer.

Can You Expand Your Service?
 1. What urgency exists in the field ministry, and why?
1 Observing the interest that multitudes showed in the Kingdom good news, Jesus instructed his disciples to “beg the Master of the harvest to send out workers into his harvest.” (Matt. 9:37, 38) Since we are in the final hours of the harvest season, our work is even more urgent than ever before. This means that we should prayerfully consider how we can have a fuller share in the field ministry.​—John 14:13, 14.
 2. How have some responded to the call for more workers in the field?
2 Expanded Service: With Jehovah’s guidance and help, many have found it possible to take up pioneer service. (Ps. 26:2, 3; Phil. 4:6) Some made a special effort to serve as auxiliary pioneers one or more months during the year. This proved to be a fine way to expand their ministry. The happiness derived from engaging in this privilege caused many of them to consider becoming regular pioneers.​—Acts 20:35.
 3. If you have pioneered before, what may you now wish to consider?
3 Can You Resume Pioneer Service?: If you previously served as a pioneer, you no doubt hold cherished memories of that time. Have you given prayerful thought to the possibility of returning to the pioneer ranks? The circumstances that caused you to come off the pioneer list may no longer be a hindrance. The time may have come for you to enjoy that special privilege once more.​—1 John 5:14, 15.
 4. What unique opportunity is open to all of us?
4 The harvest work is well under way and is soon to be finished. (John 4:35, 36) May all of us examine our present situation to determine whether we can adjust our affairs so as to expand our participation in the field. Or if we sincerely find that we cannot expand our service, can we look for ways to become more effective? (Mark 12:41-44) What a privilege is now set before all those whose present circumstances allow them to be used by Jehovah in this unique endeavor!​—Ps. 110:3.

Field Service Highlights
We are pleased to report a new peak in Bible studies in the United States for the third consecutive month! The total of 691,657 Bible studies conducted in March is an increase of 21,936 over the previous peak. It is thrilling to see that in the Turks and Caicos Islands there were peaks in publishers, hours, magazines, and return visits. Also, the total of 498 Bible studies is an increase of 73 over the previous peak set in JanuaryÂ 2009.

▪ Whenever personal travel plans include visiting a land that is not listed separately in the current service year report or whose address is not listed on the last page of the latest Yearbook, please contact your branch office to ascertain what precautions or special instructions may need to be followed. The Kingdom work in that area may be under certain restrictions. (Matt. 10:16) In some lands it may not be advisable for visitors to make contact with local Witnesses or congregations. Other direction may be provided to you regarding informal witnessing or carrying supplies of literature. Your cooperation with the direction provided will prevent unnecessary problems for you or for the Kingdom work.​—1 Cor. 14:33,40.

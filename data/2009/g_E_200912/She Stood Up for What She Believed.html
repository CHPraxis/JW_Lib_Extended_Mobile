<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">▪ During a recent holiday season, the first-grade class of seven-year-old Morgan was assigned to read a story about Christmas. Morgan reminded the teacher that she felt that this celebration was not in harmony with the Bible. Her teacher kindly allowed her to choose to read a story that did not offend her conscience.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Sometime later, a school awards ceremony was held, and Morgan’s family was invited to attend. Morgan was surprised when at the ceremony she was presented with an award for her courage in holding firmly to what she believed. When asked how she had developed such courage, she explained that she and her family read together from the book <em>Learn From the Great Teacher, </em>the lessons of which are drawn from the life and teachings of Jesus Christ.</p>

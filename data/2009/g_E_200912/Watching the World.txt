Youths Consider Peers Spoiled
According to the newspaper de Volkskrant, young people in the Netherlands “feel that their peers are being spoiled” and that they “receive too much encouragement to feel good about themselves, resulting in a lack of consideration toward others.” Among people aged 16 to 24, “no less than 2 out of every 3 . . . feel that young people’s rights are no longer balanced with their duties,” reports the newspaper. The general opinion is that “youths demand a lot . . . and seldom ask themselves what they can contribute to society.”
Children Make Lunch
When a Japanese school principal sought ways to get parents and children to spend more time together, the school adopted his idea to have pupils prepare their own lunch boxes one day a month. Now hundreds of schools do the same. “Children are not expected to do everything themselves from the start,” says Japan’s IHT Asahi Shimbun. “Each grade has its own goal. Children in the lower elementary grades enlist their families to help come up with a menu and shop for ingredients. . . . The focus in the upper grades is on drawing up a balanced menu.” The result? “Schools have reported that children’s cooking skills improved, less food was wasted and families had something new to talk about,” says the newspaper. Children also claim “to have learned to appreciate what their parents do for them.”
Cleanup at the South Pole
Last year, as part of a special ecological program, Russian polar specialists removed 360 tons of waste from Antarctica in a general cleanup. Garbage dumped near research stations at the South Pole has included unused building materials, broken machinery, and empty fuel barrels. “According to the protocol for the ecological protection of the southernmost tip of the earth, every country must take out its own garbage,” reports the Russian magazine Itogi. “The most diligent in carrying out their obligations are the Japanese.”

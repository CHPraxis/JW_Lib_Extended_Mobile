<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">When a Japanese school principal sought ways to get parents and children to spend more time together, the school adopted his idea to have pupils prepare their own lunch boxes one day a month. Now hundreds of schools do the same. “Children are not expected to do everything themselves from the start,” says Japan’s <em>IHT Asahi Shimbun. </em>“Each grade has its own goal. Children in the lower elementary grades enlist their families to help come up with a menu and shop for ingredients. . . . The focus in the upper grades is on drawing up a balanced menu.” The result? “Schools have reported that children’s cooking skills improved, less food was wasted and families had something new to talk about,” says the newspaper. Children also claim “to have learned to appreciate what their parents do for them.”</p>

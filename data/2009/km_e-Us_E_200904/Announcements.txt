Announcements
▪ Literature offer for April and May: The Watchtower and Awake! magazines. When making return visits on interested people, including those who attend the Memorial or other theocratic events but who are not actively associated with the congregation, concentrate on starting studies using the Bible Teach book. June: What Does the Bible Really Teach? If householders already have the book, publishers may offer any 192-page book published prior to 1992. July: Any 32-page brochures that are in stock except How Can Blood Save Your Life?, Jehovah’s Witnesses and Education, and Jehovah’s Witnesses​—Who Are They? What Do They Believe?
▪ A concerted effort will be made to advertise the 2009 district and international conventions to be held worldwide. Publishers will have the opportunity to distribute a special handbill in their territory. The campaign should be held during the three weeks prior to the congregation’s assigned convention.
▪ Lapel badge cards will be supplied to all publishers via the congregation. International convention delegates will use the same lapel badge card.

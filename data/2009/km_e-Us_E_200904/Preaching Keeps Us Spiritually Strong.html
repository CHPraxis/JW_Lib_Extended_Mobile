<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="qu"> 1. What benefit does the preaching work give us?</p>
<p id="p2" data-pid="2" data-rel-pid="[7]" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>Having an active share in the preaching work can strengthen us spiritually and increase our happiness. Of course, we engage in the ministry primarily to please Jehovah. However, by obeying the command to “preach the word,” we receive Jehovah’s blessings and also benefit ourselves in other ways. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:4:2-55:4:2" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Tim. 4:2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:48:17-23:48:18" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Isa. 48:17, 18</a>) Just how can preaching strengthen us and make us happy?</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="qu"> 2. In what ways does the ministry strengthen us?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" data-rel-pid="[8]" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup><strong>We Are Strengthened and Blessed: </strong>Preaching encourages us to focus on Kingdom blessings rather than present troubles. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:4:18-47:4:18" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Cor. 4:18</a>) Explaining Bible teachings strengthens our faith in Jehovah’s promises and builds our appreciation for the truth. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:65:13-23:65:14" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Isa. 65:13, 14</a>) As we help others to grow spiritually so as to be “no part of the world,” we strengthen our own stand of separateness from the world.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:14-43:17:14" data-bid="4-1" class="b">John 17:14,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:16-43:17:16" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:12:2-45:12:2" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> Rom. 12:2</a>.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="qu"> 3. How does our ministry help us cultivate Christian qualities?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[9]" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>Participating in the ministry helps us to cultivate Christian qualities. For example, endeavoring to “become all things to people of all sorts” assists us to develop greater humility. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:9:19-46:9:23" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 Cor. 9:19-23</a>) As we talk to those who are “skinned and thrown about like sheep without a shepherd,” we are inclined to learn sympathy and empathy. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:9:36-40:9:36" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Matt. 9:36</a>) We learn endurance when we persevere despite apathy or opposition. Our joy is increased by giving of ourselves in behalf of others.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:20:35-44:20:35" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Acts 20:35</a>.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="qu"> 4. How do you feel about your ministry?</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[10]" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>What a blessing to have a ministry that gives praise to the only One deserving of our worship! The ministry strengthens us. It brings abundant blessings to those who are completely absorbed in ‘bearing thorough witness to the good news.’​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:20:24-44:20:24" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Acts 20:24</a>.</p>

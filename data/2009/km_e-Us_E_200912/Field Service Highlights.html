<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">The August 2009 report marked an important new milestone in theocratic progress for the United States branch. There were new peaks in Kingdom publishers in all three territories assigned to our branch. In the United States, the total of 1,154,275 publishers reporting is an increase of 48,165 over the previous peak of 1,106,110 set in July 2009.

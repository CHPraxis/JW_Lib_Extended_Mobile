<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>Preparing to participate in our meetings includes preparing to sing songs of praise. Consider the following suggestions.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup><strong>Understand the Lyrics: </strong>The theme scripture and additional scriptures listed at the end of each song help to emphasize the Scriptural basis for the lyrics.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup><strong>Practice: </strong>A portion of Family Worship each week can be used to become familiar with the new songs. Sing along with the recorded piano accompaniment of songs to be used for each meeting. You may be able to learn the melody and the lyrics of some of the new songs by listening to <em>Sing to Jehovah​—Vocal Renditions, </em>Disc 1.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>Will you be ready this weekend when we begin using <em>Sing to Jehovah </em>at the <em>Watchtower </em>Study? You will if you take time to understand the meaning of the songs and practice singing them.</p>

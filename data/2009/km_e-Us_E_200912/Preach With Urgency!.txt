Preach With Urgency!
 1. What exhortation of Paul demands attention in our day?
1 “Preach the word, be at it urgently.” (2 Tim. 4:2) Why is Paul’s exhortation so important in our day? How can these words impact our lives and those of others?
 2. Why do we diligently search for those who have not heard the good news?
2 Lives Are Involved: Millions of people around the world have yet to hear the good news that can lead to their salvation. (Rom. 10:13-15; 1 Tim. 4:16) Many honesthearted ones are being found in territory frequently worked. If we call on a different day or at another time of day, we may find a different person. Such diligent searching will leave us with a clean conscience and free of bloodguilt.​—Acts 20:26.
 3. How can we make wise use of our time in the ministry?
3 In spite of facing violent opposition, first-century Christians ‘filled Jerusalem with their teaching.’ (Acts 5:28) Are we equally determined to “give a thorough witness”? (Acts 10:42) When in the ministry, do we make wise use of time? If we are waiting as others make a return visit, do we take the initiative to speak with passersby?
 4. How does preaching with urgency help us to keep on the watch?
4 Increases Our Alertness: With the end of this system of things near at hand, we must stay alert, keeping on the watch. (1 Thess. 5:1-6) When we regularly speak about our Kingdom hope, we avoid becoming weighed down by this system of things. (Luke 21:34-36) In turn, as we keep the day of Jehovah “close in mind,” we are moved to increase our share in the lifesaving preaching work.​—2 Pet. 3:11, 12.
 5. How does respect for life motivate us in the ministry?
5 When we preach with urgency, we reflect Jehovah’s view of life: “He does not desire any to be destroyed but desires all to attain to repentance.” (2 Pet. 3:9; Ezek. 33:11) May we be resolved to contact as many as possible in our territory, all to Jehovah’s praise!​—Ps. 109:30.

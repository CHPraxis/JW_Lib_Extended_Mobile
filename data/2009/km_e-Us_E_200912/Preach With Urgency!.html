<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="qu"> 1. What exhortation of Paul demands attention in our day?</p>
<p id="p2" data-pid="2" data-rel-pid="[8]" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>“Preach the word, be at it urgently.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:4:2-55:4:2" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Tim. 4:2</a>) Why is Paul’s exhortation so important in our day? How can these words impact our lives and those of others?</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="qu"> 2. Why do we diligently search for those who have not heard the good news?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" data-rel-pid="[9]" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup><strong>Lives Are Involved: </strong>Millions of people around the world have yet to hear the good news that can lead to their salvation.

If we call on a different day or at another time of day, we may find a different person. Such diligent searching will leave us with a clean conscience and free of bloodguilt.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:20:26-44:20:26" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Acts 20:26</a>.</p>

<p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[10]" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>In spite of facing violent opposition, first-century Christians ‘filled Jerusalem with their teaching.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:5:28-44:5:28" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Acts 5:28</a>) Are we equally determined to “give a thorough witness”? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:10:42-44:10:42" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Acts 10:42</a>) When in the ministry, do we make wise use of time? If we are waiting as others make a return visit, do we take the initiative to speak with passersby?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="qu"> 4. How does preaching with urgency help us to keep on the watch?</p>

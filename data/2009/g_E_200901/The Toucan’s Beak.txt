Was It Designed?
The Toucan’s Beak
▪ A poor flier, the toucan of Central and South America moves about primarily by hopping. The sound produced by some species is similar to that of a frog, but it is louder. In fact, it can be heard up to half a mile [1 km] away in the jungle. Perhaps what amazes scientists most about the toucan, though, is its beak.
Consider: The beak on some toucans is over a third of the bird’s length. It looks heavy, but it is not. “The surface is made of keratin, the same material in fingernails and hair,” explains materials scientist Marc André Meyers. “It’s actually many layers of tiny hexagonal plates, overlapping like shingles on a roof.”
The consistency of the toucan’s beak has been compared to that of a hard sponge. Some parts of it are hollow, while other parts are made up of beams and membranes. The result is a lightweight beak that has astounding strength. “It’s almost as if the toucan has a deep knowledge of mechanical engineering,” says Meyers.
The construction of the toucan’s beak enables the bird to absorb high impacts. Scientists believe that the beak can serve as a model for engineers in the aviation and automotive industries. “Panels that mimic toucan beaks may offer better protection to motorists involved in crashes,” Meyers says.
What do you think? Did the toucan’s strong but lightweight beak come about by chance? Or was it designed?

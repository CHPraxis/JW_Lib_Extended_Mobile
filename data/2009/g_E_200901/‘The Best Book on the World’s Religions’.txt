‘The Best Book on the World’s Religions’
▪ A high-school teacher in Canada faced the challenge of instructing students in the beliefs of several different religions practiced in her area. After reading the book Mankind’s Search for God, she exclaimed: “This is the best book describing the world’s religions that I have ever read!” She was so impressed that she sought and received permission from the school board to use the book in class.
The teacher offered to travel over 300 miles [500 km] to pick up 40 copies of the book from the Canada branch office of Jehovah’s Witnesses. The Witnesses in her area, however, were happy to deliver the books to her. A number of students in her class enjoyed the book so much that they asked to have their own copies.
You too may find that this book will help you to understand the beliefs of people in your community. It explains the origins, history, and teachings of the major religions of the world—including Hinduism, Buddhism, Taoism, Confucianism, Shinto, Judaism, Islam, and Christianity.

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb">WHAT a marvelous future awaits all humans whom God views as righteous! Forever they will delight to learn more about Jehovah’s beautiful qualities. Their hearts overflow with praise as they learn ever more about God’s creative works. Central to such a glorious future is “righteousness,” which is emphasized in <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:112:1-19:112:10" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Psalm 112</a>. But how can the holy and righteous God, Jehovah, view sinful humans as righteous? No matter how hard we try to do what is right, we make mistakes, sometimes serious ones.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:3:23-45:3:23" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Rom. 3:23;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/59:3:2-59:3:2" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Jas. 3:2</a>.</p>
<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu"> 2. What are two miracles Jehovah performed out of love?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>Lovingly, Jehovah provided a perfect solution. How so? First, by performing the miracle of transferring the life of his beloved heavenly Son to the womb of a virgin so that he could be born as a perfect human. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:1:30-42:1:35" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Luke 1:30-35</a>) Then, after Jesus’ enemies put him to death, Jehovah performed another outstanding miracle. God raised Jesus back to life as a glorious spirit creature.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/60:3:18-60:3:18" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 Pet. 3:18</a>.</p>
<p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="qu"> 3. Why was God pleased to reward his Son with heavenly life?</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>Jehovah rewarded Jesus with something <span id="page25" class="pageNum" data-no="25" data-before-text="25"></span>that his Son did not have in his prehuman existence<wbr />—indestructible life in heaven. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:7:15-58:7:17" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Heb. 7:15-17,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:7:28-58:7:28" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 28</a>) Jehovah was pleased to do this because Jesus had kept perfect integrity under severe tests. Jesus thereby provided his Father with the best, yes the complete, answer to Satan’s lie that humans serve God with selfish motives and not out of unbreakable love.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:27:11-20:27:11" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Prov. 27:11</a>.</p>
<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu"> 4. (a) Upon his return to heaven, what did Jesus do for us, and how did Jehovah respond? (b) How do you feel about what Jehovah and Jesus have done for you?</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>In heaven, Jesus did more. He ‘appeared before the person of God for us’ with the value of “his own blood.” Our loving heavenly Father graciously accepted Jesus’ precious offering as “a propitiatory sacrifice for our sins.” Therefore, with ‘cleansed consciences,’ we can render “sacred service to the living God.” What a reason to echo the opening words of <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:112:1-19:112:10" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Psalm 112</a>, <em>“Praise Jah, you people”!<wbr /></em>—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:9:12-58:9:14" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Heb. 9:12-14,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:9:24-58:9:24" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 24;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/62:2:2-62:2:2" data-bid="9-3" class="b"> 1 John 2:2</a>.</p>

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>For us to maintain a righteous standing with God, we must keep on exercising faith in Jesus’ shed blood. Not a day should pass by without our thanking Jehovah for loving us so much. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:3:16-43:3:16" data-bid="10-1" class="b">John 3:16</a>) We also need to keep studying God’s Word and doing our best to live in harmony with its message. <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:112:1-19:112:10" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Psalm 112</a> contains fine advice for all who want to maintain a clean conscience before God. This psalm complements <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:111:1-19:111:10" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Psalm 111</a>. Both open with the exclamation “Praise Jah, you people!” or “Hallelujah!” and are followed by 22 lines, each line beginning with one of the 22 letters of the Hebrew alphabet.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span></p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="ss"><strong>A Basis for Happiness</strong></p>
<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu"> 6. How is the God-fearing “man” described in <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:112:1-19:112:10" data-bid="48-1" class="b">Psalm 112</a> blessed?</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup><em>“Happy is the man in fear of Jehovah, in whose commandments he has taken very much delight.

This suggests that <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:112:1-19:112:10" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Psalm 112</a> can refer to a composite group made up of many individuals. Interestingly, the apostle Paul was inspired to apply <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:112:9-19:112:9" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Psalm 112:9</a> in connection with Christians in the first century.

<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu"> 7. Why do God’s servants need to have a wholesome fear of him, and how should you feel about God’s commandments?</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><sup>7 </sup>As indicated at <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:112:1-19:112:1" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Psalm 112:1</a>, these true Christians experience great happiness as they walk “in fear of Jehovah.” <span id="page26" class="pageNum" data-no="26" data-before-text="26"></span>This wholesome fear of displeasing him helps them to resist the spirit of Satan’s world. They take “very much delight” in studying God’s Word and in obeying his commandments. That includes the command to preach the good news of the Kingdom throughout the earth. They strive to make disciples of people of all nations while warning the wicked of the coming of God’s day of judgment.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/26:3:17-26:3:18" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Ezek. 3:17, 18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:28:19-40:28:20" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> Matt. 28:19, 20</a>.</p>
<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu"> 8. (a) How have God’s devoted people today been rewarded for their zeal? (b) What future blessings await those with an earthly hope?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><sup>8 </sup>Because of obeying such commands, God’s servants on earth today now number some seven million. Who can deny that his people have become “mighty in the earth”?

As a group, those with an earthly hope will be preserved through the coming “great tribulation” to form “a new earth” in which “righteousness is to dwell.” In time, Armageddon survivors “will be blessed” even more. They will be on hand to welcome back millions of resurrected ones. What a thrilling prospect! Eventually, those who take “very much delight” in God’s commandments will grow to human perfection and enjoy forever “the glorious freedom of the children of God.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/61:3:13-61:3:13" data-bid="20-1" class="b">2 Pet. 3:13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:8:21-45:8:21" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> Rom. 8:21</a>.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="ss"><strong>Wise Use of Riches</strong></p>
<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu">9, 10. How have true Christians used their spiritual riches, and how will their righteousness stand forever?</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><sup>9 </sup><em>“Valuable things and riches are in his house; and his righteousness is standing forever. </em><em>He has flashed up in the darkness as a light to the upright ones. He is gracious and merciful and righteous.” </em>(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:112:3-19:112:4" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Ps. 112:3, 4</a>) In Bible times, some of God’s servants were noted for their material riches. And in another sense, <span id="page27" class="pageNum" data-no="27" data-before-text="27"></span>those whom God approves truly become rich, even if that is not in a material sense. The fact is, in the main, those choosing to humble themselves before God may be poor and looked down upon, as was true in Jesus’ day. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:4:18-42:4:18" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Luke 4:18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:7:22-42:7:22" data-bid="22-2" class="b"> 7:22;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:7:49-43:7:49" data-bid="22-3" class="b"> John 7:49</a>) But whether one has much or little materially, it is possible to be spiritually rich.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:6:20-40:6:20" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Matt. 6:20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/54:6:18-54:6:19" data-bid="23-2" class="b"> 1 Tim. 6:18, 19</a>; <em>read </em><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/59:2:5-59:2:5" data-bid="24-1" class="b"><em>James 2:5</em></a><em>.</em></p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><sup>10 </sup>Anointed Christians, along with their companions, do not keep their spiritual riches to themselves. Rather, they have “flashed up” in Satan’s dark world “as a light to the upright ones.” They do so by helping others to benefit from the spiritual treasures of wisdom and knowledge of God. Opposers have tried to put a stop to the Kingdom-preaching work but have failed. Instead, the fruitage of this righteous work will ‘stand forever.’ By enduring in a course of righteousness, God’s servants can have the assurance of living permanently, “standing forever.”</p>
<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu">11, 12. What are some ways that God’s people use the material things they have?</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><sup>11 </sup>God’s people, both the anointed slave class and those making up the “great crowd,” have proved to be generous regarding material things. <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:112:9-19:112:9" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Psalm 112:9</a> states: <em>“He has distributed widely; he has given to the poor ones.” </em>True Christians today often make material contributions to fellow Christians and even to neighbors who are in need. They also use material resources to support relief campaigns in times of disasters. As Jesus indicated would be so, that is a source of happiness too.<wbr />—<em>Read </em><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:20:35-44:20:35" data-bid="26-1" class="b"><em>Acts 20:35;</em></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/47:9:7-47:9:7" data-bid="26-2" class="b"> <em>2 Corinthians 9:7</em></a><em>.</em></p>

Some give in a patronizing or begrudging way. It is not pleasant to receive help from one who makes you feel inferior or who makes you feel that you are a nuisance or a burden. By contrast, how refreshing it is to receive help from someone who is gracious. Jehovah is the outstanding example of a gracious, happy Giver. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/54:1:11-54:1:11" data-bid="28-1" class="b">1 Tim. 1:11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/59:1:5-59:1:5" data-bid="28-2" class="b"> Jas. 1:5,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/59:1:17-59:1:17" data-bid="28-3" class="b"> 17</a>) Jesus Christ perfectly reflected his Father’s gracious example. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/41:1:40-41:1:42" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Mark 1:40-42</a>) Thus, to be viewed by God as righteous, we give cheerfully and graciously, especially in field service when offering spiritual help to our neighbors.</p>
<p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu">14. What are some ways in which we can ‘sustain our affairs with justice’?</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><sup>14 </sup><em>“He sustains his affairs with justice.” </em>(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:112:5-19:112:5" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Ps. 112:5</a>) As foretold, the faithful steward class cares for the Master’s interests in harmony with Jehovah’s justice.

The just way of dealing with matters is evident also in the Bible-based direction the slave class provides on how all congregations, missionary homes, and Bethel homes should function. Justice is required not only of elders but also of other Christians in their dealings with one another and with unbelievers, including in business matters.<wbr />—<em>Read </em><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/33:6:8-33:6:8" data-bid="32-1" class="b"><em>Micah 6:8,</em></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/33:6:11-33:6:11" data-bid="32-2" class="b"> <em>11</em></a><em>.</em></p>

Those whom God views as righteous cannot escape the effects of this bad news, but it does not paralyze them with fear. Instead, their hearts are “steadfast” and “unshakable” as they look to the future with confidence, knowing that God’s righteous new world is near. If disaster does strike, they are better able to cope with the situation because they rely on Jehovah for support.

No doubt, the righteous will experience increased opposition as the end draws closer. Such hatred will reach a climax in the worldwide attack of Satan the Devil in his role as Gog of Magog.

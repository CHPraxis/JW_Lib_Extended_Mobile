The Most Important Date in History
It is the date on which Jesus Christ died. Why was Jesus’ death so important? For a number of reasons.
Jesus’ faithfulness until death proved that a human could maintain integrity to God.
Christ’s death also provided an opportunity for some from mankind to become corulers with him in heaven. Additionally, it opened the way for many more to enjoy everlasting life in an earthly paradise.
On the evening before he died, Jesus used unleavened bread and red wine as symbols of his loving human sacrifice. And he told his disciples: “Keep doing this in remembrance of me.” (Luke 22:19) Will you remember this important event?
Jehovah’s Witnesses warmly invite you to join them in observing the Memorial of Jesus’ death. This year the date for the observance is Thursday, April 9, after sundown. You may attend at the Kingdom Hall nearest to your home. Please check with Jehovah’s Witnesses locally for the exact time and place.

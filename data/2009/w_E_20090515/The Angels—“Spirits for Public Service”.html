<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>All the angels rejoiced at the ‘founding of the earth’ and shared with delight in their assigned work as this unique jewel in space developed into mankind’s home.

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>Surely the holy angels must have been appalled when they witnessed the beginning of revolt in God’s household. One from their midst was no longer content with praising Jehovah but desired to be worshipped. He made himself Satan (meaning “Resister”) by challenging the rightfulness of Jehovah’s rulership and by launching an ambitious attempt to set up a rival sovereignty. With the first recorded lie, Satan slyly induced the first human pair to join him in rebelling against their loving Creator.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:3:4-1:3:5" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Gen. 3:4, 5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:8:44-43:8:44" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> John 8:44</a>.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup>Jehovah quickly rendered judgment against Satan by stating in the first Bible prophecy: “I shall put enmity between you and the woman and between your seed and her seed. He will bruise you in the head and you will bruise him in the heel.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:3:15-1:3:15" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Gen. 3:15</a>) Enmity would persist between Satan and God’s “woman.” Yes, Jehovah viewed the heavenly organization of faithful spirit creatures as a beloved wife bonded with him as Husband. This prophecy provided a sure basis for hope, although the details remained a “sacred secret” to be revealed progressively. God purposed that one from within the heavenly part of his organization would crush all rebels and that through him “the things in the heavens and the things on the earth” would be brought together.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/49:1:8-49:1:10" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Eph. 1:8-10</a>.</p>

<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><sup>8 </sup>Abraham, Jacob, Moses, Joshua, Isaiah, Daniel, Jesus, Peter, John, and Paul are among those who were ministered to by angels. Righteous angels executed God’s judgments and transmitted prophecies and directions, including the Mosaic Law.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/55:3:16-55:3:17" data-bid="18-1" class="b">2 Tim. 3:16, 17</a>) Behind the scenes, however, the angels are very busy carrying out God’s will and supporting his servants.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><sup>9 </sup>The Bible assures us: “The angel of Jehovah is camping all around those fearing him, and he rescues them.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:34:7-19:34:7" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Ps. 34:7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:91:11-19:91:11" data-bid="19-2" class="b"> 91:11</a>) Because of the issue of integrity, Jehovah permits Satan to bring all sorts of trials upon us. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:21:16-42:21:19" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Luke 21:16-19</a>) However, God knows the point beyond which a test would prove nothing more as far as our integrity to him is concerned. (<em>Read </em><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:10:13-46:10:13" data-bid="21-1" class="b"><em>1 Corinthians 10:13</em></a><em>.</em>) Angels are ever alert to intervene according to God’s will. They rescued Shadrach, Meshach, Abednego, Daniel, and Peter but did not prevent the deaths of Stephen and James at enemy hands. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/27:3:17-27:3:18" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Dan. 3:17, 18,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/27:3:28-27:3:28" data-bid="22-2" class="b"> 28;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/27:6:22-27:6:22" data-bid="22-3" class="b"> 6:22;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:7:59-44:7:60" data-bid="22-4" class="b"> Acts 7:59, 60;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:12:1-44:12:3" data-bid="22-5" class="b"> 12:1-3,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:12:7-44:12:7" data-bid="22-6" class="b"> 7,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:12:11-44:12:11" data-bid="22-7" class="b"> 11</a>) The circumstances and issues were different.

<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><sup>10 </sup>The Scriptures do not teach that each <span id="page23" class="pageNum" data-no="23" data-before-text="23"></span>person on earth has a guardian angel.

Fellow Christians may be motivated to provide help and comfort. God may give us the wisdom and inner strength needed to cope with “a thorn in the flesh” that afflicts us as if we were being slapped by “an angel of Satan.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/47:12:7-47:12:10" data-bid="24-1" class="b">2 Cor. 12:7-10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/52:5:14-52:5:14" data-bid="24-2" class="b"> 1 Thess. 5:14</a>.</p>

<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><sup>11 </sup>Consider how Jehovah used angels in the case of Jesus. They announced his birth and resurrection and ministered to him when he was on earth. The angels could have prevented his arrest and cruel death. Instead, however, an angel was sent to strengthen him. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:28:5-40:28:6" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Matt. 28:5, 6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:2:8-42:2:11" data-bid="25-2" class="b"> Luke 2:8-11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:22:43-42:22:43" data-bid="25-3" class="b"> 22:43</a>) In accord with Jehovah’s purpose, Jesus died a sacrificial death and furnished proof that a perfect man can maintain integrity to God despite being tested to the limit. Jehovah therefore resurrected Jesus to immortal heavenly life, giving him “all authority” and making angels subject to him.

<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><sup>12 </sup>Jesus knew that it was wrong for him to put Jehovah to the test by expecting angels to rescue him if he were to engage in reckless behavior.

<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><sup>13 </sup>In reproving those who “speak abusively” of Jehovah’s anointed servants, the apostle Peter points to the fine example of the righteous angels. Although they have great power, the angels humbly refrain from making judgmental accusations “out of respect for Jehovah.” (<em>Read </em><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/61:2:9-61:2:11" data-bid="30-1" class="b"><em>2 Peter 2:9-11</em></a><em>.</em>) Let us also keep free from improper judging, respect those entrusted with oversight in the congregation, and leave matters in the hands of Jehovah, the Supreme Judge.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:12:18-45:12:19" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Rom. 12:18, 19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:13:17-58:13:17" data-bid="31-2" class="b"> Heb. 13:17</a>.</p>

(<em>Read </em><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:24:31-40:24:31" data-bid="48-1" class="b"><em>Matthew 24:31;</em></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:7:1-66:7:3" data-bid="48-2" class="b"> Rev. 7:1-3</a>) Moreover, Jesus is accompanied by angels when he “separates the sheep from the goats.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:25:31-40:25:33" data-bid="49-1" class="b">Matt. 25:31-33,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:25:46-40:25:46" data-bid="49-2" class="b"> 46</a>.</p>
<p id="p26" data-pid="26" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><sup>20 </sup>“At the revelation of the Lord Jesus from heaven with his powerful angels” all “who do not know God and those who do not obey the good news about our Lord Jesus” will be destroyed. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/53:1:6-53:1:10" data-bid="50-1" class="b">2 Thess. 1:6-10</a>) When John saw that same event in vision, he described Jesus and the angelic heavenly armies as going forth on white horses in order to carry on war in righteousness.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:19:11-66:19:14" data-bid="51-1" class="b">Rev. 19:11-14</a>.</p>
<p id="p52" data-pid="52" class="qu">21. What action will the angel “with the key of the abyss and a great chain in his hand” take against Satan and his demons?</p>
<p id="p27" data-pid="27" data-rel-pid="[52]" class="sb"><sup>21 </sup>John also “saw an angel coming down out of heaven with the key of the abyss and a great chain in his hand.” This is none other than the archangel Michael, who will bind the Devil and hurl him<wbr />—and evidently the demons—<wbr />into the abyss. They will be released briefly at the end of Christ’s Millennial Reign when perfect mankind will experience a final test. Thereafter, Satan and all other rebels will suffer destruction. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:20:1-66:20:3" data-bid="52-1" class="b">Rev. 20:1-3,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:20:7-66:20:10" data-bid="52-2" class="b"> 7-10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/62:3:8-62:3:8" data-bid="52-3" class="b"> 1 John 3:8</a>) All rebellion against God will have been removed.</p>
<p id="p53" data-pid="53" class="qu">22. How are the angels involved in what is just ahead, and how should we feel about their role?</p>
<p id="p28" data-pid="28" data-rel-pid="[53]" class="sb"><sup>22 </sup>Grand deliverance from Satan’s wicked system of things is just ahead. Angels will have a definite role in these significant events that will vindicate Jehovah’s sovereignty and bring to complete fulfillment his purpose for the earth and mankind. The righteous angels are indeed “spirits for public service, sent forth to minister for those who are going to inherit salvation.” Let us therefore be thankful to Jehovah God for the way he uses the angels to help us do the divine will and gain everlasting life.</p>

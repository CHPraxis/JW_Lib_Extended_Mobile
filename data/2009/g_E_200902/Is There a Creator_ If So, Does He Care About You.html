<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">▪ We are far from alone when asking, What caused the universe, our planet, and our life on it? And how does this relate to our finding a satisfying meaning in life?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Many people believe in creation, that there is a Creator who cares about us. Does research suggest this to be reasonable in our scientific age? Why are many educated people looking into the Bible, and should what it says about a Creator matter to us and our loved ones?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The 192-page book <em>Is There a Creator Who Cares About You? </em>takes up these issues. You will find that its clear answers can help you to add meaning to your life and to lay the basis for a happier future.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">HUMANS need more than air, food, and water. To be truly happy, we have to satisfy our spiritual need. We need to know the purpose of life, why we are here. Hence, Jesus Christ said: “Happy are those conscious of their spiritual need.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:5:3-40:5:3" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matthew 5:3</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">God has enabled us to satisfy that need by means of the most widely distributed sacred book in the world, the Holy Bible, now available in whole or in part in some 2,400 languages. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/55:3:16-55:3:16" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Timothy 3:16</a>) The Bible tells us that God created the universe and all life on earth. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:1:1-1:1:31" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Genesis, chapters 1 and</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:2:1-1:2:25" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 2</a>) It even tells us that he divided his creative activity into six figurative “days,” or periods of time, the order of which harmonizes with the principal divisions of geologic time established by scientists.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The Bible also reveals God’s purpose for mankind. That purpose is stated at <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:37:29-19:37:29" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Psalm 37:29</a>: “The righteous themselves will possess the earth, and they will reside forever upon it.” Note that the righteous<wbr />—the morally and spiritually upright—<wbr />will live forever, not in heaven, but on the earth. Of course, the earth will not be the polluted <span id="page9" class="pageNum" data-no="9" data-before-text="9"></span>planet it is today. Rather, it will become a global paradise.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:104:5-19:104:5" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Psalm 104:5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:23:43-42:23:43" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Luke 23:43</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="ss"><strong>Knowledge That Leads to Life</strong></p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">That Paradise will be twofold<wbr />—physical and spiritual. Says <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:11:9-23:11:9" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Isaiah 11:9</a>: “The earth will certainly be filled with the knowledge of Jehovah as the waters are covering the very sea.” Inscribed on human hearts, that knowledge even now impels true Christians to live in peace and harmony with one another. What is more, they take seriously Jesus’ words said in prayer: “This means everlasting life, their taking in knowledge of you, the only true God, and of the one whom you sent forth, Jesus Christ.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:17:3-43:17:3" data-bid="7-1" class="b">John 17:3</a>.</p>

Was It Designed?
The Water-Repellent Lotus Leaf
▪ Self-cleaning plastic cups? Windows that stay dry in the rain? Microscopic machines that operate with little friction? Scientists say these are just a few benefits that could come our way if we succeed in tapping into the secrets of the lotus leaf.
Consider: The surface of the lotus leaf is covered with microscopic bumps that are, in turn, covered with wax crystals. Droplets of water that fall on the leaf are suspended on these structures, which act as a water repellent. The slope of the leaf causes the water to roll off before it even has a chance to reach the leaf’s surface. The result? Not only is the lotus leaf kept dry but it is also kept clean, as dirt and dust particles are carried off in the droplets.
Scientists want to develop materials that mimic the lotus leaf’s water-repellent properties. Even microscopic machines, which are subject to damage from water, would benefit from a design similar to that of the lotus leaf. “The potential uses are endless,” reports Science Daily.
What do you think? Did the lotus leaf come about by chance? Or was it designed?

<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">The Bible contains gems of wisdom on those subjects and more. Granted, finding these gems may take effort. But expending that effort is a lot like going on a treasure hunt: The more challenging the search, the more exciting the discovery!<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:2:1-20:2:6" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Proverbs 2:1-6</a>.</p>

<p id="p58" data-pid="58" class="sc"><strong>MAKE THE SCRIPTURES LIVE!</strong></p>
<p id="p59" data-pid="59" class="sn">Get involved in what you read. For example:</p>
<p id="p60" data-pid="60" class="su">□ Convert lists of names into <strong>family trees.</strong></p>
<p id="p61" data-pid="61" class="su">□ Create <strong>diagrams. </strong>For instance, as you read about a faithful character, connect that person’s qualities and acts with the blessings he or she received.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:28:20-20:28:20" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Proverbs 28:20</a>.</p>

<p id="p69" data-pid="69" class="su">□ Draw a <strong>storyboard, </strong>a series of simple pictures to illustrate a sequence of events. Describe what’s happening in each scene.</p>
<p id="p70" data-pid="70" class="su">□ Build a <strong>scale model </strong>of structures, such as Noah’s ark.<wbr />—For example, see <a class="xt" data-xtid="6" href="jwpub://p/E:102007008/16-26"><em>Awake! </em>of January 2007, page 22</a>.</p>
<p id="p71" data-pid="71" class="su">□ <strong>Read aloud </strong>with friends or family members. Suggestion: Assign one person to read the narration. Others can take on character parts.</p>
<p id="p72" data-pid="72" class="su">□ Select an account, and turn it into a <strong>news story. </strong>Report the event from several perspectives by including “interviews” with the main characters and eyewitnesses.</p>
<p id="p73" data-pid="73" class="su">□ Take an account in which a character made an unwise decision and <strong>imagine a different ending! </strong>For example, consider Peter’s denial of Jesus. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/41:14:66-41:14:72" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Mark 14:66-72</a>) How could Peter have better responded to the pressure?</p>
<p id="p74" data-pid="74" class="su">□ Watch or listen to <strong>recordings </strong>of Bible dramas.</p>
<p id="p75" data-pid="75" class="su">□ <strong>Write your own drama. </strong>Include lessons that can be learned from the account.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:15:4-45:15:4" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Romans 15:4</a>.</p>

<p id="p78" data-pid="78" class="sc"><strong>TO GET MOTIVATED</strong></p>
<p id="p79" data-pid="79" class="su">▪ Set a goal! Write below a date by which you would like to start your Bible-reading program.</p>
<p id="p80" data-pid="80" class="si">․․․․․</p>
<p id="p81" data-pid="81" class="su">▪ Choose a portion of the Bible that interests you. (See the box <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:102009128/43">“In What Order Will You Read the Bible?”</a>) Then write below which part of the Bible you will read first.</p>
<p id="p82" data-pid="82" class="si">․․․․․</p>
<p id="p83" data-pid="83" class="su">▪ Begin with a small amount of time. Even 15 minutes of Bible reading is better than no time at all. Write below how much time you can set aside for this activity.</p>
<p id="p84" data-pid="84" class="si">․․․․․</p>
<p id="p85" data-pid="85" class="si"><strong>Suggestion: </strong>Keep a study Bible. Write notes in it. Mark verses that are especially meaningful to you.</p>

<p id="p87" data-pid="87" class="sc"><strong>WHAT YOUR PEERS SAY</strong></p>
<p id="p88" data-pid="88" class="sc">  “I try to read a little of the Bible each night before I go to bed. This gives me something good to think about as I fall asleep.”<wbr />—Megan.</p>
<p id="p89" data-pid="89" class="se">  “I focus on one verse for 15 minutes. I’ll read every footnote, look up every cross-reference, and do additional research. Sometimes I don’t finish a verse in one sitting, but I get so much out of my reading with this method!”<wbr />—Corey.</p>
<p id="p90" data-pid="90" class="se">  “Once, I read the Bible in 10 months. With that pace I saw connections between different parts of the Bible that I’d never noticed before.”<wbr />—John.</p>
<p id="p91" data-pid="91" class="se"><strong>[Box on page 25]</strong></p>
<p id="p92" data-pid="92" class="sc"><strong>YOU GET TO CHOOSE!</strong></p>
<p id="p93" data-pid="93" class="su">□ <strong>Pick an event. </strong>The Bible is packed with real-life drama. Pick an account that interests you, and read it from beginning to end.</p>
<p id="p94" data-pid="94" class="si"><strong>Suggestion: </strong>For ideas on how to get even more out of the account, see <a class="xt" data-xtid="7" href="jwpub://p/E:1102008141/48-59">page 292 of the book <em>Questions Young People Ask<wbr />—Answers That Work, </em>Volume 2</a>, published by Jehovah’s Witnesses.</p>
<p id="p95" data-pid="95" class="su">□ <strong>Pick a Gospel. </strong>Read Matthew (the first Gospel written), Mark (noted for being fast-moving and action-packed), Luke (which gives special attention to prayer and to women), or John (which covers very little of what is stated in the other Gospels).</p>
<p id="p96" data-pid="96" class="si"><strong>Suggestion: </strong>Before reading, briefly look up information about the Bible book and its writer so that you can better understand what makes that Gospel unique.</p>
<p id="p97" data-pid="97" class="su">□ <strong>Pick a psalm. </strong>For example:</p>
<p id="p98" data-pid="98" class="sk">If you feel alone and friendless, read <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:142:0-19:142:7" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Psalm 142</a>.</p>
<p id="p99" data-pid="99" class="sk">If you’re discouraged over your weaknesses, read <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:51:0-19:51:19" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Psalm 51</a>.</p>
<p id="p100" data-pid="100" class="sk">If you question the value of God’s standards, read <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:73:0-19:73:28" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Psalm 73</a>.</p>
<p id="p101" data-pid="101" class="si"><strong>Suggestion: </strong>Keep a list of psalms you’ve read that are particularly encouraging to <em>you.</em></p>
<p id="p102" data-pid="102" class="se"><strong>[Box on page 26]</strong></p>
<p id="p103" data-pid="103" class="sc"><strong>DIG DEEPER</strong></p>
<p id="p104" data-pid="104" class="su">▪ <strong>Consider the setting. </strong>Examine the timing, location, and circumstances surrounding a passage.</p>
<p id="p105" data-pid="105" class="si"><strong>Example: </strong><em>Read </em><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/26:14:14-26:14:14" data-bid="8-1" class="b"><em>Ezekiel 14:14</em></a><em>. </em>About what age may Daniel have been when Jehovah mentioned him as a good example alongside Noah and Job?</p>
<p id="p106" data-pid="106" class="si"><strong>Clue: </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/26:14:1-26:14:23" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ezekiel chapter 14</a> was recorded just five years after Daniel was exiled to Babylon<wbr />—likely as a teenager.</p>
<p id="p107" data-pid="107" class="si"><strong>The hidden gem: </strong>Was Daniel too young for Jehovah to notice his faithfulness? What good decisions led to blessings for him? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/27:1:8-27:1:17" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Daniel 1:8-17</a>) How can Daniel’s example help <em>you </em>to make good decisions?</p>
<p id="p108" data-pid="108" class="su">▪ <strong>Analyze details. </strong>Sometimes just a word or two is significant.</p>
<p id="p109" data-pid="109" class="si"><strong>Example: </strong><em>Compare </em><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:28:7-40:28:7" data-bid="11-1" class="b"><em>Matthew 28:7</em></a> <em>with </em><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/41:16:7-41:16:7" data-bid="12-1" class="b"><em>Mark 16:7</em></a><em>. </em>Why did Mark include the detail that Jesus would soon appear to the disciples <em>“and Peter”?</em></p>
<p id="p110" data-pid="110" class="si"><strong>Clue: </strong>Mark was not an eyewitness of these events; evidently, he got his information from Peter.</p>
<p id="p111" data-pid="111" class="si"><strong>The hidden gem: </strong>Why must Peter have felt reassured to hear that Jesus wanted to see him again? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/41:14:66-41:14:72" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Mark 14:66-72</a>) How did Jesus prove himself a real friend to Peter? How can you imitate Jesus and be a real friend to others?</p>
<p id="p112" data-pid="112" class="su">▪ <strong>Do further research. </strong>Consult Bible literature for explanations.</p>
<p id="p113" data-pid="113" class="si"><strong>Example: </strong><em>Read </em><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:2:7-40:2:15" data-bid="14-1" class="b"><em>Matthew 2:7-15</em></a><em>. </em>When did the astrologers visit Jesus?</p>
<p id="p114" data-pid="114" class="si"><strong>Clue: </strong>See <a class="xt" data-xtid="8" href="jwpub://p/E:2008005/1-11"><em>The Watchtower </em>of January 1, 2008, page 31</a>, published by Jehovah’s Witnesses.</p>
<p id="p115" data-pid="115" class="si"><strong>The hidden gem: </strong>How, evidently, did Jehovah provide materially for Jesus’ family while they were in Egypt? How can trust in God help you to cope with stressful circumstances?<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:6:33-40:6:34" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Matthew 6:33, 34</a>.</p>

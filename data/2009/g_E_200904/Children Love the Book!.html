<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">▪ Children of all ages are fascinated by the book <em>Learn From the Great Teacher. </em>One girl wrote: “The book had a lot of features that I liked. For instance, I really enjoyed all the pictures. The vivid colors catch the reader’s attention. When I read the book, I took some time to analyze the illustrations to see how they tie in with the story!</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“Another thing I liked in the book were the words used. They are easy to understand and make reading more enjoyable.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“When I read this book, I was spellbound by the way it discussed some of today’s problems and how we can avoid them. Chapters that I really appreciated were ‘We Need to Resist Temptations,’ ‘A Lesson on Being Kind,’ and ‘Do You Always Want to Be First?’”</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">▪ A French-speaking couple who are Jehovah’s Witnesses entered an apartment building in the city of Ajaccio, on the Mediterranean island of Corsica. On the floor they found a blank envelope containing 400 euros. The wife explains what they did next: “We attached a note to the public notice board in the lobby, saying that the person who lost the envelope could call us at our number.”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The next evening a woman called. After she gave proof that she was the one who had lost the money, she arranged to meet the couple. Astonished that someone would return her money, she arrived with a bouquet of flowers. The envelope she had lost contained her wages, and the next day she was going on vacation for a month.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">While she was away, she sent the couple a card, thanking them once again for their kind gesture. When the woman returned from vacation, the two Witnesses called on her and spoke about the practical value of the Bible in family life and in everyday conduct, subjects that were of interest to her.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Using the book <em>What Does the Bible Really Teach? </em>the couple took the opportunity to discuss a few points from the chapter <a class="xt" data-xtid="5" href="jwpub://p/E:1102005144/1-33">“How to Make Your Family Life Happy.”</a> The woman was impressed and exclaimed: “Why, everything I need is in the Bible!” She then accepted a free Bible study.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">The <em>Bible Teach </em>book discusses not only family life but also the truth about God and Jesus Christ, as well as where the dead are, why God allows suffering, and many other topics that are of concern to people.

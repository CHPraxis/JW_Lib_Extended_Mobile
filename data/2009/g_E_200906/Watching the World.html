<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Archaeologists digging in Jerusalem’s ancient City of David have discovered a 2,600-year-old clay seal impression, or bulla, bearing the name of “Gedaliah the son of Pashhur.” Gedaliah is spoken of in the Bible at <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/24:38:1-24:38:1" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Jeremiah 38:1</a>, as is Yehukhal<wbr />—called “Jucal [shortened form of Jehucal (Yehukhal)] the son of Shelemiah”—<wbr />whose name was found on a bulla in the same area in 2005. The two men were officials in the court of King Zedekiah. <em>The Jerusalem Post </em>reports: “This is the first time in the annals of Israeli archeology that two clay bullae with two Biblical names that appear in the same verse in the Bible have been unearthed in the same location.”</p>

<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">“It had been thought only chimpanzees, dolphins and elephants shared the human ability to recognize their own bodies in a mirror,” says a Reuters report. Now, Eurasian magpies have been recognized as members of this “club,” which had commonly been believed to be exclusive. Researchers marked magpies’ bodies with a colored dot that they could see only in a mirror. “The birds regularly scratched the mark on their body, proving they recognized the image in the mirror as themselves and not another animal,” claims the report.</p>

Can the Bible Be Understood?
“Our family read the Bible every Sunday. I didn’t really enjoy it very much. I believed that the Bible is God’s Word, but most of what I read was very difficult to understand.”—Steven, Britain.
“When I was 17, I tried to read the Bible. I found it hard to understand, so I just gave up.”—Valvanera, Spain.
“I read the Bible once because I felt that as a Catholic, I should read it. It took me three years to finish! But I understood hardly any of it.”—Jo-Anne, Australia.
THE Bible remains the most popular book in the world. It continues to outsell all other books, being available to more people, in more languages, and in more formats than ever before. Yet, many who own a Bible find it difficult to understand. Is that true of you?
Does the Author Want Us to Understand His Word?
“All Scripture is inspired of God,” says the Bible. (2 Timothy 3:16) Yes, Jehovah God is the Bible’s Author. Does he want us to understand his Word? Or did he deliberately make the Bible unfathomable to all but a privileged few, such as clergymen and Bible scholars?
Consider the following verses from the Bible itself:
“This commandment that I am commanding you today is not too difficult for you, nor is it far away.”—Deuteronomy 30:11.
“The very disclosure of your words gives light, making the inexperienced ones understand.”—Psalm 119:130.
“In that very hour [Jesus] became overjoyed in the holy spirit and said: ‘I publicly praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have carefully hidden these things from wise and intellectual ones, and have revealed them to babes.’”—Luke 10:21.
The Author of the Bible does, indeed, want you to understand his Word! However, the fact remains that many sincere people find this book difficult to comprehend. What can help? The articles that follow outline three suggestions that can help you to understand the Bible.

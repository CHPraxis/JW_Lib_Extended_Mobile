<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="ss"><strong>Does the Author Want Us to Understand His Word?</strong></p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">“All Scripture is inspired of God,” says the Bible. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/55:3:16-55:3:16" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Timothy 3:16</a>) Yes, Jehovah God is the Bible’s Author. Does he want us to understand his Word? Or did he deliberately make the Bible unfathomable to all but a privileged few, such as clergymen and Bible scholars?</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Consider the following verses from the Bible itself:</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="si"><em>“This commandment that I am commanding you today is not too difficult for you, nor is it far away.”<wbr />—</em><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/5:30:11-5:30:11" data-bid="2-1" class="b"><em>Deuteronomy 30:11</em></a><em>.</em></p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="si"><em>“The very disclosure of your words gives light, making the inexperienced ones understand.”<wbr />—</em><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:119:130-19:119:130" data-bid="3-1" class="b"><em>Psalm 119:130</em></a><em>.</em></p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="si"><em>“In that very hour </em>[<em>Jesus</em>] <em>became overjoyed in the holy spirit and said: ‘I publicly praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have carefully hidden these things from wise and intellectual ones, and have revealed them to babes.’”<wbr />—</em><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:10:21-42:10:21" data-bid="4-1" class="b"><em>Luke 10:21</em></a><em>.</em></p>

<p data-pid="2" class="p2 sb"> After the death of Jesus’ apostles, by the beginning of the second century C.E., the early Church Fathers gained prominence. Describing their teachings, the <em>New Catholic Encyclopedia </em>(2003), Volume 6, page 687, says: “The general stream of teaching was that heavenly bliss is granted to the disembodied soul immediately after whatever necessary purification follows death.”</p>

<h2 class="inline" id="p3" data-pid="3"><strong>What does the Bible say?</strong></h2><div class="pGroup">
<p data-pid="3" class="p3 sb"> “Happy are the mild-tempered ones, since they will inherit <em>the earth.”<wbr /></em>—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:5:5-40:5:5" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matthew 5:5</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Although Jesus promised his disciples that he would “prepare a place” for them in heaven, he indicated that the righteous do not automatically go there. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:3:13-43:3:13" data-bid="2-1" class="b">John 3:13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:14:2-43:14:3" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 14:2, 3</a>) Did he not pray that God’s will take place “as in heaven, <em>also upon earth”? </em>(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:6:9-40:6:10" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matthew 6:9, 10</a>) In reality, one of two destinies awaits the righteous. A minority will rule in heaven with Christ, but the majority will live forever on earth.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:5:10-66:5:10" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Revelation 5:10</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Over time, the early church changed its view of its own role on the earth. With what result? “The institutional church increasingly replaced the expected Kingdom of God,” states <em>The New Encyclopædia Britannica. </em>The church began solidifying its power by becoming mixed up in politics, ignoring Jesus’ explicit statements that his followers were to be “no part of the world.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:15:19-43:15:19" data-bid="5-1" class="b">John 15:19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:17:14-43:17:16" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 17:14-16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:18:36-43:18:36" data-bid="5-3" class="b"> 18:36</a>) Under the influence of the Roman Emperor Constantine, the church compromised some of its beliefs, one of which involved the very nature of God.</p>

<p data-pid="2" class="p2 sb"> “The impression could arise that the Trinitarian dogma is in the last analysis a late 4th-century invention. In a sense, this is true . . . The formulation ‘one God in three Persons’ was not solidly established, certainly not fully assimilated into Christian life and its profession of faith, prior to the end of the 4th century.”<wbr />—<em>New Catholic Encyclopedia </em>(1967), Volume 14, page 299.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“The Council of Nicaea met on May 20, 325 [C.E.]. Constantine himself presided, actively guiding the discussions, and personally proposed . . . the crucial formula expressing the relation of Christ to God in the creed issued by the council, ‘of one substance with the Father.’ . . . Overawed by the emperor, the bishops, with two exceptions only, signed the creed, many of them much against their inclination.”<wbr />—<em>Encyclopædia Britannica </em>(1970), Volume 6, page 386.</p>

<h2 class="inline" id="p4" data-pid="4"><strong>What does the Bible say?</strong></h2><div class="pGroup">
<p data-pid="4" class="p4 sb"> “Stephen, filled with the Holy Spirit, gazed into heaven and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing at God’s right hand. ‘Look! I can see heaven thrown open,’ he said, ‘and the Son of man standing at the right hand of God.’”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:7:55-44:7:56" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Acts 7:55, 56</a>, <em>The New Jerusalem Bible.</em></p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">What did this vision reveal? Filled with God’s active force, Stephen saw Jesus “standing at God’s right hand.” Clearly, then, Jesus did not become God again after his resurrection to heaven but, rather, a distinct spiritual being. There is no mention of a third person next to God in this account. Despite attempts to find passages of Scripture to support the Trinity dogma, Dominican priest Marie-Émile Boismard wrote in his book <em>À l’aube du christianisme<wbr />—La naissance des dogmes </em>(At the Dawn of Christianity—<wbr />The Birth of Dogmas): “The statement that there are three persons in the one God . . . cannot be read anywhere in the New Testament.”</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">The dogma that Constantine championed was intended to put an end to dissensions within the fourth-century Church. However, it actually raised another issue: Was Mary, the woman who bore Jesus, “the Mother of God”?</p>

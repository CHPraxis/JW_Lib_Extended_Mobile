Announcements
▪ Literature offer for March: What Does the Bible Really Teach? Make a diligent effort to start Bible studies. April and May: The Watchtower and Awake! magazines. When making return visits on interested people, including those who attend the Memorial or other theocratic events but who are not actively associated with the congregation, concentrate on starting studies using the Bible Teach book. June: What Does the Bible Really Teach? If householders already have the book, publishers may offer any 192-page book printed on paper that discolors or any book published prior to 1992, with the exception of Creation, Greatest Man, Mankind’s Search for God, and Young People Ask.
▪ New issues of The Watchtower and Awake! are to be distributed as soon as they are received. That will allow publishers to become familiar with the contents before offering the magazines in field service.
▪ Immediately after the Memorial, the total attendance and number of partakers should be submitted to the branch office using the jw.org Web site. If this is not possible, a letter may be sent. When multiple congregations meet together, only one congregation should submit the total attendance figure.

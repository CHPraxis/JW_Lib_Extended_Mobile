Mankind’s Oldest Modern Book is the first of three separate video presentations found on the DVD The Bible​—A Book of Fact and Prophecy. After watching this video, answer the following questions:
(1) In what ways does the Bible agree with modern science? (2) How can we be sure that our modern Bibles accurately represent the original writings? (3) What is an outstanding textual feature of ancient Bible manuscripts? (4) In what ways did John Wycliffe, Johannes Gutenberg, William Tyndale, John Hus, Martin Luther, Casiodoro de Reina, and Charles Taze Russell contribute to the spreading of God’s Word around the world, and how did the church fiercely oppose the Bible? (5) How has the Bible’s practical counsel helped people deal with problems of health (Ps. 34:8), compulsive gambling (1 Tim. 6:9, 10), marital separation and infidelity (1 Cor. 13:4, 5; Eph. 5:28-33), and preoccupation with material riches (Matt. 16:26)? (6) What evidence is there that applying Scriptural principles can overcome national, ethnic, and racial hatred (Luke 10:27)? (7) In what ways has adhering to Bible principles brought you greater happiness? (8) How can you use this video to help others?​—See the February 2006 Our Kingdom Ministry, page 8.

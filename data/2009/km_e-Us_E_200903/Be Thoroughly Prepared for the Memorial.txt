Be Thoroughly Prepared for the Memorial
What a joy and a privilege it is for followers of the Christ to prepare thoroughly for the night when we commemorate the death of Jesus Christ! (Luke 22:19) What practical steps should be taken to prepare for the Memorial?
▪ Time and Location: Everyone should clearly understand the hour and the exact location that the Memorial will be held. If more than one congregation will be meeting at the Kingdom Hall, it is important to arrive on time and depart in an orderly fashion, since the time allotted between meetings is limited. Efforts should be made to avoid unnecessary congestion in the entryway, in the lobby, on the public sidewalks, and in the parking lot.
▪ Invitations: Do all the publishers have their supply of invitations, and are they familiar with the contents? Have you rehearsed how you will present this invitation? To whom will you give an invitation? Efforts should be made so that all invitations are placed.
▪ Transportation: Some interested ones as well as a number of brothers and sisters may need transportation or other personal assistance. What arrangements have been made to care for their needs?
▪ Emblems: Make sure that the emblems will not be passed until after sundown. Arrangements should be made to serve any of the anointed who are infirm and unable to be present. The appropriate type of bread and wine should be obtained and made ready.​—See the February 15, 2003, Watchtower, pages 14-15, paragraphs 14, 17.
▪ Kingdom Hall: The hall should be thoroughly cleaned ahead of time. Plates, wine cups or wineglasses, and a suitable table and tablecloth should be brought to the hall and put in place in advance. If another meeting place is used, ensure that there will be a suitable sound system so that all in attendance will be able to hear the speaker. Attendants and servers should be selected and instructed in advance about their duties, the proper procedure to be followed, and the need for dignified dress and grooming.
On this most important occasion, the Memorial of the death of Jesus Christ, we want to be thoroughly prepared individually and as a congregation. Certainly, Jehovah’s rich blessing will be upon all who demonstrate heartfelt appreciation for all that Jehovah has provided for mankind through the sacrifice of his beloved Son, Jesus Christ.

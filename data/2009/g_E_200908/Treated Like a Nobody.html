<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sa">“During my first year at primary school in Spain, the other children in my class kept calling me names, since I was much shorter than they were. I would go home crying nearly every day.”<wbr />—Jennifer, a daughter of Filipino immigrants.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sa">“When I moved to a new school, white fellow students called me insulting names. I knew they wanted to provoke me into a fight. Somehow, though, I kept my cool<wbr />—but inside I felt hurt and rejected.”<wbr />—Timothy, an African-American.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sa">“When I was seven years old, the Igbo and Hausa people in Nigeria clashed with each other. The hatred affected me, and I began to make fun of a boy in my class who was Hausa, even though he had been my friend.”<wbr />—John, a member of the Igbo ethnic group.</p>

Perhaps it was because of your skin color, your religion, your economic status, your gender, or even your age.

When they walk by a group of people, go into a store, move to a new school, or attend a social gathering, they may become sick with anxiety.</p>

When officially sanctioned, discrimination can lead to such evils as ethnic cleansing and genocide. An ancient example of an attempted genocide is found in the Bible book of Esther.

Says a former United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights: “Six decades after the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights . . . , the principles of equality and non-discrimination are still far from a universal reality.” That is disturbing because immigration and the influx of refugees have significantly altered the demographics of many lands.</p>

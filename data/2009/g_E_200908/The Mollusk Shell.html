<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn">▪ Seashells look fragile, but they are usually difficult to break. “I’d have to hit some of them with a hammer to get a piece off,” says engineer Kenneth Vecchio, reflecting on his childhood days. The toughness of the seashell is especially evident in the shell of mollusks.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span></p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><strong>Consider: </strong>The inner layer of the shell of mollusks (called nacre, or mother-of-pearl) has microscopic scales that are just nanometers, or billionths of a meter, apart. “The complexity we have observed in nacre at the nanoscale is quite amazing and seems likely to be a critical determinant of the toughness of the material,” says Christine Ortiz, associate professor of the Department of Materials Science and Engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, U.S.A.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Science writer Charles Petit describes a magnified view of nacre as “astonishingly orderly.” He explains: “A microscopic cross section looks like brickwork, with flat, hexagonal tablets of a crystalline, calcium carbonate mineral stacked in neat layers. Mortaring them is a flexible protein-rich gum originally secreted by the shellfish.”</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Scientists believe that the secrets of the mollusk’s shell have broad applications<wbr />—tougher armor systems, auto panels, and airplane wings, to name a few. “Nature uses nanoscale structural design principles to produce materials with superior mechanical properties,” says Ortiz. “In many aspects, human engineers have yet to achieve the same skill.”</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><strong>What do you think? </strong>Did the shell of the mollusk with its amazing strength come about by chance? Or was it designed?</p>

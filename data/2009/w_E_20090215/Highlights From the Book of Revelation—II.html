<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="st"><strong>Highlights From the Book of Revelation<wbr />—II</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">WHAT lies ahead for those who worship Jehovah God and for those who do not? What is the future of Satan and his demons? What blessings will obedient mankind experience during the Thousand Year Reign of Christ? The answers to these and other vital questions are revealed at <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:13:1-66:22:21" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Revelation 13:1–22:21</a>.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> These chapters contain the last 9 of the 16 visions that the apostle John received near the end of the first century C.E.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“Happy is he who reads aloud and those who hear the words of this prophecy,” writes John, “and who observe the things written in it.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:1:3-66:1:3" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Rev. 1:3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:22:7-66:22:7" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 22:7</a>) Reading and applying what we learn from the book of Revelation can affect our heart, strengthen our faith in God and his Son, Jesus Christ, and give us a bright hope for the future.<span data-fnid="2" class="fn">b<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="2"></span></span><wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:4:12-58:4:12" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Heb. 4:12</a>.</p>

<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="ss"><strong>(</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:13:1-66:16:21" data-bid="4-1" class="b"><strong>Rev. 13:1–16:21</strong></a><strong>)</strong></p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">“The nations became wrathful,” states <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:11:18-66:11:18" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Revelation 11:18</a>, “and [God’s] own wrath came, and the appointed time . . . to bring to ruin those ruining the earth.” Providing background for this, the eighth vision shows the activity of “a wild beast . . . with ten horns and seven heads.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:13:1-66:13:1" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Rev. 13:1</a>.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">In the ninth vision, John sees “the Lamb standing upon the Mount Zion” and with him “a hundred and forty-four thousand.” They have been “bought from among mankind.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:14:1-66:14:1" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Rev. 14:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:14:4-66:14:4" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 4</a>) Angelic announcements follow. In the next vision, John beholds “seven angels with seven plagues.” Evidently, Jehovah himself commands these angels to pour out “the seven bowls of the anger of God” on various features of Satan’s world. The bowls contain pronouncements and warnings of the judgments God will execute. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:15:1-66:15:1" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Rev. 15:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:16:1-66:16:1" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 16:1</a>) These two visions give details of further Kingdom judgments connected with the third woe and the blowing of the seventh trumpet.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:11:14-66:11:15" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Rev. 11:14, 15</a>.</p>

It makes fire come out of heaven in that it assumes a prophetlike role by claiming to have conquered the forces of evil in the two world wars of the 20th century and to have won a victory over Communism.</p>

Accepting ‘the mark of the wild beast in our hand or upon our forehead’ would amount to permitting the wild beast to control our actions or affect our thinking.</p>

We should help our Bible students to develop a healthy fear of God and to give glory to Jehovah.</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb"><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:14:14-66:14:20" data-bid="19-1" class="b"><strong>14:14-20</strong></a><strong>. </strong>When “the harvest of the earth,” that is, the harvest of those who will be saved, is completed, it will be time for the angel to hurl “into the great winepress of the anger of God” the gathering of “the vine of the earth.” That vine<wbr />—Satan’s corrupt visible system of governments over mankind with its “clusters” of evil fruitage—<wbr />will then be destroyed forever. We should be determined not to be influenced by the vine of the earth.</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb"><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:16:13-66:16:16" data-bid="20-1" class="b"><strong>16:13-16</strong></a><strong>. </strong>“Unclean inspired expressions” symbolize demonic propaganda intended to ensure that the kings of the earth are not swayed by the pouring out of the seven bowls of God’s anger but instead are maneuvered into opposition to Jehovah.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:24:42-40:24:42" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Matt. 24:42,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:24:44-40:24:44" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> 44</a>.</p>

<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">“Babylon the Great,” the world empire of false religion, is a disgusting segment of Satan’s wicked world. The 11th vision portrays her as a “great harlot”<wbr />—an immoral woman—<wbr />“sitting upon a scarlet-colored wild beast.” She is to be completely destroyed by “the ten horns” of the very beast that is carrying her. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:17:1-66:17:1" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Rev. 17:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:17:3-66:17:3" data-bid="24-2" class="b"> 3,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:17:5-66:17:5" data-bid="24-3" class="b"> 5,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:17:16-66:17:16" data-bid="24-4" class="b"> 16</a>) Likening the harlot to a “great city,” the subsequent vision announces her fall and issues an urgent call to God’s people to “get out of her.” The demise of the great city is mourned by many. There is rejoicing in heaven, however, because of “the marriage of the Lamb.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:18:4-66:18:4" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Rev. 18:4,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:18:9-66:18:10" data-bid="25-2" class="b"> 9, 10,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:18:15-66:18:19" data-bid="25-3" class="b"> 15-19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:19:7-66:19:7" data-bid="25-4" class="b"> 19:7</a>) In the 13th vision, the rider of “a white horse” goes to war with the nations.

<p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">What about “the original serpent, who is the Devil and Satan”? When will he be “hurled into the lake of fire”? That is one of the subjects of the 14th vision. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:20:2-66:20:2" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Rev. 20:2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:20:10-66:20:10" data-bid="27-2" class="b"> 10</a>) The last two visions give glimpses of life during the Millennium. As the “revelation” comes to an end, John sees ‘a river of water of life flowing down the middle of the broad way,’ and a wonderful invitation is extended to “anyone thirsting.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:1:1-66:1:1" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Rev. 1:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:22:1-66:22:2" data-bid="28-2" class="b"> 22:1, 2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:22:17-66:22:17" data-bid="28-3" class="b"> 17</a>.</p>

After the destruction of Babylon the Great, the kings of the earth evidently come to realize how useful she was to them. She provided a religious front for their oppressive deeds.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sa">“[Jesus] went up into the mountain; and . . . his disciples came to him; and he . . . began teaching them.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:5:1-40:5:2" data-bid="1-1" class="b">MATT. 5:1, 2</a>.</p>
<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu">1, 2. (a) Under what circumstances did Jesus give his Sermon on the Mount? (b) How did Jesus begin his discourse?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb">IT IS the year 31 C.E. Jesus briefly interrupts his preaching tour of Galilee to observe the Passover in Jerusalem. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:5:1-43:5:1" data-bid="2-1" class="b">John 5:1</a>) Returning to Galilee, he prays all night for God’s guidance in choosing 12 apostles. The next day a crowd gathers as Jesus heals the sick. With his disciples and others present, he sits down on a mountainside and begins teaching.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:4:23-40:5:2" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matt. 4:23–5:2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:6:12-42:6:19" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Luke 6:12-19</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>Jesus starts his discourse<wbr />—the Sermon on the Mount—<wbr />by showing that happiness results from having a good relationship with God. (<em>Read </em><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:5:1-40:5:12" data-bid="4-1" class="b"><em>Matthew 5:1-12</em></a><em>.</em>) Happiness is ‘a state of well-being ranging from contentment to intense joy.’ The nine happinesses that Jesus pronounced highlight why Christians are happy, and these sayings are as beneficial today as they were nearly 2,000 years ago. Let us now consider each of them.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="ss"><strong>“Those Conscious of Their Spiritual Need”</strong></p>
<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu"> 3. What does it mean to be conscious of our spiritual need?</p>

<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu">4, 5. (a) Why are those conscious of their spiritual need happy? (b) How can our spiritual need be satisfied?</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>Those conscious of their spiritual need are happy, “since the kingdom of the heavens belongs to them.” Accepting Jesus as the Messiah opened up for his early disciples the possibility of ruling with him in God’s heavenly Kingdom. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:22:28-42:22:30" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Luke 22:28-30</a>) Whether we personally hope to be a joint heir with Christ in heaven or we look forward to everlasting life in an earthly paradise under Kingdom rule, we can be happy if we are truly conscious of our spiritual need and are fully aware of our dependence on God.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>Not all are conscious of their spiritual need, for many lack faith and do not appreciate sacred things.

Their mourning is sadness over their own sinful state and the conditions existing because of human imperfection. Why are such mourners “happy”? Because they exercise faith in God and Christ and are comforted by having a good relationship with Jehovah.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:3:36-43:3:36" data-bid="10-1" class="b">John 3:36</a>.</p>

How do we really feel about what this world has to offer? The apostle John wrote: “Everything in the world<wbr />—the desire of the flesh and the desire of the eyes and the showy display of one’s means of life—<wbr />does not originate with the Father.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/62:2:16-62:2:16" data-bid="11-1" class="b">1 John 2:16</a>) But what if we sense that our own spirituality is being eroded by “the spirit of the world,” the impelling force that dominates human society alienated from God? Then let us pray fervently, study God’s Word, and seek the help of the elders. As we draw closer to Jehovah, we will “find comfort” for ourselves, regardless of what is causing us distress.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:2:12-46:2:12" data-bid="12-1" class="b">1 Cor. 2:12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:119:52-19:119:52" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> Ps. 119:52;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/59:5:14-59:5:15" data-bid="12-3" class="b"> Jas. 5:14, 15</a>.</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/54:6:11-54:6:11" data-bid="14-1" class="b">1 Tim. 6:11</a>) If we are mild-tempered, we will display meekness by doing Jehovah’s will and accepting his guidance. Mildness of temper will also be evident in the way we deal with fellow believers and others. Such meekness harmonizes with the apostle Paul’s counsel.<wbr />—<em>Read </em><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:12:17-45:12:19" data-bid="15-1" class="b"><em>Romans 12:17-19</em></a><em>.</em></p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><sup>9 </sup>Why are the mild-tempered ones happy? Because “they will inherit the earth,” said mild-tempered Jesus. He is the principal Inheritor of the earth.

<p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu">10. How may a lack of mildness affect our privileges of service and our relationship with others?</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><sup>10 </sup>Like Jesus, we should be mild-tempered. But what if we are known for having a belligerent spirit? Such an aggressive and hostile attitude may cause people to shy away from us. If we are brothers desiring to have responsibilities in the congregation, this trait disqualifies us. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/54:3:1-54:3:1" data-bid="19-1" class="b">1 Tim. 3:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/54:3:3-54:3:3" data-bid="19-2" class="b"> 3</a>) Paul told Titus to keep reminding Christians in Crete “not to be belligerent, to be reasonable, exhibiting all mildness toward all men.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/56:3:1-56:3:2" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Titus 3:1, 2</a>) What a blessing such mildness is to others!</p>

The psalmist said that he was “crushed with longing” for God’s righteous judicial decisions. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:119:20-19:119:20" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Ps. 119:20</a>) Do we prize <span id="page8" class="pageNum" data-no="8" data-before-text="8"></span>righteousness so much that we hunger and thirst for it?</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><sup>12 </sup>Jesus said that those hungering and thirsting for righteousness would be happy because they would be “filled,” or fully satisfied. This became possible after Pentecost 33 C.E., for Jehovah’s holy spirit then began to “give the world convincing evidence concerning . . . righteousness.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:16:8-43:16:8" data-bid="23-1" class="b">John 16:8</a>) By means of the holy spirit, God inspired men to compile the Christian Greek Scriptures, which are so beneficial “for disciplining in righteousness.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/55:3:16-55:3:16" data-bid="24-1" class="b">2 Tim. 3:16</a>) God’s spirit also enables us to “put on the new personality which was created according to God’s will in true righteousness.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/49:4:24-49:4:24" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Eph. 4:24</a>) Is it not comforting to know that those who repentantly seek forgiveness of their sins on the basis of Jesus’ ransom sacrifice can attain a righteous standing with God?<wbr />—<em>Read </em><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:3:23-45:3:24" data-bid="26-1" class="b"><em>Romans 3:23, 24</em></a><em>.</em></p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><sup>13 </sup>If we have an earthly hope, our hunger and thirst for righteousness will be fully satisfied when we enjoy everlasting life under righteous conditions on earth. Meanwhile, let us be determined to live in harmony with Jehovah’s standards.

Jesus miraculously relieved the suffering of many because he had pity for them. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:14:14-40:14:14" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Matt. 14:14</a>) Mercy is manifested in a judicial sense when people forgive those who transgress against them, just as Jehovah mercifully forgives repentant ones.

A fine way to show mercy is to share Bible truths with others.

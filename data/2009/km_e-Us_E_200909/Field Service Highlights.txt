Field Service Highlights
We are happy to report a new peak in Bible studies in the Turks and Caicos Islands for the second consecutive month. The total of 541 Bible studies conducted in the month of May is an increase of 41 over the previous peak of 500 set in April 2009. Truly, the islands are adding to Jehovah’s praise.​—Isa. 42:10

Jehovah God is now opening to you the opportunity to live in a paradise! The time is coming when you will be able to enjoy life in lasting peace and happiness. Our loving and almighty heavenly Father, Jehovah, will make this come true without fail, for he promises: “So my word that goes forth from my mouth will prove to be. It will not return to me without results, but it will certainly do that in which I have delighted.”​—Isaiah 55:10, 11.

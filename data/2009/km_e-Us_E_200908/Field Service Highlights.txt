Field Service Highlights
We are pleased to report that the Memorial attendance in the United States on April 9, 2009, was the highest number ever recorded​—2,469,036. This is 1,409,783 more than the average number of publishers for the 2008 service year. These figures reveal that there is “plenty to do in the work of the Lord.”​—1 Cor. 15:58.
For the second consecutive month, the congregations in the Turks and Caicos Islands reported new peaks in hours, magazines, and Bible studies.

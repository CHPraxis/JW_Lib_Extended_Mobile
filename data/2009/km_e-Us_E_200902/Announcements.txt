Announcements
▪ Literature offer for February: Offer one of the following, as available: Is There a Creator Who Cares About You?, The Bible​—God’s Word or Man’s?, or The Secret of Family Happiness. March: What Does the Bible Really Teach? Make a diligent effort to start Bible studies. April and May: The Watchtower and Awake! magazines. When making return visits on interested people, including those who attend the Memorial or other theocratic events but who are not actively associated with the congregation, concentrate on starting studies using the Bible Teach book.
▪ The special public talk for the 2009 Memorial season will be entitled “Is There a True Religion From God’s Standpoint?” See the related announcement in the September 2008 Our Kingdom Ministry.
▪ In the islands of Micronesia, there is a special need for qualified elders to take the lead in the congregations. (Acts 16:9, 10) Elders, such as those who are retired from their secular employment, are encouraged to consider whether their circumstances allow them to move to one of these islands to assist. Any who may be in a position to do so should follow the steps outlined in the Organized book, pages 111-112, and write to the Guam branch office for further information. (Mal. 3:10; Luke 14:28) The address for the Guam branch office is Watchtower Bible and Tract Society, 143 Jehovah Street, Barrigada, GU 96913.

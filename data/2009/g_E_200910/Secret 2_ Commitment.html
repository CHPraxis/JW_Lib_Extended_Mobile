<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sa">“What God has yoked together let no man put apart.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:19:6-40:19:6" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matthew 19:6</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn"><strong>What this means. </strong>Successful couples view their marriage as a permanent union. When a problem arises, they strive to solve it rather than use it as an excuse to abandon the marriage. When spouses have a sense of commitment, they feel secure. Each trusts that the other will continue to honor the union.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn"><strong>Why it matters. </strong>In many ways, commitment is the backbone of a marriage relationship. Yet, after repeated conflicts, commitment can seem more like a trap than a trust. In effect, “till death do us part” becomes little more than a cold contract<wbr />—one that the mates wish had loopholes. They might not abandon the marriage <em>literally, </em>but they could “walk out” in other ways<wbr />—for example, by retreating into stony silence when serious issues need to be discussed.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn"><strong>Try this exercise. </strong>Rate your level of commitment, using the following questions as a guide.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="su">▪ <em>When we are in the midst of a dispute, do I find myself regretting that I married my spouse?</em></p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="su">▪ <em>Do I often daydream about being with someone other than my spouse?</em></p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="su">▪ <em>Do I sometimes tell my spouse, “I’m leaving you” or “I’m going to find someone who appreciates me”?</em></p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sn"><strong>Make a resolve. </strong>Think of one or two actions you could take to strengthen your commitment. (Some ideas: Write an occasional note to your spouse, keep photos of your spouse on display at work, or phone your spouse each day from work, just to stay in touch.)</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="si">Why not come up with several suggestions and then ask your spouse which would be most meaningful to him or her?</p>

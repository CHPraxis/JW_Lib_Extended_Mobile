Secret 3: Teamwork
“Two are better than one . . . If one of them should fall, the other one can raise his partner up.”—Ecclesiastes 4:9, 10.
What this means. Successful couples respect God’s headship arrangement as outlined in the Bible. (Ephesians 5:22-24) Nevertheless, both husband and wife view their marriage in terms of “ours” and “we” rather than “mine” and “me.” When there is teamwork, husband and wife are no longer single at heart. They are “one flesh”—a Bible term that describes not only the permanence of the union but also its intimacy.—Genesis 2:24.
Why it matters. If you and your spouse are not a team, minor events may quickly become major issues with each of you attacking the other rather than the problem at hand. In contrast, when you and your spouse are a team, you become like pilot and copilot with the same flight plan rather than two pilots on a collision course. When you disagree, you work out practical solutions instead of wasting time and emotional energy blaming and accusing.
Try this exercise. Rate your spirit of teamwork by answering the following questions.
▪ Do I view the money I earn as “all mine,” since I am the one who earned it?
▪ Do I keep my distance from my spouse’s relatives, even though he or she is close to them?
▪ To relax fully, do I need to be away from my spouse?
Make a resolve. Think of one or two ways you could show yourself to be more team-oriented with your spouse.
Why not ask your spouse what he or she would suggest?

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sa">“Let your reasonableness become known.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/50:4:5-50:4:5" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Philippians 4:5</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn"><strong>What this means. </strong>In successful families, husbands and wives make allowances for each other’s mistakes. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:3:23-45:3:23" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Romans 3:23</a>) They are also neither unduly rigid nor overly permissive with their children. They set a modest number of household rules. When correction is needed, they give it “to the proper degree.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/24:30:11-24:30:11" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Jeremiah 30:11</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn"><strong>Why it matters. </strong>The Bible says that “the wisdom from above is . . . reasonable.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/59:3:17-59:3:17" data-bid="4-1" class="b">James 3:17</a>) God himself does not demand perfection from imperfect humans, so why should a married couple demand it from each other? Really, nitpicking over minor faults only produces resentment, not improvement. It is best to accept the fact that “we all stumble many times.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/59:3:2-59:3:2" data-bid="5-1" class="b">James 3:2</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Successful parents display reasonableness when dealing with their children. Their discipline is not excessive, nor are they “hard to please.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/60:2:18-60:2:18" data-bid="6-1" class="b">1 Peter 2:18</a>) They grant freedoms to adolescents who demonstrate a sense of responsibility. They do not try to micromanage. One reference work notes that trying to control every aspect of an adolescent’s life “is the equivalent of performing a violent and exhausting rain dance to make it rain. There won’t be any rain, but you will get worn out.”</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn"><strong>Try this exercise. </strong>Rate your level of reasonableness by answering the following questions.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="su">▪ <em>When was the last time you praised your spouse?</em></p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="su">▪ <em>When was the last time you criticized your spouse?</em></p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sn"><strong>Make a resolve. </strong>If you struggled to find an answer to the first question in the accompanying exercise but had no problem answering the second, think of a goal you could set with regard to your expectations.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="si">Why not discuss with your spouse what resolves you both might make?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Think of some freedoms you could grant your adolescent as he or she demonstrates a sense of responsibility.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="si">Why not have an open discussion with your adolescent about such issues as curfews?</p>

<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sc">Like a careful driver, a reasonable family member is prepared to yield</p>

Purpose of Study Articles
Study Articles 1, 2  PAGES 3-11
These articles examine in subject order all the verses of Romans chapter 12. We will consider what it means to “be aglow with the spirit” and to offer our bodies as a living sacrifice to God. We will also learn how we can be peacemakers at home and within the congregation and in what ways we can conquer evil with good.
Study Articles 3, 4  PAGES 13-21
What does it mean to be a good friend? These articles will help us to see how Jesus set the pattern in this regard and how the first-century Christians followed his example. They will explain, too, why it is helpful for us to form strong, upbuilding friendships today and how we can do so.

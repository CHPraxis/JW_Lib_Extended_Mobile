To Whom Do We Belong?

(Romans 14:8)



1. To whom do you belong?
Which god do you now obey?
Your master is he to whom you bow.
He is your god; you serve him now.
You cannot serve two gods;
Both masters can never share
The love of your heart in its ev’ry part.
To neither you would be fair.
2. To whom do you belong?
Which god will you now obey?
For one god is false and one is true,
So make your choice; it’s up to you.
Shall Caesar of this world
Possess your allegiance still?
Or will you obey the true God today
By always doing his will?
3. To whom do I belong?
Jehovah I will obey.
My Father in heaven I shall serve;
I’ll pay my vows without reserve.
He bought me at great cost;
Devoted to him I’ll stay.
The death of his Son my ransom has won;
His name I’ll honor each day.



(See also Josh. 24:15; Ps. 116:14, 18; 2 Tim. 2:19.)

Ever Loyal

(Psalm 18:25)



1. Ever loyal to Jehovah,
Loyal love we wish to show.
As a people, dedicated,
His commands we want to know.
His advice will never fail us,
And his counsel we obey.
He is loyal; we can trust him.
From his side we’ll never stray.
2. Ever loyal to our brothers,
Sticking close in times of need.
Ever caring, always trusting,
Ever kind in word and deed.
We show honor to our brothers
And respect them from the heart.
Let the Bible draw us closer;
From their side we’ll never part.
3. Ever loyal to their guidance
When our brothers take the lead.
When they give us clear direction,
May our mind and heart give heed.
Then the blessing from Jehovah
Will be ours to make us strong.
When we’re loyal, ever faithful,
To Jehovah we’ll belong.

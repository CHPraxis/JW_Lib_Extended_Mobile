Grateful for God’s Word

(Philippians 2:16)



1. Jehovah, our Father, we want to express
How grateful we are that your Word we possess!
Its writers you inspired to tell your very thought.
By Scripture we’re guided; by you we are taught.
2. Endowed are its pages with human appeal.
Your prophets were like us; they felt what we feel.
We gather faith and courage by learning of their lives.
Our heart it refreshes; our soul it revives.
3. Your word has such power to reach deep inside,
Yes, even the spirit and soul to divide.
It searches our intentions and motives of our hearts.
It offers correction and wisdom imparts.

Jehovahâ€™s Attributes

(Revelation 4:11)



1. Jehovah God, exalted in might,
Source of all life and Provider of light.
Creation speaks of your power so great;
More your great day will still relate.
2. Your lofty throne, on justice it stands.
Thus you make known all your righteous commands.
And as we turn to your Word, we can see
Your wisdom shine so brilliantly.
3. Greatest of all is your perfect love.
None can repay all your gifts from above.
Your attributes and your glorious name,
Exultingly we will proclaim.



(See also Ps. 36:9; 145:6-13; Jas. 1:17.)

The Scene of This World Is Changing

(1 Corinthians 7:31)



1. To give us hope and to save us
From sin and death that enslave us,
His only Son our God gave us​—
No gift could have greater worth.
(CHORUS)
Though the scene of this world
is now changing,
God has been wisely arranging
Blessings for heaven and earth.

2. The world around us is ailing.
The wicked system is failing.
But God’s rule we are now hailing;
The Kingdom has come to birth.
(CHORUS)
Though the scene of this world
is now changing,
God has been wisely arranging
Blessings for heaven and earth.

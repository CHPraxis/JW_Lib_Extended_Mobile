Making Our Way Successful

(Joshua 1:8)



1. We delight in Jehovah’s Word.
May we read it each day.
Sound each thought in an undertone;
Meditate and obey.
May it guide ev’ry step we take,
Ev’ry thought we express.
(CHORUS)
Read and meditate, then obey.
This Jehovah will bless.
Walk with him each and ev’ry day.
Find the way to success.

2. When the kings ruled in Israel,
They received this command:
‘Ev’ry king for himself must write
God’s Law in his own hand.
He must read in it all his days,
That he may not transgress.’
(CHORUS)
Read and meditate, then obey.
This Jehovah will bless.
Walk with him each and ev’ry day.
Find the way to success.

3. As we feed on God’s Word each day,
Hope and comfort we find.
Calm descends on our troubled hearts;
Faith in Him is refined.
When we truly embrace his Word,
We mature and progress.
(CHORUS)
Read and meditate, then obey.
This Jehovah will bless.
Walk with him each and ev’ry day.
Find the way to success.

We Are Jehovah’s Army!

(Joel 2:7)



1. We are Jehovah’s army,
Freed from Satan’s chains,
Preaching about God’s Kingdom,
In which Jesus now reigns.
As we press on faithfully,
Each a volunteer,
We remain determined
With no hint of fear.
(CHORUS)
We are Jehovah’s army;
With his Christ we’re one,
Joyfully proclaiming,
“God’s rule has begun.”

2. We are Jehovah’s servants,
Searching for his sheep,
Those who are lost and lonely,
Those who sigh and who weep.
These we try to find and feed
With repeated calls;
These we keep inviting
To our Kingdom Halls.
(CHORUS)
We are Jehovah’s army;
With his Christ we’re one,
Joyfully proclaiming,
“God’s rule has begun.”

3. This is Jehovah’s army
Under Christ’s command,
Fully equipped for battle,
Each one firmly will stand.
Cautious though we need to be,
Upright we remain.
In the face of danger,
Truth we will maintain.
(CHORUS)
We are Jehovah’s army;
With his Christ we’re one,
Joyfully proclaiming,
“God’s rule has begun.”

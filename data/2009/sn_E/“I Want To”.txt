“I Want To”

(Luke 5:13)



1. Oh, what love God’s Son for us showed
When he left his Father’s abode
That with men he might live,
God’s truth he could give;
This truth from his lips ever flowed.
Greatly he did comfort mankind,
Healed those who were sick, lame, and blind.
To his royal commission he proved true
And lovingly said: “I want to.”
2. Oh, what help Jehovah God gave
When he sent the faithful wise slave,
With whom we serve with joy,
Our powers employ,
That meek ones we might help to save.
Those in need can easily tell
When we love them ever so well.
So if widows and orphans should ask you,
Then readily say: “I want to.”



(See also John 18:37; Eph. 3:19; Phil. 2:7.)

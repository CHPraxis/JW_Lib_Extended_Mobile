Great God, Jehovah

(Exodus 34:6,Â 7)



1. Great God, Jehovah, you are deserving,
Worthy of the highest praise,
Good and just in all your ways.
Your throne is founded firmly on justice;
You are God to endless days.
2. Pardoning error, sin, and transgression,
Merciful to those like you,
Those who practice mercy too.
Your kingly justice, your loving-kindness,
You have shown in all you do.
3. Let men and angels join in your praises;
Let your name be sanctified,
Never more to be denied.
Soon may your Kingdom, ruling in heaven,
Make your will be done earth wide.

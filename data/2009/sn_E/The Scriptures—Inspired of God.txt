The Scriptures​—Inspired of God

(2 Timothy 3:16, 17)



1. God’s Word is a shining light,
Guides our feet through earth’s dark night.
If we follow it faithfully,
Surely its truth will set us free.
2. That divine Word is inspired,
Teaches us what is required.
Help it gives, setting all things straight,
And for God’s discipline to wait.
3. By these Scriptures from above,
We have come to know God’s love.
Reading daily will make us wise,
Showing us how to gain life’s prize.



(See also Ps. 119:105; Prov. 4:13.)

Long-Suffering

(Galatians 5:22)



1. Our Sov’reign Lord, Jehovah,
Is zealous for his holy name.
He fervently desires
To clear it from unrighteous blame.
Through many generations,
Great endurance he has shown;
Long-suffering and patient,
Not weary has he grown.
His will is that salvation
All sorts of people might attain.
Long-suffering forbearance
By God shall not have been in vain.
2. Long-suffering is needed
To keep us on our godly path.
It lets our heart be tranquil,
Protects us from unrighteous wrath.
It finds the good in others,
Always hoping for the best.
It lets us keep our balance
In times when we’re distressed.
Along with other virtues
That holy spirit can bestow,
Long-suffering will help us
To imitate the God we know.

To God We Are Dedicated!

(Matthew 16:24)



1. To Christ, by our God, Jehovah, we have been drawn
To be his disciples from now on.
From Jehovah’s lofty throne,
Light of truth has brightly shone.
In our hearts, our faith has grown;
Ourselves we agree to disown.
(CHORUS)
To God we are dedicated; This is our choice.
In him and in Jesus we now rejoice.

2. In prayer we have come before Jehovah to say
We’ll serve him forever and obey.
It’s a joy beyond compare,
One that we most gladly share,
As Jehovah’s name we bear,
And news of his Kingdom declare.
(CHORUS)
To God we are dedicated; This is our choice.
In him and in Jesus we now rejoice.

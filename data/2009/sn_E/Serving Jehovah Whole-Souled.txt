Serving Jehovah Whole-Souled

(Matthew 22:37)



1. O Jehovah, Sov’reign Ruler,
You are the one I love and obey.
You deserve my full devotion;
Your trust in me I shall not betray.
Your commands I loyally follow;
All you wish I gladly will do.
(CHORUS)
O Jehovah, you are worthy;
Whole-souled devotion I give to you.

2. Father, all your works exalt you.
Earth, moon, and stars your glory proclaim.
I do give my life to serve you;
With all my strength I’ll make known your name.
To my pledge of full dedication,
I will ever strive to be true.
(CHORUS)
O Jehovah, you are worthy;
Whole-souled devotion I give to you.

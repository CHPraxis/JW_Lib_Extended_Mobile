“Here I Am! Send Me”

(Isaiah 6:8)



1. Today men heap reproach and shame,
In many ways on God’s fair name.
Some show God weak; some paint him cruel.
“There is no God!” so shouts the fool.
Who’ll go the name of God to clear?
Who’ll sing his praise for all to hear?
“Lord, here I am! Send me, send me.
I’ll sing your praises faithfully.
(CHORUS)
No greater honor could there be, Lord.
Here I am! Send me, send me.”

2. Men make the taunt that God is slow;
The fear of God they do not know.
Some worship idols made of stone;
Some would put Caesar on God’s throne.
Who’ll tell the wicked what’s in store?
Who’ll warn of God’s great final war?
“Lord, here I am! Send me, send me.
I’ll sound the warning fearlessly.
(CHORUS)
No greater honor could there be, Lord.
Here I am! Send me, send me.”

3. Today the meek ones mourn and sigh
Because the evils multiply.
With honest hearts they seek to find
The truth that gives real peace of mind.
Who’ll go with comfort to the meek?
Who’ll help them righteousness to seek?
“Lord, here I am! Send me, send me.
I’ll teach such meek ones patiently.
(CHORUS)
No greater honor could there be, Lord.
Here I am! Send me, send me.”

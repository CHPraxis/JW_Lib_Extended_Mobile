Song 16
Flee to God’s Kingdom!

(Zephaniah 2:3)



1. Oh, seek Jehovah, you meek ones and lowly;
Seek what is right, and seek meekness today.
Thus it may be in the day of his anger
That you may be hidden away.
(CHORUS)
Flee to God’s Kingdom, the hope of mankind;
Firm for his rule take your stand.
There you will find God’s protection and blessing;
Hasten to heed his command.

2. Come, you who hunger for truth and for justice;
Why longer sorrow and cry out in pain?
Seek now God’s way to escape the oppressor,
Submitting yourself to Christ’s reign.
(CHORUS)
Flee to God’s Kingdom, the hope of mankind;
Firm for his rule take your stand.
There you will find God’s protection and blessing;
Hasten to heed his command.

3. Look up, yes, lift up your heads with rejoicing;
See all the proof that the Kingdom is here!
Welcome the light that Jehovah is sending,
And let him alone be your fear!
(CHORUS)
Flee to God’s Kingdom, the hope of mankind;
Firm for his rule take your stand.
There you will find God’s protection and blessing;
Hasten to heed his command.

Song 8
The Lord’s Evening Meal

(Matthew 26:26-30)



1. Jehovah, our Father in heaven,
Oh, this is a most sacred night!
It was Nisan fourteen when your glory was seen,
Your love, justice, wisdom, and might.
The Passover lamb was then eaten,
And Israel’s tribes went forth free.
Cent’ries later our Lord his own lifeblood outpoured
To fulfill this divine prophecy.
2. We’re gathered together before you.
As sheep of your pasture, we came
To give praise for your love that brought Christ from above,
To honor your most holy name.
We keep this Memorial occasion
Fixed firmly in heart and in mind.
Thus we’ll walk ev’ry day as Christ showed us the way,
And then life everlasting we’ll find.



(See also Luke 22:14-20; 1 Cor. 11:23-26.)

Song 11
Making Jehovah’s Heart Glad

(Proverbs 27:11)



1. Great God, we’ve vowed to do your will;
In wisdom your work we’ll fulfill.
For then we know we’ll have a part
In making glad your loving heart.
2. Your slave, your steward here on earth,
Proclaims your greatness and your worth,
Feeds us with nourishment when due,
Thus strengthens us your will to do.
3. Impart to us your active force,
That we may keep a faithful course
And bring forth fruitage to your praise
And thus make glad your heart always.



(See also Matt. 24:45-47; Luke 11:13; 22:42.)

Imitate Christ’s Mildness

(Matthew 11:28-30)



1. The greatest of men was our Lord Jesus Christ;
By pride or ambition he was not enticed.
God’s purpose gave him the most prominent part;
Yet, always he proved himself lowly in heart.
2. All you who are toiling with burdensome cares,
He bids you come under the yoke that he bears.
Refreshment you’ll find as the Kingdom you seek.
Our Lord is mild-tempered; he favors the meek.
3. ‘All you are just brothers,’ our Lord Jesus said.
So never seek greatness; serve others instead.
The mild and the meek to our God have great worth;
He promises they will inherit the earth.



(See also Matt. 5:5; 23:8; Prov. 3:34; Rom. 12:16.)

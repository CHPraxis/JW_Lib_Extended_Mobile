Praise Jah With Me

(Psalm 146:2)



1. Praise Jah with me;
Loud let it ring!
He gives us life, breath, and ev’ry good thing.
Each day and night,
His name we bless.
His perfect love clothes His almightiness.
We sing his praise, and his name we confess.
2. Praise Jah with me.
He satisfies
And hears our prayers as our needs he supplies.
His mighty arm
Strengthens the weak;
His holy spirit sustains all the meek.
His name we praise; Of his power we speak.
3. Praise Jah with me.
Our God is just;
He brings all comfort, in him we can trust.
Wrongs he will right;
Hearts he will heal.
Rich Kingdom blessings all mankind will feel.
Come let us praise him with joy and with zeal!

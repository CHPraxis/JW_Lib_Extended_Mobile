Life Without End​—At Last!

(John 3:16)



1. Can you see with your mind’s eye,
Peoples dwelling together?
Sorrow has passed. Peace at last!
Life without tears or pain.
(CHORUS)
Sing out with joy of heart!
You too can have a part.
Live for the day when you’ll say,
“Life without end, at last!”

2. In those days old will grow young,
Flesh revived as in childhood.
Troubles are gone, from now on,
No need to weep or fear.
(CHORUS)
Sing out with joy of heart!
You too can have a part.
Live for the day when you’ll say,
“Life without end, at last!”

3. Paradise all will enjoy
As we sing of God’s glory.
Long as we live, we will give
To God, our Maker, thanks.
(CHORUS)
Sing out with joy of heart!
You too can have a part.
Live for the day when you’ll say,
“Life without end, at last!”

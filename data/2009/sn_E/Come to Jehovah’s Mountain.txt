Song 107
Come to Jehovah’s Mountain

(Isaiah 2:2-4)



1. Raise your eyes and behold,
Far above the highest hill.
There stands Jehovah’s mountain
Lifted up in this day.
People come from afar,
Ev’rywhere from sea to sea,
Calling to one another,
‘Come serve God and obey.’
Now the time has arrived
For the small, a great nation to be.
As we grow and we thrive,
God’s direction and blessing we see.
Millions now come to God
And accept his sov’reignty.
Loyal they vow to be
And from his side never stray.
2. Jesus gave the command
To go forth and preach the word.
Good news about the Kingdom
Reaches all men today.
Christ now rules from on high,
Urging all to take his side.
Meek ones who hear his voice
Let God’s Word show them the way.
What a joy to behold
How a great crowd continues to grow!
Yes, we all have a share,
Helping others Jehovah to know.
Let us lift up the voice,
Calling out for all to hear,
‘Come to Jehovah’s mountain,
Here forever to stay.’



(See also Ps. 43:3; 99:9; Isa. 60:22; Acts 16:5.)

Song 27
Take Sides With Jehovah!

(Exodus 32:26)



1. Once with confusion our sad hearts were filled,
Drinking the cup false religion distilled;
But with what happiness our hearts were thrilled
When of God’s Kingdom we heard.
(CHORUS)
Take sides with Jehovah;
Make him your delight.
He’ll never forsake you;
Walk on in his light.
Tell, tell the glad tidings
Of freedom and peace.
His rule by Christ Jesus
Will ever increase.

2. Now we’re rejoicing in serving our God,
Spreading the seeds of his truth all abroad,
Helping our brothers God’s virtues to laud,
Praising his great worthy name.
(CHORUS)
Take sides with Jehovah;
Make him your delight.
He’ll never forsake you;
Walk on in his light.
Tell, tell the glad tidings
Of freedom and peace.
His rule by Christ Jesus
Will ever increase.

3. We will not fear what the Devil can do.
Trusting Jehovah will carry us through.
Though they are many and though we are few,
God is our strength and our might.
(CHORUS)
Take sides with Jehovah;
Make him your delight.
He’ll never forsake you;
Walk on in his light.
Tell, tell the glad tidings
Of freedom and peace.
His rule by Christ Jesus
Will ever increase.

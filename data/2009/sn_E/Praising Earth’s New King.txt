Praising Earth’s New King

(Revelation 7:9)



1. A multitude is gathering
from ev’ry tribe and nation,
Collected by the Christ and his
anointed congregation.
God’s Kingdom has been brought to birth;
His will shall soon be done on earth.
This hope is a gift of priceless worth,
giving joy and consolation.
(CHORUS)
Praise our God, Jehovah;
Praise his Son, Christ Jesus,
Who through the ransom have set us free.
Now we have the hope to live on the earth
And serve God eternally.

2. We hail the Christ, our reigning King,
with sounds of jubilation.
This Prince of Peace shall do God’s will
and bring about salvation.
We see the joys that lie ahead:
An earth released from fear and dread,
The grand resurrection of the dead.
What a time for exultation!
(CHORUS)
Praise our God, Jehovah;
Praise his Son, Christ Jesus,
Who through the ransom have set us free.
Now we have the hope to live on the earth
And serve God eternally.

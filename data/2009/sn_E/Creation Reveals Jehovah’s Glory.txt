Creation Reveals Jehovahâ€™s Glory

(Psalm 19)



1. Jehovah God, my soul is well aware.
A host of stars, your glory does declare.
From day to day and night to night they speak
And without words bring knowledge to the meek.
From day to day and night to night they speak
And without words bring knowledge to the meek.
2. For you have made the sun and moon and stars.
Great oceans stop where you have set their bars.
We lift our eyes and see your heavens grand.
We stand in awe that you remember man.
We lift our eyes and see your heavens grand.
We stand in awe that you remember man.
3. Your laws are pure, and your commands are true.
Day after day, reminders come from you.
They make us wise, are better than fine gold.
Oh, may we keep them, always to them hold.
They make us wise, are better than fine gold.
Oh, may we keep them, always to them hold.

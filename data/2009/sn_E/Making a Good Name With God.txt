Making a Good Name With God

(Ecclesiastes 7:1)



1. Throughout our lifetime, We want to use each day
To make a good name And all God’s laws obey.
If in Jehovah’s sight We strive to do what’s right,
Then to his own heart We’ll bring delight.
2. To seek in this world A celebrated name,
To want its favor, To bask in its acclaim
Is simply vanity. For if its friend we’d be,
Jehovah’s favor We would not see.
3. In God’s remembrance We want our name to be
Inscribed in his book For all eternity.
On him we can depend, So we his truth defend
And keep our good name Down to the end.

Song 26
Oh, Walk With God!

(Micah 6:8)



1. Oh, walk with God in modesty;
Love kindness, and be true.
With God keep your integrity;
Let him your strength renew.
If you would keep his truth so grand,
By men be not beguiled;
But let God lead you by the hand,
Just as a little child.
2. Oh, walk with God in purity;
Relapse not into sin.
Advance to full maturity,
And his approval win.
And on whatever things are pure
And lovely, true, and just,
On these things think; and to endure,
In God put all your trust.
3. Oh, walk with God in faithfulness,
For then you will attain
Contentment true and godliness,
Which are the greatest gain.
Oh, walk with God; be ever glad
His glorious praise to sing.
The greatest joy that can be had,
His Kingdom work will bring.



(See also Gen. 5:24; 6:9; Phil. 4:8; 1Â Tim. 6:6-8.)

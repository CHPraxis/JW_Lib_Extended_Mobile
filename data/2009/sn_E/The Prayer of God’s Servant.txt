The Prayer of Godâ€™s Servant

(Ephesians 6:18)



1. Heavenly Father, Sovereign Lord,
May your great name forever be adored.
Your tender mercies long will endure,
Ever so faithful, ever so sure.
Ever faithful, ever sure,
All your mercies will endure.
2. Love for the truth within us instill.
Help us, O God, to carry out your will.
All your commandments we want to keep,
Finding and feeding your precious sheep.
Finding, feeding your dear sheep,
Your commands we want to keep.
3. Wisdom we seek from heaven above.
Please grant this gift, and fill our hearts with love.
Help us our love and mercy to show,
Helping all men our great God to know.
Helping all our God to know,
May our love and mercy show.

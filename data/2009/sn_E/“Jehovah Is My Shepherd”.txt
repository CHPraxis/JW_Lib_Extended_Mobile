Song 22
“Jehovah Is My Shepherd”

(Psalm 23)



1. Jehovah God is my Shepherd;
So why should I fear or fret?
For he who cares for his sheep so much
Will none of his own forget.
By quiet waters he leads me,
My soul does restore and bless.
He guides my steps for his own name’s sake
In pathways of righteousness.
He guides my steps for his own name’s sake
In pathways of righteousness.
2. Alone in depths of deep shadow,
I walk, yet I fear no harm.
For my Great Shepherd is always near;
His staff keeps me from alarm.
My head with oil he refreshes;
My cup he has filled up well.
His loving-kindness will follow me,
And there in his house I’ll dwell.
His loving-kindness will follow me,
And there in his house I’ll dwell.
3. How wise and loving my Shepherd!
His praises with joy I sing.
The cheering news of his tender care
To sheeplike ones I will bring.
His Word I’ll faithfully follow,
Walk carefully in his way.
My glorious treasure of serving him,
I’ll gratefully use each day.
My glorious treasure of serving him,
I’ll gratefully use each day.



(See also Ps. 28:9; 80:1.)

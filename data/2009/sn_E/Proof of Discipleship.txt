Proof of Discipleship

(John 13:34, 35)



1. There is a law we must all obey
If we would live the Christian way.
This is the kingly law from above;
This is how we show Christlike love.
Such was the love of our Lord, the Christ;
His perfect life he sacrificed.
He left a model we follow closely;
His disciples, we prove to be.
2. Genuine love that will never fail
Tenderly aids the weak or frail.
Love is a debt that we must repay,
Serving willingly day by day.
No other place could we ever find
Friends showing love of this rare kind.
These are the bonds that we can be sure of;
May we follow the way of love.

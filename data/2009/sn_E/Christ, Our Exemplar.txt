Christ, Our Exemplar

(Romans 5:8)



1. What love Jehovah showed,
What blessings from him flowed,
When for all mankind he gave his dear Son.
Christ then became our bread,
That we might all be fed,
And life eternal in peace might be won.
2. Christ taught us ev’ry day
For God’s great name to pray,
The name Jehovah to be sanctified.
Pray that his Kingdom come
And that his will be done.
Pray that he daily our bread will provide.
3. God’s truth Christ Jesus taught
And tender comfort brought
To those who followed as his faithful sheep.
May seeds of Kingdom praise
Be sown through all our days.
Then satisfaction and joy we will reap.



(See also Matt. 6:9-11; John 3:16; 6:31-51; Eph. 5:2.)

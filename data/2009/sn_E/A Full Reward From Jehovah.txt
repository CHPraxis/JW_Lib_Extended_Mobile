A Full Reward From Jehovah

(Matthew 19:29)



1. Jehovah is faithful and fully aware
Of all those who serve him whole-souled.
He knows there are times their devotion and zeal
Result in their loss as foretold.
If you have left houses or famâ€™ly or friends,
Be sure that our God knows the sum.
He makes it up now with our dear brotherhood
And life in the new world to come.
(CHORUS)
May Jehovah, the God of comfort, see;
May he provide a full reward for you.
May you find refuge beneath his wings.
Jehovah is faithful; Jehovah is true.

2. It may be by choice or by their lot in life;
There are some who single remain.
By seeking the Kingdom of God to the full,
In godly devotion they gain.
By making the room for their unwedded state,
At times they are lonely, we know.
As brothers and sisters to these faithful ones,
Support and approval we show.
(CHORUS)
May Jehovah, the God of comfort, see;
May he provide a full reward for you.
May you find refuge beneath his wings.
Jehovah is faithful; Jehovah is true.

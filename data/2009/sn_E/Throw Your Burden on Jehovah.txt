Throw Your Burden on Jehovah

(Psalm 55)



1. Please give ear, O Lord, Jehovah,
Let yourself be found by me.
Hear my prayer, and may you answer;
Help me unafraid to be.
(CHORUS)
Throw your burden on Jehovah;
He himself will you sustain.
He will never let you totter
But will help you firm remain.

2. Had I wings just as a dove has,
Far from danger I would fly,
Safe from those who seek to hurt me,
Sheltered from their hateful cry.
(CHORUS)
Throw your burden on Jehovah;
He himself will you sustain.
He will never let you totter
But will help you firm remain.

3. I will call upon Jehovah,
His protection I will seek.
He gives peace midst opposition;
Strength he gives to all the meek.
(CHORUS)
Throw your burden on Jehovah;
He himself will you sustain.
He will never let you totter
But will help you firm remain.

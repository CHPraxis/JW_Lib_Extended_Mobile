Song 46
Jehovah Is Our King!

(Psalm 97:1)



1. Rejoice, give glory to Jehovah,
For the heavens have told forth his righteousness.
Let us sing to our God joyful songs to his praise
And concern ourselves with his great acts.
(CHORUS)
Let the heavens rejoice, Let the earth joyful be,
For Jehovah has become our King!
Let the heavens rejoice, Let the earth joyful be,
For Jehovah has become our King!

2. His glory tell among the nations;
Of his great saving acts tell from day to day.
For Jehovah is King; He deserves all the praise.
We bow down before his mighty throne.
(CHORUS)
Let the heavens rejoice, Let the earth joyful be,
For Jehovah has become our King!
Let the heavens rejoice, Let the earth joyful be,
For Jehovah has become our King!

3. His righteous rule is now established.
On his throne, he has placed his anointed Son.
Let the gods of this world suffer shame and bow down,
For the praise belongs to God alone.
(CHORUS)
Let the heavens rejoice, Let the earth joyful be,
For Jehovah has become our King!
Let the heavens rejoice, Let the earth joyful be,
For Jehovah has become our King!

Song 17
Forward, You Witnesses!

(Luke 16:16)



1. Firm and determined in this time of the end,
Prepared are God’s servants the good news to defend.
Though Satan against us has vaunted,
In our God’s strength we move ahead undaunted.
(CHORUS)
Then forward, you Witnesses, ever strong of heart!
Rejoice that in God’s work, you too may have a part!
Go tell far and wide that the paradise is near
And that soon all its blessings will be here.

2. Soldiers of Jah do not seek a life of ease;
The world and its rulers we do not try to please.
Unspotted at all times remaining,
Our integrity we shall keep maintaining.
(CHORUS)
Then forward, you Witnesses, ever strong of heart!
Rejoice that in God’s work, you too may have a part!
Go tell far and wide that the paradise is near
And that soon all its blessings will be here.

3. God’s Kingdom hope has been mocked and pushed aside;
His great name is slandered, its holiness denied.
Let’s share in its sanctification,
And proclaim it to ev’ry tribe and nation.
(CHORUS)
Then forward, you Witnesses, ever strong of heart!
Rejoice that in God’s work, you too may have a part!
Go tell far and wide that the paradise is near
And that soon all its blessings will be here.

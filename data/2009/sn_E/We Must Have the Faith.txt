We Must Have the Faith

(Hebrews 10:38, 39)



1. On many occasions God spoke to men
By means of his prophets of old.
Today he has said, ‘Let all men repent,’
By God’s own Son we are told.
(CHORUS)
Do we have the faith that is sure?
We must build such faith to survive.
Is our faith proved true by our works?
This kind of faith preserves our souls alive.

2. We gladly obey Christ Jesus’ command
To share Kingdom truth far and wide.
We carefully guard our freeness of speech;
This truth we never will hide.
(CHORUS)
Do we have the faith that is sure?
We must build such faith to survive.
Is our faith proved true by our works?
This kind of faith preserves our souls alive.

3. Our faith is an anchor firm and secure;
We never will shrink back in fear.
Though enemies will against us arise,
We know salvation is near.
(CHORUS)
Do we have the faith that is sure?
We must build such faith to survive.
Is our faith proved true by our works?
This kind of faith preserves our souls alive.

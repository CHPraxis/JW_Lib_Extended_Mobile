Worship Jehovah During Youth

(Ecclesiastes 12:1)



1. Precious to God are you daughters and sons;
Great his affection for you, our dear ones.
Loving attention to you he extends
Through us, your parents, your famâ€™ly, and friends.
2. Honor your parents who care for your life,
Giving no cause for contention or strife.
If you gain favor with God and with men,
Days of your youth will be happiest then.
3. Always remember your God in your youth;
Grow ever stronger in love of the truth.
By your devotion to God you will bring
Joy to the heart of Jehovah, our King.



(See also Ps. 71:17; Lam. 3:27; Eph. 6:1-3.)

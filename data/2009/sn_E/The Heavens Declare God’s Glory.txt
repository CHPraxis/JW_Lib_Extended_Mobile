The Heavens Declare God’s Glory

(Psalm 19)



1. The heavens tell the glory of Jehovah.
The work of his own hand in skies above we see.
And each new day brings to him rightful praise.
The starlit night proclaims his might And his true majesty.
2. Jehovah’s law is perfect, life-restoring,
And his reminders guide the steps of old and young.
His rulings prove to be true, right, and just.
His word is sure, his law so pure, So sweet upon the tongue.
3. The fear of God is pure and stands forever.
The worth of his commands exceeds the finest gold.
His orders lead and preserve all his own.
His honor, fame, and holy name, We loyally uphold.

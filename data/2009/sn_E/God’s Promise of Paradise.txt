God’s Promise of Paradise

(Luke 23:43)



1. A paradise our God has promised,
By means of Christ’s Millennial Reign,
When he’ll blot out all sin and error,
Removing death and tears and pain.
(CHORUS)
A paradise, the earth will be.
With eyes of faith, this we can see.
This promise Christ shall soon fulfill,
For he delights to do God’s will.

2. Soon here on earth, as God has purposed,
His Son will cause the dead to rise.
Thus it will be as Jesus promised:
‘You’ll be with me in Paradise.’
(CHORUS)
A paradise, the earth will be.
With eyes of faith, this we can see.
This promise Christ shall soon fulfill,
For he delights to do God’s will.

3. Yes, Paradise, our Lord did promise.
And he is now earth’s rightful King.
We daily thank our loving Father,
And from our hearts, his praises sing.
(CHORUS)
A paradise, the earth will be.
With eyes of faith, this we can see.
This promise Christ shall soon fulfill,
For he delights to do God’s will.

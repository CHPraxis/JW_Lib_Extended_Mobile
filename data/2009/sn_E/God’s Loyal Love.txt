God’s Loyal Love

(Isaiah 55:1-3)



1. Loyal love! God is love.
This truth cheers us from above.
Love caused God to send his Son,
Who for us the ransom won,
That we might gain righteousness,
Life eternal, happiness.
(CHORUS)
Hey there, all you thirsty ones,
Come and drink life’s water free.
Yes, come drink, you thirsty ones;
God’s loving-kindness see.

2. Loyal love! God is love.
All his works give proof thereof.
Love for us he’s further shown,
Giving Christ the kingly throne
To fulfill his cov’nant sworn.
See! His Kingdom has been born.
(CHORUS)
Hey there, all you thirsty ones,
Come and drink life’s water free.
Yes, come drink, you thirsty ones;
God’s loving-kindness see.

3. Loyal love! God is love.
May his love move us to love.
Loyally we’ll help the meek,
As God’s righteous way they seek.
May we preach with godly fear,
Comfort spread for all to hear.
(CHORUS)
Hey there, all you thirsty ones,
Come and drink life’s water free.
Yes, come drink, you thirsty ones;
God’s loving-kindness see.

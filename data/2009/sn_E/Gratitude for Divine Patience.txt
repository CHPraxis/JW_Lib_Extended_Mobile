Gratitude for Divine Patience

(2 Peter 3:15)



1. Great God, Jehovah, boundless in might,
You have made known your love of right.
Wickedness rules on earth below,
Causing you pain, as we well know.
You are not slow, as men may contend;
Your time is near for badness to end.
We look to you in hope and trust,
Grateful that you are patient and just.
2. One thousand years, from your point of view,
Are like a day when they are through.
Time now proceeds to your great day;
It will arrive without delay.
Though all transgression you do resent,
Your heart is glad when sinners repent.
We look ahead with hope renewed,
Praising your name in deep gratitude.



(See also Luke 15:7; 2 Pet. 3:8, 9.)

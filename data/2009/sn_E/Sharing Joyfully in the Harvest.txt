Sharing Joyfully in the Harvest

(Matthew 13:1-23)



1. We live in the time of the harvest,
A priv’lege beyond all compare.
God’s glorious angels are reapers;
In this work we too have a share.
Christ Jesus has set the example
By taking the lead in the field.
So great is the honor bestowed on us
To joyfully share in his yield.
2. True love for our God and our neighbor
Now moves us to speed up our pace.
Both harvest and preaching are urgent,
For shortly the end we will face.
The joy we receive is surpassing;
As God’s fellow workers, we share.
So may we endure in his Kingdom work
And know that his blessing is there.



(See also Matt. 24:13; 1 Cor. 3:9; 2 Tim. 4:2.)

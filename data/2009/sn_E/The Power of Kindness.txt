The Power of Kindness

(Ephesians 4:32)



1. We’re grateful to know Jehovah, our God,
For in his Word we find:
Although he is great in wisdom and might,
Jehovah is loving and kind.
2. Christ Jesus invites the weary at heart
To leave their cares behind.
How kindly his yoke, how light is his load,
For he is refreshing and kind.
3. We see in our God and Jesus our Lord,
The persons we should be.
In all that we do, we want to reflect
Their kindness and true empathy.



(See also Mic. 6:8; Matt. 11:28-30; Col. 3:12; 1 Pet. 2:3.)

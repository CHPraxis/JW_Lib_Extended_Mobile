<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">For example, perhaps you are curious about the Bible’s answers to such questions as these: Does God really care about me as an individual? What happens to us when we die? How can I find happiness in life?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The answers to these and other intriguing questions can be found in the book <em>What Does the Bible Really Teach? </em>published by Jehovah’s Witnesses. This book is designed for a topical study of the Bible. Such a study method draws together the Bible verses that bear on a particular topic.</p>

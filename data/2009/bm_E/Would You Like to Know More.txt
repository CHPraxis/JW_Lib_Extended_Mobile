This brochure presents a brief, fast-moving summary of the message found in the Bible. However, this summary is not intended to explain in detail what the Bible teaches on every subject.
For example, perhaps you are curious about the Bible’s answers to such questions as these: Does God really care about me as an individual? What happens to us when we die? How can I find happiness in life?
The answers to these and other intriguing questions can be found in the book What Does the Bible Really Teach? published by Jehovah’s Witnesses. This book is designed for a topical study of the Bible. Such a study method draws together the Bible verses that bear on a particular topic.

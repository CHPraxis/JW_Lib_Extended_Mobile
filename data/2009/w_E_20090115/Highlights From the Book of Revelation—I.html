<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="st"><strong>Highlights From the Book of Revelation<wbr />—I</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">WHILE imprisoned on the island of Patmos, the aged apostle John receives a series of 16 visions. He beholds in them what Jehovah God and Jesus Christ accomplish during the Lord’s day<wbr />—the period that stretches from the establishment of God’s Kingdom in 1914 to the end of Christ’s Millennial Reign. The book of Revelation, written by John in about the year 96 C.E., is an exciting account of these visions.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Let us now consider highlights of <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:1:1-66:12:17" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Revelation 1:1–12:17</a>, covering the first seven visions received by John. These visions are of interest to us because they pertain to what is happening on the world scene now and show how Jehovah will take action in the near future. Those who read the account of these visions with faith are indeed comforted and encouraged.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:4:12-58:4:12" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Heb. 4:12</a>.</p>

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">First, John beholds the glorified Jesus Christ and receives a series of messages that he is to ‘write in a scroll and send to the seven congregations.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:1:10-66:1:11" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Rev. 1:10, 11</a>) The vision of a throne in its position in heaven follows. In the right hand of the One seated upon the throne is a scroll sealed with seven seals. The one deemed “worthy to open the scroll” is none other than “the Lion that is of the tribe of Judah,” or “a lamb . . . having seven horns and seven eyes.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:4:2-66:4:2" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Rev. 4:2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:5:1-66:5:2" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 5:1, 2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:5:5-66:5:6" data-bid="5-3" class="b"> 5, 6</a>.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">The third vision reveals what happens as “the Lamb” opens the first six seals, one after another. With the opening of the sixth seal, a great earthquake occurs and the great day of wrath arrives. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:6:1-66:6:1" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Rev. 6:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:6:12-66:6:12" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 12,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:6:17-66:6:17" data-bid="6-3" class="b"> 17</a>) But the next vision shows ‘four angels holding tight the four winds of the earth’ until the sealing of the 144,000 is completed. “A great crowd” of those not sealed is seen “standing before the throne and before the Lamb.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:7:1-66:7:1" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Rev. 7:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:7:9-66:7:9" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 9</a>.</p>

Thus, the message to “the seven congregations” ultimately applies to all of God’s people gathered together in more than 100,000 congregations earth wide. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:1:11-66:1:11" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Rev. 1:11,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:1:20-66:1:20" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 20</a>) Since holy spirit is given according to what its operation needs to accomplish, the expression “the seven spirits” denotes the fullness of its operation in giving understanding and bringing blessings to those who pay attention to the prophecy. The book of Revelation seems to progress on the basis of a series of sevens. The number seven here represents completeness, and indeed, the book deals with bringing “to a finish,” or completion, “the sacred secret of God.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:10:7-66:10:7" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Rev. 10:7</a>.</p>

Since then, Jesus has been using the key to open up opportunities and privileges related to the Kingdom. In 1919, Jesus placed “the key of the house of David” upon the shoulder of “the faithful and discreet slave” by appointing that slave class “over all his belongings.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:22:22-23:22:22" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Isa. 22:22;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:24:45-40:24:45" data-bid="19-2" class="b"> Matt. 24:45,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:24:47-40:24:47" data-bid="19-3" class="b"> 47</a>.</p>

This was at the end of the first world war. Anointed Christians did not ascend to heaven at the end of the Gentile Times, as many had expected they would. They experienced difficult times during the war. So now they prayed fervently for guidance. In response to their prayers, the angel hurled to the earth a symbolic fire that set the anointed Christians afire spiritually. Though few in number, they began a worldwide preaching campaign that made God’s Kingdom a burning issue, thus lighting a fire in Christendom. Thunderous warnings from the Bible were sounded forth, flashes of Scriptural truth were made known, and the realm of false religion was shaken to its foundation, just as buildings are shaken by an earthquake.</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:12:13-66:12:14" data-bid="36-1" class="b">Rev. 12:13, 14</a>) The sounding of the trumpets represents fearless proclamations of Jehovah’s judgments against Satan’s world by God’s people in cooperation with the angels.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:9:1-66:9:1" data-bid="38-1" class="b">Rev. 9:1</a>) The sixth is about the greatest cavalry charge in history and the worldwide preaching campaign that began in 1922.

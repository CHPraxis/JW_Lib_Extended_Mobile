<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu"> 5. What training did the Servant receive?</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>One of Isaiah’s prophecies about God’s Servant sheds light on the intimate relationship between Jehovah and his firstborn Son during the Son’s prehuman existence. (<em>Read </em><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:50:4-23:50:9" data-bid="16-1" class="b"><em>Isaiah 50:4-9</em></a><em>.</em>) The Servant himself reveals that Jehovah continually trained him, saying: “He awakens my ear to hear like the taught ones [“disciples,” ftn.].” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:50:4-23:50:4" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Isa. 50:4</a>) During all that time, Jehovah’s Servant listened to his Father and learned from him, becoming a submissive disciple. What a unique privilege to be taught by the Creator of the universe!</p>
<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu"> 6. How did the Servant indicate his perfect submission to his Father?</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup>In this prophecy, the Servant speaks of his Father as “the Sovereign Lord Jehovah.” This shows that the Servant had learned the fundamental truth of Jehovah’s universal sovereignty. Indicating his perfect submission to his Father, he stated: “The Sovereign Lord Jehovah himself has opened my ear, and I, for my part, was not rebellious. I did not turn in the opposite direction.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:50:5-23:50:5" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Isa. 50:5</a>) He “came to be beside [Jehovah] as a master worker” in the creation of the material universe and man. This “master worker” was “glad before [Jehovah] all the time, being glad at the productive land of his earth, and the things [God’s Son] was fond of were with the sons of men.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:8:22-20:8:31" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Prov. 8:22-31</a>.</p>
<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu"> 7. What shows that the Servant had confidence in his Father’s support during his trials?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><sup>7 </sup>This training received by the Servant and his fondness for mankind stood him in good stead when he came to earth and faced severe opposition. He continued to delight to do his Father’s will, even in the face of bitter persecution. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:40:8-19:40:8" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Ps. 40:8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:26:42-40:26:42" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> Matt. 26:42;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:6:38-43:6:38" data-bid="20-3" class="b"> John 6:38</a>) Throughout his trials on earth, Jesus was confident of his Father’s approval and support. As was foretold in Isaiah’s prophecy, Jesus was able to say: “The One declaring me righteous is near. Who can contend with me? . . . Look! The Sovereign Lord Jehovah himself will help me.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:50:8-23:50:9" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Isa. 50:8, 9</a>) Jehovah certainly did help his faithful Servant throughout his ministry on earth, as another prophecy of Isaiah shows.</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:42:3-23:42:3" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Isa. 42:3</a>) He further showed that God’s Law needed to be applied with reasonableness and mercy. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:23:23-40:23:23" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Matt. 23:23</a>) Jesus also displayed justice by preaching without prejudice to both rich and poor.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:11:5-40:11:5" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Matt. 11:5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:18:18-42:18:23" data-bid="31-2" class="b"> Luke 18:18-23</a>.</p>

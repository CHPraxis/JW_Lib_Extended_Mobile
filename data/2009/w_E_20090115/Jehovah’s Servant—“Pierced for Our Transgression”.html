<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sa">“He was being pierced for our transgression; he was being crushed for our errors. . . . Because of his wounds there has been a healing for us.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:53:5-23:53:5" data-bid="1-1" class="b">ISA. 53:5</a>.</p>
<p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="qu"> 1. What should we keep in mind when we observe the Memorial, and what prophecy will help us to do so?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb">WE OBSERVE the Memorial to commemorate Christ’s death and to remember all that his death and resurrection have accomplished. The Memorial reminds us of the vindication of Jehovah’s sovereignty, the sanctification of his name, and the fulfillment of his purpose, including the salvation of mankind. Perhaps no other prophecy in the Bible better depicts Christ’s sacrifice and what it has accomplished than the one recorded at <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:53:3-23:53:12" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Isaiah 53:3-12</a>. Isaiah foretold the Servant’s sufferings and provided specific details about Christ’s death and about the blessings his death would result in for his anointed brothers and his “other sheep.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:10:16-43:10:16" data-bid="3-1" class="b">John 10:16</a>.</p>
<p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="qu"> 2. Of what is Isaiah’s prophecy a proof, and what effect will it have on us?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>Seven centuries before Jesus’ birth on earth, Jehovah inspired Isaiah to prophesy that His chosen Servant would be faithful even when tested to the limit. This very fact is proof of Jehovah’s absolute confidence in his Son’s loyalty. As we examine this prophecy, our hearts will be warmed and our faith will be strengthened.</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/50:2:5-50:2:8" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Phil. 2:5-8</a>) His sacrifice was to accomplish real forgiveness of sins, which the offering of animal sacrifices under the Mosaic Law only foreshadowed. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:10:1-58:10:4" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Heb. 10:1-4</a>) Should he not have been welcomed and honored, at least by the Jews, who were awaiting the promised Messiah? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:6:14-43:6:14" data-bid="7-1" class="b">John 6:14</a>) Instead, the Christ was “despised” by the Jews, and they “held him as of no account,” as Isaiah had prophesied. The apostle John wrote: “He came to his own home, but his own people did not take him in.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:1:11-43:1:11" data-bid="8-1" class="b">John 1:11</a>) The apostle Peter told the Jews: “The God of our forefathers . . . has glorified his Servant, Jesus, whom you, for your part, delivered up and disowned before Pilate’s face, when he had decided to release him. Yes, you disowned that holy and righteous one.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:3:13-44:3:14" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Acts 3:13, 14</a>.</p>

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>Isaiah also prophesied that Jesus was meant to have “acquaintance with sickness.” During his ministry, Jesus certainly got tired on occasion, but there is no indication that he got sick. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:4:6-43:4:6" data-bid="10-1" class="b">John 4:6</a>) He did, however, become acquainted with the sicknesses of those to whom he preached. He felt pity for them and healed many. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/41:1:32-41:1:34" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Mark 1:32-34</a>) Jesus thus fulfilled the prophecy that states: “Truly our sicknesses were what he himself carried; and as for our pains, he bore them.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:53:4-23:53:4" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Isa. 53:4a;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:8:16-40:8:17" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> Matt. 8:16, 17</a>.</p>

But in view of his great love for his Father, the very idea that he was to die accused of blasphemy must have added to his suffering as Jehovah’s Servant.

<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu">6, 7. In what sense did Jehovah ‘crush’ his faithful Servant, and why did this bring God “delight”?</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup>It is one thing for Isaiah’s prophecy to state that others would account Christ as “stricken by God” but quite another for the prophecy to foretell: “Jehovah himself took delight in crushing him.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:53:10-23:53:10" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Isa. 53:10</a>) Since Jehovah had also stated: “Look!

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:42:1-23:42:1" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Isa. 42:1</a>) In what sense can it be said that this brought Jehovah joy?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><sup>7 </sup>To understand this part of the prophecy, <span id="page27" class="pageNum" data-no="27" data-before-text="27"></span>we should remember that in challenging Jehovah’s sovereignty, Satan cast doubt on the loyalty of all of God’s servants in heaven and on earth.

Thus, while Jehovah permitted Christ to be killed by his enemies, there can be no doubt that Jehovah suffered when he saw his chosen Servant being put to death. However, observing his Son’s absolute faithfulness brought Jehovah much delight. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:27:11-20:27:11" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Prov. 27:11</a>) Furthermore, knowing the benefits that his Son’s death would bring to repentant humans brought Jehovah great joy.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:15:7-42:15:7" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Luke 15:7</a>.</p>

<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><sup>9 </sup>The apostle Peter wrote: “To this course you were called, because even Christ suffered for you, leaving you a model for you to follow his steps closely. He himself bore our sins in his own body upon the stake, in order that we might be done with sins and live to righteousness.” Then, quoting from Isaiah’s prophecy, Peter added: “And ‘by his stripes you were healed.’” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/60:2:21-60:2:21" data-bid="25-1" class="b">1 Pet. 2:21,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/60:2:24-60:2:24" data-bid="25-2" class="b"> 24;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:53:5-23:53:5" data-bid="25-3" class="b"> Isa. 53:5</a>) This opened the way for sinners to become reconciled to God, as Peter further stated: “Christ died once for all time concerning sins, a righteous person for unrighteous ones, that he might lead you to God.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/60:3:18-60:3:18" data-bid="26-1" class="b">1 Pet. 3:18</a>.</p>

The end of verse 12 gives us a clue to the answer. “And for the transgressors he [the Servant] proceeded to interpose.” All of Adam’s descendants are born sinners, “transgressors,” and therefore receive “the wages sin pays,” namely, death.

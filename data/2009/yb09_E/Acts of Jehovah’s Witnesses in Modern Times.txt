Acts of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Modern Times
Samoa
This chronicle of Jehovah’s Witnesses in the “Cradle of Polynesia” is one of godly devotion and courageous loyalty. Discover what it is like to preach in tropical communities that are well-versed in the Bible and so religious that they have a unique vocabulary when speaking to or about God. You will meet Witnesses who have overcome seemingly insurmountable health problems to continue serving Jehovah. Read about a family that walked 14 miles [22 km] over a mountain range to attend meetings, and find out why some village children used to call out, “Here comes Armageddon!”
Lands of the Former Yugoslavia
From a region where ethnic and religious differences have spawned bloodshed and hatred, there emerges a remarkable story of faith and courage. Describing a group of Witnesses trapped in a city that endured one of the longest sieges in modern history, a brother relates: “Though we came from Croatian, Serbian, and Bosnian backgrounds​—the same three groups that were killing one another outside—​we were united in pure worship.” When you read this report, your faith will be strengthened as you see how the brothers kept integrity both in times of peace and in times of war.

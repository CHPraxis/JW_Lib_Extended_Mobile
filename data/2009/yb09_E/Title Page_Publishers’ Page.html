<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">The apostle Paul had completed three missionary journeys and had experienced both trials and blessings. Now he was on his way to Jerusalem, where he expected no warm reception, for “bonds and tribulations” awaited him there. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:20:23-44:20:23" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Acts 20:23</a>) Yet, he was not deterred. At Miletus he told the elders of the Ephesus congregation: “I do not make my soul of any account as dear to me, if only I may finish my course and the ministry that I received of the Lord Jesus, to bear thorough witness to the good news of the undeserved kindness of God.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:20:24-44:20:24" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Acts 20:24</a>.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Paul valued his life, but the doing of God’s will was his highest priority. Jehovah’s Witnesses worldwide feel similarly. Although, as Jesus foretold, they are “objects of hatred by all the nations,” God’s people have taken the good news to the ends of the earth and are boldly witnessing in virtually every nation. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:9-40:24:9" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Matt. 24:9</a>) May the yeartext for 2009 inspire you to continue bearing witness without letup, thus showing your appreciation for the undeserved kindness of God.</p>

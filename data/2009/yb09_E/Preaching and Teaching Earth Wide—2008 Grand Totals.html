<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">EACH year, we read in this publication about the efforts being made to help people come to know and love Jehovah God. The scope and scale of this work is unprecedented. No organization could possibly afford to pay millions of people to proclaim <em>any </em>message to such a vast, international audience. Yet, in their work of Bible education, Jehovah’s Witnesses desire no financial reward. They adhere to the instruction Jesus gave to his disciples nearly two thousand years ago: “You received free, give free.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:10:8-40:10:8" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matt. 10:8</a>) As you meditate on what has been accomplished in the past service year, pause to consider that it has been done by those who unselfishly and freely give because they are motivated to respond to God’s love.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">THROUGHOUT his conversation with Nicodemus, Jesus emphasized that undergoing a new birth, or being born again, is of great importance. How did he make that clear?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Note how Jesus in his discussion with Nicodemus underscored the importance of the new birth. He stated: <em>“Unless </em>anyone is born again, he <em>cannot </em>see the kingdom of God.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:3:3-43:3:3" data-bid="1-1" class="b">John 3:3</a>) The words “unless” and “cannot” highlight the necessity of the new birth. To illustrate: If someone says, “Unless the sun shines, there cannot be daylight,” he means that sunshine is absolutely necessary for daylight. In a similar manner, Jesus stated that being born again is absolutely necessary for seeing God’s Kingdom.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Finally, as if to remove any lingering doubt about the subject, Jesus stated: “You people <em>must </em>be born again.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:3:7-43:3:7" data-bid="2-1" class="b">John 3:7</a>) Clearly, according to Jesus, being born again is a requirement<wbr />—a must—<wbr />for one to “enter into the kingdom of God.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:3:5-43:3:5" data-bid="3-1" class="b">John 3:5</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Since Jesus viewed the new birth as a matter of such great importance, Christians should make sure that they understand this subject accurately. For example, do you think that a Christian can <em>choose </em>to be born again?</p>

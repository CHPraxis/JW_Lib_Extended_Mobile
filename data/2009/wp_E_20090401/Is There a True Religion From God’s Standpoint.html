<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="st"><strong>Is There a True Religion From God’s Standpoint?</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Many people are born into their religion. Others choose their form of worship later in life. There is certainly no shortage of religions from which to choose. Perhaps you have wondered, ‘Does it really matter which religion I belong to?’</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">That question will be answered in the public discourse “Is There a True Religion From God’s Standpoint?” This Bible talk will be given worldwide in over 230 lands. In most places, it will be delivered at the local Kingdom Hall of Jehovah’s Witnesses on Sunday, April 26, 2009. The Witnesses in your area will be glad to provide you with the time and address. You are warmly invited to attend.</p>

The New Birth—How Important?
THROUGHOUT his conversation with Nicodemus, Jesus emphasized that undergoing a new birth, or being born again, is of great importance. How did he make that clear?
Note how Jesus in his discussion with Nicodemus underscored the importance of the new birth. He stated: “Unless anyone is born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.” (John 3:3) The words “unless” and “cannot” highlight the necessity of the new birth. To illustrate: If someone says, “Unless the sun shines, there cannot be daylight,” he means that sunshine is absolutely necessary for daylight. In a similar manner, Jesus stated that being born again is absolutely necessary for seeing God’s Kingdom.
Finally, as if to remove any lingering doubt about the subject, Jesus stated: “You people must be born again.” (John 3:7) Clearly, according to Jesus, being born again is a requirement—a must—for one to “enter into the kingdom of God.”—John 3:5.
Since Jesus viewed the new birth as a matter of such great importance, Christians should make sure that they understand this subject accurately. For example, do you think that a Christian can choose to be born again?

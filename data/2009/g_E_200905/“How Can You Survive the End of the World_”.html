<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">▪ What does the Bible mean when it speaks about the end of the world, or the present system of things? A global nuclear exchange that could wipe out all human life? Or is it referring to some natural phenomenon, such as an asteroid impact? Interestingly, the Bible says that “a great crowd” of humans will survive the world’s end. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:7:9-66:7:10" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Revelation 7:9, 10,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:7:14-66:7:14" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 14</a>) Who will they be? Can you be among them?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Those important questions will be answered in the public talk “How Can You Survive the End of the World?” It will be delivered at the “KEEP ON THE WATCH!” conventions of Jehovah’s Witnesses, beginning in May in the United States and continuing around the world. You are cordially invited to attend the convention nearest you. Contact Jehovah’s Witnesses in your area, or write to the publishers of this magazine. The March 1, 2009, issue of our companion magazine, <em>The Watchtower, </em>lists convention locations in the United States.</p>

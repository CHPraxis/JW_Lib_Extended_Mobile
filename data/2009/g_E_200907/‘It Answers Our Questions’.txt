‘It Answers Our Questions’
▪ ‘It answers our questions.’ That is what young people are saying about the new book Questions Young People Ask—Answers That Work, Volume 2. “I was feeling confused and unsure of myself,” wrote Jessicah, in Texas, U.S.A. “This book really encouraged me. It was beneficial for me to know that there are many teens like me who encounter obstacles along their journey of trying to serve God. The book answered just about every question that I had about being a youth.”
Breann, in Colorado, said: “Your book is having its intended effect of encouraging dialogue between parents and children. When I want to talk to my mom, I bring out the book and read right from it. A friend of mine is also preparing to talk with her parents simply because of reading this book.”
The first chapters of the book address questions about an issue particularly on young people’s minds—relationships with the opposite sex. Katrina, in New Jersey, wrote: “The book made my convictions so strong that no matter what anyone else says, I’m not ready to date. Besides, being single gives one the opportunity to do so many great things! I don’t want to give them up right now. And when I’m ready to date, I will have a better idea of what to look for in a mate and how to proceed.”

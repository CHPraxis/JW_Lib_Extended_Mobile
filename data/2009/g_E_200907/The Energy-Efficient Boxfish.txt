Was It Designed?
The Energy-Efficient Boxfish
▪To produce a car that is sturdier, more energy-efficient, and environmentally friendly, designers looked to an unlikely place for inspiration—under the sea! The boxfish, found near coral reefs in tropical waters, provides an excellent model for a vehicle with lightweight construction and astounding aerodynamics.
Consider: The boxfish can swim fast—covering a distance of up to six times its body length each second. But this speed is more than a feat of strength. Contrary to expectations, the cubelike shape of the fish actually enhances its aerodynamic qualities. In fact, engineers who constructed a model of the boxfish and tested it in a wind tunnel found this design to slip through the air far more efficiently than compact cars do.
The boxfish has a bony outer skin that gives it maximum strength with minimal weight. Tiny vortices form in the water surrounding the fish, stabilizing the creature when it encounters turbulence. Thus, the boxfish has outstanding maneuverability and protection from injury.
Engineers believe that the boxfish provides the secret to producing a safer, more fuel-efficient, yet lightweight, vehicle. “Quite frankly,” says research and development chief Dr. Thomas Weber, “we were surprised when this clumsy-looking fish, of all things, became our model for designing an aerodynamic and fuel-efficient car.”
What do you think? Did the energy-efficient boxfish come about by chance? Or was it designed?

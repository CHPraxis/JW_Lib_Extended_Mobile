10 min: The Value of a Positive Attitude in Our Ministry. Audience discussion. Jesus provided a good example for us in that he viewed those to whom he preached as sheep in need of help. (Matt. 9:36-38) Though Ananias was initially apprehensive about calling on Saul, what helped him to change his viewpoint? (Acts 9:13-15) How did his approach indicate a positive attitude on his part? (Acts 9:17) What reasons do we have for approaching people in our territory with a positive attitude? How will a positive attitude make our ministry more effective? Briefly interview one or two publishers whose positive attitude led to good results in their ministry.

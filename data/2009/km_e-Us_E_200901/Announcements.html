<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">▪ Literature offer for <strong>January: </strong><em>What Does the Bible Really Teach? </em>If householders already have the book, publishers may offer any 192-page book printed on paper that discolors or any book published prior to 1992 with the exception of <em>Creation, Greatest Man, Mankind’s Search for God</em>, and <em>Young People Ask</em>. <strong>February: </strong>Offer one of the following, as available: <em>Is There a Creator Who Cares About You?, The Bible​</em>—<em>God’s Word or Man’s?</em>, or <em>The Secret of Family Happiness</em>. <strong>March: </strong><em>What Does the Bible Really Teach? </em>Make a diligent effort to start Bible studies. <strong>April: </strong>The <em>Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>magazines. When making return visits on interested people, including those who attend the Memorial or other theocratic events but who are not actively associated with the congregation, concentrate on starting studies using the <em>Bible Teach </em>book.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn">▪ Starting the first week in March, the new public talk for circuit overseers will be “Reject Worldly Fantasies, Pursue Kingdom Realities.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn">▪ Congregations should make appropriate arrangements to observe the Memorial this year on Thursday, April 9, after sundown. Each congregation should try to hold its own Memorial observance. Where a number of congregations normally use the same Kingdom Hall, perhaps one or more congregations can obtain the use of another facility for that evening. Where possible, we suggest a minimum of 40 minutes between the programs so that all may benefit fully from some association after the Memorial.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn">▪ It is necessary for the branch office to maintain an up-to-date record of addresses and telephone numbers for all coordinators of the bodies of elders and secretaries. If there is a change at any time, the Congregation Service Committee should complete, sign, and send an S-29 form to the branch office promptly. This includes any changes in telephone area codes.</p>

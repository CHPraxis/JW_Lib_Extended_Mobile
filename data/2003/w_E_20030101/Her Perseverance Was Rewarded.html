<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Many righthearted individuals want their loved ones to learn about God’s purposes and thus have a happy life. When someone dedicates himself to God, others, young as well as old, may well have contributed to that wise decision by their good conduct. Such was the case of Jearim, a teenage girl in Mexico, who turned in the following note at a special assembly day of Jehovah’s Witnesses:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“I want to share with you my joy and happiness. Let me tell you why. Eighteen years ago, when I was not yet born, my parents learned the truth. My mother progressed, and later on my brother and I did too. Together we prayed to Jehovah that my father would also get on the road to life. Eighteen years have gone by, and today is a very special day for us. My father is getting baptized. I thank Jehovah that he did not bring about the end before this long-awaited moment arrived. Thank you, Jehovah!”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Over the years, the family of this young girl surely had in mind the principles embodied in the inspired counsel of <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/60:3:1-60:3:2" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Peter 3:1, 2</a>, which says: “You wives, be in subjection to your own husbands, in order that, if any are not obedient to the word, they may be won without a word through the conduct of their wives, because of having been eyewitnesses of your chaste conduct together with deep respect.” And young Jearim certainly applied the words of <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/5:5:16-5:5:16" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 5:16</a>: “Honor your father and your mother, just as Jehovah your God has commanded you.” Applying such principles and patiently waiting on Jehovah certainly brought blessings to Jearim and her family.</p>

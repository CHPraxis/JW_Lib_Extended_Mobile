“You Are Right, Life Is Beautiful!”
WOULD you like to learn the real meaning of life? Eighteen-year-old Magdalena, one of Jehovah’s Witnesses who lives in Szczecin, Poland, helped her high school classmate Katarzyna to do just that. Katarzyna was an avowed atheist, but when Magdalena talked to her about the Bible, she showed genuine interest.
Although Katarzyna appreciated what Magdalena shared with her from the Bible, she could not fully accept it. As she talked with Magdalena about true friends, Katarzyna once said: “You have the Bible; you know what principles to follow and where to look for friends. But what about those who, at least for now, cannot accept those principles?”
A turning point came when Katarzyna took a trip to London, England. She visited the branch office of Jehovah’s Witnesses there, and she was moved by the kindness shown to her. Such simple gestures as opening the door for her and showing genuine interest in what she was saying appealed to her.
When the new school year started in September 2001, Katarzyna decided to accept a regular Bible study. She is building her appreciation for Bible principles and has started to apply them in her everyday life. Recently, she confided in Magdalena, saying: “I feel as if I am starting a new life.” She also sent her a short message via cellular phone: “Thanks so much for our study today! You are right, life is beautiful! It is wonderful to know whom we should thank for that.”

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">For many years now, congregations throughout the world have benefited from the use of their Kingdom Hall library, formerly called Theocratic Ministry School library. In the past, it was deemed necessary that each congregation acquire its own library. However, with many Kingdom Halls now being used by more than one congregation, some of which are foreign-language congregations, it seems best to have only one well-equipped, up-to-date Kingdom Hall library per language group in each Kingdom Hall. In Kingdom Halls that have more than one auditorium, each auditorium should have a library for each language group meeting there.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">It is expected that this arrangement will help conserve space and expense. Moreover, merging the libraries of two or more congregations will most likely bring about better libraries. As these are combined, duplicate copies of books may be stored and later used when new Kingdom Halls are built. If the Kingdom Hall is equipped with a computer with <em>Watchtower Library </em>on CD-ROM, some may find this tool very beneficial.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">For each Kingdom Hall library, one brother, preferably one of the Theocratic Ministry School overseers, will serve as the librarian. He should progressively add appropriate publications to the collection, neatly marking the inside cover of each one to show that it belongs to the Kingdom Hall library. At least once a year, he should check the library for completeness and ensure that the publications are in good condition. Publications from these libraries should not be taken out of the Kingdom Hall.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The Kingdom Hall library continues to be greatly appreciated by all those associated with the congregation. May we show that we personally value this provision by taking care of it and by using it to search out “the very knowledge of God.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:2:5-20:2:5" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Prov. 2:5</a>.</p>

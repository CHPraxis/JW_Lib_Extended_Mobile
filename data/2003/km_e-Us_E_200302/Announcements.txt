Announcements
▪ Literature offer for February: The new book Draw Close to Jehovah will be featured. March: Feature the Knowledge book, with an effort to start home Bible studies. April and May: Feature individual copies of both The Watchtower and Awake! When making return visits on interested people, which may include calling on those who attended the Memorial or other theocratic events but who are not actively associated with the congregation, concentrate on placing Worship the Only True God. Every effort should be made to start a home Bible study, especially if some individuals have already studied the Knowledge book and the Require brochure.
▪ The presiding overseer or someone designated by him should audit the congregation’s accounts on March 1 or as soon as possible thereafter. When this has been done, make an announcement to the congregation after the next accounts report is read. Read any acknowledgment of contributions the congregation has made to the worldwide work and to any other fund sponsored by the organization.
▪ The secretary and the service overseer should review the activity of all regular pioneers. If any are having difficulty meeting the hour requirement, the elders should arrange for assistance to be given. For suggestions, review the annual S-201 letters.
▪ The special public talk for the 2003 Memorial season will be “Has Babylon’s Judgment Hour Arrived?” See related announcement in the September 2002 Our Kingdom Ministry.
▪ Since the arrangement for personal subscriptions through the mail was discontinued, it is important for congregations to release the latest issues of The Watchtower and Awake! as soon as they are received. That will allow the publishers to become familiar with the content before offering the magazines in field service.
▪ U.S. Selective Service regulations require that all men register at the post office within 30 days after reaching 18 years of age. A male noncitizen under the age of 26 who takes up residency in the United States must also register with Selective Service within 30 days of becoming a resident. All of those required to do so should comply with this law, viewing it as a Christian’s obligation to the superior authorities. From the time he registers until the year he turns 26, a brother must notify Selective Service of any change of address within ten days of the change. Elders should be aware of young brothers nearing the age of 18 and new alien residents between the ages of 18 and 26 and remind them of their duty to register with the Selective Service System.
▪ When working unassigned territory, publishers may offer the Require brochure or the Knowledge book. Any other publication may be offered if the householder already has these two publications. All should carry a variety of tracts for not-at-homes or individuals who do not accept literature. Efforts should be made to follow up interest, especially where unassigned territories are accessible to nearby congregations.

What to Say About the Magazines
The Watchtower Feb. 15
“Some people wonder if there is a personal God. Others say he exists but feel that he is far off from them. Have you noted this? [Allow for response.] Notice why coming to know God personally is so important. [Read John 17:3.] In this regard, you will find the opening articles in this issue interesting.”
Awake! Feb. 22
“Do you think that God meant for humans, including children, to suffer from malnutrition? [Allow for response.] Note this comforting promise found in the Bible. [Read Psalm 72:16.] This issue of Awake! discusses the causes of malnutrition and, more important, God’s promise to end it soon.”
The Watchtower Mar. 1
“We would like your opinion on this interesting scripture. [Read Matthew 5:10.] How can a person be happy when he is being persecuted? [Allow for response.] The first two articles in this magazine tell of some who maintained happiness in spite of their suffering. You will be interested to read how they did so.”
Awake! Mar. 8
“Wouldn’t you agree that despite life’s problems we still have reason to be thankful? [Allow for response.] One reason to be thankful is the way we are made. [Read Psalm 139:14.] How grateful we can be to have the senses needed to appreciate life, as this issue of Awake! illustrates!”

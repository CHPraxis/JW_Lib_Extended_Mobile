<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>In the first century, many Christians made their homes available to be used for congregation meetings. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:16:19-46:16:19" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Cor. 16:19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:4:15-51:4:15" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Col. 4:15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/57:1:1-57:1:2" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> Philem. 1, 2</a>) In some congregations today, there are not enough locations for Congregation Book Study groups and meetings for field service. This may result in some book study groups having 30 or more in attendance, far more than the preferred number of about 15.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup><strong>A Fine Privilege: </strong>Have you considered opening your home for a Congregation Book Study? A room of sufficient size that is clean, well lit, and well ventilated is ideal for this purpose. Since the book study is a congregation meeting and part of Jehovah’s arrangement to instruct his people, having a book study in your home is a fine privilege. Many report that they have benefited spiritually by opening their home in this way.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>If you think that your home is suitable, by all means make this known to the elders. They may be looking for additional locations. If it is not possible to have a book study in your home, could meetings for field service be held there? Even if there is not a need at the present time, the elders will appreciate knowing that your home is available. You may enjoy the privilege in the future.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup><strong>Showing Good Manners: </strong>When gathering in a private home, all in attendance need to be respectful of the host’s property. Parents should make sure that their children remain in the area designated for the study, not venturing into private areas of the home. Consideration should also be shown for the neighbors, being careful to avoid unduly inconveniencing them.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:6:3-47:6:4" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Cor. 6:3, 4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:2:12-60:2:12" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 1 Pet. 2:12</a>.</p>

Be Sound in Mind as the End Draws Close
1 God’s Word repeatedly describes Jehovah’s day as coming “as a thief”​—that is, suddenly, instantly, stealthily. (1 Thess. 5:2; Matt. 24:43; 2 Pet. 3:10; Rev. 3:3; 16:15) “On this account,” Jesus said, “prove yourselves ready, because at an hour that you do not think to be it, the Son of man is coming.” (Matt. 24:44) How can we maintain our spiritual readiness as the end draws close? A key is found in the inspired admonition: “Be sound in mind.”​—1 Pet. 4:7.
2 Soundness of mind involves looking at things from Jehovah’s standpoint. (Eph. 5:17) It helps us to see ourselves as “aliens and temporary residents” amid the present system of things. (1 Pet. 2:11) It enables us to discern what is truly important, to set priorities, and to make good decisions.​—Phil. 1:10.
3 Set Spiritual Goals: Setting and attaining spiritual goals helps us to be sound in mind. Do you have spiritual goals that you are currently pursuing? Are you striving to read the Bible every day, attend all Christian meetings, read each issue of The Watchtower and Awake!, or perhaps increase your share in the ministry? If you set goals that are right for you, persist in pursuing them, and ask Jehovah to bless your efforts, you may be amazed at the results.
4 An elder asked a young couple about their spiritual goals. The question made them realize that if they simplified their life and eliminated burdensome debt, they could pioneer. They decided to make that their goal. They diligently paid off the debt and found ways to prune away unnecessary activities that were sapping their time and energy. Exactly one year later, they had reached their goal. With what result? The husband says: “Without goals we would not be where we are now. We are happier. Our life is calmer and better. It has real meaning and purpose.”
5 As we await Jehovah’s day, may we maintain our spiritual readiness by living with soundness of mind, keeping focused on doing God’s will.​—Titus 2:11-13.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">THE Bible is not a mental-health manual. However, it gives us consolation and helps us to appreciate life despite the troubles we encounter. Realistically, the Scriptures do say: “Man, born of woman, is short-lived and glutted with agitation.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:14:1-18:14:1" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Job 14:1</a>) Our own imperfection accounts for some of our trials. But who is primarily responsible for human suffering?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The Bible identifies that one as a wicked spirit called Devil and Satan. He is “misleading the entire inhabited earth” and causing many of the troubles that beset mankind. Yet, the Bible also tells us that his time is running out. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:12:9-66:12:9" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Revelation 12:9,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:12:12-66:12:12" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 12</a>) Soon all the distress that Satan has brought upon earth’s inhabitants will end by divine intervention. According to the Bible, God’s promised new world of righteousness will end hopelessness and despair.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:3:13-61:3:13" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2 Peter 3:13</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">What a comfort it is to know that human suffering is temporary! Under the rule of God’s heavenly Kingdom in the hands of Jesus Christ, injustice and suffering will end. Regarding God’s appointed King, the Scriptures state: “He will deliver the poor one crying for help, also the afflicted one and whoever has no helper. He will feel sorry for the lowly one and the poor one, and the souls of the poor ones he will save. From oppression and from violence he will redeem their soul, and their blood will be precious in his eyes.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:72:12-19:72:14" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Psalm 72:12-14</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The time for the fulfillment of these prophetic words is very near. We can enjoy everlasting life on a paradise earth under wonderful conditions. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:23:43-42:23:43" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Luke 23:43;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:3-43:17:3" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> John 17:3</a>) Knowledge of these comforting Scriptural promises gives hope and consolation to those crying for help.</p>

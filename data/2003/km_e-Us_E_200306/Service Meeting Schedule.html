With each person we meet in our ministry, we strive to share an upbuilding Scriptural thought about the Kingdom. However, we need to do more than just <em>read </em>Bible texts. We need to <em>explain, illustrate, and apply </em>them. Show how this can be done, using as examples some of the scriptures cited in the <a class="xt" data-xtid="14" href="jwpub://p/E:1101989231/19-34:52"><em>Reasoning </em>book, pages 154-5</a>, under the italicized subheading “Human rulers are not providing what mankind urgently needs.” Following the discussion, have a well-prepared publisher demonstrate how to use one scripture effectively on a return visit, giving a concise explanation, a simple illustration, and a brief application that shows the householder how Kingdom rule will benefit him personally. Begin the demonstration with the publisher reading the scripture. Following the demonstration, review how the text was explained, illustrated, and applied. Encourage all to develop the ability to use God’s Word effectively.</p>

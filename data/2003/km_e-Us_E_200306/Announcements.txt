Announcements
▪ Literature offer for June, July, and August: Offer the Knowledge book or the Require brochure. When householders already have these publications, use another appropriate brochure that the congregation has in stock. September: Life​—How Did It Get Here? By Evolution or by Creation? Before requesting additional supplies from the branch office, congregations should use what is available locally and check if nearby congregations have a surplus on hand.
▪ The branch facilities in Brooklyn, Patterson, and Wallkill, New York, will be closed on the following Saturdays: September 13, 2003 (Gilead graduation); October 4, 2003 (annual meeting of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania); March 13, 2004 (Gilead graduation); and May 15, 2004 (spring cleaning). There will be no arrangements for tours or for congregations to pick up literature on those dates.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sa">BY <em>AWAKE! </em>WRITER IN KENYA</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">THE large pool within the sprawling Masai Mara Game Reserve in Kenya is bathed in the quiet radiance of the evening sun. As the sun descends on the horizon, the waters reflect a golden-brown resplendence. A few feet away, herds of zebras and wildebeests (gnu) approach the pool at a leisurely pace. Suddenly and with much apprehension, the animals stand still, their eyes firmly fixed on a huge boulderlike object floating near the edge of the pool. After boisterously agitating the waters, the “boulder” sinks out of sight. The grazers have just beheld a vicious aquatic animal<wbr />—the hippopotamus.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Found in pools, rivers, and lakes in eastern Africa, the hippo is surpassed in size only by the elephant. When full-grown, the hippo may reach a length of 15 feet <strong>[of over 4 meters] </strong>and a shoulder height of 5 feet <strong>[1.5 m]</strong>. Its weight may be about four tons. The word “Behemoth” mentioned in the Bible book of Job is generally considered to refer to the hippopotamus. <span id="page24" class="pageNum" data-no="24" data-before-text="24"></span>Not surprisingly, the Bible describes this massive beast as having bones that are as “tubes of copper,” and it compares them to “wrought-iron rods.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/18:40:15-18:40:18" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Job 40:15-18</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Thick-skinned, hairless, and seemingly clumsy, the barrel-shaped hippo would certainly fare badly in any beauty contest. The legs of the hippo are short, causing one to wonder how they manage to support such a colossal frame. But do not underestimate the power of those stubby legs. On land the hippo can run faster than man. In water it has been known to outdo a small man-powered boat or even a motorboat.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="ss"><strong>Aquatic Life</strong></p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Hippos are sociable animals, typically living in groups of 10 to 15 led by a dominant bull, though larger groups numbering about 150 have been seen. They are amphibious and emerge from the water<wbr />—mainly at night—<wbr />to feed on the lush vegetation found on the shores. Generally, they avoid straying far from the water. In the dry season, however, some hippos have been known to walk up to six miles <strong>[10 km] </strong>in search of food.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">It is unclear how hippos mark their territories. A startling habit of spreading their dung around with the tail is thought by some to be a way of impressing female hippos or of intimidating a rival. Under attack, they neigh like a horse, and they bellow or roar when fighting. Loud snorts are audible even when the animals are submerged. The lead bull gives himself away with a <em>MUH-Muh-muh </em>call.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">The hippo spends the whole day partially or totally submerged in water, and its large body is well suited for this. Although it may not be an accomplished swimmer like its amphibious neighbors, the hippo can stay submerged for up to 15 minutes! Its nostrils, eyes, and ears are located on one level, making it possible for the animal to hide the rest of its body underwater. It is here, underwater, that several of the hippo’s activities<wbr />—including courtship and mating—<wbr />take place.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">After a gestation period of about eight months, a single offspring is born in shallow waters. Suckling occurs either on land or in ankle-deep water. As strong as it is, the hippo takes parenting seriously, treating the baby with surprising tenderness. Indeed, a floating mother with a young hippo riding on her back is a remarkable phenomenon to behold. Of course, the seemingly benign animal will put up a fierce fight against any attempt to get the baby off her back!</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">The hippo’s skin is well suited for aquatic life. Significant changes become evident once the animal emerges onto land. Glands situated under the skin secrete thin mucus with a reddish-brown color and a high salt content. Seen from a distance, the pigment makes the animal appear to be sweating blood. The slime, however, protects <span id="page25" class="pageNum" data-no="25" data-before-text="25"></span>the skin both in water and on dry land. In ancient African communities, the skin of the hippo was cut into strips and soaked in oil. Then the strips were twisted and dried to make a dreaded whip that was used in territorial fights.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> <em>Grzimek’s Animal Life Encyclopedia </em>notes that after tanning<wbr />—a process that takes at least six years—<wbr />the hippo skin “is as hard as rock and about four and a half centimeters [one and three quarters inches] thick.”</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="ss"><strong>The Impressive but Frightening Yawn</strong></p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">The mouth is certainly the most striking feature of the hippo. On land the animal uses its one-and-a-half-foot-wide <strong>[half-meter-wide] </strong>lips to graze near the water. Yet, the mouth is not just a feeding instrument. When the hippo opens its jaws 150 degrees, it is not merely a yawn but a threatening display of aggressiveness. Defending the ever-diminishing territory leads to serious fights between opponents. The open mouth reveals huge lower canines. These weapons of defense may reach a length of 12 inches <strong>[30 cm] </strong>above the gum line.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">The hippo’s mouth is dangerous not only to other hippos but also to humans. Any human efforts to coexist with the hippo have proved futile. The animal will make an unprovoked attack on those who venture too close to its domain. Furthermore, if a hippo is wounded, it is even more irritable and hence capable of inflicting greater damage on any intruder. Even boats have been capsized by the huge jaws of an angry hippo.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">On land the hippo is as brutish as it is in water. For example, it is extremely dangerous to be between a grazing hippo and the water. Indeed, in some parts of Africa, unsuspecting villagers have been attacked by hippos that found their path to the water blocked. The animal inspires fear in both man and beast and must be treated with the utmost caution and respect.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="ss"><strong>Will the Hippo Survive?</strong></p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">Grazing on land, a lone hippo is vulnerable to attack by lions. Nevertheless, the hippo’s most threatening enemy seems to be man. “People have greatly reduced both the number of hippopotamuses and the size of the area in which they live,” says the <em>World Book Encyclopedia. </em>“Hunters have killed large numbers of them, and farmers have made cropland out of many areas where hippopotamuses once made their home.”</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">Yes, human encroachment on the hippo’s habitat has forced the animal into a small area, thus inhibiting its free movement and breeding patterns. Happily, under the rule of God’s Kingdom, the Creator promises to restore a proper balance between man and beast, so that no one will “do any harm or cause any ruin” in the restored earthly Paradise.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:11:9-23:11:9" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Isaiah 11:9</a>.</p>

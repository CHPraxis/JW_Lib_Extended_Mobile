Sound Advice for Young People
While offering magazines near a courthouse in California, U.S.A., Bill, one of Jehovah’s Witnesses, was approached by a man who asked to see all the Awake! magazines that Bill had with him. Bill relates: “Earlier some in the congregation had given me some older magazines, so I was able to show the man a wide variety.
“The man quickly separated the magazines and made a stack of the ones he had not yet read. He asked if he could have the stack of magazines. He identified himself as an employee of the county court and said that he was in charge of counseling young people in trouble. He explained that he obtains Awake! in order to photocopy the ‘Young People Ask’ articles. He then files the articles by subject and keeps them on hand to give to the young people he counsels. The man said: ‘The subjects discussed are typical problems troubling young people today.’ He commended Jehovah’s Witnesses for publishing such good information to help young people. He added that he would be looking for me in the coming weeks to pick up any new Awake! magazines that I could supply.”

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">IT WAS the day that completely changed the course of humankind for its eternal good. No other day in history has had such an impact on mankind’s future. It was the day when Jesus completed all that he came to earth to do. Nailed to a torture stake, he took his final breath and cried out: “It has been accomplished!” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:19:30-43:19:30" data-bid="1-1" class="b">John 19:30</a>) For what purpose had Jesus come?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“The Son of man came,” says the Bible, “not to be ministered to, but to minister and to give his soul a ransom in exchange for many.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:20:28-40:20:28" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matthew 20:28</a>) Jesus gave his soul, or life, so that mankind could be rescued from inherited sin and death. Yes, “God loved the world so much that he gave his only-begotten Son, in order that everyone exercising faith in him might not be destroyed but have everlasting life.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:3:16-43:3:16" data-bid="3-1" class="b">John 3:16</a>) What a valuable provision Jesus’ sacrifice is!</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The day of Jesus’ death is the day to remember for yet another reason. On that day the Son of God taught his apostles valuable lessons that would help them remain faithful. How his last words must have touched the hearts of those disciples! What were his teachings? How can we benefit from what Jesus taught them? These questions will be discussed in the next article.</p>

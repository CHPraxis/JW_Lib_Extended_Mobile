<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Have you appreciated reading the recent issues of <em>The Watchtower? </em>Well, see if you can answer the following questions:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn">• <strong>What are some ways in which Ruth served as a fine example?</strong></p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn">She was exemplary in her love for Jehovah, in her loyal love toward Naomi, and in displaying the qualities of industriousness and humility. For good reason, people viewed her as “an excellent woman.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/8:3:11-8:3:11" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ruth 3:11</a>)​—4/15, pages 23-6.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn">• <strong>How do we know that Jehovah cares for ordinary people?</strong></p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn">He told the Israelites, who had been treated cruelly in Egypt, not to maltreat the underprivileged. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:22:21-2:22:24" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Exodus 22:21-24</a>) Jesus, who imitated his Father, showed genuine interest in common people, and he selected as apostles men who were “unlettered and ordinary.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:4:13-44:4:13" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Acts 4:13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:9:36-40:9:36" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Matthew 9:36</a>) We can imitate God by showing concern for others, such as young people.​—4/15, pages 28-31.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sn">• <strong>What reason do we have for believing that Jehovah notices what we do?</strong></p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sn">Bible accounts show that Jehovah notices the accomplishments of humans. He noted the sacrifice that Abel offered, and he notices our ‘sacrifices of praise, the fruit of lips.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:13:15-58:13:15" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Hebrews 13:15</a>) Jehovah was aware that Enoch strove to please him by living a clean, moral life. And God observed how a non-Israelite widow of Zarephath shared what little she had with the prophet Elijah. Jehovah also notices our acts of faith.​—5/1, pages 28-31.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sn">• <strong>Why can it be said that after Pentecost 33 C.E., Jews who became Christians had to make a personal dedication to God?</strong></p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sn">In 1513 B.C.E., the ancient Israelites came into a dedicated relationship with Jehovah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:19:3-2:19:8" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Exodus 19:3-8</a>) After that, Jews were born into that dedicated nation under the Law covenant. But Jehovah removed the Law covenant by means of Christ’s death in 33 C.E. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:2:14-51:2:14" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Colossians 2:14</a>) Thereafter, Jews wanting to serve God acceptably needed to make a dedication to him and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ.​—5/15, pages 30-1.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sn">• <strong>Does the burning of incense have a place in true worship today?</strong></p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sn">The use of incense was part of true worship in ancient Israel. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:30:37-2:30:38" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Exodus 30:37, 38;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:16:12-3:16:13" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> Leviticus 16:12, 13</a>) But the Law covenant, including the use of incense, ended with Christ’s death. Christians can decide for themselves whether to use incense for nonreligious purposes, but it is not a part of true worship today. The feelings of others should also be considered so as to avoid stumbling them.​—6/1, pages 28-30.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sn">• <strong>What recent news item has moved many to give more thought to the reality that Jesus walked the earth?</strong></p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sn">Much publicity has been given to a box, an ossuary, found in Israel. It seems to date from the first century, and there is an inscription on it that reads: “James, son of Joseph, brother of Jesus.” Some consider this to be “the oldest extrabiblical archaeological evidence” of Jesus’ existence.​—6/15, page 3-4.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sn">• <strong>How does a human learn to love?</strong></p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sn">Humans first learn to love by the example and training of their parents. When husband and wife show love and respect for each other, the children can learn to love. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:5:28-49:5:28" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Ephesians 5:28;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/56:2:4-56:2:4" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> Titus 2:4</a>) Even if a person does not come from a loving family, he can learn to love by accepting Jehovah’s fatherly guidance, by getting the help of the holy spirit, and by benefiting from the warm support of the Christian brotherhood.​—7/1, pages 4-7.</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sn">• <strong>Who was Eusebius, and what lesson can we learn from his life?</strong></p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sn">Eusebius was an early historian who, in 324 C.E., finished the ten-volume work entitled <em>History of the Christian Church. </em>Although he believed that the Father existed before the Son, Eusebius accepted a different view at the council in Nicaea. He apparently ignored Jesus’ requirement that His followers be “no part of the world.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:16-43:17:16" data-bid="9-1" class="b">John 17:16</a>)​—7/15, pages 29-31.</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sn">• <strong>Has Jehovah changed his view of polygamy?</strong></p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sn">No, Jehovah has not changed his view of polygamy. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/39:3:6-39:3:6" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Malachi 3:6</a>) God’s arrangement for the first man was for him to “stick to his wife” and to become one flesh with her. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:2:24-1:2:24" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Genesis 2:24</a>) Jesus said that divorcing except on the ground of fornication and then remarrying makes one an adulterer. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:19:4-40:19:6" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Matthew 19:4-6,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:19:9-40:19:9" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> 9</a>) Jehovah’s toleration of polygamy came to an end with the formation of the Christian congregation.​—8/1, page 28.</p>

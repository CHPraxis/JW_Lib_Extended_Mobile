<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">THE death of a loved one is indeed distressing. The empty feeling, the loneliness, and the sense of loss are unfathomable. Bereavement can make a person feel helpless, for regardless of how much wealth, power, or influence he might possess, no one now on earth can restore a dead person to life.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">However, our Creator looks at matters differently. Having formed the first human from the dust of the ground, he is also able to re-create a dead person. For this reason, God can view the dead as though they were alive. Regarding faithful servants of old who have died, Jesus said: “They are all living from [God’s] standpoint.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:20:38-42:20:38" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Luke 20:38</a>, footnote.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">While on earth, Jesus was empowered to resurrect the dead. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:5:21-43:5:21" data-bid="2-1" class="b">John 5:21</a>) Hence, he shares his Father’s view of those who have died faithful. For example, when his friend Lazarus died, Jesus told his disciples: “I am journeying . . . to awaken him from sleep.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:11:11-43:11:11" data-bid="3-1" class="b">John 11:11</a>) From a human standpoint, Lazarus was dead, but to Jehovah and Jesus, Lazarus was sleeping.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Under Jesus’ Kingdom rule, there will be “a resurrection of both the righteous and the unrighteous.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:24:15-44:24:15" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Acts 24:15</a>) In time, those who are resurrected will receive divine education and have the prospect of everlasting life on earth.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:5:28-43:5:29" data-bid="5-1" class="b">John 5:28, 29</a>.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Yes, the death of a loved one can cause much distress and sorrow, which may last for years. Nevertheless, viewing the dead from God’s standpoint can bring us great comfort and fill us with hope.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:1:3-47:1:4" data-bid="6-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 1:3, 4</a>.</p>

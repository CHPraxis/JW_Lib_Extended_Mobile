God’s View of the Dead
THE death of a loved one is indeed distressing. The empty feeling, the loneliness, and the sense of loss are unfathomable. Bereavement can make a person feel helpless, for regardless of how much wealth, power, or influence he might possess, no one now on earth can restore a dead person to life.
However, our Creator looks at matters differently. Having formed the first human from the dust of the ground, he is also able to re-create a dead person. For this reason, God can view the dead as though they were alive. Regarding faithful servants of old who have died, Jesus said: “They are all living from [God’s] standpoint.”​—Luke 20:38, footnote.
While on earth, Jesus was empowered to resurrect the dead. (John 5:21) Hence, he shares his Father’s view of those who have died faithful. For example, when his friend Lazarus died, Jesus told his disciples: “I am journeying . . . to awaken him from sleep.” (John 11:11) From a human standpoint, Lazarus was dead, but to Jehovah and Jesus, Lazarus was sleeping.
Under Jesus’ Kingdom rule, there will be “a resurrection of both the righteous and the unrighteous.” (Acts 24:15) In time, those who are resurrected will receive divine education and have the prospect of everlasting life on earth.​—John 5:28, 29.
Yes, the death of a loved one can cause much distress and sorrow, which may last for years. Nevertheless, viewing the dead from God’s standpoint can bring us great comfort and fill us with hope.​—2 Corinthians 1:3, 4.

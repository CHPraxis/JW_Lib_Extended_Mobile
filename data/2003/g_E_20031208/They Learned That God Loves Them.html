<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Some find it hard to believe that anyone<wbr />—even God—<wbr />could dearly love them. So after reading the book <em>Draw Close to Jehovah, </em>many wrote letters expressing appreciation for the assurance that it provides. “I am overwhelmed by how much he loves me, even with all my failings,” wrote a woman from Decatur, Illinois, U.S.A.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">She further wrote: “I cried with joy when I read the statement [on page 117]: ‘As a just, or righteous, Father, Jehovah balances firmness for what is right with tender compassion toward his earthly children, who need his help and forgiveness.’”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">A man from Ripon, California, wrote: “Thank you so much for showing me that Jehovah does love me. He does care. I’m not just some number on a piece of paper.” A woman in New Hampshire said: “At times I feel I can’t put the book down.” She explained: “I have had a very difficult time truly believing that Jehovah could love me.” So the book was just what she needed.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">We believe that you too will benefit from reading this book. After three introductory chapters, it is divided into four sections, entitled “Vigorous in Power,” “A Lover of Justice,” “Wise in Heart,” and “God Is Love.” Each section concentrates on a principal attribute of God. The chapter “Draw Close to God, and He Will Draw Close to You” concludes this motivating book.</p>

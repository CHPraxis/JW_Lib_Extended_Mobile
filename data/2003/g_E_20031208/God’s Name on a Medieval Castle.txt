God’s Name on a Medieval Castle
BY AWAKE! WRITER IN SLOVAKIA
SLOVAKIA is a small but very scenic country in the heart of Europe. The picturesque countryside is studded with castles that stand as monuments to the region’s long and rich history. Among the most remarkable is Orava Castle, built atop the 365-foot [112 m] limestone cliffs that tower over the adjacent village.
The first historical references to Orava Castle date from 1267. Since then, its ownership has changed hands many times. In 1556 the castle came into the possession of the wealthy Thurzó family. Among other improvements and additions, the Thurzós built the castle’s chapel.
Each year Orava Castle and its exhibits draw tens of thousands of visitors from many countries. In the courtyard visitors can see something of special interest that is preserved in a sandstone relief of the Thurzó family coat of arms. The relief contains the Biblical name of God—Jehovah—in Latin.

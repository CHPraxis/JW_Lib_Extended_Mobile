<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">▪ Literature offer for <strong>April and May: </strong>Feature individual copies of both <em>The Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>When making return visits on interested people, which may include those who attend the Memorial and/or other theocratic events but who are not actively associated with the congregation, concentrate on placing the new book <em>Worship the Only True God. </em>Every effort should be made to start a home Bible study, especially if some individuals have already studied the <em>Knowledge </em>book and the <em>Require </em>brochure. <strong>June, July, and August: </strong>Offer the <em>Knowledge </em>book or the <em>Require </em>brochure. When householders already have these publications, use another appropriate brochure that the congregation has in stock.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn">▪ Those planning to tour the U.S. branch facilities may wish to arrange their visits on a weekday (Monday through Friday, between 8:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m.) rather than on Saturday morning. This will allow them to view Bethel departments in full operation. Those wishing to tour on Saturday morning are certainly welcome. However, they will receive only a limited tour, since many Bethel family members are sharing in the field ministry or other theocratic activities at that time.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn">▪ DISTRICT CONVENTION CHANGE: Because of circumstances beyond our control, the dates for the district convention in Uniondale, New York, on September 5-7, 2003, have been changed to July 25-27, 2003.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn">▪ DISTRICT CONVENTION CORRECTION: The address appearing on <a class="xt" data-xtid="23" href="jwpub://p/E:2003167/1-139">page 30 of the March 1, 2003, <em>Watchtower</em></a> for the district conventions to be held in Columbia, South Carolina, is incorrect. The correct address is as follows: The Carolina Center, 801 Lincoln Street.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn">▪ Beginning in April, district convention badge cards for 2003 will automatically be included with literature shipments. It will not be necessary to request these unless you have a foreign-language group associated with your congregation. Based on the size of each congregation, cards will be shipped in lots of 25. If additional badge cards are needed by the congregation, these should be requested on a Literature Request Form (S-14). Plastic badge holders must be requested for any in the congregation who desire them.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sn">▪ DISTRICT CONVENTION PARKING: At all convention sites where we have secured control of the parking facilities, the spaces will be made available at no charge on a first-come, first-served basis. No parking tickets will be used, but convention badge cards will serve as identification for parking. Only those who have a state-approved disabled license plate or placard will be allowed to park in the parking reserved for the disabled. Being aware that considerable expense is involved, we can show our appreciation by making voluntary contributions to the worldwide work at our Kingdom Hall or at the convention. Any checks contributed at the convention should be made payable to “Watch Tower.” Since parking space is usually limited, carpooling should be done to the extent possible rather than having only one or two persons per car. At a few locations, this parking arrangement cannot be fully implemented this year. Congregations affected by any variation in this arrangement will be so advised by their local convention headquarters.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sn">▪ Whenever personal travel plans include attending congregation meetings, an assembly, or a district convention in another land, your request for information regarding dates, times, and locations must be directed to the branch office that oversees the work in that land. Addresses of branch offices are listed on the last page of the current <em>Yearbook.</em></p>

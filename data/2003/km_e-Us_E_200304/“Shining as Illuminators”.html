<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>Amid the spiritual and moral darkness of the present system of things, some six million worshipers of the true God, Jehovah, are “shining as illuminators” in 234 lands worldwide. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:2:15-50:2:15" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Phil. 2:15</a>) This causes us to stand out. How do we reflect the precious light of truth that emanates from Jehovah?​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:3:18-47:3:18" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Cor. 3:18</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup><strong>Our Actions: </strong>People are quick to notice our conduct. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:2:12-60:2:12" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Pet. 2:12</a>) One woman observed that a Witness coworker was kind and helpful and did not use foul language or laugh at unclean jokes. When others tried to provoke the Witness by using profanity in his presence, he remained calm yet firm for what is right. What effect did this have on the woman? She recalls: “I was so impressed with his conduct that I started asking questions about the Bible. I began studying God’s Word and was later baptized.” She adds: “It was his conduct that convinced me to examine the beliefs of Jehovah’s Witnesses.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>Our attitude toward authority, our view of worldly practices, and our wholesome speech cause Jehovah’s Witnesses to stand out as a people who live by the Bible’s lofty standards. Such fine works can bring glory to Jehovah and attract others to his worship.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup><strong>Our Words: </strong>Of course, those who see our fine conduct may not know why we are different unless we speak to them about our beliefs. Do those with whom you work or attend school know that you are one of Jehovah’s Witnesses? Do you look for opportunities to turn an ordinary conversation into a witness? Is it your resolve to “let your light shine before men” on every appropriate occasion?​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:5:14-40:5:16" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Matt. 5:14-16</a>.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>Fulfilling our commission as light-bearers calls for a spirit of self-sacrifice. A whole-souled attitude will move us to forgo less important things in order to do as much as we can in the lifesaving work of preaching and making disciples.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:12:15-47:12:15" data-bid="5-1" class="b">2 Cor. 12:15</a>.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup>By our actions and words, may we continue shining as illuminators. If we do, others may be moved to join us in giving glory to Jehovah.</p>

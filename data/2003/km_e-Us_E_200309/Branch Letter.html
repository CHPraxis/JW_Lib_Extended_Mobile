<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sh">Dear Kingdom Publishers:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“God kept making it grow.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:3:6-46:3:6" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Cor. 3:6</a>) How thrilling it has been to see the growth in the United States field! During the 2003 service year, over 70,000 new Bible studies were started. This is commendable.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Jehovah is blessing the activity in the foreign-language field. Congregations or groups have been established in 37 languages besides English and Spanish. Recently, the first Amharic and Indonesian congregations in the branch territory were formed. May we strive to reach the estimated 28 million foreign-born people living in the United States.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">To supply literature for the growing worldwide field, the printery at Watchtower Farms, near Wallkill, New York, is being expanded. Good progress is being made in adding three and a half acres <strong>[1.4 ha] </strong>of floor space. This is equivalent to 30 average-size Kingdom Halls! Two large, state-of-the-art printing presses are scheduled to arrive early in 2004. Each press will be able to produce up to 25 magazines a second. New bindery and shipping equipment will also be installed during 2004. This will result in greater production with reduced personnel.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">As we begin the 2004 service year, we join with you in praying that Jehovah will ‘keep making it grow.’</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sj">Your brothers,</p>

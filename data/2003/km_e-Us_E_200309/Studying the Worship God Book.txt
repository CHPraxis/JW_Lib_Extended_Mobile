Studying the Worship God Book
Worship the Only True God is designed to be studied with new ones after they have completed a study of the Knowledge book. Our consideration of this publication at the Congregation Book Study will equip us to use this tool in the ministry and will help us to deepen our love and appreciation for Jehovah and his organization. How can we benefit fully from our study of the Worship God book?
Conducting the Study: Since we will be considering a full chapter each week, book study overseers will need to apportion the time wisely. They will want to keep the study moving during the introductory paragraphs to allow more time for the weightier material, which generally appears later in the chapter. Briefly discussing the review box at the conclusion of each study will assist those present to retain the key points.
Indented questions for meditation and discussion appear in about half the chapters of the Worship God book. An example can be found on pages 48-9. It is not necessary for such questions to be read along with the paragraphs. When considering them with the group, the overseer should have the cited scriptures read and discussed as time permits.
Advance Preparation: Preparing well for the study involves more than underlining the answers. Prayerful meditation on the cited scriptures will enable us to prepare not only our comments but, more important, our hearts. (Ezra 7:10) All of us can contribute to an interchange of encouragement by modestly offering our comments.​—Rom. 1:11, 12.
Our study of the Worship God book will help us to draw close to Jehovah and will equip us to help honesthearted ones join us in worshiping him. (Ps. 95:6; Jas. 4:8) May all of us benefit fully from this fine spiritual provision.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>A shepherd boy trusts in Jehovah and defeats a mighty warrior. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:17:45-9:17:47" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Sam. 17:45-47</a>) A wealthy man patiently endures calamity. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:1:20-18:1:22" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Job 1:20-22;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:2:9-18:2:10" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 2:9, 10</a>) God’s Son directs all credit for his teaching to his Father. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:7:15-43:7:18" data-bid="3-1" class="b">John 7:15-18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:8:28-43:8:28" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 8:28</a>) In each of these examples, humility played a key role. Similarly today, humility is vital in the situations that we face.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:3:12-51:3:12" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Col. 3:12</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup><strong>When Preaching: </strong>As Christian ministers, we humbly share the good news with people of all sorts, not prejudging them on the basis of their race, culture, or background. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:9:22-46:9:23" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 Cor. 9:22, 23</a>) If some are rude or arrogantly reject the Kingdom message, we do not respond in kind but patiently go on searching for deserving ones. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:10:11-40:10:11" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Matt. 10:11,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:10:14-40:10:14" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 14</a>) Rather than trying to impress others with our knowledge or education, we direct attention to God’s Word, recognizing that it is more persuasive than anything that we might say. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:2:1-46:2:5" data-bid="7-1" class="b">1 Cor. 2:1-5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:4:12-58:4:12" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> Heb. 4:12</a>) In imitation of Jesus, we give all praise to Jehovah.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:10:17-41:10:18" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Mark 10:17, 18</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup><strong>In the Congregation: </strong>Christians must also ‘gird themselves with lowliness of mind toward one another.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:5:5-60:5:5" data-bid="9-1" class="b">1 Pet. 5:5</a>) If we consider others as superior to ourselves, we will look for ways to serve our brothers rather than expecting them to serve us. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:13:12-43:13:17" data-bid="10-1" class="b">John 13:12-17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:2:3-50:2:4" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> Phil. 2:3, 4</a>) We will not feel that we are above such tasks as cleaning the Kingdom Hall.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>Humility helps us to ‘put up with one another in love’ and thus promotes peace and unity in the congregation. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:4:1-49:4:3" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Eph. 4:1-3</a>) It helps us to be in subjection to those who are appointed to take the lead. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:13:17-58:13:17" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Heb. 13:17</a>) It moves us to accept any counsel or discipline we may be given. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:141:5-19:141:5" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Ps. 141:5</a>) And humility prompts us to rely on Jehovah when we care for any privileges we may receive in the congregation. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:4:11-60:4:11" data-bid="14-1" class="b">1 Pet. 4:11</a>) Like David, we recognize that success depends not on human ability but on God’s blessing.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:17:37-9:17:37" data-bid="15-1" class="b">1 Sam. 17:37</a>.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup><strong>Before Our God: </strong>Above all, we need to ‘humble ourselves under the mighty hand of God.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:5:6-60:5:6" data-bid="16-1" class="b">1 Pet. 5:6</a>) If we must contend with trying circumstances, we may long for the relief that the Kingdom will bring. But we humbly exercise patience, waiting for Jehovah to fulfill his promises at his appointed time. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:5:7-59:5:11" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Jas. 5:7-11</a>) As was true of integrity-keeping Job, our foremost concern is that “the name of Jehovah continue to be blessed.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:1:21-18:1:21" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Job 1:21</a>.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup>The prophet Daniel ‘humbled himself before his God’ and was blessed with Jehovah’s favor and many fine privileges. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:10:11-27:10:12" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Dan. 10:11, 12</a>) May we likewise clothe ourselves with humility, knowing that “the result of humility and the fear of Jehovah is riches and glory and life.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:22:4-20:22:4" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Prov. 22:4</a>.</p>

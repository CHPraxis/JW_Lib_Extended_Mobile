<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">“FOR the past year, Jehovah’s Witnesses have been visiting me and sharing the wonderful news about God’s Kingdom. I was a Catholic for eight years, but I did not know much about God. Just in this one year, I have learned a lot,” wrote a man who lives in Kerala, India. “I am very happy to know that <em>The Watchtower </em>is published in 139 [now 146] languages,” he continued. “It is surprising that people of all language groups are coming to know the message about God.”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Although many philosophers claim that it is impossible to know God, the apostle Paul made it clear that this is possible. Addressing a group of Athenians, some of whom were worshiping at an altar dedicated to “an Unknown God,” Paul said: “What you are unknowingly giving godly devotion to, this I am publishing to you. The God that made the world and all the things in it . . . gives to all persons life and breath and all things. And he made out of one man every nation of men, to dwell upon the entire surface of the earth.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:17:23-44:17:26" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Acts 17:23-26</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Paul urged his audience to seek to know the Creator, for “he is not far off from each one of us.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:17:27-44:17:27" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Acts 17:27</a>) Jehovah’s Witnesses will be happy to help you to come to know the true God and his appealing qualities.</p>

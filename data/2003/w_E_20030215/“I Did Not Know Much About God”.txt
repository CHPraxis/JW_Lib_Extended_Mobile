“I Did Not Know Much About God”
“FOR the past year, Jehovah’s Witnesses have been visiting me and sharing the wonderful news about God’s Kingdom. I was a Catholic for eight years, but I did not know much about God. Just in this one year, I have learned a lot,” wrote a man who lives in Kerala, India. “I am very happy to know that The Watchtower is published in 139 [now 146] languages,” he continued. “It is surprising that people of all language groups are coming to know the message about God.”
Although many philosophers claim that it is impossible to know God, the apostle Paul made it clear that this is possible. Addressing a group of Athenians, some of whom were worshiping at an altar dedicated to “an Unknown God,” Paul said: “What you are unknowingly giving godly devotion to, this I am publishing to you. The God that made the world and all the things in it . . . gives to all persons life and breath and all things. And he made out of one man every nation of men, to dwell upon the entire surface of the earth.”​—Acts 17:23-26.
Paul urged his audience to seek to know the Creator, for “he is not far off from each one of us.” (Acts 17:27) Jehovah’s Witnesses will be happy to help you to come to know the true God and his appealing qualities.

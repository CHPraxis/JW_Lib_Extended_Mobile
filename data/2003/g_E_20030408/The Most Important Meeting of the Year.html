<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Imagine that you suffer from an illness that is life-threatening. Surgery can cure you, but the cost of an operation is far beyond what you can afford. Now suppose a benefactor steps in and offers to pay for the operation. Would you not be grateful for his life-saving gift?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The Bible teaches that the first humans, Adam and Eve, passed on sin and death to all of their descendants. In a sense, then, each of us was born with a terminal illness<wbr />—and none of us can afford the cure. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:49:7-19:49:9" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 49:7-9</a>) Yet, Jehovah God provided his Son, Jesus Christ, as a ransom to cover the cost of our sins. Because of this life-saving gift, we have the opportunity to live forever in Paradise.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:6:23-45:6:23" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Romans 6:23</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">On Wednesday, April 16, after sundown, Jehovah’s Witnesses will commemorate Jesus’ death. Last year more than 15,000,000 were present<wbr />—most of whom were not Jehovah’s Witnesses. You are invited to attend this year’s Memorial of Christ’s death. It is truly the most important meeting of the year. Please check with Jehovah’s Witnesses locally for the exact time and location.</p>

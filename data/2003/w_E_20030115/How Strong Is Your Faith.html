<p id="p3" data-pid="3" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb">JEHOVAH’S servants know that they must have faith.

<p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>Our faith will become stronger if we persist in pursuing the course that God’s Word sets out for all Christians.

Of course, nobody else can exercise faith for us or make us loyal integrity keepers.

<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>The Scriptures abound with accounts of those who had faith. We may be acquainted with many of their outstanding deeds, but what about the faith they displayed from day to day, perhaps throughout a long life?

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="ss"><strong>Faith Gives Us Courage</strong></p>
<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu"> 5. What Scriptural evidence is there that faith strengthens us to declare God’s word courageously?</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>Faith strengthens us to declare God’s word with courage. Enoch courageously foretold the execution of divine judgment. “Look!” he said, “Jehovah came with his holy myriads, to execute judgment against all, and to convict all the ungodly concerning all their ungodly deeds that they did in an ungodly way, and concerning all the shocking things that ungodly sinners spoke against him.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/65:1:14-65:1:15" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Jude 14, 15</a>) Upon hearing such words, Enoch’s godless enemies surely wanted to kill him. Yet, he boldly spoke out in faith, and God “took him” by putting him to sleep in death, apparently without allowing him to suffer its pangs. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:5:24-1:5:24" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Genesis 5:24;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:11:5-58:11:5" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> Hebrews 11:5</a>) We do not experience such miracles, but Jehovah answers our prayers so that we can declare his word with faith and courage.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:4:24-44:4:31" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Acts 4:24-31</a>.</p>
<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu"> 6. How did God-given faith and courage help Noah?</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup>By faith Noah “constructed an ark for the saving of his household.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:11:7-58:11:7" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Hebrews 11:7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:6:13-1:6:22" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> Genesis 6:13-22</a>) Noah was also “a preacher of righteousness” who courageously declared God’s warning to his contemporaries. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:2:5-61:2:5" data-bid="14-1" class="b">2 Peter 2:5</a>) They must have scoffed at his message about a coming Deluge, even as some scoff when we provide Scriptural proof that the present system of things will soon be destroyed. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:3:3-61:3:12" data-bid="15-1" class="b">2 Peter 3:3-12</a>) Like Enoch and Noah, however, we can deliver such a message because of our God-given faith and courage.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="ss"><strong>Faith Makes Us Patient</strong></p>
<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu"> 7. How did Abraham and others display faith and patience?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><sup>7 </sup>We need faith and patience, especially as we await the end of this wicked system. Among those ‘who through faith and patience will inherit the promises’ is the God-fearing patriarch Abraham. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:6:11-58:6:12" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Hebrews 6:11, 12</a>) By faith he left the city of Ur, with all its advantages, and became an alien in a foreign land promised to him by God. Isaac and Jacob were heirs of the very same promise. <span id="page17" class="pageNum" data-no="17" data-before-text="17"></span>However, “in faith all these died, although they did not get the fulfillment of the promises.” By faith they ‘reached out for a better place, that is, one belonging to heaven.’ Accordingly, God “has made a city ready for them.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:11:8-58:11:16" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Hebrews 11:8-16</a>) Yes, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob​—and their godly wives—​patiently awaited God’s heavenly Kingdom, under which they will be resurrected to life on earth.</p>
<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu"> 8. Despite what did Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob manifest patience and faith?</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><sup>8 </sup>Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob did not lose faith. The Promised Land did not come under their control, and they did not see all nations bless themselves by means of Abraham’s seed. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:15:5-1:15:7" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Genesis 15:5-7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:22:15-1:22:18" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> 22:15-18</a>) Though the ‘city built by God’ would not become a reality until centuries had passed, these men continued to display faith and patience throughout their lives. Surely we should do no less now that the Messianic Kingdom is a reality in heaven.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:42:5-19:42:5" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Psalm 42:5,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:42:11-19:42:11" data-bid="19-2" class="b"> 11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:43:5-19:43:5" data-bid="19-3" class="b"> 43:5</a>.</p>

<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><sup>9 </sup>The faithful patriarchs never adopted the degraded Canaanite life-style, for they had far higher goals and objectives. Faith similarly gives us spiritual goals that enable us to resist assimilation into the world lying in the power of the wicked one, Satan the Devil.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:2:15-62:2:17" data-bid="20-1" class="b">1 John 2:15-17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:5:19-62:5:19" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> 5:19</a>.</p>
<p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu">10. How do we know that Joseph pursued a goal far higher than that of worldly prominence?</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><sup>10 </sup>By divine providence, Jacob’s son Joseph served as Egypt’s food administrator, but it was not his goal to be a great man of this world. With faith in the fulfillment of Jehovah’s promises, 110-year-old Joseph told his brothers: “I am dying; but God will without fail turn his attention to you, and he will certainly bring you up out of this land to the land about which he swore to Abraham, to Isaac and to Jacob.” Joseph asked to be buried in the land of promise. At death, he was embalmed and laid in a coffin in Egypt. But when the Israelites were delivered from Egyptian bondage, the prophet Moses had Joseph’s bones taken along for burial in the Promised Land. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:50:22-1:50:26" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Genesis 50:22-26;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:13:19-2:13:19" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> Exodus 13:19</a>) Faith like that of Joseph should move us to pursue goals far higher than worldly prominence.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:7:29-46:7:31" data-bid="22-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 7:29-31</a>.</p>
<p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu">11. In what way did Moses give evidence that he had spiritual goals?</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><sup>11 </sup>Moses ‘chose ill-treatment with God’s people rather than the temporary enjoyment <span id="page18" class="pageNum" data-no="18" data-before-text="18"></span>of sin’ as a well-educated member of Egypt’s royal family. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:11:23-58:11:26" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Hebrews 11:23-26;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:7:20-44:7:22" data-bid="23-2" class="b"> Acts 7:20-22</a>) This cost him worldly prestige and perhaps a grand burial in an ornate coffin at some renowned Egyptian site. But of what value would that have been compared with the privilege of being a “man of the true God,” the mediator of the Law covenant, Jehovah’s prophet, and a Bible writer? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/15:3:2-15:3:2" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Ezra 3:2</a>) Is prestigious secular advancement what you desire, or has faith given you much higher spiritual goals?</p>

<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><sup>12 </sup>Faith gives people not only the highest goals but also a rewarding life. Rahab of Jericho must have found little meaning in her life as a harlot. Yet, how that changed when she exercised faith! She was “declared righteous by works [of faith], after she had received the [Israelite] messengers hospitably and sent them out by another way,” so that they eluded their Canaanite enemies. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:2:24-59:2:26" data-bid="25-1" class="b">James 2:24-26</a>) Recognizing Jehovah as the true God, Rahab displayed faith also by abandoning her life of prostitution.

<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><sup>13 </sup>After abandoning her sinful life, Rahab apparently maintained an upright course. However, some who have long been dedicated to God have sinned gravely. King David committed adultery with Bath-sheba, had her husband killed in battle, and then took her as his wife. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:11:1-10:11:27" data-bid="29-1" class="b">2 Samuel 11:1-27</a>) Repenting in deep sorrow, David petitioned Jehovah: “Your holy spirit O do not take away from me.” David did not lose God’s spirit.

<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><sup>14 </sup>Although we walk by faith, we may sometimes need assurance of divine help.

Desiring assurance that Jehovah was with him, he proposed tests involving a fleece of wool exposed on a threshing floor overnight.

<p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><sup>15 </sup>The faith of Judge Barak was bolstered by assurance in the form of encouragement. The prophetess Deborah spurred him on to take the initiative in freeing the Israelites from oppression by Canaanite King Jabin.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:4:1-7:5:31" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Judges 4:1–5:31</a>) Deborah encouraged Barak to act as Israel’s God-appointed leader, and he was one of Jehovah’s servants who through faith “routed the armies of foreigners.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:11:34-58:11:34" data-bid="36-1" class="b">Hebrews 11:34</a>) Reflecting on how God blessed Barak for acting in faith may well move us to action if we are somewhat hesitant about fulfilling a challenging assignment in Jehovah’s service.</p>

When Paul was about to embark on his second missionary journey, Barnabas agreed to the proposal that they revisit the congregations in Cyprus and Asia Minor. However, Barnabas wanted to take along his cousin Mark. Paul disagreed because Mark had abandoned them in Pamphylia. “A sharp burst of anger” occurred, and this dispute caused a separation.

<p id="p55" data-pid="55" class="qu">20. What examples of faith do we have in Naomi and Ruth?</p>
<p id="p29" data-pid="29" data-rel-pid="[55]" class="sb"><sup>20 </sup>The aging widow Naomi was a Judean and knew that certain women of Judah might bear sons who would be forefathers of the Messiah. Inasmuch as her sons had died childless and she was past the childbearing age, however, the possibility that her family might contribute to Messianic lineage was remote indeed. Nevertheless, her widowed daughter-in-law Ruth became the wife of elderly Boaz, bore him a son, and became an ancestress of Jesus, the Messiah! (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:49:10-1:49:10" data-bid="48-1" class="b">Genesis 49:10,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:49:33-1:49:33" data-bid="48-2" class="b"> 33;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/8:1:3-8:1:5" data-bid="48-3" class="b"> Ruth 1:3-5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/8:4:13-8:4:22" data-bid="48-4" class="b"> 4:13-22;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:1:1-40:1:1" data-bid="48-5" class="b"> Matthew 1:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:1:5-40:1:5" data-bid="48-6" class="b"> 5</a>) The faith of Naomi and Ruth outlasted adversity and brought them joy. Great joy will be ours too if we maintain faith in the face of adversity.</p>
<p id="p56" data-pid="56" class="qu">21. What does faith do for us, and what should be our determination?</p>
<p id="p30" data-pid="30" data-rel-pid="[56]" class="sb"><sup>21 </sup>Although we cannot say what a day will bring forth for us individually, by faith we can meet any challenge. Faith makes us courageous and patient. It gives us the highest goals and a rewarding life. Faith has positive effects on our relationship with others and outlasts adversity. May we therefore be “the sort that have faith to the preserving alive of the soul.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:10:39-58:10:39" data-bid="49-1" class="b">Hebrews 10:39</a>) In the strength of our loving God, Jehovah, and to his glory, let us continue to exercise strong faith.</p>

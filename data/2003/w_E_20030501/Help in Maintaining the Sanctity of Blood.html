<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">THROUGHOUT the earth Jehovah’s servants have demonstrated loyalty to God in connection with the sanctity of blood. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:15:28-44:15:29" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Acts 15:28, 29</a>) Help to the Christian brotherhood has been provided by the faithful and discreet slave class. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:24:45-40:24:47" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matthew 24:45-47</a>) Let us see what the results were in the Philippines.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The Philippines branch reports: “In 1990 we were informed that representatives from Brooklyn Bethel would be holding a seminar here in the Philippines. Brothers were invited from several Asian branches, including Korea, Taiwan, and Hong Kong. The purpose was to help set up Hospital Information Services at their branches and also to arrange for Hospital Liaison Committees. In the Philippines the committees were initially established in four major cities.” The committees would endeavor to locate doctors willing to cooperate with us regarding the Christian stand on blood. They would also aid brothers when difficulties involving blood arose.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Remegio was selected to serve on the Hospital Liaison Committee in Baguio. As time went by, doctors began to take note of this service. Remegio remembers one occasion when a number of doctors meeting with a Hospital Liaison Committee wanted to know how to treat the Witness patients who refused blood. Remegio said: “The doctors started asking questions, but I found myself stymied because the questions were very technical.” He prayed to Jehovah for help in handling this challenge. Remegio continued: “After each question, other doctors raised their hands and told how they had coped with a similar situation.” Remegio was happy for the help, especially since the question-and-answer period went on for two hours.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">There are now 21 committees throughout the country, with a total of 77 brothers serving on them. Danilo, a Witness who is a medical doctor, says: “Doctors realize that their Witness patients are supported by an organization that lovingly cares for them.” One physician was initially reluctant to perform surgery on a brother without transfusing blood. However, the brother was firm in his stand. The surgery was performed and was a success. Hospital Information Services reports: “The doctor was just amazed at the brother’s recovery. He said: ‘Based on what has happened here, should any of your members need to have this type of surgery without blood, I’ll be happy to do it.’”</p>

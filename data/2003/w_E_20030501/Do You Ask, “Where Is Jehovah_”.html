<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu"> 1. When people ask, “Where is God?,” what may they have in mind?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb">“WHERE is God?” That question has been asked by many people. Some of them have simply been trying to understand a basic fact about the Creator, namely, where is he located? Others have voiced the question after a widespread calamity or when they personally felt hard-pressed and could not understand why God did not intervene. Yet others do not inquire at all because they reject the very idea that God exists.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:10:4-19:10:4" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Psalm 10:4</a>.</p>
<p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="qu"> 2. Who succeed in their search for God?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>There are, of course, many who recognize the abundant proof that there is a God.

But intense love for truth has impelled millions of others, in all lands, to search for the <em>true </em>God. Their effort has not been in vain because he “is not far off from each one of us.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:17:26-44:17:28" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Acts 17:26-28</a>.</p>
<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu"> 3. (a) Where is God’s place of dwelling? (b) What is implied by the Scriptural question, “Where is Jehovah?”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>When a person really does find Jehovah, he realizes that “God is a Spirit,” invisible to human eyes. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:4:24-43:4:24" data-bid="5-1" class="b">John 4:24</a>) Jesus referred to the true God as “my Father who is <em>in heaven.” </em>What does that mean? That the realm inhabited by our heavenly Father is, in a spiritual sense, a lofty one, even as the physical heavens of outer space are high above the earth. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:12:50-40:12:50" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Matthew 12:50;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:63:15-23:63:15" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> Isaiah 63:15</a>) Though we cannot see God with our physical eyes, however, he makes it possible for us to know him and to learn much about his purposes.

On matters that affect our lives, he provides a sound basis for us to determine his position, that is, how he views such matters and whether our desires are in harmony with his purposes. He wants us to make inquiry about such things and to put forth earnest effort to find the answers. Through the prophet Jeremiah, Jehovah reproved the people of ancient Israel because they failed to do this. They knew the name of God, but they did not ask, “Where is Jehovah?” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/24:2:6-24:2:6" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Jeremiah 2:6</a>) Jehovah’s purpose was not their chief concern. They were not looking for his guidance. When faced with decisions, large and small, do you ask, “Where is Jehovah?”</p>

<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu"> 4. How can we benefit from David’s example in inquiring of Jehovah?</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>When still a young man, David, the son of Jesse, developed strong faith in Jehovah. He knew Jehovah as “the living God.” David had personally experienced Jehovah’s protection. Impelled by faith and by love for “the name of Jehovah,” David slew the heavily armed Philistine giant Goliath. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/9:17:26-9:17:26" data-bid="9-1" class="b">1 Samuel 17:26,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/9:17:34-9:17:51" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 34-51</a>) However, David’s success did not make him self-confident. He did not reason that whatever he did now, Jehovah would bless him. Repeatedly during the years that followed, David inquired of Jehovah when confronted with decisions. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/9:23:2-9:23:2" data-bid="10-1" class="b">1 Samuel 23:2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/9:30:8-9:30:8" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> <span id="page9" class="pageNum" data-no="9" data-before-text="9"></span>30:8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/10:2:1-10:2:1" data-bid="10-3" class="b"> 2 Samuel 2:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/10:5:19-10:5:19" data-bid="10-4" class="b"> 5:19</a>) He continued to pray: “Make me know your own ways, O Jehovah; teach me your own paths. Make me walk in your truth and teach me, for you are my God of salvation.

<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu">5, 6. How did Jehoshaphat search for Jehovah at different times in his life?</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>In the days of King Jehoshaphat, the fifth king in the royal line descended from David, the combined forces of three nations came up to war against Judah. Faced with this national emergency, Jehoshaphat “set his face to search for Jehovah.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/14:20:1-14:20:3" data-bid="12-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 20:1-3</a>) This was not the first time that Jehoshaphat had searched for Jehovah. The king had shunned the Baal worship indulged in by the apostate northern kingdom of Israel and had chosen to walk in Jehovah’s ways. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/14:17:3-14:17:4" data-bid="13-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 17:3, 4</a>) So now when he was confronted with a crisis, how did Jehoshaphat “search for Jehovah”?</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup>In a public prayer that he offered in Jerusalem at this critical time, Jehoshaphat indicated that he had called to mind Jehovah’s almighty power. He had thought deeply about Jehovah’s purpose as revealed by His driving out other nations and giving certain land to Israel as an inheritance. The king acknowledged his need for Jehovah’s help. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/14:20:6-14:20:12" data-bid="14-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 20:6-12</a>) Did Jehovah let himself be found on that occasion? Yes, indeed. Through Jahaziel, a Levite, Jehovah provided specific direction, and the following day He gave victory to His people. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/14:20:14-14:20:28" data-bid="15-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 20:14-28</a>) How can you be certain that Jehovah will also let himself be found by you when you turn to him for direction?</p>
<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu"> 7. Whose prayers does God hear?</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><sup>7 </sup>Jehovah is not partial. He invites people of all nations to seek him in prayer. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:65:2-19:65:2" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Psalm 65:2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:10:34-44:10:35" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> Acts 10:34, 35</a>) He takes note of what is in the heart of those who petition him. He assures us that he hears the prayers of the righteous ones. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:15:29-20:15:29" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Proverbs 15:29</a>) He lets himself be found by some who formerly showed no interest in him but who now humbly seek his direction. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:65:1-23:65:1" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Isaiah 65:1</a>) He even hears the prayers of those who have failed to keep his law but who now humbly repent.

<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><sup>8 </sup>After the prophet Samuel told King Saul that he had been rejected by God because of his disobedience, Saul prostrated himself to Jehovah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/9:15:30-9:15:31" data-bid="21-1" class="b">1 Samuel 15:30, 31</a>) But it was mere outward show. Saul’s desire was, not to be obedient to God, but to be honored before the people. Later, when the Philistines were warring against Israel, Saul went through the formality of inquiring of Jehovah. However, when he received no answer, he consulted a spirit medium, though he knew that this was condemned by Jehovah. <span id="page10" class="pageNum" data-no="10" data-before-text="10"></span>(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/5:18:10-5:18:12" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 18:10-12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/9:28:6-9:28:7" data-bid="22-2" class="b"> 1 Samuel 28:6, 7</a>) Summing up the matter, <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/13:10:14-13:10:14" data-bid="23-1" class="b">1 Chronicles 10:14</a> says of Saul: “He did not inquire of Jehovah.” Why? Because Saul’s prayers were not grounded in faith. Hence, it was as if he had not prayed at all.</p>
<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu"> 9. What was wrong with Zedekiah’s plea for Jehovah’s direction?</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><sup>9 </sup>Similarly, as the end of the kingdom of Judah approached, more prayers were offered and Jehovah’s prophets were consulted. However, the people were mixing idolatry with professed reverence for Jehovah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/36:1:4-36:1:6" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Zephaniah 1:4-6</a>) Though they went through the motions of inquiring of God, they did not prepare their hearts to submit to his will. King Zedekiah pleaded with Jeremiah to inquire of Jehovah for him. Jehovah had already told the king what he ought to do. But lacking faith and yielding to the fear of men, the king did not obey the voice of Jehovah, and Jehovah gave him no other reply that would be more to the king’s liking.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/24:21:1-24:21:12" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Jeremiah 21:1-12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/24:38:14-24:38:19" data-bid="25-2" class="b"> 38:14-19</a>.</p>

<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><sup>10 </sup>After Jerusalem had been destroyed and the Babylonian army had departed with the Jewish exiles, Johanan prepared to take into Egypt the small group of Jews that remained in Judah. Their plans were made, but before leaving they asked Jeremiah to pray in their behalf and seek direction from Jehovah. However, when they did not get the answer they wanted, they went right ahead and did what they had planned. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/24:41:16-24:43:7" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Jeremiah 41:16–43:7</a>) Do you see in these events lessons that can benefit you so that when you seek Jehovah’s face, he will let himself be found by you?</p>

<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><sup>11 </sup>True worship involves more than symbolizing our dedication by water immersion, attending congregation meetings, and sharing in the public ministry. Our entire way of life is involved. Daily we are subjected to pressures<wbr />—some subtle, some more obvious—<wbr />that could turn us away from the path that is in accord with godly devotion. How will we react to these? When writing to faithful Christians in Ephesus, the apostle Paul urged them: “Keep on making sure of what is acceptable to the Lord.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/49:5:10-49:5:10" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Ephesians 5:10</a>) The wisdom of doing that is illustrated by many situations reported in the Scriptures.</p>
<p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu">12. Why was Jehovah displeased when David had the ark of the covenant moved to Jerusalem?</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><sup>12 </sup>After the ark of the covenant had been returned to Israel and had been kept for many years at Kiriath-jearim, King David desired to transfer it to Jerusalem. He consulted with chiefs of the people and said that the Ark would be moved ‘if it seemed good to them and it was acceptable with Jehovah.’ But he neglected to search adequately to ascertain Jehovah’s will on the matter. If he had done so, the Ark would never have been loaded onto a wagon. It would have been carried by Kohathite Levites on their shoulders, <span id="page11" class="pageNum" data-no="11" data-before-text="11"></span>as God had clearly instructed. Though David frequently inquired of Jehovah, he failed to do so in a proper way on this occasion. The result was disastrous. David later acknowledged: “Jehovah our God broke through against us, for we did not search after him according to the custom.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/13:13:1-13:13:3" data-bid="28-1" class="b">1 Chronicles 13:1-3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/13:15:11-13:15:13" data-bid="28-2" class="b"> 15:11-13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/4:4:4-4:4:6" data-bid="28-3" class="b"> Numbers 4:4-6,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/4:4:15-4:4:15" data-bid="28-4" class="b"> 15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/4:7:1-4:7:9" data-bid="28-5" class="b"> 7:1-9</a>.</p>

<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><sup>13 </sup>When the Ark was finally transported by the Levites from the house of Obed-edom to Jerusalem, a song composed by David was sung. It included the heartfelt reminder: “Search after Jehovah and his strength, seek his face constantly. Remember his wonderful acts that he has performed, his miracles and the judicial decisions of his mouth.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/13:16:11-13:16:12" data-bid="29-1" class="b">1 Chronicles 16:11, 12</a>.</p>

<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><sup>14 </sup>Before his death, David counseled his son Solomon: “If you search for [Jehovah], he will let himself be found by you.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/13:28:9-13:28:9" data-bid="30-1" class="b">1 Chronicles 28:9</a>) Upon taking the throne, Solomon went to Gibeon, where the tent of meeting was located, and sacrificed to Jehovah. There Jehovah invited Solomon: “Ask! What shall I give you?” In response to Solomon’s request, Jehovah freely gave him wisdom and knowledge to judge Israel, and to that He added riches and honor. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/14:1:3-14:1:12" data-bid="31-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 1:3-12</a>) Using the architectural plan provided by Jehovah to David, Solomon built a magnificent temple. But in the matter of his own marital affairs, Solomon failed to search for Jehovah. Solomon married women who were not worshipers of Jehovah. In his later years, they inclined his heart away from Jehovah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/11:11:1-11:11:10" data-bid="32-1" class="b">1 Kings 11:1-10</a>) No matter how prominent, wise, or knowledgeable we may seem to be, it is important to “keep on making sure of what is acceptable to the Lord”!</p>
<p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="qu">15. When Zerah the Ethiopian came against Judah, why could Asa pray with confidence that Jehovah would deliver Judah?</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><sup>15 </sup>The need for this is reinforced by the record of the kingship of Asa, a great-grandson of Solomon. Eleven years after Asa became king, Zerah the Ethiopian led a million-man army against Judah. Would Jehovah deliver Judah? Over 500 years earlier, Jehovah had clearly stated what his people could expect if they listened to him and kept his commandments and what they could expect if they did not. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/5:28:1-5:28:1" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 28:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/5:28:7-5:28:7" data-bid="33-2" class="b"> 7,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/5:28:15-5:28:15" data-bid="33-3" class="b"> 15,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/5:28:25-5:28:25" data-bid="33-4" class="b"> 25</a>) At the beginning of his reign, Asa had removed from his realm altars and pillars used in false worship. He had urged the people “to search for Jehovah.” Asa had not waited until faced with calamity before doing that. So with faith in Jehovah, Asa could pray to him to act in their behalf. The outcome? Judah was given a resounding victory.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/14:14:2-14:14:12" data-bid="34-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 14:2-12</a>.</p>

<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><sup>16 </sup>Nevertheless, when Asa returned victorious, Jehovah sent Azariah to meet the king and to say: “Hear me, O Asa and all Judah and Benjamin! Jehovah is with you as long as you prove to be with him; and if you search for him, he will let himself be found by you, but if you leave him he will leave you.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/14:15:2-14:15:2" data-bid="35-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 15:2</a>) With renewed zeal, Asa promoted true worship. But some years later, when again faced with war, Asa failed to search for Jehovah. He did not consult God’s Word, and he did not call to mind what Jehovah had done when the Ethiopian army had invaded Judah. Foolishly he made an alliance with Syria.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/14:16:1-14:16:6" data-bid="36-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 16:1-6</a>.</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><sup>17 </sup>For this, Jehovah caused Hanani the seer to reprove Asa. Even at that point, when Jehovah’s view of the matter was explained, Asa could have benefited. Instead, <span id="page12" class="pageNum" data-no="12" data-before-text="12"></span>he became offended and put Hanani in the house of the stocks. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/14:16:7-14:16:10" data-bid="37-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 16:7-10</a>) How sad! What about us? Do we search for God but then refuse to accept counsel?

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">“LET your conscience be your guide” is often-heard advice. But for our conscience to be a reliable guide, it needs to be properly educated in right and wrong, and we must be sensitive to its leading.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Consider the experience of a man named Zacchaeus, as recorded in the Bible. Zacchaeus, who lived in Jericho, was a chief tax collector and a rich man. By his own admission, he had acquired his wealth by means of extortion<wbr />—a practice that certainly hurt others. Did Zacchaeus’ conscience trouble him over his unrighteous actions? If it did, he had evidently been ignoring it.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:19:1-42:19:7" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Luke 19:1-7</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">A situation arose, however, that caused Zacchaeus to reconsider his course. Jesus came to Jericho. Short-statured Zacchaeus wanted to get a look at him, but he could not see him because of the crowd. So he ran ahead and climbed a tree for a better view. Impressed by Zacchaeus’ intense interest, Jesus told him that he would visit him in his home. Zacchaeus gladly extended hospitality to his distinguished guest.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">What Zacchaeus saw and heard while in association with Jesus touched his heart and moved him to change his ways. He announced: “Look! The half of my belongings, Lord, I am giving to the poor, and whatever I extorted from anyone by false accusation I am restoring fourfold.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:19:8-42:19:8" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Luke 19:8</a>.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Zacchaeus’ conscience had been enlightened, and he listened and responded to it. The good results were far-reaching. Imagine how Zacchaeus felt when Jesus told him: “This day salvation has come to this house!”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:19:9-42:19:9" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Luke 19:9</a>.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">What an encouraging example! It shows that whatever course we have previously pursued, we can change. Like Zacchaeus, we can heed Jesus’ words<wbr />—recorded in the Bible—<wbr />and develop our sense of right and wrong. Then we can, as the apostle Peter urged, “hold a good conscience.” We can listen to our trained conscience and do what is right.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/60:3:16-60:3:16" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 Peter 3:16</a>.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sa">BY <em>AWAKE! </em>WRITER IN MEXICO</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">THE neighborhood children are having a fiesta. We can hear their excited voices crying out: “<em>Dale! Dale! Dale!” </em>(Hit it! Hit it! Hit it!) We peer over into the patio and observe a gaily decorated papier-mâché burro suspended between two trees. A blindfolded child is striking out at the burro with a stick, attempting to break it. The guests are shouting encouragement. At last, the burro bursts open, and candy, fruit, and toys spill out. Amid much laughter, all scramble to pick up the treats. It looks like fun. We are told that the burro is called a piñata and that breaking a piñata at fiestas is a tradition here in Mexico and some other Latin-American countries.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">We wonder why the piñata is so popular. What is its origin? Does breaking the piñata have any special significance? We decided to investigate.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="ss"><strong>The Origin of the Piñata</strong></p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">A widespread opinion is that the Chinese may have been the first to use something like a piñata as part of their New Year’s celebration, which also marked the beginning of spring. They made figures of cows, oxen, and buffalo, covering them with colored paper and filling them with five kinds of seeds. Colored sticks were used to break the figures open. The decorative paper that covered the figures was burned and the ashes gathered and kept for good luck during the coming year.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">It is thought that in the 13th century, Venetian traveler Marco Polo took the “piñata” back with him from China to Italy. There, it acquired its present name from the Italian word <em>pignatta, </em>or fragile pot, and came to be filled with trinkets, jewelry, or candy instead of seeds. The tradition then spread to Spain. Breaking the piñata became a custom on the first Sunday of Lent.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> It seems that at the beginning of the 16th century, Spanish missionaries brought the piñata to Mexico.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">However, the missionaries may have been surprised (as we were) to find that the native people of Mexico already had a similar tradition. The Aztecs celebrated the birthday of Huitzilopochtli, their god of the sun and war, by placing a clay pot on a pole in his temple at the end of the year. The pot was adorned with colorful feathers and filled with tiny treasures. It was then broken with a stick, and the treasures that spilled out became an offering to the god’s image. The Maya also <span id="page23" class="pageNum" data-no="23" data-before-text="23"></span>played a game in which blindfolded participants hit a clay pot suspended by a string.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">As part of their strategy to evangelize the Indians, the Spanish missionaries ingeniously made use of the piñata to symbolize, among other things, the Christian’s struggle to conquer the Devil and sin. The traditional piñata was a clay pot covered with colored paper and given a star shape with seven tasseled points. These points were said to represent the seven deadly sins: greed, gluttony, sloth, pride, envy, wrath, and lust. Striking the piñata while blindfolded represented blind faith and willpower overcoming temptation or evil. The treats inside the piñata were the reward.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="ss"><strong>The Piñata Today</strong></p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Later, the piñata became part of the festivities of the posadas<span data-fnid="2" class="fn">b<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="2"></span></span> during the Christmas season and continues as such to this day. (A star-shaped piñata is used to represent the star that guided the astrologers to Bethlehem.) Breaking the piñata is also considered indispensable at birthday parties. Indeed, piñatas have become so traditionally Mexican that Mexico even exports them to other countries.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">We found that for many people in Mexico, the piñata has lost its religious <span id="page24" class="pageNum" data-no="24" data-before-text="24"></span>significance and is considered by most to be just harmless fun. In fact, piñatas are used in Mexico on many festive occasions, not just for the posadas or for birthdays. And piñatas can be purchased in many forms other than the traditional star shape. They are sometimes made to resemble animals, flowers, clowns.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">When considering whether to include a piñata at a social gathering, Christians should be sensitive to the consciences of others. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:10:31-46:10:33" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 10:31-33</a>) A main concern is, not what the practice meant hundreds of years ago, but how it is viewed today in your area. Understandably, opinions may vary from one place to another. Hence, it is wise to avoid turning such matters into big issues. The Bible says: “Let each one keep seeking, not his own advantage, but that of the other person.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:10:24-46:10:24" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 10:24</a>.</p>

“Keep Doing Good”
“I want you to know that your efforts and hard work have not gone unnoticed by persons who take an interest in the appearance of our Town and how it looks to travellers passing through. Your property displays the pride you take in your surroundings and the Town itself.”
These words of praise were from the mayor of the town of Halton Hills, where the branch office of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Canada is located. Thereafter, the mayor presented the branch with a plaque, expressing “appreciation of [its] efforts and dedication to promote and enhance the quality of life of all residents of Halton Hills.”
Such commendation from government authorities attests to the truthfulness of Romans 13:3, which says: “Keep doing good, and you will have praise from it.” Rightfully, though, all praise and honor go to the Sovereign of the universe, Jehovah.

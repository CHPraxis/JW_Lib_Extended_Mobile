“It Is a Must-Read”
That is how one reader from California, U.S.A., described the book Draw Close to Jehovah. “It is well written, beautifully illustrated, and packed with many spiritual gems,” he stated. He then concluded by saying: “Thank you so much for this wonderful book about our magnificent God.”
Others have made similar comments, such as: “Now that I’ve read through it, I’m actually a little sad that I’m finished. But I look forward to going through it again—this time studying it carefully and meditating deeply on the contents.”
Another person wrote: “The information about our God’s compassion and his readiness to forgive touched the depths of my heart and made me feel truly close to our heavenly Father and Life-Giver.”
We believe that you will draw closer to our heavenly Father, Jehovah, by reading this book. It is divided into four sections entitled “Vigorous in Power,” “A Lover of Justice,” “Wise in Heart,” and “God Is Love.” Three introductory chapters lead into these sections, which concentrate on the principal attributes of God. The chapter “Draw Close to God, and He Will Draw Close to You” concludes this 31-chapter book.

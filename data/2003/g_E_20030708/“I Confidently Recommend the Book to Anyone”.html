<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">He wrote: “Denmark has many taboos. I am going to violate one of them today. It is not <em>comme-il-faut </em>[proper] to say nice things about Jehovah’s Witnesses. That is just what I am going to do now.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">“For the last many, many years, a neatly dressed married couple have been making monthly visits at my door to give me the <em>Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>magazines. I have long ago explained that I am not going to be converted to anything but that I find their magazines extremely informative and interesting<wbr />—if you disregard the preaching bits. I have read a number of fascinating articles in those magazines, and a circulation of [21 million] does command a certain respect.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">“The other day the handsome couple gave me this book [<em>Mankind’s Search for God</em>], without any charge. . . . I read the book from the front to the back cover. I also checked most of the references, and there are many!</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">“It is the best, most factual and neutral history of religion I have ever read.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">“I confidently recommend the book to anyone. Of course, there is also something about the faith of Jehovah’s Witnesses, but that is only a minute part of this brilliant history of religion.”</p>

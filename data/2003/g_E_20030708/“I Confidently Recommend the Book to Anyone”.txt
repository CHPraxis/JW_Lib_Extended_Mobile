“I Confidently Recommend the Book to Anyone”
Which book was indicated by the well-known Danish author Erik Haaest, quoted above?
Mankind’s Search for God
He wrote: “Denmark has many taboos. I am going to violate one of them today. It is not comme-il-faut [proper] to say nice things about Jehovah’s Witnesses. That is just what I am going to do now.
“For the last many, many years, a neatly dressed married couple have been making monthly visits at my door to give me the Watchtower and Awake! magazines. I have long ago explained that I am not going to be converted to anything but that I find their magazines extremely informative and interesting—if you disregard the preaching bits. I have read a number of fascinating articles in those magazines, and a circulation of [21 million] does command a certain respect.
“The other day the handsome couple gave me this book [Mankind’s Search for God], without any charge. . . . I read the book from the front to the back cover. I also checked most of the references, and there are many!
“It is the best, most factual and neutral history of religion I have ever read.
“I confidently recommend the book to anyone. Of course, there is also something about the faith of Jehovah’s Witnesses, but that is only a minute part of this brilliant history of religion.”

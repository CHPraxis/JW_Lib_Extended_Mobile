Choose Life Eternal
PEOPLE have never before had such a wide array of choices. For example, the clothes we wear, the food we eat, and where we work and live are often a matter of choice. In many parts of the world, choosing one’s mate is also the norm. The Bible, however, presents a choice that surpasses all other choices​—one that is open to all humankind.
The Bible says: “The one firmly standing for righteousness is in line for life, but the one chasing after what is bad is in line for his own death.” (Proverbs 11:19) And Jesus Christ declared: “This means everlasting life, their taking in knowledge of you, the only true God, and of the one whom you sent forth, Jesus Christ.”​—John 17:3.
Yes, our Creator has extended to us the opportunity to choose a course that can lead to life everlasting! What must we do to gain eternal life?
According to the Bible, “in the path of righteousness there is life.” (Proverbs 12:28) We can be among the righteous who are on the path to life everlasting. How? By making sure that our lives conform to God’s will and his commands. (Matthew 7:13, 14) May we therefore make the right choice and receive God’s gift of everlasting life.​—Romans 6:23.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">PEOPLE have never before had such a wide array of choices. For example, the clothes we wear, the food we eat, and where we work and live are often a matter of choice. In many parts of the world, choosing one’s mate is also the norm. The Bible, however, presents a choice that surpasses all other choices​—one that is open to all humankind.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The Bible says: “The one firmly standing for righteousness is in line for life, but the one chasing after what is bad is in line for his own death.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:11:19-20:11:19" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Proverbs 11:19</a>) And Jesus Christ declared: “This means everlasting life, their taking in knowledge of you, the only true God, and of the one whom you sent forth, Jesus Christ.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:3-43:17:3" data-bid="2-1" class="b">John 17:3</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Yes, our Creator has extended to us the opportunity to choose a course that can lead to life everlasting! What must we do to gain eternal life?</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">According to the Bible, “in the path of righteousness there is life.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:12:28-20:12:28" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Proverbs 12:28</a>) We can be among the righteous who are on the path to life everlasting. How? By making sure that our lives conform to God’s will and his commands. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:7:13-40:7:14" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Matthew 7:13, 14</a>) May we therefore make the right choice and receive God’s gift of everlasting life.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:6:23-45:6:23" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Romans 6:23</a>.</p>

<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu">1, 2. Why should we be interested in what Christ said to seven congregations in Asia Minor?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb">JEHOVAH’S only-begotten Son, Jesus Christ, is the Head of the Christian congregation. To keep the congregation of his anointed followers unblemished, Christ exercises his headship by commending and correcting them. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:5:21-49:5:27" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ephesians 5:21-27</a>) There are examples of this in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:2:1-66:2:29" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Revelation chapters 2 and</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:3:1-66:3:22" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 3</a>, where we find Jesus’ powerful and loving messages directed to seven congregations in Asia Minor.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>Before he heard Jesus’ words to the seven congregations, the apostle John was granted a vision of “the Lord’s day.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:1:10-66:1:10" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Revelation 1:10</a>) That “day” began when the Messianic Kingdom was established in 1914. What Christ said to the congregations is therefore vitally important in these last days. His encouragement and counsel help us to deal with these critical times.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:1-55:3:5" data-bid="5-1" class="b">2 Timothy 3:1-5</a>.</p>
<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu"> 3. What are the figurative meanings of the “stars,” “angels,” and “golden lampstands” that the apostle John beheld?</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>John beheld the glorified Jesus Christ, who “holds the seven stars in his right hand” and who “walks in the midst of the seven golden lampstands,” or congregations. The “stars” are “the angels of the seven congregations.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:1:20-66:1:20" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Revelation 1:20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:2:1-66:2:1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 2:1</a>) Stars sometimes symbolize angelic spirit creatures, but Christ would not use a man to record messages for spirit creatures. Hence, these “stars” logically denote spirit-anointed overseers, or bodies of elders. The term “angels” relates to their role as messengers. Because God’s organization has grown, “the faithful steward” has also appointed qualified men of Jesus’ “other sheep” as overseers.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:12:42-42:12:44" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Luke 12:42-44;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:10:16-43:10:16" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> John 10:16</a>.</p>
<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu"> 4. How do elders benefit from paying attention to what Christ says to the congregations?</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>The “stars” are in Jesus’ right hand​—within his power, control, favor, and protection. Therefore, they are accountable to him. By heeding his words to each of the seven congregations, present-day elders see how they can handle similar situations. Of course, all Christians need to listen to God’s Son. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:9:7-41:9:7" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Mark 9:7</a>) So, what can we learn by paying attention as Christ speaks to the congregations?</p>

<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu"> 5. What kind of city was Ephesus?</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>Jesus commended and reproved the congregation in Ephesus. (Read <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:2:1-66:2:7" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Revelation 2:1-7</a>.) The massive temple of the goddess Artemis stood in this wealthy commercial and religious center on the west coast of Asia Minor. Although Ephesus was filled with immorality, false religion, and the practice of magic, God blessed the ministry of the apostle Paul and others in that city.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:19:1-44:19:41" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Acts, chapter 19</a>.</p>

<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup>Christ commended the congregation in Ephesus, saying: “I know your deeds, and your labor and endurance, and that you cannot bear bad men, and that you put those to the test who say they are apostles, but they are not, and you found them liars.” Today, congregations of Jesus’ true followers have a similar record of good deeds, hard work, and endurance. They do not put up with false brothers who want to be viewed as apostles. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:11:13-47:11:13" data-bid="11-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 11:13,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:11:26-47:11:26" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 26</a>) Like the Ephesians, loyal Christians today “cannot bear bad men.” To maintain the purity of Jehovah’s worship and to protect the congregation, therefore, they do not extend the hand of fellowship to unrepentant apostates.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:2:4-48:2:5" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Galatians 2:4, 5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/63:1:8-63:1:11" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> 2 John 8-11</a>.</p>
<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu">7, 8. What serious problem existed in the congregation in Ephesus, and how might we deal with a similar situation?</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><sup>7 </sup>Yet, Christians in Ephesus had a serious problem. “I hold this against you,” said Jesus, “that you have left the love you had at first.” Members of the congregation needed to rekindle their first love for Jehovah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:12:28-41:12:30" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Mark 12:28-30;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:2:4-49:2:4" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> Ephesians 2:4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:5:1-49:5:2" data-bid="13-3" class="b"> 5:1, 2</a>) We ourselves must guard against losing our first love for God. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/64:1:3-64:1:3" data-bid="14-1" class="b">3 John 3</a>) But what if such things as a desire for material riches or the pursuit of pleasure are becoming paramount in our lives? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:4:8-54:4:8" data-bid="15-1" class="b">1 Timothy 4:8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:6:9-54:6:10" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> 6:9, 10</a>) Then we should fervently pray for divine help to replace such inclinations with deep-seated love for Jehovah and gratitude for all that he and his Son have done for us.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:4:10-62:4:10" data-bid="16-1" class="b">1 John 4:10,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:4:16-62:4:16" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> 16</a>.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><sup>8 </sup>Christ urged the Ephesians: “Remember from what you have fallen, and repent and do the former deeds.” What if they did not do this? “If you do not,” said Jesus, “I am coming to you, and I will remove your lampstand from its place.” If all the sheep were to lose their first love, the “lampstand,” or congregation, would no longer exist. As zealous Christians, may we therefore work hard to keep the congregation shining spiritually.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:5:14-40:5:16" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Matthew 5:14-16</a>.</p>
<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu"> 9. How should sectarianism be viewed?</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><sup>9 </sup>To their credit, the Ephesians hated “the deeds of the sect of Nicolaus.” Aside from what is said in Revelation, nothing definite is known about the origin, teachings, and practices of this sect. Since Jesus condemned the following of men, however, we need to keep on hating sectarianism, as did the Christians in Ephesus.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:23:10-40:23:10" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Matthew 23:10</a>.</p>
<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu">10. What will be the experience of those who heed what the spirit says?</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><sup>10 </sup>“Let the one who has an ear hear what the spirit says to the congregations,” said Christ. When on earth, Jesus spoke under the influence of God’s spirit.

Under the spirit’s direction, Jesus promised: “To him that conquers I will grant to eat of the tree of life, which is in the paradise of God.” For anointed ones, who heed what the spirit says, this means immortality in the heavenly “paradise of God,” or Jehovah’s very presence. The “great crowd,” who also listen to what the spirit says, will enjoy an earthly paradise where they will drink from “a river of water of life” and will find healing from “the leaves of the trees” alongside it.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:7:9-66:7:9" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Revelation 7:9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:22:1-66:22:2" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> 22:1, 2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:23:43-42:23:43" data-bid="20-3" class="b"> Luke 23:43</a>.</p>

Let us individually promote love for Jehovah by talking about his loving ways. We can express our gratitude for the love God showed in providing the ransom by means of his dear Son.

<p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu">12. What does history reveal regarding Smyrna and religious practices there?</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><sup>12 </sup>The congregation in Smyrna was commended by Christ, “‘the First and the Last,’ who became dead and came to life again” by a resurrection. (Read <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:2:8-66:2:11" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Revelation 2:8-11</a>.) Smyrna (now Izmir, Turkey) was built on the west coast of Asia Minor. Greeks settled the city, but the Lydians destroyed it in about 580 B.C.E. Successors of Alexander the Great rebuilt Smyrna on a new site. It became part of the Roman province of Asia and was a thriving commercial center noted for fine public buildings. Its temple of Tiberius Caesar made it a center of emperor worship. Worshipers had to burn a pinch of incense and say “Caesar is Lord.” Christians could not comply because to them “Jesus is Lord.” Hence, they suffered tribulation.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:10:9-45:10:9" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Romans 10:9</a>.</p>
<p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu">13. Although poor materially, in what sense were Christians in Smyrna rich?</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><sup>13 </sup>Besides tribulation, Christians in Smyrna endured poverty, possibly suffering economic sanctions because they would not engage in emperor worship. Jehovah’s present-day servants are not immune from similar trials. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:13:16-66:13:17" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Revelation 13:16, 17</a>) Though materially poor, those who are like Christians in Smyrna are spiritually rich, and that is what really matters!​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:10:22-20:10:22" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Proverbs 10:22;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/64:1:2-64:1:2" data-bid="26-2" class="b"> 3 John 2</a>.</p>

<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><sup>14 </sup>Most Jews in Smyrna were “a synagogue of Satan” because they held to unscriptural traditions, rejected God’s Son, and blasphemed his spirit-begotten followers. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:2:28-45:2:29" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Romans 2:28, 29</a>) But what comfort anointed ones can draw from Christ’s next words! He says: “Do not be afraid of the things you are about to suffer. Look! The Devil will keep on throwing some of you into prison that you may be fully put to the test, and that you may have tribulation ten days. Prove yourself faithful even to death, and I will give you the crown of life.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:2:10-66:2:10" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Revelation 2:10</a>.</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><sup>15 </sup>Jesus was not afraid to die for upholding Jehovah’s sovereignty. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:2:5-50:2:8" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Philippians 2:5-8</a>) Although Satan is now waging war upon the anointed remnant, they do not fear the <span id="page13" class="pageNum" data-no="13" data-before-text="13"></span>things they must suffer as a group​—tribulation, imprisonment, or violent death. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:12:17-66:12:17" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Revelation 12:17</a>) They will be world conquerors.

Then let us help fellow believers to focus on the main reason why God permits persecution​—the issue of universal sovereignty.

<p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><sup>17 </sup>Both commendation and correction were given to the congregation in Pergamum. (Read <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:2:12-66:2:17" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Revelation 2:12-17</a>.) Situated about 50 miles <strong>[80 km] </strong>north of Smyrna, Pergamum was a city steeped in pagan religion. Chaldean magi (astrologers) seem to have fled there from Babylon. Sick people flocked to Pergamum’s renowned temple of Asclepius, the false god of healing and medicine. Pergamum, with its temple devoted to the worship of Caesar Augustus, has been called “the chief centre of the imperial cult under the early empire.”​—<em>Encyclopædia Britannica, </em>1959, Volume 17, page 507.</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><sup>18 </sup>In Pergamum there was an altar dedicated to Zeus. The city was also a seat of Devil-inspired deification of men. No wonder the congregation there was said to be dwelling where “the throne of Satan” was! Refusing to worship the emperor could result in death for an upholder of Jehovah’s sovereignty. The world is still lying in the Devil’s power, and national symbols are now being idolized. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:5:19-62:5:19" data-bid="34-1" class="b">1 John 5:19</a>) From the first century to the present day, many faithful Christians have been martyred, like the one Christ called “Antipas, my witness, the faithful one, who was killed by your side.” Jehovah God and Jesus Christ certainly remember such loyal servants.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:5:21-62:5:21" data-bid="35-1" class="b">1 John 5:21</a>.</p>

<p id="p28" data-pid="28" data-rel-pid="[54]" class="sb"><sup>23 </sup>A black pebble brought condemnation in Roman courts, whereas a white one meant acquittal. Jesus’ giving “a white pebble” to conquering anointed Christians indicates that he adjudges them innocent, pure, and clean. Since the Romans also used pebbles to gain entry to important events, the “white pebble” may denote the anointed one’s being admitted to a place in heaven at the marriage of the Lamb. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:19:7-66:19:9" data-bid="42-1" class="b">Revelation 19:7-9</a>) The “new name” evidently signifies the privilege of being united with Jesus as joint-heirs in the heavenly Kingdom.

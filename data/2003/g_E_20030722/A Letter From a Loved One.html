<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A reader from New York compared the book <em>Draw Close to Jehovah </em>to a letter from a loved one, explaining: “Each chapter just stirs the heart and fills you with love for Jehovah.” She added: “Now that I have reached the end of the book, I can’t wait to start reading through it again, the way you would a letter from someone you dearly love.” Consider what others have had to say.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A reader in Kansas observed: “I can really feel myself drawing closer to my heavenly Father. My heart just swells with love . . . I look forward to reading more each morning, and I will read it over again many times.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">A woman from Maine wrote: “It has done so much to increase the reality of the person of Jehovah! What a comfort the statement on page 74 is: ‘For those who die, there is no safer place to be than in God’s memory.’” A writer in Alaska concurs: “It touched me so deeply that tears flowed.” She added: “I will certainly read and refer to it over and over.”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">We believe that you will feel similarly if you read this book. Following its three introductory chapters, the book is divided into four sections entitled “Vigorous in Power,” “A Lover of Justice,” “Wise in Heart,” and “God Is Love.” It concludes with the chapter “Draw Close to God, and He Will Draw Close to You.”</p>

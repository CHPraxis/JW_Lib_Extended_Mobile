<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">To religious people the very idea of giving God glory might sound puzzling. Is not God the Preeminent Sovereign of the universe? How, then, can a mere human glorify him? Such a thing is possible, for the Bible exhorts us to “fear God and give him glory.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:14:7-66:14:7" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Revelation 14:7</a>) One way we can do this is by “hearing the word of God and keeping it.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:11:28-42:11:28" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Luke 11:28</a>) Indeed, by studying the Bible and living by its principles, we bring honor and glory to its Author, Jehovah God.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">But who today are giving God glory in this way? Billions claim to be religious, but is this all that is required? How can we be certain that our form of worship is pleasing to God and thus bringing him glory? These questions will be answered in the stirring talk “Who Are Giving God Glory Today?” This public address will be delivered at the district conventions of Jehovah’s Witnesses beginning this month. Hundreds of such conventions will be held around the world. To find the location nearest you, contact Jehovah’s Witnesses in your area, or write to the publishers of this magazine. The March 1, 2003, issue of our companion magazine, <em>The Watchtower, </em>lists convention locations in the United States, Canada, Britain, and Ireland.</p>

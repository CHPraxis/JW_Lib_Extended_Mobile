<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">▪ What is special about Baldwin Street, located in Dunedin, New Zealand? Dunedin has long claimed that this street is the steepest street in the world. Although this claim has been challenged, one thing is certain: Baldwin Street is unusually steep.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">This well-known street has become a popular tourist destination for visitors from around the world. No, you do not have to be a mountaineer to reach its top. You can go up this 1,180-foot <strong>[359 m] </strong>street on foot, but motorists are discouraged from trying to drive up it.</p>

<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The day is bright as my two companions and I scan the full length stretching upward before us. Once into our journey, we are soon breathing deeply while leaning forward to keep our balance. “It’s like climbing a concrete wall,” someone gasps. A bench appears just at the right time and beckons us to take a rest.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Our ascent continues, and soon we are at the top surveying the panorama, while catching our breath. Below us are neat rows of well-kept homes and gardens. The horizon extends to include dark-green native bush bordering lush pastures<wbr />—all of this set against a background of blue sky.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Our walk to the top has not broken any speed records. After completing the descent, we stop to take a picture of our conquest and to claim our copy of the city’s Certificate of Achievement saying that we climbed the “World’s Steepest Street.”<wbr />—<em>Contributed.</em></p>

Comfort at the Right Time
Many people are in need of comfort in these critical times, particularly when faced with the loss of a loved one. One woman suffered the deaths of her mother and her unborn baby in close succession. She wrote to the branch office of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Mexico: “My greatest comfort was receiving the brochure When Someone You Love Dies. This was very valuable information that came at the right moment. Thank you for your Christian love and diligence in providing Bible publications such as this.”
She was particularly comforted by scriptures quoted in the brochure. For example, 1 Corinthians 15:26 states: “As the last enemy, death is to be brought to nothing.” Perhaps you or someone you know will also receive comfort from reading this 32-page brochure. When Someone You Love Dies considers such topics as “How Can I Live With My Grief?,” “How Can Others Help?,” and “A Sure Hope for the Dead.”

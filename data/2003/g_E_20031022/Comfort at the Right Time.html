<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Many people are in need of comfort in these critical times, particularly when faced with the loss of a loved one. One woman suffered the deaths of her mother and her unborn baby in close succession. She wrote to the branch office of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Mexico: “My greatest comfort was receiving the brochure <em>When Someone You Love Dies. </em>This was very valuable information that came at the right moment. Thank you for your Christian love and diligence in providing Bible publications such as this.”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">She was particularly comforted by scriptures quoted in the brochure. For example, <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:15:26-46:15:26" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 15:26</a> states: “As the last enemy, death is to be brought to nothing.” Perhaps you or someone you know will also receive comfort from reading this 32-page brochure. <em>When Someone You Love Dies </em>considers such topics as “How Can I Live With My Grief?,” “How Can Others Help?,” and “A Sure Hope for the Dead.”</p>

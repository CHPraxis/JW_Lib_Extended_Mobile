“Jehovah Is My Solace”
THE words above are a translation of the official royal motto of King Charles IX of Sweden. In Latin it reads: “Iehovah solatium meum.” This king was one in a line of several generations of rulers in Sweden, from 1560 to 1697, who highlighted God’s name in Hebrew or Latin characters on coins, on medals, or in personal mottoes. Charles IX also instituted the Royal Order of Jehovah. On the day of his coronation in 1607, Charles wore a necklace called the Jehovah chain.
What led these monarchs to such practices? Scholars believe that the Calvinist movement in Europe at that time, coupled with respect for the Bible, influenced them. As well-educated Renaissance sovereigns, they were evidently familiar with the Latin version of God’s personal name, Jehovah. Some no doubt realized that the name appeared thousands of times in the original Hebrew Bible text.
It is well documented that in various parts of Europe during the 16th and 17th centuries, the name Jehovah often appeared on coins and medals as well as in public buildings and churches. God’s own statement, quoted at Exodus 3:15, was evidently commonly accepted and respected: “Jehovah . . . is my name to time indefinite.”

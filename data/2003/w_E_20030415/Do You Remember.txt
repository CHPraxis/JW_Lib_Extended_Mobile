Do You Remember?
Have you appreciated reading the recent issues of The Watchtower? Well, see if you can answer the following questions:
• How can we benefit from learning about the family of Shaphan?
Shaphan was a copyist and secretary for King Josiah of Judah. An influential man in the kingdom, Shaphan supported the king’s campaign to restore true worship. Two of Shaphan’s sons stood by the prophet Jeremiah. And another son and two grandsons likewise used their influence in behalf of true worship. Similarly, we should use our resources and influence to uphold true worship.​—12/15, pages 19-22.
• How has Irene Hochstenbach overcome a major handicap and been able to serve Jehovah?
When she was seven years old, she lost her hearing. Despite being deaf, she has learned to communicate with others and now travels with her husband (a traveling overseer) as he serves congregations in the Netherlands.​—1/1, pages 23-6.
• What two new study aids were released at the “Zealous Kingdom Proclaimers” District Conventions?
Christians around the globe rejoiced to receive Worship the Only True God, which is designed to be studied with new ones after they have completed their study of the book Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life; the other new book is Draw Close to Jehovah, which focuses on Jehovah’s qualities and dealings. It also shows how we can imitate him in displaying his qualities.​—1/15, pages 23-4.
• What is the sense of Proverbs 12:5: “The thoughts of the righteous ones are judgment”?
The very thoughts of good people are morally sound and directed toward what is fair and just. Since righteous ones are motivated by love for God and for fellow humans, their intentions are good.​—1/15, page 30.
• What can help a person to cultivate a balanced view of work?
It is useful to be trained from childhood to esteem work. The Bible urges us to have a good work ethic, avoiding laziness. (Proverbs 20:4) It also encourages Christians not to become preoccupied with work. We should recognize that service to God deserves a prominent place in our life. (1 Corinthians 7:29-31) Furthermore, true Christians are confident that God will not forsake them.​—2/1, pages 4-6.
• Where is an altar first mentioned in the Bible?
It is at Genesis 8:20, referring to the altar that Noah built when he left the ark after the Deluge. Likely, however, Cain and Abel used altars in making their offerings. (Genesis 4:3, 4)​—2/15, page 28.
• How can some Christians make good use of changed circumstances?
Some have accepted​—or initiated—​changes in their employment that have allowed them more time for the ministry. Others have increased their time and privileges in God’s service when their family responsibilities decreased, such as when their children became adults and married.​—3/1, pages 19-22.
• How do the examples of Jonah and the apostle Peter help us to see others as Jehovah sees them?
Both Jonah and Peter had well-known faults in their thinking and in how they responded to tests of faith and obedience. Still, Jehovah clearly saw good qualities in them and continued to use them in his service. When others offend or disappoint us, we can focus on their good qualities that we may have found attractive in the past and on the good that God sees in them.​—3/15, pages 16-19.
• Why do Bible translations differ in numbering the book of Psalms?
There is a difference in numbering between the book in the original Hebrew language and in its translation into Greek in the Septuagint. More recent translations may differ, depending on whether they were based on the Hebrew text or on the Septuagint.​—4/1, page 31.

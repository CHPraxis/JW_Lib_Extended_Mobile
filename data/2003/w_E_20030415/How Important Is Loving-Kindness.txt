How Important Is Loving-Kindness?
“THE desirable thing in earthling man is his loving-kindness,” states the Bible. (Proverbs 19:22) Indeed, acts of kindness motivated by love are truly desirable. The word “loving-kindness” in the Bible, however, refers to a kindness that may be based on an already existing relationship, such as one founded on a prior act of kindness on the part of another. Thus, it includes the thought of loyalty.
King Jehoash of Judah failed to develop this desirable quality. He owed a great debt of gratitude to his aunt and to Jehoiada, his uncle. When Jehoash was less than one year old, his wicked grandmother made herself queen and killed all of Jehoash’s brothers, who were heirs to the throne. She failed to kill little Jehoash, though, because his aunt and uncle had carefully hidden him. They also taught him God’s Law. When Jehoash was seven, his uncle used his authority as high priest to execute the wicked queen and to enthrone Jehoash.​—2 Chronicles 22:10–23:15.
Young Jehoash ruled as king in a fine manner until the death of his uncle, but then he turned to idol worship. God sent Zechariah, who was the son of Jehoiada, to warn Jehoash of his apostasy. Jehoash had Zechariah stoned. What a shocking act of disloyalty toward a family to whom he owed so much!​—2 Chronicles 24:17-21.
The Bible states: “Jehoash the king did not remember the loving-kindness that [Zechariah’s] father had exercised toward him, so that he killed his son.” At the point of dying, Zechariah said: “Let Jehovah see to it and ask it back.” True to Zechariah’s words, Jehoash became a very sick man and was murdered by his own servants.​—2 Chronicles 24:17-25.
Instead of ending up like King Jehoash, all who follow this advice will have a blessed future: “May loving-kindness and trueness themselves not leave you. . . . And so find favor . . . in the eyes of God and of earthling man.”​—Proverbs 3:3, 4.

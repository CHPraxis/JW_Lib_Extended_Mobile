Do You Remember?
Have you appreciated reading the recent issues of The Watchtower? Well, see if you can answer the following questions:
• How many chapters are there in the book of Micah, when was it written, and what was the situation at the time?
The book of Micah contains seven chapters. The prophet Micah wrote the book in the eighth century B.C.E., at which point God’s covenant people were divided into two nations​—Israel and Judah.​—8/15, page 9.
• According to Micah 6:8, what does God require of us?
We are “to exercise justice.” God’s way of doing things is the standard of justice, so we must uphold his principles of honesty and integrity. He tells us “to love kindness.” Christians have shown loving-kindness in responding to the needs of others, such as after disasters. For us “to be modest in walking with” Jehovah, we must recognize our limitations and depend on him.​—8/15, pages 20-2.
• If faced with the loss of a job, what might a Christian want to do?
It would be wise to reexamine one’s life-style. It might be possible to simplify one’s life by moving to a smaller dwelling or by eliminating unnecessary material possessions. Certainly, it is important to stop being anxious about daily needs, trusting that God can make it possible to keep us going. (Matthew 6:33, 34)​—9/1, pages 14-15.
• What should we remember when giving or receiving wedding gifts?
Costly gifts are not needed, nor should they be expected. The giver’s heart attitude is what is most precious. (Luke 21:1-4) It is not kind to announce the name of the giver of a present. To do that could be embarrassing. (Matthew 6:3)​—9/1, page 29.
• Why should we pray incessantly?
Regular prayer can help cement our relationship with God and equip us to face severe trials. Our prayers may be brief or lengthy, depending on the need and circumstances. Prayer builds faith and helps us to handle problems.​—9/15, pages 15-18.
• How should we understand 1 Corinthians 15:29, which in some versions is translated “baptized for the dead”?
The apostle Paul meant that anointed Christians are baptized, or immersed, into a course of life that will lead to a death of integrity like that of Christ. Afterward, they are resurrected to spirit life as Christ was.​—10/1, page 29.
• How do we know that becoming a Christian involves more than avoiding the wrongs mentioned at 1 Corinthians 6:9-11?
The apostle Paul did not stop at mentioning such wrongs as fornication, idolatry, and drunkenness. Showing that additional changes may be needed, he continued in the next verse: “All things are lawful for me; but not all things are advantageous.”​—10/15, pages 18-19.
• Who were some of the women of ancient times who made God’s heart rejoice?
They include the midwives Shiphrah and Puah, who would not obey Pharaoh and kill newborn Israelite males. (Exodus 1:15-20) The Canaanite prostitute Rahab protected two Israelite spies. (Joshua 2:1-13; 6:22, 23) Displaying sensibleness, Abigail helped to save lives and to protect David from bloodguilt. (1 Samuel 25:2-35) They are examples for women today.​—11/1, pages 8-11.
• How was it that “from heaven did the stars fight” against Sisera, as stated at Judges 5:20?
Some feel that this refers to divine assistance. Others point to angelic help, meteorite showers, or Sisera’s dependence on astrological predictions. Lacking Biblical details, we can take the statement as indicating some form of divine intervention in behalf of Israel’s army.​—11/15, page 30.
• With apathy and indifference to religion sweeping the globe, why do so many people still profess belief in God?
Some go to church seeking peace of mind. Others hope for eternal life after death, or for health, riches, and success. In some areas, people seek to fill a spiritual void that resulted as capitalistic aspirations displaced Communist ideology. Being aware of such reasons can help a Christian to initiate meaningful conversations.​—12/1, page 3.

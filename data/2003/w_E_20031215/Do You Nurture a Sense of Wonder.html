<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">HAVE you noted that Bible writers repeatedly evoke a sense of wonder when acknowledging the works and attributes of God? “I am wonderfully made,” declared the psalmist. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:139:14-19:139:14" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 139:14</a>) “O Jehovah,” wrote the prophet Isaiah, “you are my God. I exalt you, I laud your name, for you have done wonderful things.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:25:1-23:25:1" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Isaiah 25:1</a>) Or think of the wonderment and awe expressed in the apostle Paul’s words: “O the depth of God’s riches and wisdom and knowledge!”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:11:33-45:11:33" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Romans 11:33</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><em>The Oxford Encyclopedic English Dictionary </em>defines “wonder” as “an emotion excited by what is unexpected, unfamiliar, or inexplicable, esp. surprise mingled with admiration or curiosity etc.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Is it not a joy to observe little children exhibit wide-eyed wonder when they see, feel, or hear things new to them? Sadly, such wonder based on curiosity or novelty often diminishes with the passage of years.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">However, for the Bible writers just quoted, a feeling of awe ran deep. It was durable. Why so? They nurtured their sense of wonder by meditating appreciatively on the works of God. Prayed the psalmist: “I dwell upon the years long past, upon the memory of all that thou hast done; the wonders of thy creation fill my mind.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:143:5-19:143:5" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Psalm 143:5</a>, <em>The New English Bible.</em></p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">How commendable it is that this sense of wonder can be found among modern-day worshipers of God! Do you have it? Are you nurturing it?</p>

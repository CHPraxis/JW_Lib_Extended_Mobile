A Crime-Free World Ahead
IMAGINE, if you can, a world without criminals! There would be no need for police, prisons, or expensive and complicated criminal justice systems. It would be a world where each individual would respect the life and property of others. Does that seem too good to be true? You may think so, but this amazing change for the better is exactly what the Bible promises. Why not consider what the Scriptures foretell regarding crime and other evils on this earth?
In the book of Psalms, we read: “Do not show yourself heated up because of the evildoers. Do not be envious of those doing unrighteousness. For like grass they will speedily wither, and like green new grass they will fade away. But the meek ones themselves will possess the earth, and they will indeed find their exquisite delight in the abundance of peace.” (Psalm 37:1, 2, 11) Really, no one can prevent God from fulfilling this promise and all his other heartening promises.
God’s way to bring about these blessings is his Kingdom. In the Lord’s Prayer, Jesus Christ taught his followers to pray for this Kingdom to come and for God’s will to be done “as in heaven, also upon earth.” (Matthew 6:9, 10) Soon, under that Kingdom, no one on earth will be motivated to commit crime because of poverty, oppression, or selfishness. Instead, God’s Word states: “There will come to be plenty of grain on the earth; on the top of the mountains there will be an overflow.” (Psalm 72:16) Indeed, Jehovah God will provide everyone on earth with an endless supply of good things. More important, human society will be rooted in love for God and neighbor, and never again will the world be disturbed by crime.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">HISTORY is full of broken promises. Nations have often failed to keep solemnly signed nonaggression pacts, thus leading their people into terrible wars. Napoleon once observed: “Governments keep their promises only when they are forced to do so, or when it will be to their advantage.”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">What about promises made by individuals? How disappointing it is when a person does not keep his word! Especially is this so if he is someone you know and trust. Of course, people may be either unable or unwilling to fulfill their promises.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">What a difference there is between human and divine promises! God’s promises are completely reliable and trustworthy. Any promise made by Jehovah God is a guarantee. It is sure to be fulfilled. Referring to God’s unfailing word, <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:55:11-23:55:11" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Isaiah 55:11</a> states: “So my word that goes forth from my mouth will prove to be. It will not return to me without results, but it will certainly do that in which I have delighted, and it will have certain success in that for which I have sent it.”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">So, then, how should we view God’s promises recorded in the Bible? We certainly can rely on them. For instance, the apostle John wrote: “Look! The tent of God is with mankind, and he will reside with them, and they will be his peoples. And God himself will be with them. And he will wipe out every tear from their eyes, and death will be no more, neither will mourning nor outcry nor pain be anymore. The former things have passed away.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:3-66:21:4" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Revelation 21:3, 4</a>) You can enjoy such blessings if you act in harmony with Jesus’ words: “This means everlasting life, their taking in knowledge of you, the only true God, and of the one whom you sent forth, Jesus Christ.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:3-43:17:3" data-bid="3-1" class="b">John 17:3</a>.</p>

2003 Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses
Containing Report for the Service Year of 2002
“Draw Close to God, and He Will Draw Close to You.”​—James 4:8.
What a marvelous blessing it is to enjoy a warm relationship with the Sovereign of the universe! He is the Supreme One and has both the power and the desire to give us endless life in health and happiness. Our yeartext for 2003 assures us that Jehovah not only observes our efforts to please him but also responds with warm appreciation. How loving the God whom we worship is!

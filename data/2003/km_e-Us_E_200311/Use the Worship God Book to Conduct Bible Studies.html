<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">The book <em>Worship the Only True God </em>is designed to help newer ones advance in the truth and deepen their appreciation for Jehovah and his organization. It can be used with Bible students as the second study book. The <a class="xt" data-xtid="17" href="jwpub://p/E:202000207/1-10">June 2000 <em>Our Kingdom Ministry</em>, page 4</a>, explained: “If it is evident that a person is making progress, although slowly, and that he is developing appreciation for what he is learning, then continue the Bible study in a second book after the <em>Require </em>brochure and the <em>Knowledge </em>book are completed. . . . In all cases, the <em>Require </em>brochure and the <em>Knowledge </em>book would be studied first. The Bible study, return visits, and time spent to continue the study should be counted and reported, even if the student gets baptized before completing the second book.”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Who else can benefit from a Bible study in the <em>Worship God </em>book? That same article continues: “If you know of some who studied [the <em>Require </em>brochure and] the <em>Knowledge </em>book in the past but never progressed to dedication and baptism, you may want to take the initiative to see if they would like to resume their Bible study.” Let us make good use of the <em>Worship God </em>book to help others join us in serving the only true God.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">▪ Literature offer for <strong>November: </strong><em>What Does God Require of Us? </em>or <em>Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life. </em>If people already have these, <em>Worship the Only True God </em>or an older publication may be offered. <strong>December: </strong><em>The Greatest Man Who Ever Lived. </em>As an alternative offer, you may use <em>My Book of Bible Stories, The Bible​—God’s Word or Man’s?, </em>or <em>You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth. </em><strong>January: </strong>Any book published prior to 1988 that the congregation may have in stock. If you do not have any of these in stock, please check if nearby congregations have a surplus of older publications on hand that you can use. Congregations that do not have older books may offer <em>Mankind’s Search for God. </em><strong>February: </strong><em>Draw Close to Jehovah. </em>If this publication is not available, you may use <em>Life​—How Did It Get Here? By Evolution or by Creation? </em>or <em>Revelation​—Its Grand Climax At Hand! </em>as an alternative offer.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn">▪ The presiding overseer or someone designated by him should audit the congregation’s accounts on December 1 or as soon as possible thereafter. When this has been done, make an announcement to the congregation after the next accounts report is read.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn">▪ Congregations should begin requesting bound volumes of <em>The Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>for 2003 with their next literature request. A listing of the languages in which these items are available will appear in the “Announcement to All Congregations,” which is mailed to all congregations each month. Until the bound volumes are available and shipments are made, these will appear as “Pending” on congregation packing lists. Bound volumes are special-request items.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn">▪ The secretary of each congregation holding title to property should review paragraphs 42-4 in the form entitled “Information Regarding Ownership of Kingdom Halls” (T-36). Even after real-estate tax exemption has been obtained, an annual filing is required in some states. Check carefully with your local tax assessor’s office to confirm whether any action is required. All taxes and assessments are to be paid within the time provided. If any tax or assessment is questioned, promptly follow through on the matter so that either it is removed or a proper challenge is filed within the applicable time limit.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn">▪ Donations made by check and put in the local Kingdom Hall contribution boxes for the worldwide work and the Kingdom Hall Fund should be made payable to “Jehovah’s Witnesses.” Donations made by check at district conventions and those sent to the branch office should be made payable to “Watch Tower.” The branch office financial address is Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania, c/o Office of the Secretary and Treasurer, 25 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn, NY 11201-2483.</p>

Question Box
▪ Should a family Bible study be reported to the congregation?
If a Christian parent conducts a family Bible study and unbaptized children are involved, the parent may report a maximum of one hour a week, one return visit a week, and one home Bible study a month. This is the case even if the study lasts for more than one hour, is conducted more than once a week, or is conducted with the children individually.​—See the Our Ministry book, p. 104.
If all in the household are baptized Witnesses, then neither the time nor the study itself is reported as field service (unless a child is still studying the second book after baptism). This is because the congregation’s field service report reflects primarily what is being accomplished in preaching the good news and teaching Bible truth to those who are not dedicated and baptized servants of Jehovah. (Matt. 24:14; 28:19, 20) However, this in no way diminishes the importance of holding such a study regularly.
It is the responsibility of Christian parents to study with their children. Those who need assistance in establishing or improving their family study may ask the elders for help. If circumstances make it advisable for another publisher to conduct a Bible study with an unbaptized son or daughter of a Christian family associated with the congregation, the presiding overseer or service overseer should be consulted. If such a study is approved, the one conducting it may report it just as he or she would any other Bible study.
Training children in Jehovah’s ways involves far more time and effort than appears on a field service report. (Deut. 6:6-9; Prov. 22:6) Christian parents are to be commended for shouldering their weighty responsibility to bring up their children “in the discipline and mental-regulating of Jehovah.”​—Eph. 6:4.

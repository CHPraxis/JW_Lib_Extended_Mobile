<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">JESUS CHRIST foretold that in the last days “the love of the greater number [would] cool off.” As a result, in many parts of the world today, people in general are apathetic to the Kingdom good news. Some even view religion with disdain.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:24:12-40:24:12" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matthew 24:12,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:24:14-40:24:14" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 14</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Even so, with faith and patience, Kingdom publishers are successfully meeting the challenge, as the following experience from the Czech Republic shows.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Two Witnesses talked to a lady through a closed door. After a while, the door cracked open slightly, a hand reached out and grasped the <em>Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>magazines that the Witnesses were offering. A voice said “thank you,” and the door was shut. “Should we call back?” the Witnesses wondered. One of them, a pioneer, or full-time minister, decided to go back, but the same thing happened again, and this continued for a year.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Having decided that she should change her approach, the pioneer prayed to Jehovah for help. The next time she offered the magazines, she asked the woman friendly questions: “How are you? How did you enjoy the magazines?” At first, there was no response, but after a few more visits, the lady began to warm up. One time she opened the door wide, but the conversation was brief.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">In view of the woman’s reluctance to talk at the door, the pioneer decided to write her a letter to explain the purpose of the visits and to offer a home Bible study. Finally, after a year and a half of patient effort, the pioneer succeeded in starting a Bible study with the householder. She was surprised but encouraged when the woman later told her: “I have believed in God since the time you started to bring me the magazines.”</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Indeed, patience and persistence can bring happy results in the Kingdom-preaching and disciple-making work.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:28:19-40:28:20" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matthew 28:19, 20</a>.</p>

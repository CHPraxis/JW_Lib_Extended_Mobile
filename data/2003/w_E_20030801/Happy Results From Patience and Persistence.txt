Kingdom Proclaimers Report
Happy Results From Patience and Persistence
JESUS CHRIST foretold that in the last days “the love of the greater number [would] cool off.” As a result, in many parts of the world today, people in general are apathetic to the Kingdom good news. Some even view religion with disdain.—Matthew 24:12, 14.
Even so, with faith and patience, Kingdom publishers are successfully meeting the challenge, as the following experience from the Czech Republic shows.
Two Witnesses talked to a lady through a closed door. After a while, the door cracked open slightly, a hand reached out and grasped the Watchtower and Awake! magazines that the Witnesses were offering. A voice said “thank you,” and the door was shut. “Should we call back?” the Witnesses wondered. One of them, a pioneer, or full-time minister, decided to go back, but the same thing happened again, and this continued for a year.
Having decided that she should change her approach, the pioneer prayed to Jehovah for help. The next time she offered the magazines, she asked the woman friendly questions: “How are you? How did you enjoy the magazines?” At first, there was no response, but after a few more visits, the lady began to warm up. One time she opened the door wide, but the conversation was brief.
In view of the woman’s reluctance to talk at the door, the pioneer decided to write her a letter to explain the purpose of the visits and to offer a home Bible study. Finally, after a year and a half of patient effort, the pioneer succeeded in starting a Bible study with the householder. She was surprised but encouraged when the woman later told her: “I have believed in God since the time you started to bring me the magazines.”
Indeed, patience and persistence can bring happy results in the Kingdom-preaching and disciple-making work.—Matthew 28:19, 20.

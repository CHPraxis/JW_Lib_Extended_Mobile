<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>Jehovah’s loyal servants seek opportunities to praise him each day. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:96:2-19:96:3" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ps. 96:2, 3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:13:15-58:13:15" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Heb. 13:15</a>) One way we can do that is by witnessing informally. Many worshipers of Jehovah today are thankful that someone introduced them to the Kingdom message through informal witnessing.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>Giving an informal witness to one person often opens the way for others to hear the Kingdom message. For example, Jesus’ conversation with a Samaritan woman at Jacob’s fountain led to many more taking an interest in the good news. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:4:6-43:4:30" data-bid="2-1" class="b">John 4:6-30,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:4:39-43:4:42" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 39-42</a>) While Paul and Silas were imprisoned in Philippi, they witnessed to the jailer, and the man’s entire household accepted the truth.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:16:25-44:16:34" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Acts 16:25-34</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup><strong>Opportunities: </strong>What opportunities do you have to witness informally? Some do so when shopping, taking public transportation, or waiting at medical appointments. Others are able to witness during breaks at work or school. Simply having one of our Bible publications visible may prompt others to inquire about our beliefs.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:3:15-60:3:15" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 Pet. 3:15</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup><strong>Getting Started: </strong>A shy seven-year-old girl heard at a meeting how important it is for all to preach. So when going shopping with her mother, she put two brochures in her bag. While her mother was busy at the counter, the girl offered a brochure to a lady, who graciously accepted it. When asked how she got the courage to approach the lady, this shy girl replied: “I just said, Ready, Set, Go! And I went!”</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>To witness informally, we all need a spirit like that little girl’s. What can help us? Pray for the courage to speak up. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/52:2:2-52:2:2" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 Thess. 2:2</a>) Have in mind a question or comment on a topic of interest that you can use to initiate a conversation. Then trust that Jehovah will bless your efforts.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:12:11-42:12:12" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Luke 12:11, 12</a>.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup>Witnessing informally to the people we meet each day brings praise to Jehovah and gives us joy. It may help someone get on the road to everlasting life.</p>

Announcements
▪ Literature offer for May: Offer individual copies of The Watchtower and Awake! When making return visits on interested people, which may include those who attended the Memorial or other theocratic events but who are not actively associated with the congregation, concentrate on placing the Worship God book. Every effort should be made to start a home Bible study, especially with individuals who have already studied the Knowledge book and the Require brochure. June, July, and August: Offer the Knowledge book or the Require brochure. When householders already have these publications, use another appropriate brochure that the congregation has in stock.
▪ The presiding overseer or someone designated by him should audit the congregation’s accounts on June 1 or as soon as possible thereafter. When this has been done, make an announcement to the congregation after the next accounts report is read.
▪ Donations made by check and put in the local Kingdom Hall contribution boxes for the worldwide work and the Kingdom Hall Fund should be made payable to “Jehovah’s Witnesses.” Donations made by check at district conventions and those sent to the branch office should be made payable to “Watch Tower.” The branch office financial address is Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania, c/o Office of the Secretary and Treasurer, 25 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn, NY 11201-2483.
▪ Beginning with the May literature shipment, the annual supply of congregation forms is being shipped to congregations as forms become available. Instructions regarding forms distribution will appear on the shipment packing list. When there is more than one congregation in a Kingdom Hall auditorium, the literature coordinator should make sure that each congregation receives its supply of forms as soon as they arrive.
▪ Congregation secretaries should maintain an adequate supply of the forms Application for Regular Pioneer Service (S-205) and Application for Auxiliary Pioneer Service (S-205b). These can be ordered on the Literature Request Form (S-14). Maintain at least a one-year supply. Review all regular pioneer application forms to make sure they are complete. If applicants cannot recall the exact date of their baptism, they should estimate the date and keep a record of it.
▪ It is necessary for the branch office to maintain an up-to-date record of addresses and telephone numbers for all presiding overseers and secretaries. If there is a change at any time, the Congregation Service Committee should complete, sign, and send a Presiding Overseer/Secretary Change of Address (S-29) form to the branch office promptly. This includes any changes in telephone area codes.

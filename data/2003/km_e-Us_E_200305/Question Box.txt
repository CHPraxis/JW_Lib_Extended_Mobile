Question Box
▪ When witnessing by telephone, should we explain the donation arrangement?
When we give a witness in person, it may be possible to explain that the worldwide Bible educational work of Jehovah’s Witnesses is supported entirely by voluntary donations and that we are happy to accept such donations. However, no mention of donations or the donation arrangement should be made when witnessing by telephone, as this could be misinterpreted as a form of telephone solicitation. The ministry of Jehovah’s Witnesses is noncommercial in every way.​—2 Cor. 2:17.
▪ When witnessing by telephone, what should we do if a person requests that Jehovah’s Witnesses not call again?
The wishes of the person should be respected. A dated note with the name of the person should be placed in the territory envelope so that publishers will avoid calling that number in the future. Once a year, the list of people who have requested that we not call should be reviewed. Under the direction of the service overseer, experienced, tactful publishers can be assigned to contact these people to determine their current feelings.​—See the June 1994 Our Kingdom Ministry Question Box.

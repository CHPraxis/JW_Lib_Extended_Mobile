<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">▪ Literature offer for <strong>May: </strong>Offer individual copies of <em>The Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>When making return visits on interested people, which may include those who attended the Memorial or other theocratic events but who are not actively associated with the congregation, concentrate on placing the <em>Worship God </em>book. Every effort should be made to start a home Bible study, especially with individuals who have already studied the <em>Knowledge </em>book and the <em>Require </em>brochure. <strong>June, July, and August: </strong>Offer the <em>Knowledge </em>book or the <em>Require </em>brochure. When householders already have these publications, use another appropriate brochure that the congregation has in stock.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn">▪ The presiding overseer or someone designated by him should audit the congregation’s accounts on June 1 or as soon as possible thereafter. When this has been done, make an announcement to the congregation after the next accounts report is read.</p>

<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn">▪ Congregation secretaries should maintain an adequate supply of the forms Application for Regular Pioneer Service (S-205) and Application for Auxiliary Pioneer Service (S-205b). These can be ordered on the Literature Request Form (S-14). Maintain at least a one-year supply. Review all regular pioneer application forms to make sure they are complete. If applicants cannot recall the exact date of their baptism, they should estimate the date and keep a record of it.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sn">▪ It is necessary for the branch office to maintain an up-to-date record of addresses and telephone numbers for all presiding overseers and secretaries. If there is a change at any time, the Congregation Service Committee should complete, sign, and send a Presiding Overseer/Secretary Change of Address (S-29) form to the branch office promptly. This includes any changes in telephone area codes.</p>

Entrusted With the Good News
1 How privileged we are to be entrusted with the good news of God! (1 Thess. 2:4) While some may refuse this powerful message, honesthearted ones are drawn to it as to a lovely fragrance. (2 Cor. 2:14-16) For those who accept and obey the good news, it means salvation. (Rom. 1:16) How should we care for this trust?
2 Jesus and the Apostles: Jesus put proclaiming the good news in first place. (Luke 4:18, 43) Even when he was tired and hungry, his love for people and his appreciation for the message moved him to share it with others. (Mark 6:30-34) By word and example, he impressed upon the minds of his disciples the importance of the Kingdom-preaching work.​—Matt. 28:18-20; Mark 13:10.
3 In imitation of Jesus, the apostles zealously declared the Kingdom message. Even when beaten and ordered to stop preaching, “they continued without letup teaching and declaring the good news.” (Acts 5:40-42) The apostle Paul worked tirelessly in this work. (1 Cor. 15:9, 10; Col. 1:29) He likened the privilege of sharing the good news to a debt owed to his fellowmen, and he was willing to forgo personal convenience in order to discharge it.​—Acts 20:24; Rom. 1:14-16.
4 Our Privilege Today: Appreciation for the sacred commission entrusted to us will move us to seek ways to expand our share in the preaching work. (Rom. 15:16) Edward, who was confined to a wheelchair, would sit at the entrance of a hotel and talk to guests about his faith. Desiring to do more, however, he had a special cab built on a pickup truck, and by means of this vehicle, he pioneered for many years, traveling thousands of miles in the process. Like Edward, many today have adjusted their circumstances to have a greater share in spreading the good news.
5 In imitation of Jesus and the apostles, may we today always give the preaching work priority in our lives. By so doing, we demonstrate our love for people as well as our appreciation of the good news entrusted to us.

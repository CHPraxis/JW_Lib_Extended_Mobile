‘It Reached Into My Heart’
How can you attain a close relationship with God? Many are being assisted by the publication Draw Close to Jehovah. For example, a woman who has been one of Jehovah’s Witnesses for some 25 years states: “This book is a masterpiece.” She continues: “It reached deep down into the cracks and crevices of my heart and made me feel a zeal for Jehovah that I have never felt. It has brought me closer to Jehovah, to my husband, and to the congregation.”
The book Draw Close to Jehovah can help you too. In its prologue the book states: “God’s qualities and ways, as revealed in the Bible, are a vital field of study. Pondering the way Jehovah manifests each of his qualities, seeing how Jesus Christ perfectly reflected them, and understanding how we too may cultivate them will draw us closer to God.”

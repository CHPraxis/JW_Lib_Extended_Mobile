Keys to a Successful Marriage
“Cheating just enough: that is the key to a successful romantic relationship,” states La Presse. The Canadian newspaper was reporting on a study that made a virtue of lying. The study was published in the Journal of Social and Personal Relationships. Professor Tim Cole, of De Paul University, Chicago, U.S.A., says: “By cheating [or lying] just enough, we can preserve the benefits of [a romantic] relationship without putting it in jeopardy.”
However, is deception really a key to a successful marriage? The Bible exhorts Christians: “Now that you have put away falsehood, speak truth each one of you with his neighbor.” (Ephesians 4:25) Does this counsel work? When asked the question, What is the single biggest reason couples split up? a divorce attorney answered: “The inability to talk honestly with each other, bare their souls and treat each other as their best friend.”
What, then, is the secret to a happy marriage? Chapter 3 of the book The Secret of Family Happiness is entitled “Two Keys to a Lasting Marriage.” It considers two vital factors that make it possible for a couple to live together happily, unlocking the door to many blessings.

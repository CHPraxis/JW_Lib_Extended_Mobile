<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">“Cheating just enough: that is the key to a successful romantic relationship,” states <em>La Presse. </em>The Canadian newspaper was reporting on a study that made a virtue of lying. The study was published in the <em>Journal of Social and Personal Relationships. </em>Professor Tim Cole, of De Paul University, Chicago, U.S.A., says: “By cheating [or lying] just enough, we can preserve the benefits of [a romantic] relationship without putting it in jeopardy.”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">However, is deception really a key to a successful marriage? The Bible exhorts Christians: “Now that you have put away falsehood, speak truth each one of you with his neighbor.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/49:4:25-49:4:25" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ephesians 4:25</a>) Does this counsel work? When asked the question, What is the single biggest reason couples split up? a divorce attorney answered: “The inability to talk honestly with each other, bare their souls and treat each other as their best friend.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">What, then, is the secret to a happy marriage? <a class="xt" data-xtid="1" href="jwpub://p/E:1101996022/1-38">Chapter 3 of the book <em>The Secret of Family Happiness</em></a> is entitled “Two Keys to a Lasting Marriage.” It considers two vital factors that make it possible for a couple to live together happily, unlocking the door to many blessings.

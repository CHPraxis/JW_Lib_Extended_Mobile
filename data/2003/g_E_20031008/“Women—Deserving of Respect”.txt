“Women—Deserving of Respect”
A 17-year-old college student in India participated in a public-speaking competition organized by her school. She decided to use as her source material the cover series “Women—Deserving of Respect,” in the July 8, 1992, issue of Awake!
The theme of her speech was “Women—Are They Respected Today?” The result? “I won the first prize in the competition,” she reports. “I would like to express my deep appreciation for Awake!” she continues. “It is very helpful for youngsters like us because it keeps us well-informed and up-to-date. It also helps us to cope with the pressures of this world.”
Have you enjoyed reading this issue of Awake!? It is written for the enlightenment of the entire family, not just for the young ones. This magazine probes beneath the surface and points to the real meaning behind current events. It is published semimonthly in English. Do not miss an issue!

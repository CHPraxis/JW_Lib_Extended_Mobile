It Came With the Wind
A gentleman was walking on the streets of Mumbai, India, when a gust of wind dropped a printed page at his feet. It was Kingdom News No. 36, entitled “The New Millennium—What Does the Future Hold for You?” The subject caught his attention. Without wasting any time, he picked it up and read the whole leaflet. His interest was aroused, and wanting to know more, he requested a Bible and other publications.
The leaflet, published by Jehovah’s Witnesses, contains faith-strengthening thoughts. It clearly explains that the problems we face, including sickness, poverty, and war, are caused by “greed, distrust, and selfishness—traits that cannot be eliminated simply by scientific research, technology, or politics.” The tract also shows that in the near future, God will rid this earth of all wickedness.

What to Say About the Magazines
The Watchtower Jan. 15
“In view of all the bloodshed that has occurred, do you think that evil has conquered good? [Allow for response.] Notice what the Bible says about God. [Read Psalm 83:18b.] Since God is the Most High over the earth, can evil really win? [Allow for response.] This issue of The Watchtower gives a satisfying answer to that question.”
Awake! Jan. 22
“As never before, our security is being threatened. A growing concern is something called identity theft. Have you heard of that? [Allow for response.] The Bible promises that one day this earth will be free from all threats to our security. [Read Isaiah 11:9.] This magazine explains how this will be accomplished.”
The Watchtower Feb. 1
“Many people today worry about unemployment, and others are under tremendous pressure at work. Do you think it is possible to feel happy and secure at work? [Allow for response. Then read Isaiah 65:21-23.] This issue of The Watchtower discusses a time when all will have work that is rewarding.”
Awake! Feb. 8
“This issue of Awake! reports on a tragic reality of our times​—child prostitution. This deplorable form of child abuse is something that the Bible promises will soon end. [Read Proverbs 2:21, 22.] This magazine shows what is behind such exploitation of children as well as how it will be stopped.”

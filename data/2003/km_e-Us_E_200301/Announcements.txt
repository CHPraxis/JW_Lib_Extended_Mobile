Announcements
▪ Literature offer for January: Any 192-page book published prior to 1988 may be offered. Branches that do not have older 192-page books may offer Mankind’s Search for God. February: The new book Draw Close to Jehovah will be featured. Branches that do not yet have this publication may use the Creation book or the Revelation Climax book as an alternative offer. March: Feature the Knowledge book, with an effort to start home Bible studies. April and May: Feature individual copies of both The Watchtower and Awake! When making return visits on interested people, concentrate on placing Worship the Only True God. Every effort should be made to start a home Bible study, especially if some individuals have already studied the Knowledge book and the Require brochure.
▪ Starting in February, and no later than March 2, the new public talk for circuit overseers will be “Deliverance From a World of Darkness.”
▪ Congregations should make convenient arrangements to observe the Memorial this year on Wednesday, April 16, after sundown. Although the talk may start earlier, the passing of the emblems should not begin until after sundown. Check with local sources to determine when sundown occurs in your area. Where a number of congregations normally use the same Kingdom Hall, perhaps one or more congregations can obtain the use of another facility for that evening. Where possible, we would suggest a minimum of 40 minutes between the programs so that all may benefit fully from the occasion. Consideration should also be given to traffic conditions and parking, including the dropping off and picking up of passengers. The body of elders should decide what arrangements would be best locally.
▪ As of this issue, the list of new publications available will no longer appear in Our Kingdom Ministry. The “Announcement to All Congregations” with this information will continue to be mailed to all congregations each month. As a reminder, once the “Announcement to All Congregations” is received, an announcement should be made at the next Service Meeting regarding the items that may be of interest to your congregation. The announcement may then be posted on the information board. After that, the literature servant should retain it in his file.
▪ For those who wish to make donations to the worldwide work electronically, a set of instructions is available to explain this arrangement. For further information, call or write to Watch Tower, Office of the Secretary and Treasurer, 25 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn, New York 11201-2483, (718) 560-5000.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">IN BY far the majority of instances in the Christian Greek Scriptures, or New Testament, the word “love” is a translation of the Greek word <em>a·gaʹpe.</em></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Explaining the meaning of that term, the reference work <em>Insight on the Scriptures</em><span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> says: “[<em>A·gaʹpe</em>] is not sentimentality, based on mere personal attachment, as is usually thought of, but is a moral or social love based on deliberate assent of the will as a matter of principle, duty, and propriety, sincerely seeking the other’s good according to what is right. <em>A·gaʹpe </em>(love) transcends personal enmities, never allowing these to cause one to abandon right principles and to retaliate in kind.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><em>A·gaʹpe </em>can also include deep feeling. “Have <em>intense </em>love [<em>a·gaʹpe</em>] for one another,” admonished the apostle Peter. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/60:4:8-60:4:8" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Peter 4:8</a>) Thus, it could be said that <em>a·gaʹpe </em>involves the heart as well as the mind. Why not consider some scriptures that show the power and scope of this noble form of love?

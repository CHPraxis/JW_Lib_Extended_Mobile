<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">MANY young people were encouraged to consider seriously their conduct when they saw the video <em>Young People Ask<wbr />—How Can I Make Real Friends?</em><span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> The video contains sound scriptural counsel, personal expressions by young Christians, and a moving contemporary drama based on the Bible account of Dinah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:34:1-1:34:31" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Genesis, chapter 34</a>) The following expressions about the video come from Mexico.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Martha relates: “The video deeply touched my heart. It seems as though it was made just for me. I thought that it was enough that my teachers and schoolmates <em>knew </em>that I was one of Jehovah’s Witnesses. I failed to <em>prove </em>it by witnessing to them. I am grateful for all the information Jehovah provides, especially when it touches us as deeply as this video does.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Juan Carlos says: “This video really makes you think. As a young man, I’ve made some mistakes and could identify with some of the characters in the drama. Some years ago, I led a double life, but I realized that such a life can bring bad consequences. After watching the video, I am determined to be faithful to Jehovah.”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Sulem confesses: “When I watched the video, I was overcome by emotion. Earlier, I had stopped reading the Bible, and I wasn’t praying to Jehovah very much. When I listened to the comments made by the young people in the video, I was moved to start studying the Bible again and to pray to Jehovah.”</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Young people today face many challenges, and their choice of friends can often strongly influence how they live their lives. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:26:4-19:26:4" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Psalm 26:4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:13:20-20:13:20" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Proverbs 13:20</a>) The video <em>Young People Ask<wbr />—How Can I Make Real Friends? </em>is helping many to make good decisions in this regard.</p>

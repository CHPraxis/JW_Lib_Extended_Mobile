‘When Jehovah Raised Up Judges’





YOU can readily find Mount Tabor (F4) on the map​—southwest of the Sea of Galilee, in the Valley of Jezreel. Try to visualize an army of 10,000 assembled on top of the mountain. Jehovah used Judge Barak and the prophetess Deborah to rally Israel against Canaanite King Jabin, who had oppressed the people for 20 years. Under army chief Sisera, Jabin’s 900 chariots equipped with menacing iron scythes came from Harosheth to the dry bed of the Kishon, between Megiddo and Mount Tabor.
Judge Barak led the men of Israel down into the valley to engage Sisera’s forces. Jehovah ensured victory by sending a flash flood that bogged down Sisera’s chariots, which panicked the Canaanites. (Jg 4:1–5:31) That was just one of the many victories that God granted Israel during the period of the Judges.
After the conquest of Canaan, the land was apportioned to the tribes of Israel. Note where various non-Levite tribes settled. The small tribe of Simeon received cities in Judah’s territory. Following Joshua’s death, the nation fell into spiritual and moral decline. Israel “got to be in very sore straits,” oppressed by enemies. Responding compassionately, ‘Jehovah raised up judges’​—12 men of faith and courage—​who delivered Israel in the course of three centuries.​—Jg 2:15, 16, 19.
Judge Gideon used only 300 lightly armed but mobile soldiers to rout 135,000 Midianite warriors. The battlefield was between Mount Gilboa and Moreh. After an initial victory, Gideon chased the enemy to the east, into the desert.​—Jg 6:1–8:32.
Jephthah, a Gileadite of the tribe of Manasseh, freed Israelite towns east of the Jordan from the Ammonite oppressors. To achieve his victory, Jephthah likely traveled on the King’s Road, which linked Ramoth-gilead and the area of Aroer.​—Jg 11:1–12:7.
Samson’s exploits against the Philistines centered on the coastal area around Gaza and Ashkelon. Gaza lies in a well-watered region famous for agriculture. Samson used 300 foxes to set fire to the Philistines’ grainfields, vineyards, and olive groves.​—Jg 15:4, 5.
As evident from the Biblical account or as suggested by their tribe, the judges were active across the Promised Land. Wherever the scene of action, Jehovah took good care of his repentant people in times of crisis.

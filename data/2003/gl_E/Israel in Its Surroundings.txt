Israel in Its Surroundings
JEHOVAH told Abraham: ‘Go from Ur in Mesopotamia to the country that I shall show you.’ That country was inhabited and surrounded by other nations.​—Ge 12:1-3; 15:17-21.
As God’s people moved away from Egypt, they knew that they might face resistance from enemies, such as “the despots of Moab.” (Ex 15:14, 15) The Amalekites, Moabites, Ammonites, and Amorites were on Israel’s route to the Promised Land. (Nu 21:11-13; De 2:17-33; 23:3, 4) And the Israelites would encounter other enemy nations in the land that God had promised them.





God said that Israel was to “clear away” seven “populous nations”​—the Hittites, Girgashites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites—​that merited destruction. They were morally degraded and religiously corrupt. Their gods included Baal (noted for phallic stone pillars), Molech (object of child sacrifice), and the fertility goddess Ashtoreth (Astarte).​—De 7:1-4; 12:31; Ex 23:23; Le 18:21-25; 20:2-5; Jg 2:11-14; Ps 106:37, 38.
Sometimes the whole area that God was giving to Israel was called “Canaan,” from north of Sidon to “the torrent valley of Egypt.” (Nu 13:2, 21; 34:2-12; Ge 10:19) At other times the Bible names various nations, city-states, or peoples in that land. Some had distinct locales, such as the Philistines on the coast and the Jebusites in the mountains near Jerusalem. (Nu 13:29; Jos 13:3) Others changed locations or territory over time.​—Ge 34:1, 2; 49:30; Jos 1:4; 11:3; Jg 1:16, 23-26.
At the time of the Exodus, the Amorites were likely the dominant tribe.a (De 1:19-21; Jos 24:15) They had seized Moabite land down to the torrent valley of Arnon, though the area across from Jericho was still called “the desert plains of Moab.” Amorite kings also ruled Bashan and Gilead.​—Nu 21:21-23, 33-35; 22:1; 33:46-51.
Even though they had God’s backing, the Israelites did not eliminate all those condemned nations, who over time ensnared Israel. (Nu 33:55; Jos 23:13; Jg 2:3; 3:5, 6; 2Ki 21:11) Yes, the Israelites fell victim despite the warning: “You must not walk after other gods, any gods of the peoples who are all around you.”​—De 6:14; 13:7.
[Footnote]
Like “Canaanite,” “Amorite” could be used collectively for the peoples of the land or could be listed separately.​—Ge 15:16; 48:22.

Christianity Spreads Abroad
ON THE Mount of Olives near Bethany, Jesus commissioned a preaching work that would shape world history. It was to start about two miles to the west​—at Jerusalem. The message would be spread to nearby Judea and Samaria, eventually reaching “the most distant part of the earth.”​—Ac 1:4, 8, 12.
Not long after Jesus said those words, the Festival of Pentecost drew Jews and proselytes from all over the Roman Empire, from regions indicated on the map below. The apostle Peter’s preaching to them that day opened the way for a rapid spread of Christianity.​—Ac 2:9-11.





Persecution in Jerusalem soon scattered Christ’s followers. Peter and John helped Samaritans to hear and embrace the good news. (Ac 8:1, 4, 14-16) After Philip witnessed to an Ethiopian on the desert road leading “from Jerusalem to Gaza,” Christianity spread into Africa. (Ac 8:26-39) About the same time, the message bore fruit in Lydda, which is on the Plain of Sharon, and at the port of Joppa. (Ac 9:35, 42) From there Peter went to Caesarea and assisted the Roman officer Cornelius, his relatives, and his friends to become spirit-anointed Christians.​—Ac 10:1-48.





Paul, a former persecutor, became the apostle to the nations. He traveled overland and by ship during three missionary trips and a voyage to Rome. The apostle and others spread the good news to numerous centers of the Roman Empire. Paul desired to reach Spain (See page 2.), and Peter served as far east as Babylon. (1Pe 5:13) Truly, under Christ’s active leadership, his followers spread Christianity abroad. By 60/61 C.E., ‘the good news was preached in all creation under heaven.’ (Col 1:6, 23) Since then, this good news has literally reached “the most distant part of the earth.”

THEY CAME FROM . . .
  Jews and proselytes who heard the good news at Pentecost 33 C.E. were from Parthia, Media, Elam, Mesopotamia, Judea, Cappadocia, Pontus, Asia, Phrygia, Pamphylia, Egypt, Libya, Rome, Crete, and Arabia. Many got baptized. What do you think they did when they returned home?

SEVEN CONGREGATIONS
  Jesus sent messages to seven congregations in Asia Minor. Note their locations: coastal Ephesus and Smyrna; inland Pergamum, Philadelphia, and Laodicea; riverside Thyatira; and Sardis, on a key trade route. Unearthed remains of these cities confirm that the Bible refers to real places.

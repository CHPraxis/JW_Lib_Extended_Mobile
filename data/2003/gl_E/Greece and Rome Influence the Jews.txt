Greece and Rome Influence the Jews





THE expansion of what became the Grecian Empire began in the mountains of Macedonia. There, in his early 20’s, Alexander began to look eastward. In 334 B.C.E., he led his army across the Hellespont (Dardanelles), separating Europe and Asia. Like a dashing “leopard,” the Greeks under Alexander embarked on a series of rapid conquests. (Da 7:6) Alexander prevailed over the Persians near Troy, on the plains of the Granicus River, and defeated them decisively at Issus.
The Greeks invaded Syria and Phoenicia, taking Tyre after a seven-month siege. (Eze 26:4, 12) Sparing Jerusalem, Alexander conquered Gaza. (Zec 9:5) Once in Egypt, he founded Alexandria, which became a center of commerce and learning. Recrossing the Promised Land, he again routed the Persians, at Gaugamela, near the ruins of Nineveh.
Alexander turned south to take Babylon, Shushan (Susa), and Persepolis​—Persian administrative centers. He then sped through the Persian domain, reaching the Indus River in what is now Pakistan. In just eight years, Alexander conquered most of the then-known world. But in 323 B.C.E., when 32 years old, he died of malaria at Babylon.​—Da 8:8.
Hellenic influences in the Promised Land were strong. Some veterans of Alexander’s army settled in the area. By the first century, there was a league of Greek-speaking cities (Decapolis). (Mt 4:25; Mr 7:31) The Hebrew Scriptures had become available in Greek. Koine (common Greek) served as an international language for spreading Christian teachings.
Roman Empire
What was happening in the west? Rome​—previously a group of villages on the Tiber River—​grew in importance. Eventually, Rome’s efficient war machine and centralized political power enabled her to devour the areas controlled by Alexander’s four generals. By 30 B.C.E., the Roman Empire was clearly dominant, an early manifestation of the ‘fearsome beast’ Daniel saw in vision.​—Da 7:7.





The Roman Empire stretched from Britain down to North Africa, from the Atlantic Ocean to the Persian Gulf. Because the empire surrounded the Mediterranean, the Romans called it Mare Nostrum (Our Sea).
Rome too influenced the Jews, whose land was part of the Roman Empire. (Mt 8:5-13; Ac 10:1, 2) Jesus was baptized and died during Emperor Tiberius’ reign. Some Roman rulers savagely persecuted Christians but could not defeat true worship. After 13 centuries, the empire succumbed to attacks by Germanic tribes in the north and nomadic invaders in the east.

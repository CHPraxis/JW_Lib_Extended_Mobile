Announcements
▪ Literature offer for March: Feature the Knowledge book, with an effort to start home Bible studies. April and May: Feature individual copies of both The Watchtower and Awake! Publishers should indicate to householders that they may contribute to the worldwide work if they so desire. When making return visits on interested people, concentrate on placing Worship the Only True God. Every effort should be made to start a home Bible study, especially if some individuals have already studied the Knowledge book and the Require brochure. June: Offer the Knowledge book or the Require brochure. When householders already have these publications, use another appropriate brochure that the congregation has in stock.
▪ Publishers who wish to serve as auxiliary pioneers in April should make their plans now and turn in their application early. This will help the elders to make necessary field service arrangements and have sufficient magazines and other literature on hand. The names of all who are approved to auxiliary pioneer should be announced to the congregation each month.
▪ The branch office does not fill individual publishers’ requests for literature. The presiding overseer should arrange for an announcement to be made each month before the congregation monthly request for literature is sent to the branch so that all interested in obtaining personal literature items may advise the brother handling literature. Please keep in mind which publications are special-request items.
▪ It is important that groups of 20 or more persons planning to visit the branch office facilities first correspond by mail with the Central Tour Desk at 100 Watchtower Drive, Patterson, NY 12563-9204. The Central Tour Desk will care for groups that will be visiting the branch office facilities at Brooklyn, Patterson, and Wallkill, New York, or the Assembly Hall at Jersey City, New Jersey. Please send information on the number coming and the dates and times for visiting each location. The branch office will provide a description of the tours that are available as well as a map giving directions to each location. LODGING INFORMATION HAS BEEN SENT TO THE CONGREGATION ELDERS AND MAY BE OBTAINED FROM THE CONGREGATION SECRETARY. Before your visit, please review the June 2002 Our Kingdom Ministry Question Box regarding proper dress and grooming when visiting Bethel homes.
▪ A packet of legal material is available to assist publishers who are involved in lawsuits over child custody and visitation matters in which our religion is under attack. The packet should be requested by the body of elders only in a case in which it is evident that the publisher’s religious beliefs will be at issue. For those facing secular issues on child custody or visitation, helpful information can be found in Awake! of December 8, 1997, pages 3-12; in Awake! of October 22, 1988, pages 2-14; and on the chart found in Awake! of April 22, 1991, page 9.
▪ The secretary should see that the Regional Building Committee is kept up-to-date on the status of all baptized publishers who have submitted Kingdom Hall Volunteer Worker Questionnaire (S-82) forms. When there are adjustments in a volunteer’s status, such as when one moves or is appointed as a ministerial servant or an elder, new forms should be filled out promptly and submitted. If a volunteer’s mailing address or telephone number changes or if he is no longer in good standing in the congregation, the elders should immediately inform the Regional Building Committee by letter.

Announcements
▪ Literature offer for August: Offer the Knowledge book or the Require brochure. When householders already have these publications, use another appropriate brochure that the congregation has in stock. September: Life​—How Did It Get Here? By Evolution or by Creation? Before requesting additional supplies from the branch office, congregations should use what is available locally and check if nearby congregations have a surplus on hand. October: Feature individual copies of both The Watchtower and Awake! Where interest is shown, offer the Require brochure, making a special effort to start Bible studies. November: Offer the Knowledge book or the Require brochure. Where householders already have these publications, offer the Worship God book or an older publication.
▪ Beginning the week of October 20, 2003, we will study Worship the Only True God in the Congregation Book Study.
▪ The presiding overseer or someone designated by him should audit the congregation’s accounts on September 1 or as soon as possible thereafter. When this has been done, make an announcement to the congregation after the next accounts report is read.
▪ The annual inventory of all literature and magazines on hand should be taken on or as close as possible to August 31, 2003. This inventory is similar to the actual count taken monthly by the literature coordinator, and the totals should be entered on the Literature Inventory form (S-18). The total number of magazines on hand should be obtained from the magazine servant(s). The secretary of the coordinating congregation should supervise the inventory. He and the presiding overseer of the coordinating congregation will sign the form. Each coordinating congregation will receive three Literature Inventory forms (S-18). Please mail the original to the branch office at 25 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn, NY 11201-2483, no later than September 6. Keep a copy for your files. The third copy may be used as a work sheet.
▪ On August 29 and 30, 2003, an inventory will be taken of all literature on hand at Brooklyn Bethel. Because of this, no congregation literature requests will be processed for pickup during those days.
▪ Congregations should begin requesting the 2004 Calendar of Jehovah’s Witnesses, Examining the Scriptures Daily​—2004, and 2004 Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses with their next literature request. A listing of the languages in which these items are available will appear in the “Announcement to All Congregations,” which is mailed to all congregations each month.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Much information is available these days about keeping our literal heart in good condition so as to have a more enjoyable and longer life. Of even greater importance is the condition of our figurative heart. How appropriate, then, is the theme of the special assembly day program beginning in September 2003: “Serving Jehovah With a Complete Heart.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:28:9-13:28:9" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Chron. 28:9</a>) What can we look forward to learning?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The circuit overseer will discuss “Helping Others to Serve Jehovah With a Delightful Soul.” Interviews will highlight the joy that results from cultivating interest and conducting Bible studies with people who want to serve Jehovah. All in attendance will no doubt derive comfort and encouragement from the visiting speaker’s first talk, “Guarding Our Hearts in a Troubled World.” The morning session will conclude with the baptism talk.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">In the afternoon, the part “Extending a Helping Hand” will consider how we can assist others. What can parents do to shield their children’s hearts from wrong influences and help them draw close to Jehovah? The part “Help Your Children Take Delight in Jehovah” will provide practical suggestions and will demonstrate how this can be done.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Are we taking advantage of every provision Jehovah makes to keep our figurative heart healthy and strong? The visiting speaker’s final talk, “Maintain a Complete Heart in Serving Jehovah,” will focus on four essential aspects of our spiritual maintenance program. How much time and effort do we devote to earnest prayer, to studying God’s Word, to zealously preaching, and to associating with other Christians? Can we improve in any of these areas?</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Jehovah extends the invitation: “Do bring your heart to discipline and your ear to the sayings of knowledge.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:23:12-20:23:12" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Prov. 23:12</a>) Plan now to attend this rewarding day of Scriptural instruction. Doing so will strengthen you to keep on serving Jehovah with a complete heart and a delightful soul.</p>

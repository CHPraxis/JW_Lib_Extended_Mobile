Work That Refreshes
1 The Bible’s message refreshes all who accept and apply it in their lives. (Ps. 19:7, 8) It helps them break free from false teachings and harmful practices and offers a reliable hope for the future. However, those who receive the good news are not the only ones to benefit. Those who share refreshing Bible truths with others are themselves also refreshed.​—Prov. 11:25.
2 Invigorated by the Ministry: Jesus said that those who accept the yoke of Christian discipleship, which includes the work of preaching and making disciples, would “find refreshment for [their] souls.” (Matt. 11:29) He himself found witnessing to others invigorating. It was like food for him. (John 4:34) When he sent forth the 70 disciples to preach, they rejoiced as they saw Jehovah backing their efforts.​—Luke 10:17.
3 Many Christians today are likewise invigorated by their participation in the preaching work. One sister said: “The ministry is refreshing because it gives my life direction and purpose. Personal problems and everyday stresses fade into the background when I share in the service.” Another zealous minister said: “The ministry . . . makes Jehovah real to me on a daily basis and gives me peace and a measure of inward happiness that cannot be attained by any other means.” What a privilege we have to be “God’s fellow workers”!​—1 Cor. 3:9.
4 Christ’s Yoke Is Kindly: While Christians are exhorted to ‘exert themselves vigorously,’ Jesus does not demand more than we are able to give. (Luke 13:24) Indeed, he lovingly invites us to ‘get under his yoke with him.’ (Matt. 11:29, ftn.) Those who must contend with difficult circumstances can be confident that their whole-souled service, even if limited, is well-pleasing to God.​—Mark 14:6-8; Col. 3:23.
5 How refreshing it is to serve a God who appreciates whatever we do for the sake of his name! (Heb. 6:10) May we always strive to give him our best.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>After enjoying a glorious sunset or a tasty meal, are we not moved to thank Jehovah, the Source of all goodness? His goodness impels us to want to imitate him. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:119:66-19:119:66" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ps. 119:66,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:119:68-19:119:68" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 68;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:5:1-49:5:1" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> Eph. 5:1</a>) How can we manifest the quality of goodness?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup><strong>Toward Unbelievers: </strong>One way we can imitate Jehovah’s goodness is by showing sincere concern for those not related to us in the faith. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:6:10-48:6:10" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Gal. 6:10</a>) Showing goodness in practical ways can have a positive effect on how they view Jehovah’s Witnesses and the message we bear.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>For example, while waiting at a medical clinic, a young pioneer brother sat next to an elderly woman who seemed sicker than most of the others present. When his turn came to see the doctor, he allowed the woman to take his place. He later met her again, this time in the market, and she was very happy to see him. Although she had previously been unreceptive to the good news, she said that she now knew that Jehovah’s Witnesses truly love their neighbors. A regular Bible study was started with her.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup><strong>Toward Our Brothers: </strong>We also imitate Jehovah’s goodness when we extend ourselves to help fellow believers. In times of disaster, we are among the first to come to the aid of our brothers. We show this same spirit when we assist those needing transportation to meetings, visit infirm ones, and widen out in affection for those we do not know well in the congregation.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:6:11-47:6:13" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2 Cor. 6:11-13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:13:16-58:13:16" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Heb. 13:16</a>.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>Another way that Jehovah shows goodness is in his being “ready to forgive.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:86:5-19:86:5" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ps. 86:5</a>) In imitation of him, we can demonstrate our love of goodness by extending forgiveness to others. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:4:32-49:4:32" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Eph. 4:32</a>) This helps to make our association with fellow believers ‘good and pleasant.’​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:133:1-19:133:3" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ps. 133:1-3</a>.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup>May Jehovah’s abundant goodness cause us to bubble over with praise for him and to become radiant with joy. And may it move us to strive to imitate his goodness in all that we do.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:145:7-19:145:7" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ps. 145:7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:31:12-24:31:12" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> Jer. 31:12</a>.</p>

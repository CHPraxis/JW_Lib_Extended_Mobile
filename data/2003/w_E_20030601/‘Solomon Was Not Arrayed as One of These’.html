<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">WILDFLOWERS like those seen here are a common sight along the roadways in southern Africa. They are called cosmos and are native to the American tropics. Such gorgeous flowers may bring to our mind a lesson taught by Jesus. Many in his audience were poor, and they were anxious about their physical needs, their food and clothing.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“On the matter of clothing,” Jesus asked, “why are you anxious? Take a lesson from the lilies of the field, how they are growing; they do not toil, nor do they spin; but I say to you that not even Solomon in all his glory was arrayed as one of these.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:6:28-40:6:29" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matthew 6:28, 29</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Various suggestions have been made as to the specific kind of wildflower Jesus had in mind. Jesus, however, went on to compare it with common vegetation, saying: “If, now, God thus clothes the vegetation of the field, which is here today and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, will he not much rather clothe you, you with little faith?”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:6:30-40:6:30" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matthew 6:30</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Though cosmos are not native in Israel, they certainly support the lesson Jesus was teaching. Whether viewed from afar or examined close up, they are stunningly beautiful and are a favorite subject of photographers and artists. Truly, Jesus was not exaggerating when he said, “not even Solomon in all his glory was arrayed as one of these.”</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">The lesson for us today? Those who serve God can be sure that he will help them to obtain the necessities even in difficult times. Jesus explained: “Seek continually [God’s] kingdom, and these things [such as the needed food and clothing] will be added to you.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:12:31-42:12:31" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Luke 12:31</a>) Yes, real benefits come from seeking God’s Kingdom. But do you know what God’s Kingdom is and what it will do for mankind? Jehovah’s Witnesses would be delighted to help you find the answers from the Bible.</p>

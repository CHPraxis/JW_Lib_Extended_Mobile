Announcements
▪ Literature offer for October: The Watchtower and Awake! magazines. Where interest is shown, offer the Require brochure, making a special effort to start Bible studies. November: What Does God Require of Us? or Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life. If people already have these, Worship the Only True God or an older publication may be offered. December: The Greatest Man Who Ever Lived. As an alternative offer, you may use My Book of Bible Stories, The Bible​—God’s Word or Man’s?, or You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth. January: Any book published prior to 1988 that the congregation may have in stock. If you do not have any of these in stock, please check if nearby congregations have a surplus of older publications on hand that you can use. Congregations that do not have older books may offer Mankind’s Search for God.
▪ The insert in this issue of Our Kingdom Ministry is the “Theocratic Ministry School Schedule for 2004” and should be kept for reference throughout 2004.
▪ If the meeting times for your congregation will change January 1, the congregation secretary should notify the branch office of the changes by submitting the Congregation Meeting Information and Handbill Request form (S-5). If needed, a new supply of handbills can be ordered on the same form. Handbills should be requested at least eight weeks before you wish to receive them.
▪ The video Transfusion-Alternative Health Care​—Meeting Patient Needs and Rights will be considered at the Service Meeting in December. English and Spanish copies are available for request through the congregation.
▪ Beginning November 1, 2003, requests for the following music and drama programs will be available on compact disc only and will no longer be filled in audiocassette format: Kingdom Melodies, Volumes 1-9; Sing Praises to Jehovah (single album with eight cassettes); and Respect Jehovah’s Authority. As additional music and drama audiocassette programs become available on compact disc, congregations will be informed when to discontinue requesting audiocassettes.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">▪ Literature offer for <strong>October: </strong>The <em>Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>magazines. Where interest is shown, offer the <em>Require </em>brochure, making a special effort to start Bible studies. <strong>November: </strong><em>What Does God Require of Us? </em>or <em>Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life. </em>If people already have these, <em>Worship the Only True God </em>or an older publication may be offered. <strong>December: </strong><em>The Greatest Man Who Ever Lived. </em>As an alternative offer, you may use <em>My Book of Bible Stories, The Bible​—God’s Word or Man’s?, </em>or <em>You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth. </em><strong>January: </strong>Any book published prior to 1988 that the congregation may have in stock. If you do not have any of these in stock, please check if nearby congregations have a surplus of older publications on hand that you can use. Congregations that do not have older books may offer <em>Mankind’s Search for God.</em></p>

District and International Conventions Stir Us to Give God Glory!
The “Give God Glory” District and International Conventions held to date have given a tremendous witness. These significant theocratic events have served to magnify Jehovah’s name and enhance our ability to “ascribe to Jehovah the glory belonging to his name.” (Ps. 96:8) Truly, he deserves to be glorified because of his wonderful creative works, which reflect his marvelous attributes.​—Job 37:14; Rev. 4:11.
Using the following questions along with your personal notes, prepare for and participate in the review of the convention program to be held during the week of October 20.
 1. How does inanimate creation declare God’s glory, and how does that differ from the way in which humans praise him? (Ps. 19:1-3; “Creation Declares the Glory of God”)
 2. What present reality does the transfiguration foreshadow, and in what way are Christians today spurred on by this reality? (Keynote address, “Glorious Prophetic Visions Spur Us On!”)

 8. What is the source of unjustified hatred, and what can help us to maintain our integrity despite experiencing such hatred? (Ps. 109:1-3; “Hated Without Cause”)
 9. What is the Christlike view of greatness, and how may a person determine that he needs to develop this viewpoint more fully? (Matt. 20:20-26; “Cultivating a Christlike View of Greatness”)

16. (a) We resolved to give God glory in what ways? (b) Of what can we be assured as we apply what we learned at the “Give God Glory” Conventions? (John 15:9, 10, 16; “‘Keep Bearing Much Fruit’ to Jehovah’s Glory”)
By meditating on the fine spiritual instruction presented at the convention, we will be moved to put into practice the things that we learned. (Phil. 4:8, 9) This will strengthen our determination to “do all things for God’s glory.”​—1 Cor. 10:31.

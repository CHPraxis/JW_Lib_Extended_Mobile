In one of the presentations, demonstrate making a return visit on a magazine-route call. Lay the groundwork for the next visit by drawing attention to the box “In Our Next Issue.”​—See the <a class="xt" data-xtid="2" href="jwpub://p/E:201998363/8-9">October 1998 <em>Our Kingdom Ministry, </em>p. 8, pars. 7-8</a>.</p>

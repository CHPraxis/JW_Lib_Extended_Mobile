<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">IN THE dark days of 1937, when differing ideologies caused tension in many European countries, true Christians faced difficult choices. Should they obey God or men? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:5:29-44:5:29" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Acts 5:29</a>) Young men of military age knew that obedience to God could cost them their lives.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Antonio Gargallo was a 19-year-old Spaniard who faced such a choice. The civil war in Spain had already dragged on for about a year when he was called up for military service by General Franco’s nationalist forces. The previous year, Antonio had been baptized as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses, and he had read the Scriptural counsel that God’s servants should remain neutral and not even learn war. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:2:4-23:2:4" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Isaiah 2:4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:17:16-43:17:16" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> John 17:16</a>) Unwilling to become a soldier and kill his fellow countrymen, Antonio attempted to flee to France. But he was apprehended and taken to an army barracks in Jaca, Huesca, near the French border.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">A military tribunal offered him a stark choice: Take up arms or be executed. Antonio decided to obey God. Shortly before his execution, he wrote the following letter to his mother and sister, who were not Jehovah’s Witnesses:</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">“I have been arrested, and without even being heard, I have been sentenced to death. Tonight I will cease to live on earth. Do not get upset or weep . . . , for I have obeyed God. Anyway, I lose very little because, God willing, I will have a new and better life. . . . I feel very calm as my last hour arrives. Please receive a last hug from this your son and brother who truly loves you.”<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span></p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Three soldiers reported that on the way to his execution, Antonio sang songs of praise to Jehovah. Such sacrifices do not go unnoticed by God or by his Son. We can be sure that faithful Christians, such as Antonio, will reap their reward by means of a resurrection.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:5:28-43:5:29" data-bid="3-1" class="b">John 5:28, 29</a>.</p>

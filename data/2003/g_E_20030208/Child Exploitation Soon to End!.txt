Child Exploitation Soon to End!
“IN THE Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the United Nations has proclaimed that childhood is entitled to special care and assistance,” states the preamble of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Regarding the importance of the family, it adds: “The child, for the full and harmonious development of his or her personality, should grow up in a family environment, in an atmosphere of happiness, love and understanding.” Yet, this ideal is far from being achieved.
Just talking about a better world for children is not enough. Moral degeneration is rampant, and many people consider the situation normal. Widespread depravity and greed cannot be controlled by law enforcement. Even parents, rather than showing love and protecting their children, often contribute to the climate of permissiveness. What hope, then, do we have for an end to child prostitution?
Although this corrupt system has failed to ensure that all children are given a loving home and a secure future, our Creator will soon eliminate every kind of perversity and promiscuity, including child prostitution. Soon, surprisingly for the world, Jehovah God will intervene in human affairs by means of his Kingdom. Corrupters and exploiters will not escape divine judgment. Only people who love their fellowmen will survive to live in God’s new world. “The upright are the ones that will reside in the earth, and the blameless are the ones that will be left over in it. As regards the wicked, they will be cut off from the very earth; and as for the treacherous, they will be torn away from it.”—Proverbs 2:21, 22.
Imagine the relief when both children and adults will be able to live without degradation and sexual abuse! Even the emotional and physical harm caused by exploitation and violence will be things of the past. Former victims of sexual exploitation will be able to live without disturbing memories or aftereffects. “The former things will not be called to mind, neither will they come up into the heart.”—Isaiah 65:17.
Then, no child will be born to suffer mistreatment or sexual abuse. Happiness, love, and understanding will be no mere dream. About the inhabitants of God’s new world, Isaiah 11:9 declares: “They will not do any harm or cause any ruin.”
Indeed, what a joy it will be when poverty, drug abuse, unhappy families, and moral badness are no more! Peace, righteousness, and security will reign. “My people must dwell in a peaceful abiding place and in residences of full confidence and in undisturbed resting-places.”—Isaiah 32:18.

Parental Care Can Prevent Family Breakdown
● “My parents encouraged me to take advantage of my school years and to learn a profession. They did not try to impose their preferences on me, but they helped me to opt for schools that gave the course that I needed.”—Tais.
● “When my sister and I went shopping, our mother went along. Besides helping us to be economical, she also helped us to avoid clothes that were extravagant or revealing.”—Bianca.
● “When we went to parties, my parents always asked who would be present, what type of music there would be, and when the party would begin and end. At most parties we were all together as a family.”—Priscila.
● “During my infancy and adolescence, my parents and I always had excellent communication. A schoolmate noticed that and said: ‘I envy the ease with which you can talk to your parents about anything. I do not even feel free to talk with my mother, and often what I want to know I try to learn from other people.’”—Samara.
● “I was a happy adolescent. I did not see anything bad in people and was always laughing. I felt at ease with my friends and enjoyed talking about funny things with them. My parents understood that this was my personality, and they did not try to change my ways. But they kindly helped me to understand that I should be careful and proper in dealing with those of the opposite sex.”—Tais.
● “As with most other youths, I became interested in the opposite sex. My father established a certain age when I could begin courtship. I was not discontent with this. Rather, I perceived that my parents were concerned about me and wanted to protect me from future harm.”—Bianca.
● “I saw marriage as something good, especially because of the example of my parents. They always had a good relationship and maintained good communication. I remember that when I was dating, my mother gave me advice on how to act under certain circumstances and explained how this would affect my marriage.”—Priscila.

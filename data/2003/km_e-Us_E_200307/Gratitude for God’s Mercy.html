<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>Before becoming a Christian, the apostle Paul was violently opposed to the spread of Christianity. However, because he acted in ignorance, he was shown mercy. Jehovah demonstrated undeserved kindness, and Paul was given an assignment to preach. He treasured that assignment. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:26:9-44:26:18" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Acts 26:9-18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:1:12-54:1:14" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 1 Tim. 1:12-14</a>) Gratitude for Jehovah’s mercy moved Paul to expend himself in fulfilling his ministry.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:12:15-47:12:15" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Cor. 12:15</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>According to God’s mercy, we too have been given a ministry. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:4:1-47:4:1" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2 Cor. 4:1</a>) Like Paul, we can demonstrate our appreciation for the mercy shown us by exerting ourselves in helping others to progress spiritually. One way we can do this is by starting and conducting Bible studies.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup><strong>Starting Bible Studies: </strong>A way to start Bible studies is by establishing a magazine route. As we regularly visit those on our route, we become better acquainted with their concerns. In time, an article in one of the magazines may serve as a springboard for introducing a Bible study in the <em>Require </em>brochure. On subsequent visits, it may be possible to continue discussions in the <em>Require </em>brochure when placing magazines with the householder.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup><strong>Prayerful Effort Needed: </strong>Prayer coupled with diligent effort will enhance our preaching activity. A pioneer sister who had one Bible study prayed that Jehovah would bless her with more. She also acted in harmony with her prayers. She made an examination of her ministry and noted that she had not been offering Bible studies when making return visits. She began doing so and soon had two more studies.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>How privileged we are to share in making known “the good news of the undeserved kindness of God”! (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:20:24-44:20:24" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Acts 20:24</a>) May gratitude for God’s mercy move us to be diligent in helping others to benefit from Jehovah’s undeserved kindness.</p>

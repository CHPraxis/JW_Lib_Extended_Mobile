Announcements
▪ Literature offer for July and August: Offer the Knowledge book or the Require brochure. When householders already have these publications, use another appropriate brochure that the congregation has in stock. September: Life​—How Did It Get Here? By Evolution or by Creation? Before requesting additional supplies from the branch office, congregations should use what is available locally and check if nearby congregations have a surplus on hand. October: The Watchtower and Awake! Where interest is shown, offer the Require brochure, making a special effort to start Bible studies.
▪ Starting in September, circuit overseers will give the public talk entitled “Why Fear the True God?”
▪ The date of the next spring cleaning at the branch facilities in Brooklyn, Patterson, and Wallkill, New York, will be May 8, 2004, not May 15, 2004, as was announced in the June 2003 Our Kingdom Ministry. There will be no arrangements for tours or for congregations to pick up literature on that date.

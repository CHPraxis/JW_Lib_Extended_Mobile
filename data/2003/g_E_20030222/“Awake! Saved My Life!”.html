<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">The publishers of <em>Awake! </em>received an appreciative letter from Italy. In part, it reads:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“I have read <em>Awake! </em>for 40 years, and I admire its presentation of a wide range of practical subjects. Recently, I was at work when I experienced a sharp pain in my stomach and chest. I decided to go home, but when I had a second wave of pain, something clicked. I clearly remembered an article in <em>Awake! </em>that described the symptoms of a heart attack.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> I decided to go to the hospital. I was still in the waiting room when my head slumped to one side and I passed out. I was told this the next day in intensive care.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“I am here today because of the swift intervention of skillful doctors. But I must also give credit to your magazine, which provided information that helped me to make the wise decision to go to the hospital. <em>Awake! </em>saved my life!”</p>

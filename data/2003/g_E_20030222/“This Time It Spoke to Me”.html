<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">In 1994, Jehovah’s Witnesses published a brochure that discusses the challenge of dealing with the death of a loved one. It has been bringing comfort to many ever since.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Recently, a letter was received from an appreciative reader in Pennsylvania, U.S.A., who wrote: “When I first obtained the brochure, my thought was, ‘It’s a very fine publication.’ However, I did not realize its strengths until I lost my daughter two weeks ago. Being absolutely beside myself and looking for help, I turned to the brochure. This time it spoke to me. It covered all the things that hurt me, and it comforted me.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The brochure <em>When Someone You Love Dies </em>answers such questions as: How can I live with my grief? How can others help? What hope is there for those who have died?</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Perhaps you or someone you know will also receive comfort from reading this 32-page brochure. You can request a copy by filling in and mailing the accompanying coupon to the address shown on the coupon or to an appropriate address listed on page 5 of this magazine.</p>

“This Time It Spoke to Me”
In 1994, Jehovah’s Witnesses published a brochure that discusses the challenge of dealing with the death of a loved one. It has been bringing comfort to many ever since.
Recently, a letter was received from an appreciative reader in Pennsylvania, U.S.A., who wrote: “When I first obtained the brochure, my thought was, ‘It’s a very fine publication.’ However, I did not realize its strengths until I lost my daughter two weeks ago. Being absolutely beside myself and looking for help, I turned to the brochure. This time it spoke to me. It covered all the things that hurt me, and it comforted me.”
The brochure When Someone You Love Dies answers such questions as: How can I live with my grief? How can others help? What hope is there for those who have died?
Perhaps you or someone you know will also receive comfort from reading this 32-page brochure. You can request a copy by filling in and mailing the accompanying coupon to the address shown on the coupon or to an appropriate address listed on page 5 of this magazine.

The Question of How Life Began
IN France, both in schools and in the media, the theory of evolution is presented as indisputable fact. As a consequence, even if people believe in God, they usually consider evolution to be the only possible explanation for the emergence of life. Yet, many who are fascinated by the complexity of living organisms are unconvinced by the theory. The France branch office of Jehovah’s Witnesses received the following letter:
“Recently I found a book that you publish entitled Life—How Did It Get Here? By Evolution or by Creation? in a secondhand bookshop. This little book was of great interest to me, since I think it addresses the real issues at stake. Trained as a physicist, I have for many years been interested in the complex problems of ‘Darwinism’ and other ‘evolution theories.’ These claim to explain the transformation of inanimate things into living organisms, or the origin of life from the inanimate.”
After reading what he described as “your little book,” the writer of the letter observed: “Life—How Did It Get Here? is very well put together and documented and presents a very good summary of the difficulties and insoluble contradictions faced by the synthetic theory of evolution commonly accepted by many contemporary scientists.” He then asked for further information.

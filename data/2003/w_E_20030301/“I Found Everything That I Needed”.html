<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">DEPRESSION, according to a report by the World Health Organization, is estimated currently to affect over 120 million people worldwide. Each year, one million people commit suicide and between 10 and 20 million attempt to put an end to their life. What help is there for those who suffer from depression? Medical treatment may alleviate the suffering, and emotional support is vital. Moreover, some who are experiencing such feelings have found additional help in the practical Bible-based publications of Jehovah’s Witnesses, as the following letter from France shows.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“Not so long ago, I could not see the point of going on living. I prayed to God to let me die. It was as if I were dead inside. Seeking direction, I prayed intensely to Jehovah. I also decided to read the <em>2002 Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses </em>and completed it in three days. I have to say that it encouraged me enormously and strengthened my faith.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“I did some research in the <em>Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>magazines, and what a surprise I had! I have read these magazines regularly for over 15 years, but I never realized just how encouraging and stimulating the articles are. They are full of love<wbr />—a quality that is so rare these days. I found everything that I needed.”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The Bible says: “Jehovah is near to those that are broken at heart; and those who are crushed in spirit he saves.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:34:18-19:34:18" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 34:18</a>) Without a doubt, all who are “broken at heart” or “crushed in spirit” can find encouragement and a hope for the future in the Bible. Jehovah’s Witnesses distribute Bible-based literature to help those in need to benefit from that divinely inspired source of comfort.</p>

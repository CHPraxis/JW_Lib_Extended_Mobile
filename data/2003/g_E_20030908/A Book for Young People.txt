A Book for Young People
A student at a university in Arkhangelsk wrote to the branch office of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Russia. She explained that she had received a magazine published by the Witnesses from someone on the street. “It made me think about life and what I know about God and religion,” she wrote. “Now I want to study the Bible. I want to learn more about the person who, not knowing any of us, gave his life for our sins and our salvation.”
Her letter continued: “You are performing a much-needed work, especially by explaining to children the difference between good and bad. After all, they are like sponges, absorbing everything around them and then changing to fit in.” The student has a younger brother and a younger sister, and she requested a copy of the book Questions Young People Ask—Answers That Work. “I hope it will help them in school and in life in general,” she said.
You too can obtain a copy of this book, which was designed especially to help youths with problems they face today. Just fill in the accompanying coupon and mail it to the address shown on the coupon or to an appropriate address listed on page 5 of this magazine.
□ I would like to receive a copy of the book Questions Young People Ask—Answers That Work.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">During her final year of school, Ginny, one of Jehovah’s Witnesses in the United States, had a fine opportunity to speak up about her religion. “My teacher told the class that we needed to do a term paper in order to graduate,” she says. “I told her that I wanted to write about Jehovah’s Witnesses in Nazi concentration camps.”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The teacher gave Ginny permission to pursue her topic. “I was nervous when it came time for me to submit my paper and give an oral presentation to the class,” Ginny admits. “I didn’t know what my classmates would say or if they would make fun of me.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Ginny began her presentation by asking: “Does anyone know who wore the Star of David in the Nazi concentration camps?” Everyone said, “The Jews.” Then she asked if anyone knew who wore a purple triangle. No one responded. “I told them that Jehovah’s Witnesses did,” Ginny says.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The teacher and the class were impressed with Ginny’s information. “They were awed by the fact that Jehovah’s Witnesses could have gained their freedom simply by signing a piece of paper renouncing their faith,” Ginny says. “Some of my classmates later told me that in the past they had made fun of Jehovah’s Witnesses but that the next time one called at their home, they would listen.”</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Ginny received four <em>A</em>’s for her report and presentation. “Not only did I get a good grade,” she says, “but I also had a great opportunity to speak up about my faith!”</p>

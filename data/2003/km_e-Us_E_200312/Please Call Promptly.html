<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Call promptly on whom? On those who request literature or regular magazine delivery or who would like a Witness to visit them at their home. Where do these requests come from? From individuals who contact the branch office by mail or telephone or by means of our official Internet Web site. When such interest is shown, the branch office notifies the local congregation by means of the S-70 form, which is a slip with the heading “Please Arrange for a Qualified Publisher to Call on This Person.” When the elders receive an S-70 form, they should immediately pass it on to a publisher who will diligently follow through on the interest. If the publisher has difficulty finding the person at home, the publisher might try to contact him by telephone or discreetly to leave a note. If you are asked to make such a call, please make every effort to contact the interested person promptly.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>What could unite over six million people from 234 lands and some 380 language groups? Only the worship of Jehovah God. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/33:2:12-33:2:12" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Mic. 2:12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/33:4:1-33:4:3" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 4:1-3</a>) Jehovah’s Witnesses know from personal experience that true Christian unity is a reality today. As “one flock” under our “one shepherd,” we are determined to resist this world’s divisive spirit.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:10:16-43:10:16" data-bid="2-1" class="b">John 10:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:2:2-49:2:2" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Eph. 2:2</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>God’s unfailing purpose is that all intelligent creation be united in true worship. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:5:13-66:5:13" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Rev. 5:13</a>) Knowing the importance of this, Jesus made the unity of his followers a matter of earnest prayer. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:20-43:17:21" data-bid="4-1" class="b">John 17:20, 21</a>) How can each of us contribute to the unity of the Christian congregation?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup><strong>How Unity Is Achieved: </strong>Without God’s Word and spirit, Christian unity would be unattainable. Our applying what we read in the Bible allows God’s spirit to flow freely in our lives. This enables us “to observe the oneness of the spirit in the uniting bond of peace.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:4:3-49:4:3" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Eph. 4:3</a>) It impels us to put up with one another in love. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:3:13-51:3:14" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Col. 3:13, 14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:4:8-60:4:8" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 1 Pet. 4:8</a>) Do you promote unity by meditating on God’s Word each day?</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>Our commission to preach and make disciples also unites us. When we work with others in the Christian ministry, “striving side by side for the faith of the good news,” we become “fellow workers in the truth.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:1:27-50:1:27" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Phil. 1:27;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/64:1:8-64:1:8" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 3 John 8</a>) As we do so, the uniting bonds of love within the congregation are strengthened. Why not invite someone you have not recently worked with to accompany you in the field ministry this week?</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>How privileged we are to be part of the only true international brotherhood on earth today! (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:5:9-60:5:9" data-bid="8-1" class="b">1 Pet. 5:9</a>) Recently, thousands experienced this global unity firsthand at the “Give God Glory” International Conventions. May each of us contribute to this precious unity by reading God’s Word each day, by resolving differences in love, and by preaching the good news “with one accord.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:15:6-45:15:6" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Rom. 15:6</a>.</p>

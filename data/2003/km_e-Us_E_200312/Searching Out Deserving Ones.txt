Searching Out Deserving Ones
1 Jesus’ instructions for carrying out the preaching work present us with a challenge. He said: “Into whatever city or village you enter, search out who in it is deserving.” (Matt. 10:11) With people today spending less and less time at home, how can we conduct this search effectively?
2 Analyze Your Territory: Begin by analyzing your territory. When are people most likely to be at home? Where can they be found during the day? Is there a certain day of the week or time of day when they might be more receptive to a visit? Adjusting your ministry to the routine and circumstances of people in the local territory can help you to accomplish the most good.​—1 Cor. 9:23, 26.
3 Many publishers have found success during the early evening hours. Some householders are more relaxed and inclined to listen at that time. When daylight hours are few during the winter months, telephone witnessing (where allowed) in the evenings may prove effective. Working business territory and witnessing in public areas are also ways to reach people with the good news.
4 During a month of special activity, one congregation instituted late-afternoon witnessing on Saturdays and Sundays and evening witnessing on Wednesdays and Fridays. They also organized telephone witnessing and arranged to work business territory. These arrangements generated so much enthusiasm for the ministry that the congregation decided to continue them.
5 Follow Up Diligently: If it is challenging in your territory to find people at home when you call back, try to make a specific appointment to call again at the conclusion of each visit, including the initial call. Then, be sure to keep the appointment. (Matt. 5:37) If appropriate, you might ask for the householder’s telephone number. This can also help you to contact the person again.
6 Our diligent efforts to search out deserving ones and follow up on the interest we find will surely have Jehovah’s blessing.​—Prov. 21:5.

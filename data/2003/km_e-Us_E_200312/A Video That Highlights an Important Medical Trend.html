<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Legal and health-care professionals are giving increased attention to the ethical views and rights of medical patients. This has promoted new therapies and approaches from which Jehovah’s Witnesses can benefit. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:15:28-44:15:29" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Acts 15:28, 29</a>) That is the focus of the video <em>Transfusion-Alternative Health Care​—Meeting Patient Needs and Rights. </em>Watch it, and then review what you learned.​—Note: Because the video includes brief surgical scenes, parents should use discretion in viewing the video with young children.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><strong>(1) </strong>Why is the medical community reevaluating the use of blood transfusions? <strong>(2) </strong>Give three examples of complex surgeries that are performed without blood transfusions. <strong>(3) </strong>How many physicians and surgeons worldwide have indicated their willingness to treat patients without blood transfusions? Why are they willing to do so? <strong>(4) </strong>What have recent hospital studies revealed about blood use? <strong>(5) </strong>What are the medical risks associated with blood transfusions? <strong>(6) </strong>What conclusion have many experts reached regarding the benefits of transfusion alternatives? <strong>(7) </strong>What causes anemia? How tolerable is it in humans? What can be done to compensate for it? <strong>(8) </strong>How can red-cell production be stimulated in a patient’s body? <strong>(9) </strong>What techniques are being used to minimize blood loss during surgery? <strong>(10) </strong>Can transfusion alternatives work for young children or for people involved in life-threatening emergencies? <strong>(11) </strong>What is one of the primary ethical principles of good medical care? <strong>(12) </strong>Why is it important for Christians to make nonblood treatment choices in advance? How can we do this?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Acceptance of some treatments featured in the video is a matter for private decision in accord with each one’s Bible-trained conscience. Have you decided which transfusion alternatives you are willing to accept for yourself and your children? Non-Witness family members should also be fully informed of your decisions and the reasons for them.​—See “Questions From Readers” in the June 15 and October 15, 2000, issues of <em>The Watchtower.</em></p>

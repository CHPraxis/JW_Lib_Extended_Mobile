‘A Magazine to Be Digested’
DAVID is a law student at the Obafemi Awolowo University in Nigeria. Recently, he wrote to the local branch office of Jehovah’s Witnesses: “I regularly deliver Awake! to a distinguished 70-year-old professor of jurisprudence on the faculty. One morning, after receiving the current issues, he said to a visitor in his office: ‘Some books are to be tasted, others to be swallowed, and some few to be chewed and digested. Awake! is a magazine to be chewed and digested.’”
On another occasion, after leaving the professor’s office, David said that he overheard him recommending Awake! to another visitor. “He spoke highly of the depth of research that goes into the preparation of Awake! and of its balanced yet bold approach to issues. I heard him say: ‘I read the magazines very carefully. God must be the one who gives the writers the wisdom to write such marvelous articles.’”
Awake! is educational and covers many subjects. Most important, it builds confidence in the Creator’s promise in the Bible of a peaceful new world that will replace the present system of things. The 32-page brochure What Does God Require of Us? highlights that purpose of God, providing information from the Bible to show what we need to do to receive his approval.

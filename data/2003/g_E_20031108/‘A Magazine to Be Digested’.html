<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">DAVID is a law student at the Obafemi Awolowo University in Nigeria. Recently, he wrote to the local branch office of Jehovah’s Witnesses: “I regularly deliver <em>Awake! </em>to a distinguished 70-year-old professor of jurisprudence on the faculty. One morning, after receiving the current issues, he said to a visitor in his office: ‘Some books are to be tasted, others to be swallowed, and some few to be chewed and digested. <em>Awake! </em>is a magazine to be chewed and digested.’”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">On another occasion, after leaving the professor’s office, David said that he overheard him recommending <em>Awake! </em>to another visitor. “He spoke highly of the depth of research that goes into the preparation of <em>Awake! </em>and of its balanced yet bold approach to issues. I heard him say: ‘I read the magazines very carefully. God must be the one who gives the writers the wisdom to write such marvelous articles.’”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><em>Awake! </em>is educational and covers many subjects. Most important, it builds confidence in the Creator’s promise in the Bible of a peaceful new world that will replace the present system of things. The 32-page brochure <em>What Does God Require of Us? </em>highlights that purpose of God, providing information from the Bible to show what we need to do to receive his approval.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Nearly 2,000 years ago, God provided the greatest gift ever given to mankind<wbr />—the life of his Son, Jesus Christ, which makes it possible for us to receive everlasting life. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:3:16-43:3:16" data-bid="1-1" class="b">John 3:16</a>) Appreciating this, many have given friends and relatives a gift copy of <em>The Greatest Man Who Ever Lived, </em>a book that describes the life of Jesus as it is presented in the four Gospels.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Some time ago a man explained that he gives this book to those from whom he receives Christmas cards. He writes to them, briefly explaining why he no longer celebrates Christmas, and he uses references from the encyclopedia, the dictionary, and the Bible. Then he includes a copy of <em>The Greatest Man Who Ever Lived.</em></p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The man said that he received two very encouraging responses from university professors. One letter said: “Your beautiful gift, <em>The Greatest Man Who Ever Lived, </em>arrived the other day. We are so pleased to have it. It is so beautiful from so many standpoints. It already has had heavy usage.”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">This book includes the speeches Jesus delivered, as well as his illustrations and miracles. To the extent possible, everything is related in the order in which it occurred. And the book features beautiful, carefully researched illustrations designed to convey the feelings of Jesus and his contemporaries.</p>

Into the Cold World!
A BABY is born into a harsh, cold world, a world full of stress. Although a baby cannot really verbalize his feelings, some scientists believe that even before birth the fetus is aware of what is taking place.
The book The Secret Life of the Unborn Child says: “We now know that the unborn child is an aware, reacting human being who from the sixth month on (and perhaps even earlier) leads an active emotional life.” Although the baby may not remember, some scientists wonder if the stressful experience of birth does affect his later life.
After birth, stress continues. Outside mother’s womb, the baby is no longer automatically fed. The pipeline that carried oxygen and nutrients is gone. To survive, he has to start breathing and take in nutrients himself. He needs somebody to feed him and to take care of his other physical needs.
The newborn also has to develop mentally, emotionally, and spiritually. So someone must nurture the little one. Who is in the best position to do it? What does the baby need from his parents? How can these needs best be met? The following articles will help answer these questions.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">THE tropical forests of Venezuela are home to a highly intelligent primate, the wedge-capped capuchin monkey. When the rainy season descends on the monkey’s jungle home, something else descends with it<wbr />—clouds of merciless mosquitoes. Besides being a nuisance, these invading insects are dangerous. They often carry the eggs of the parasitic botfly, which can result in debilitating, festering cysts when they are deposited beneath the monkey’s skin.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Apparently to protect themselves from the onslaught, capuchins cover their bodies with a potent natural repellent<wbr />—the secretion of a certain type of jungle millipede. These millipedes secrete two compounds that are effective against insects. In fact, their secretion is even stronger than man-made repellents used by the military!</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Hence, during the rainy season, the wedge-capped capuchin pokes around in tree bark or on termite mounds looking for the four-inch- <strong>[10 cm]</strong>long millipedes. When it finds one, it rubs the millipede all over itself<wbr />—from head to foot. The “secretion is so avidly sought by the monkeys that up to four of them will share a single millipede,” says the <em>Journal of Chemical Ecology. </em>Even the usual pecking order, evident at feeding time and on other occasions, is set aside when a millipede massage begins.</p>

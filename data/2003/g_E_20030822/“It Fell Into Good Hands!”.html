<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Patricia found a briefcase that had been forgotten in a government office in the city of Cuernavaca, Mexico. Upon opening it, she saw that it contained several credit cards, some signed blank checks, and the identification card of an architect. As soon as she got home, she called the man to say that she had found his briefcase. Overcome, he exclaimed: “Thank God it fell into good hands!”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">When the elderly architect came to Patricia’s home to pick up his briefcase, he told her that she was an angel, someone sent by God. Patricia said that she was one of Jehovah’s Witnesses and explained: “I serve the true God, Jehovah, and have been taught by him. That is why I acted the way I did. So all praise should go to him.” When the architect offered her a reward, Patricia did not accept it. Instead, she offered him some Bible literature and told him that she would prefer that he read it and benefit from it.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Like many of Jehovah’s Witnesses, Patricia has studied the book <em>Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life. </em>One of its 19 chapters is “Why Living a Godly Life Brings Happiness.” Patricia experienced the truth of the subheading “Honesty Results in Happiness.”</p>

You Are Warmly Invited
THE Last Supper, which the Lord Jesus Christ instituted some 2,000 years ago, is more than an event of mere historical interest. It has had a powerful effect on people ever since its inauguration. Touched by what they read in the Gospel accounts regarding what took place that night, many have endeavored to commemorate the Lord’s Supper in various ways.
All of this is understandable, since Jesus Christ himself commanded that his followers observe this event and that they do so regularly. He specifically told them: “Keep doing this in remembrance of me.”—Luke 22:19; 1 Corinthians 11:23-25.
Of course, for the observance to be a truly rewarding experience, one must have an accurate understanding of its meaning, as provided by God’s Word, the Bible. In addition, it is important to know what the Bible has to say about when and how the event is to be celebrated.
In obedience to Jesus’ command, Jehovah’s Witnesses around the world will be gathering together on the evening of Wednesday, April 16, 2003, to commemorate Jesus’ death. It will be an occasion for them to examine the Scriptures and to renew their faith in and love for the Lord Jesus Christ, who said: “God loved the world so much that he gave his only-begotten Son, in order that everyone exercising faith in him might not be destroyed but have everlasting life.” (John 3:16) You are warmly invited to gather with them that evening so that you too may strengthen your faith in and love for Jesus Christ and the heavenly Father, Jehovah God.

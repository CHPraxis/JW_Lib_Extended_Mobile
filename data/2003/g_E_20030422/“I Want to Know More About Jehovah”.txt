“I Want to Know More About Jehovah”
So wrote 12-year-old Miki in Japan who had just finished studying the brochure A Satisfying Life—How to Attain It. “When I first saw the words ‘Satisfying Life,’” she said in a letter to the publishers, “I thought that it just contained advice on how to make life satisfying. But as I studied this brochure, I realized that it teaches us about God’s greatness as well. I could grasp, in an enjoyable way, God’s greatness and what to do to have a satisfying life. Now that I have finished studying it, the desire to know more about God and to realize a satisfying life fills me. Please accept my heartfelt thanks for making the brochure.”

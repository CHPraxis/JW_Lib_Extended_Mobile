“I Found Friendship, Love, and Attention”
“BY THIS all will know that you are my disciples, if you have love among yourselves.” (John 13:35) True to Jesus’ words, love became the trademark of the early Christian brotherhood. Tertullian, writing more than a hundred years after Christ’s death, quoted observers as saying: ‘See how they love one another and how they are even ready to die for one another.’
Can that kind of love still be found in the world? Yes. Consider, for example, a letter that was received by the branch office of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Brazil. The letter writer, a woman named Marília, wrote:
“While living in Villa Mercedes, Argentina, my mother, who is one of Jehovah’s Witnesses, developed osteoarthritis, leaving her paralyzed from the waist down. For the first eight months of her illness, it was the Witnesses in Villa Mercedes who lovingly and considerately looked after her. They took care of everything, cleaning her home and preparing her meals. Even while in the hospital, Mother always had someone with her, day and night.
“Mother and I have since returned to Brazil, where she is still recovering from her illness. The Witnesses where we now live are doing everything they can to aid Mother’s recovery.”
Marília concludes her letter: “I confess that I myself am not a Witness, but I found friendship, love, and attention among the Witnesses.”
Yes, there are still people who act with true Christian love. In doing so, they demonstrate the power that Jesus’ teachings can have on our lives.

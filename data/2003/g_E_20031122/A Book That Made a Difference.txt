A Book That Made a Difference
BECAUSE so many young people imitate sloppy, faddish styles, it is refreshing when some try to dress modestly. In Balykchy, a city in Kyrgyzstan, formerly a republic of the Soviet Union, a group of youngsters decided to have their picture taken in the type of attire they had seen on the cover of the book Questions Young People Ask—Answers That Work. The youths went to a professional photographer and asked her for a group picture that would look like the one on the book’s cover. The accompanying picture is the one she took.
After the photo session, the youths left the book with the photographer. At the time, she expressed little interest, as she did not believe in the Bible. However, when the youths returned to the studio a few days later to pick up the picture, she commented that she had never read such a book in her life. She said that she never realized that the Bible gave such practical counsel, and she wanted to know more. As a result, she began to study the Bible.

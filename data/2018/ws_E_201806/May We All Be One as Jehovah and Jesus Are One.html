<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb">JESUS was concerned about unity during his last meal with his apostles. When he was praying with them, he said that he wanted his disciples to be one, or united, just as he and his Father are united. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:20-43:17:21" data-bid="2-1" class="b"><strong>John 17:20, 21</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>If Jesus’ disciples were united, this would prove to others that Jehovah had sent Jesus to the earth. People would identify Jesus’ true disciples by their love for one another, and this love would make them more united.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:13:34-43:13:35" data-bid="3-1" class="b">John 13:34, 35</a>.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>We can understand why Jesus talked a lot about unity that night. He had noticed that his apostles were not completely united. For example, the apostles argued about “which one of them was considered to be the greatest,” as they had done before. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:22:24-42:22:27" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Luke 22:24-27;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:9:33-41:9:34" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Mark 9:33, 34</a>) Another time, James and John had asked Jesus to give them prominent places in the heavenly Kingdom, right next to him.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:10:35-41:10:40" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Mark 10:35-40</a>.</p>

<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>Even Jesus experienced prejudice. When Philip told Nathanael that he had found the Messiah, Nathanael said: “Can anything good come out of Nazareth?” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:1:46-43:1:46" data-bid="6-1" class="b">John 1:46</a>) Nathanael probably knew that the Messiah would be born in Bethlehem, as the prophecy at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/33:5:2-33:5:2" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Micah 5:2</a> had said. He may have thought that Nazareth was not important enough to be the Messiah’s hometown. Also, there were prominent Judeans who looked down on Jesus because he came from Galilee. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:7:52-43:7:52" data-bid="8-1" class="b">John 7:52</a>) Many Judeans thought that people from Galilee were inferior. Other Jews tried to insult Jesus by calling him a Samaritan. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:8:48-43:8:48" data-bid="9-1" class="b">John 8:48</a>) The Samaritans were from a different nation, and their religion was different from the religion of the Jews.

<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>The Jewish religious leaders also disrespected Jesus’ followers. The Pharisees called them “accursed people.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:7:47-43:7:49" data-bid="11-1" class="b">John 7:47-49</a>) The Pharisees viewed anyone who did not study at the Jewish religious schools and who did not follow their traditions as worthless and ordinary. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:4:13-44:4:13" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Acts 4:13</a>, footnote) Jesus and his disciples experienced prejudice because people at that time were proud of their religion, their position in society, and their race. This prejudice also influenced the disciples and their view of others. To remain united, they would have to change their way of thinking.</p>
<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu"> <strong>6. </strong>Use examples to show how prejudice can affect us.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>Today, the world around us is full of prejudice. People may be prejudiced against us, or we might be somewhat prejudiced against others. A sister who is now a pioneer in Australia says: <span id="page11" class="pageNum" data-no="11" data-before-text="11"></span>“My hatred for white people grew as I focused on the injustice that was inflicted on the Aboriginal people​—past and present.” Her hatred also grew because of the way some had mistreated her.

<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu"> <strong>7. </strong>What did Jesus do about prejudice?</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>As in Jesus’ day, feelings of prejudice today are often very strong and hard to change. What did Jesus do about such feelings? First, he never became prejudiced himself. He was always impartial. He preached to rich and poor, to Pharisees and Samaritans, and even to tax collectors and sinners. Second, Jesus taught his disciples and showed them by his example that they should not be suspicious of others or prejudiced against them.</p>

<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>Jesus taught an important principle that is the basis for our unity. He told his disciples: “All of you are brothers.” <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:23:8-40:23:9" data-bid="13-1" class="b"><strong>Matthew 23:8, 9</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>In one sense, we are all brothers because we are all children of Adam. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:17:26-44:17:26" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Acts 17:26</a>) Jesus explained that his disciples were also brothers and sisters because they all acknowledged Jehovah as their heavenly Father. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:12:50-40:12:50" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Matthew 12:50</a>) And they had all become part of God’s family and were united by love and faith. That is why the apostles called other Christians their brothers and sisters in their letters to the congregations.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:1:13-45:1:13" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Romans 1:13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:2:17-60:2:17" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> 1 Peter 2:17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:3:13-62:3:13" data-bid="16-3" class="b"> 1 John 3:13</a>.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span>​—See footnote.</p>

<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>After Jesus told his disciples that they should view one another as brothers and sisters, he emphasized that they had to be humble. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:23:11-40:23:12" data-bid="17-1" class="b"><strong>Matthew 23:11, 12</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>As we have already learned, at times pride divided the apostles. And in Jesus’ day, people were very proud of their race. Many Jews believed that they were better than others because they were children of Abraham. But John the Baptist told them: “God is able to raise up children for Abraham from these stones.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:3:8-42:3:8" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Luke 3:8</a>.</p>

</div>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>Jesus taught that it is wrong for people to be proud of their race. He made that clear when a scribe asked him: “Who really is my neighbor?” To answer that question, Jesus told a story. A Jew was beaten by thieves and left on the road. Although some Jews passed by this man, they did not help him. But a Samaritan felt sorry for the Jew and took care of him. Jesus ended his story by telling the scribe that he needed to be like that Samaritan. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:10:25-42:10:37" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Luke 10:25-37</a>) Jesus showed that a <span id="page12" class="pageNum" data-no="12" data-before-text="12"></span>Samaritan could teach the Jews what it meant to love their neighbor.</p>
<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu"><strong>11. </strong>Why did Jesus’ disciples need to be impartial, and how did he help them understand that?</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>Before Jesus went to heaven, he told his disciples to preach in “all Judea and Samaria, and to the most distant part of the earth.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:1:8-44:1:8" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Acts 1:8</a>) In order to do that, Jesus’ disciples would have to overcome their pride and prejudice. Jesus had often talked about good qualities in foreigners, and this prepared his disciples to preach to all nations. For example, he praised a foreign army officer who had outstanding faith. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:8:5-40:8:10" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Matthew 8:5-10</a>) In his hometown of Nazareth, Jesus explained how Jehovah had helped foreigners, such as the Phoenician widow from Zarephath and the Syrian leper Naaman. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:4:25-42:4:27" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Luke 4:25-27</a>) Jesus also preached to a Samaritan woman and even spent two days in a Samaritan town because the people were interested in his message.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:4:21-43:4:24" data-bid="23-1" class="b">John 4:21-24,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:4:40-43:4:40" data-bid="23-2" class="b"> 40</a>.</p>

<p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>It was not easy for the apostles to overcome their prejudice. They were surprised that Jesus was willing to teach a Samaritan woman.

Perhaps because Jewish religious leaders would not talk to a woman in public, and certainly not to a Samaritan woman with a bad reputation. The apostles told Jesus to eat, but Jesus had enjoyed talking to this woman so much that eating was not important to him. God wanted him to preach, and doing what his Father wanted, even preaching to a Samaritan woman, was like food for him.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:4:31-43:4:34" data-bid="25-1" class="b">John 4:31-34</a>.</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>James and John did not understand this important lesson. When the disciples were traveling with Jesus through Samaria, they looked for a place to spend the night in a Samaritan village. But the Samaritans would not let them sleep there. James and John became so angry that they asked Jesus if he wanted them to send fire from heaven to destroy the entire village. Jesus strongly corrected them. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:9:51-42:9:56" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Luke 9:51-56</a>) Maybe James and John would not have become so angry if this had happened in their home area of Galilee. They were angry probably because they were prejudiced. Later, when John was preaching to the Samaritans and many listened to him, he might have felt embarrassed about the way he had reacted before.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:8:14-44:8:14" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Acts 8:14,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:8:25-44:8:25" data-bid="27-2" class="b"> 25</a>.</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:6:1-44:6:1" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Acts 6:1</a>) This may have happened because of prejudice about language. The apostles solved the problem quickly.

Before that, the apostle Peter had usually spent his time only with Jews.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:2:11-48:2:14" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Galatians 2:11-14</a>) Paul corrected Peter, and Peter accepted the correction. How do we know?

In fact, the first Christians became known for their love for one another. About the year 200, the writer Tertullian quoted what other people said about Christians: “They love one another,” and “They are ready even to die for one another.” Because those Christians put on “the new personality,” they learned to view all people as equal, the way God views them.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:3:10-51:3:11" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Colossians 3:10, 11</a>.</p>

But I am still learning to overcome prejudice toward others, and it is not always easy. That is why I continue praying about it.” A sister in Spain explains that sometimes she still has to fight negative feelings about a certain group of people. She says: “I succeed most of the time. But I know that I need to keep on fighting. Thanks to Jehovah, I am happy to belong to a united family.” All of us need to think carefully about how we feel.

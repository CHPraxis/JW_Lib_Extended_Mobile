<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[32]" class="sb">WE ARE so excited to hear how God’s servants are letting their light shine! Last year, Jehovah’s people conducted more than 10,000,000 Bible studies. And millions of newly interested ones came to the Memorial and learned about Jehovah’s loving gift of the ransom.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:4:9-62:4:9" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 John 4:9</a>.</p>

<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb"><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>All over the earth, Jehovah’s Witnesses speak many different languages. But this does not stop us from praising Jehovah as one united family. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:7:9-66:7:9" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Revelation 7:9</a>) No matter what language we speak or where we live, we can shine “as illuminators in the world.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:2:15-50:2:15" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Philippians 2:15</a>.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb"><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>Our ministry, our Christian unity, and our sense of urgency all bring glory to Jehovah.

<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>Preaching and making disciples is an important way we let our light shine. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:28:19-40:28:20" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Matthew 28:19, 20</a>) In 1925, the article “Light in the Darkness” stated that during the last days, no one could be faithful to the Lord if he did not take “the opportunity of letting his light shine.” Then it said: “He must do this by telling the good news to the peoples of the earth, and by conforming himself to the ways of light.” (<em>The Watch Tower, </em>June 1, 1925) In addition to our preaching, our conduct brings glory to Jehovah. Many people notice us when we preach. When we smile at them and say a warm hello, it helps them think well of us and the God we worship.</p>
<div class="blockTxt rule"><p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="sc">Our preaching and our conduct bring glory to Jehovah</p>

<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>Jesus told his disciples: “When you enter the house, greet the household.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:10:12-40:10:12" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Matthew 10:12</a>) In the area where Jesus preached, it was the custom for people to invite strangers into their home. In many places today, this is no longer the custom. People are often nervous or irritated when they see a stranger at their door. But if we are friendly and kind, they may feel more relaxed. When you are doing public witnessing using a literature cart, have you ever noticed that if you smile and greet people in a friendly way, they feel more comfortable coming and taking a publication? They may even want to start a conversation!</p>
<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu"> <strong>6. </strong>What helps one older couple stay active in the ministry?</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>An older couple in England can no longer preach from house to house as much as they used to because their health is not very good. So they set up a table with literature just outside their house. They live near a school, so they put out literature that will appeal to the parents who come to pick up their children. Some parents have taken these publications, including <em>Questions Young People Ask​—Answers That Work, </em>Volumes 1 and 2. A pioneer sister often joins the couple. The parents notice that she is friendly and that the couple really want to help others. One parent has even started to study the Bible.</p>

<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>Recently, many have had to flee from their homeland and now live in other countries as refugees. What can you do to help refugees in your area learn about Jehovah? First, you could learn how to say hello in their language. In addition, by using the <em>JW Language </em>app, you could learn a few phrases that might make them want to stop and talk with you. Then, you <span id="page23" class="pageNum" data-no="23" data-before-text="23"></span>could show them videos and publications that are available in their language on jw.org.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:10:19-5:10:19" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 10:19</a>.</p>

<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>Jehovah gives us exactly what we need to be effective when we preach. For example, what we learn at the Life and Ministry Meeting helps us feel more confident about making return visits and starting Bible studies.</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>When visitors come to our meetings, they are often impressed with the comments that our children make. You can teach your children to comment in their own words.

For example, if you are a parent, arrange to have a regular Family Worship evening. Many families watch JW Broadcasting together, and afterward they discuss how they can use what they learned.

<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>Even if you are young, you can help to make everyone in the congregation feel needed. One way is by making friends with older brothers and sisters. Ask them what has helped them to keep serving Jehovah over many years. They can teach you very valuable lessons. This will encourage both them and you! And all of us, whether we are young or old, can make visitors to our Kingdom Hall feel welcome. You can say hello, give them a nice smile, help them find a seat, and introduce them to others. Make them feel at home.</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>If you are assigned to conduct meetings for field service, you can help older ones keep their light shining brightly. Make sure that they have suitable territory. Arrange for younger people to work with them. Older brothers and sisters and those with health problems often feel discouraged that they cannot preach as much as they used to. But they will feel much better when they know that you care about them and understand their situation. No matter how old they are or how long they have been in the truth, your kindness can encourage them to keep preaching with zeal.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:19:32-3:19:32" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Leviticus 19:32</a>.</p>

In a similar way, we can refresh our brothers and sisters by being pleasant and kind. This makes the congregation more united.

<p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>Your light can shine no matter where you are. Your kindness could make your neighbors want to learn more about Jehovah. Ask yourself: ‘What do my neighbors think about me? Is my home neat and clean? Does it make the neighborhood look better? Am I a helpful neighbor?’ Ask other Witnesses how their kindness and good example have affected their relatives, neighbors, workmates, or schoolmates.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:5:9-49:5:9" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Ephesians 5:9</a>.</p>

<p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><strong><sup>15 </sup></strong>If we want to keep our light shining brightly, we need to be aware of the <span id="page25" class="pageNum" data-no="25" data-before-text="25"></span>time in which we live. Several times, Jesus told his disciples: “Keep on the watch.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:42-40:24:42" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Matthew 24:42;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:25:13-40:25:13" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> 25:13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:26:41-40:26:41" data-bid="15-3" class="b"> 26:41</a>) If we feel that the “great tribulation” is still far away, we will not be alert to every opportunity to help others learn about Jehovah.

<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu"><strong>16, 17. </strong>What can you do to keep your sense of urgency?</p>
<p id="p26" data-pid="26" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><strong><sup>16 </sup></strong>We need to keep on the watch now more than ever before. Conditions in the world continue to get worse. But we know that the end will come at the exact time Jehovah has chosen. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:42-40:24:44" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Matthew 24:42-44</a>) In the meantime, we need to be patient and focus on our future. Read the Bible every day, and never stop praying to Jehovah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:4:7-60:4:7" data-bid="18-1" class="b">1 Peter 4:7</a>) Learn from brothers and sisters who have served Jehovah for years.

<p id="p28" data-pid="28" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><strong><sup>18 </sup></strong>Even though we make many mistakes, Jehovah allows us to serve him. To help us, he provides “gifts in men,” the congregation elders. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:4:8-49:4:8" data-bid="20-1" class="b"><strong>Ephesians 4:8,</strong></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:4:11-49:4:12" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> <strong>11, 12</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>So when the elders visit you, take advantage of the time you have with them to learn from their wisdom and advice.</p>
<p id="p29" data-pid="29" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><strong><sup>19 </sup></strong>For example, a couple in England had some difficulties in their marriage, and they asked two elders for help. The wife felt that her husband was not taking the lead in serving Jehovah. The husband felt that he was not a good teacher and admitted that he was not arranging for regular family worship. The elders helped the couple think about Jesus’ example. They encouraged the husband to imitate the way Jesus took care of his disciples. They encouraged the wife to be patient with her husband. They also made some suggestions about how the couple could have family worship with their two children. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:5:21-49:5:29" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Ephesians 5:21-29</a>) The husband worked hard to become a better family head.

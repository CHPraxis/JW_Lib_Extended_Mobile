TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD | JOHN 11-12
Imitate Jesus’ Compassion









11:23-26, 33-35, 43, 44
What made Jesus’ compassion and empathy so remarkable?
  Although he did not experience all the circumstances of others, Jesus put himself in their place and felt their pain

  He was not ashamed to show his emotions openly

  He took the initiative to help those in need










In what ways can I show consideration for the feelings of others?
How can I help those in need?

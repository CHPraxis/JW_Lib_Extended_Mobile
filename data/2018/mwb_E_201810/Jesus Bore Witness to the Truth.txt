TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD | JOHN 18-19
Jesus Bore Witness to the Truth




18:36-38a
Jesus bore witness to the truth regarding God’s purposes
  IN WORD: He zealously preached the truth about God’s Kingdom

  IN DEED: His life course proved God’s prophetic word to be true


As Jesus’ disciples, we too bear witness to the truth
  IN WORD: We zealously preach the good news of God’s established Kingdom with Christ as King, even in the face of ridicule

  IN DEED: We show by our strict neutrality and godly conduct that we support Jesus’ kingship





ASK YOURSELF, ‘Is it obvious to those around me that my life is centered on bearing witness to the truth?’

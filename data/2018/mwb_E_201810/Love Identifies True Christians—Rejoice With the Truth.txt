LIVING AS CHRISTIANS
Love Identifies True Christians​—Rejoice With the Truth




WHY IMPORTANT: In imitation of Jesus, we must bear witness to the truth regarding God’s purposes. (Joh 18:37) We must also rejoice with the truth, speak the truth, and consider whatever things are true, despite living in a world full of falsehood and unrighteousness.​—1Co 13:6; Php 4:8.
HOW TO DO IT:
  Be determined not to listen to or spread harmful gossip.​—1Th 4:11

  Do not rejoice over another’s calamity

  Take delight in positive, encouraging things

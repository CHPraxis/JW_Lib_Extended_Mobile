LIVING AS CHRISTIANS
Love Identifies True Christians​—Protect Precious Unity




WHY IMPORTANT: On the night before his death, Jesus prayed that his disciples would “be completely unified.” (Joh 17:23, ftn.) To remain united, we must display love, which “does not keep account of the injury.”​—1Co 13:5.
HOW TO DO IT:
  Imitate Jehovah by looking for the good in others

  Forgive freely

  After resolving a matter, do not bring it up again.​—Pr 17:9


WATCH THE VIDEO “HAVE LOVE AMONG YOURSELVES”​—DO NOT KEEP ACCOUNT OF THE INJURY, AND THEN ANSWER THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS:
  In the first part of the video, how did Helen indicate that she was ‘keeping account of the injury’?

  In the second part of the video, how did Helen overcome her negative thinking and develop a positive viewpoint?

  Ultimately, how did Helen add to the unity of the congregation?










Whom do we hurt the most if we keep account of the injury?




BIBLE EXAMPLE FOR MEDITATION: The apostle Paul recognized John Mark’s good qualities, even though John Mark had disappointed him earlier.​—Ac 13:13; 15:37, 38; 2Ti 4:11.
ASK YOURSELF, ‘How can I show confidence in someone who has disappointed me?’

TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD | JOHN 15-17
“You Are No Part of the World”




15:19, 21; 16:33
  Jesus conquered the world by not becoming like it in any respect

  Jesus’ followers would need courage to remain undefiled by the attitudes and actions of the people in the world around them

  Meditating on Jesus’ example as a conqueror can give us the courage we need to imitate him





What situations may test my remaining separate from the world?
What kinds of media content could have a negative effect on my efforts to remain separate from the world?

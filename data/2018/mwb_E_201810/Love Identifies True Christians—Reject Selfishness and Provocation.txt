LIVING AS CHRISTIANS
Love Identifies True Christians​—Reject Selfishness and Provocation




WHY IMPORTANT: Jesus taught that love would identify his disciples. (Joh 13:34, 35) To display Christlike love, we must look out for the interests of others and avoid becoming provoked.​—1Co 13:5.
HOW TO DO IT:
  When someone says or does something hurtful, pause and analyze the cause of the problem and the consequences of your intended action.​—Pr 19:11

  Remember that we are all imperfect, and at times we say or do things that we later regret

  Resolve differences promptly

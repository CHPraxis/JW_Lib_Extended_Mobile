<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb">JESUS CHRIST was a carpenter and a minister. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:6:3-41:6:3" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Mark 6:3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:15:8-45:15:8" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Rom. 15:8</a>) He perfectly mastered both trades. As a woodworker, he learned how to handle the tools of the trade, to turn lumber into useful products. As a teacher of the good news, he skillfully used his keen knowledge of the Scriptures to help the common people understand the truths of God’s Word. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:7:28-40:7:28" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matt. 7:28;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:24:32-42:24:32" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Luke 24:32,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:24:45-42:24:45" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> 45</a>) At 30 years of age, Jesus laid aside his carpenter’s tools because he knew that being a minister was the more important occupation. He said that the work of declaring the good news of the Kingdom of God was one reason why God sent him to the earth. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:20:28-40:20:28" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Matt. 20:28;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:3:23-42:3:23" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Luke 3:23;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:4:43-42:4:43" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> 4:43</a>) Jesus made the ministry the primary focus of his life, and he wanted others to join him in that work.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:9:35-40:9:38" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Matt. 9:35-38</a>.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>We may not be carpenters, but we certainly are ministers of the good news. That occupation is so important that God is involved; we are called “God’s fellow workers.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:3:9-46:3:9" data-bid="6-1" class="b">1 Cor. 3:9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:6:4-47:6:4" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 2 Cor. 6:4</a>) We acknowledge that “the very essence of [Jehovah’s] word is truth.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:119:159-19:119:160" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ps. 119:159, 160</a>) That is why we want to be sure that we are “handling the word of the truth aright” <span id="page12" class="pageNum" data-no="12" data-before-text="12"></span>in our ministry. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:2:15-55:2:15" data-bid="8-1" class="b"><strong>2 Timothy 2:15</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>To that end, we keep honing our skills in using the Bible, the principal tool that we use to teach the truth about Jehovah, Jesus, and the Kingdom. To help us succeed in our ministry, Jehovah’s organization has designated other basic tools that we need to be very familiar with. We refer to them as being in our Teaching Toolbox.</p>
<p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="qu"> <strong>3. </strong>On what should we focus during the remaining time that we have to witness, and how does <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:13:48-44:13:48" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Acts 13:48</a> help us to do that?</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>You may wonder why it is called a Teaching Toolbox and not a Preaching Toolbox. To “preach” means to declare a message; but to “teach” means to sound that message down into a person’s mind and heart, so that he will act on what he learns. During the remaining time that we have to witness, our focus must be on starting Bible studies and teaching people the truth. That means earnestly looking for all those who are “rightly disposed for everlasting life” and helping them to become believers.​—<strong>Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:13:44-44:13:48" data-bid="9-1" class="b"><strong>Acts 13:44-48</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>
<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu"> <strong>4. </strong>How can we know who are “rightly disposed for everlasting life,” and how can we find them?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>How can we know who are “rightly disposed for everlasting life”? As in the first century, the only way to find those people is to give a witness. Thus, we need to do just as Jesus instructed: “Into whatever city or village you enter, search out who in it is deserving.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:10:11-40:10:11" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Matt. 10:11</a>) We do not expect insincere people, haughty individuals, or those with no spiritual inclination to respond favorably to the good news. We are looking for people who are honest, humble, and hungry for the truth. We can liken this search to what Jesus as a carpenter might have done in looking for just the right wood for making furniture, doors, yokes, or other things. Once he found suitable material, he could get his toolbox, use his skill, and make the item. We must do likewise as we endeavor to make disciples of honesthearted people.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:28:19-40:28:20" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Matt. 28:19, 20</a>.</p>
<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu"> <strong>5. </strong>What do we need to know about the tools in our Teaching Toolbox? Illustrate. (See opening pictures.)</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>As in any toolbox, each tool has a specific purpose. Take as an example the carpentry tools Jesus would have used.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> He needed tools to measure and mark lumber; to cut, drill, and shape the wood; and to level, plumb, and fasten the pieces. Likewise, each tool in our Teaching Toolbox has a specific purpose. So let us look in our toolbox and see how to use these essential tools that we have been given.</p>

</div>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><strong><sup>7 </sup>Invitations. </strong>What we commonly refer to as the congregation meeting invitation serves a dual purpose. It states: <span id="page13" class="pageNum" data-no="13" data-before-text="13"></span>“You are invited to study the Bible with Jehovah’s Witnesses.” Then it gives the option of doing that “at our public meetings” “or with a personal instructor.” Thus, this tool not only identifies us but also invites others who are “conscious of their spiritual need” to study the Bible with us. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:5:3-40:5:3" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Matt. 5:3</a>) Of course, people are welcome to attend our meetings whether they accept a Bible study or not. If they do attend, they will see and hear what we have to offer in the way of true Bible education.</p>
<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu"> <strong>8. </strong>How important is it for people to come to at least one of our meetings? Give an example.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>It is important that we continue to invite people to attend our meetings at least once. Why? They will see a sharp contrast between the spiritually rich environment at our meetings and the spiritually devastated condition within Babylon the Great. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:65:13-23:65:13" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Isa. 65:13</a>) Ray and Linda, a married couple in the United States, noted this some years ago. They decided that they needed to start going to church. They believed in God and felt a spiritual need, so they began going to all the churches in their city one by one. There were scores of churches and many denominations. From the start, the couple decided on two conditions that had to apply to any church they might join. First, they would have to learn something during the religious service, and second, the members of the church must look like people who claim to represent God. After several years, they had gone to every church in town, but they were sorely disappointed. They had not learned anything, and the churchgoers were far from dignified in their appearance. After walking out of the last church on their list, Linda went to her job and Ray went home. On his way, he drove by a Kingdom Hall and thought, ‘Why not go in and see what they’re all about?’ Of course, that was the best experience of all! Everyone at the Kingdom Hall was warm and friendly and dressed very appropriately. Ray sat in the front row and loved what he learned! It was just as the apostle Paul said about the person who comes into a Christian meeting for the first time and declares: “God is really among you.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:14:23-46:14:25" data-bid="14-1" class="b">1 Cor. 14:23-25</a>) Ray attended every Sunday after that; then he came to every midweek meeting. Linda also began attending, and while in their 70’s, they accepted a Bible study and got baptized.</p>

Since these tracts began to be released in 2013, some five billion of them have been printed! The beauty of these tools is that when you learn how to use one of them, you are able to use all of them because they follow the same format.

<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>You might choose to use the tract <em>What Is the Kingdom of God?</em> Show the person the question on the front as you ask: “Have you ever wondered what the Kingdom of God is?

<p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><strong><sup>14 </sup>Videos. </strong>In Jesus’ day, a carpenter used only hand tools. These days, however, woodworkers also have power tools​—saws, drills, sanders, nailers, and more. In addition to printed publications, we now have beautiful videos to show people​—four of which are in our toolbox: <a href="http://www.jw.org/finder?docID=502018807&amp;prefer=content&amp;wtlocale=E"><strong><em>Why Study the Bible?,</em></strong></a><a href="http://www.jw.org/finder?docID=502014311&amp;prefer=content&amp;wtlocale=E"> <strong><em>What Happens at a Bible Study?,</em></strong></a><a href="http://www.jw.org/finder?docID=502014315&amp;prefer=content&amp;wtlocale=E"> <strong><em>What Happens at a Kingdom Hall?</em></strong></a><strong><em>, </em></strong>and <a href="http://www.jw.org/finder?docID=1102017423&amp;prefer=content&amp;wtlocale=E"><strong><em>Jehovah’s Witnesses​—Who Are We?</em></strong></a> The videos that are less than two minutes in length work well on the initial call.

<p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu"><strong>15. </strong>Illustrate the impact that watching one of our videos in their own language can have on people.</p>
<p id="p26" data-pid="26" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><strong><sup>15 </sup></strong>To illustrate, when a sister met a woman who had moved from Micronesia and whose first language is Yapese, our sister showed her <a href="http://www.jw.org/finder?docID=502018807&amp;prefer=content&amp;wtlocale=E"><em>Why Study the Bible?</em></a> in her language. When the video began <span id="page15" class="pageNum" data-no="15" data-before-text="15"></span>playing, the woman said: “This is my language. I can’t believe it! I can tell from his accent that he is from my island. He speaks my language!” After that, she said that she was going to read and watch everything in her language on jw.org.

A sister in the United States sent to her nephew overseas a link to the same video in his language.

Our goal is to make disciples of people who are honest, humble, and spiritually hungry​—people who are “rightly disposed for everlasting life.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:13:48-44:13:48" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Acts 13:48;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:28:19-40:28:20" data-bid="23-2" class="b"> Matt. 28:19, 20</a>.</p>

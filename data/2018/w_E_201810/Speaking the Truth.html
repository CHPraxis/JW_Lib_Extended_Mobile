<p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="qu"><strong>1, 2. </strong>What device has had the worst possible effect on humankind, and who was responsible for it?</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb">THE telephone, the electric light bulb, the automobile, and the refrigerator are just some of the inventions that have improved everyday life. Other innovations, though, have made life more dangerous​—gunpowder, land mines, cigarettes, and the atomic bomb, to name a few. However, there is a device that predates all of them and that has had the worst possible effect on humankind. What is it? The lie! That is, saying something that one knows is not true in order to deceive someone else. And who devised the first lie? Jesus Christ identified “the Devil” as “the father of the lie.” <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:8:44-43:8:44" data-bid="2-1" class="b"><strong>John 8:44</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>When did he utter the first lie?</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb"><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>It happened thousands of years ago in the garden of Eden. The first human couple, Adam and Eve, were enjoying life in the Paradise that their Creator had provided for them. Then, the Devil entered the scene. He knew that God had commanded the couple not to eat from “the tree of the knowledge of good and bad,” lest they die for their disobedience. Even so, through a serpent, Satan told Eve: “You certainly will not die [the first lie ever told]. For God knows that in the very day you eat from it, your eyes will be opened and you will be like God, knowing good and bad.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:2:15-1:2:17" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Gen. 2:15-17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:3:1-1:3:5" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 3:1-5</a>.</p>
<p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="qu"> <strong>3. </strong>Why can it be said that Satan’s lie was malicious, and what has resulted from it?</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><span id="page7" class="pageNum" data-no="7" data-before-text="7"></span><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>Satan’s lie was malicious because he knew full well that if Eve believed him and ate the fruit, she would die. Eve and Adam both disobeyed Jehovah’s command and eventually died. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:3:6-1:3:6" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Gen. 3:6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:5:5-1:5:5" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 5:5</a>) More than that, through such sin, “death spread to all men.” In fact, “death ruled as king . . . , even over those who had not sinned in the same way that Adam transgressed.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:5:12-45:5:12" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Rom. 5:12,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:5:14-45:5:14" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 14</a>) Now, instead of being able to enjoy perfect, endless life as God had originally intended, humans are doing well if they live “70 years, or 80 if one is especially strong.” Even then, life is often “filled with trouble and sorrow.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:90:10-19:90:10" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ps. 90:10</a>) How tragic​—all resulting from Satan’s lie!</p>

<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>In explaining the Devil’s actions, Jesus stated: “He did not stand fast in the truth, because truth is not in him.” Truth is still not in Satan, for he continues “misleading the entire inhabited earth” with his lies. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:12:9-66:12:9" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Rev. 12:9</a>) We do not want to be misled by the Devil. Let us, then, consider three questions: How is Satan misleading humans? Why do people commonly lie? And so that we never forfeit our friendship with Jehovah, as did Adam and Eve, how can we show that we are “speaking the truth” at all times?​—<strong>Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:15:1-19:15:2" data-bid="8-1" class="b"><strong>Psalm 15:1, 2</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>

<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>The apostle Paul knew that we can avoid being “outwitted by Satan, for we are not ignorant of his intentions.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:2:11-47:2:11" data-bid="9-1" class="b">2 Cor. 2:11</a>; ftn.) We know that the whole world​—including false religion, corrupt politics, and greedy commercialism—​is under the Devil’s control. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:5:19-62:5:19" data-bid="10-1" class="b">1 John 5:19</a>) We are not surprised, then, that Satan and his demons would influence men in powerful positions to “speak lies.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:4:1-54:4:2" data-bid="11-1" class="b">1 Tim. 4:1, 2</a>) That certainly is true of people in big business who promote harmful products and fraudulent schemes through false advertising.</p>
<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu"><strong>6, 7. </strong>(a) Why are religious leaders who lie especially guilty? (b) What lies have you heard religious leaders tell?</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>Religious leaders who lie are especially guilty because they endanger the future life prospects of those who believe their lies. If an individual accepts a false teaching and practices something that is actually condemned by God, it can cost that person his eternal life. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/28:4:9-28:4:9" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Hos. 4:9</a>) Jesus knew that the religious leaders in his day were guilty of such deception. He told them to their face: “Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because you travel over sea and dry land to make one convert, and when he becomes one, you make him a subject for Gehenna [everlasting destruction] twice as much so as yourselves.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:23:15-40:23:15" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Matt. 23:15</a>; ftn.) Jesus condemned those false religious leaders in the strongest terms. They truly were ‘from their father the Devil, a murderer.’​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:8:44-43:8:44" data-bid="14-1" class="b">John 8:44</a>.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>Whether called pastors, priests, rabbis, swamis, or by some other title, religious leaders abound in the world today. Like their first-century counterparts, they are “suppressing the truth” from God’s Word and have “exchanged the truth of God for the lie.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:1:18-45:1:18" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Rom. 1:18,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:1:25-45:1:25" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> 25</a>) They promote such false teachings as <span id="page8" class="pageNum" data-no="8" data-before-text="8"></span>“once saved, always saved,” the immortality of the human soul, reincarnation, and the foolish idea that God would condone homosexual lifestyles and same-sex marriages.</p>
<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu"> <strong>8. </strong>What lie do we expect politicians to tell one day soon, but how should we react to it?</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>Politicians have used lies to mislead mankind. One of the biggest lies is yet to be heard when men proclaim that they have achieved “peace and security!” But “then sudden destruction is to be instantly on them.” May we not be taken in by their attempt to minimize how precarious this system of things really is! In truth, we “know very well that Jehovah’s day is coming exactly as a thief in the night.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/52:5:1-52:5:4" data-bid="16-1" class="b">1 Thess. 5:1-4</a>.</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu"><strong>9, 10. </strong>(a) Why do people lie, and in what does that result? (b) What should we remember about Jehovah?</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>When a new invention or innovation becomes popular, it is eventually mass-produced. The same has happened with the lie. Spreading lies has become commonplace in today’s society, and influential people are not the only ones who deceive others. As stated in the article “Why We Lie” by Y. Bhattacharjee, “lying has come to be recognized as a deeply ingrained human trait.” People often resort to lying either to protect themselves or to promote themselves. They lie to cover up their mistakes and misdeeds or to gain economic and personal advantages. As the article states, there are people who “lie with ease, in ways big and small, to strangers, co-workers, friends, and loved ones.”</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>What is the result of all this lying? Trust is lost and relationships can be ruined. Imagine how disheartening it is, for example, when a wife cheats on her faithful husband and lies to cover up the immoral affair. Or when an abusive man mistreats his wife and children in private but in public puts on the pretense of being a model family man. However, we should remember that such deceitful people cannot keep anything secret from Jehovah, for “all things are naked and openly exposed” to him.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:4:13-58:4:13" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Heb. 4:13</a>.</p>

<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>As an example, the Bible tells of how “Satan emboldened” a Christian couple in the first century to lie to God. Ananias and Sapphira schemed in their hearts to deceive the apostles. They sold some property but brought only part of the proceeds of the sale to the apostles. The couple wanted to make themselves look good in the congregation, appearing to be more generous with their donation than they really were. Yet, Jehovah could see what they had done, and he punished them accordingly.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:5:1-44:5:10" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Acts 5:1-10</a>.</p>

<p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>We know that Jehovah “is not a mere man who tells lies.” In fact, “it is impossible for God to lie.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:23:19-4:23:19" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Num. 23:19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:6:18-58:6:18" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> Heb. 6:18</a>) “Jehovah hates . . . a lying <span id="page9" class="pageNum" data-no="9" data-before-text="9"></span>tongue.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:6:16-20:6:17" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Prov. 6:16, 17</a>) To have his approval, we must live by his standard of truthfulness.

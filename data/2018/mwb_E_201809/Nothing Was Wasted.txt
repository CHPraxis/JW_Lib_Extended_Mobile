LIVING AS CHRISTIANS
Nothing Was Wasted




After Jesus miraculously fed 5,000 men plus women and children, he instructed his disciples: “Gather together the fragments left over, so that nothing is wasted.” (Joh 6:12) Jesus showed appreciation for Jehovah’s provisions by not wasting them.
In modern times, the Governing Body strives to imitate Jesus by making wise use of dedicated resources. For example, when building world headquarters in Warwick, New York, the brothers chose designs that allowed for the best use of donated funds.

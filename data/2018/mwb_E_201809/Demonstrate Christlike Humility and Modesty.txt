LIVING AS CHRISTIANS
Demonstrate Christlike Humility and Modesty









Even though Jesus was the greatest man who ever lived, he showed humility and modesty by glorifying Jehovah. (Joh 7:16-18) On the other hand, Satan became the Devil, which means “Slanderer.” (Joh 8:44) Satan’s attitude was manifested by the Pharisees, whose pride caused them to belittle anyone who showed faith in the Messiah. (Joh 7:45-49) How can we imitate Jesus when we receive privileges or responsibilities in the congregation?

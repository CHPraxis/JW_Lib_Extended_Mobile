<ul><li><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="su">  Be friendly and speak to people. Although tired, Jesus started his conversation by simply asking for a drink. So you can begin with a warm greeting and then perhaps comment on the weather or a current event. Remember, the initial goal is just to start a conversation, so talk about any subject that might be of interest to the person. If he or she does not respond, nothing is lost. Try again with someone else. Ask Jehovah for courage.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:2:4-16:2:4" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ne 2:4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:4:29-44:4:29" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Ac 4:29</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="su">  Be alert for an opportunity to introduce the good news, but do not be in a hurry. Allow the conversation to develop naturally. If you force matters, the person may become uneasy and stop conversing. Do not be disappointed if the conversation ends before you can give a witness. If the idea of trying to introduce the good news intimidates you, practice starting conversations without the goal of giving a witness.

</li>
<li><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="su">  Try creating an opportunity for a witness by making a heartfelt statement about your faith that might prompt the listener to ask for an explanation. Jesus made intriguing statements that moved the woman to ask questions. When he eventually introduced the good news, he was merely answering her questions.

<div class="boxContent"><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sc">Starting a conversation is much like playing a game of catch. Both require at least two participants and are relatively easy to initiate. At your next opportunity, “toss” someone your words, and see if you can start a conversation.</p>

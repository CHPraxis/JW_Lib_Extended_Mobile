Jesus Glorified His Father




7:15-18, 28, 29; 8:29
In all that he said and did, Jesus glorified his heavenly Father. Jesus wanted people to know that his message came from God. So he made the Scriptures the basis for his teaching and frequently quoted from them. When praised, Jesus deflected the acclaim from himself and directed it to Jehovah. His primary concern was to accomplish the work Jehovah had given him to do.​—Joh 17:4.

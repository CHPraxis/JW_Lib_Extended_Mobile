<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="noTopMargin">When Jesus gave an illustration that the disciples found difficult to understand, some were stumbled and would no longer walk with him. Just one day earlier, Jesus had fed them miraculously, confirming that his power was from God. So why did they stumble? Apparently, their motive for following Jesus was selfish. They were associating with Jesus for material advantage.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="se">Each of us should ask himself: ‘Why do I follow Jesus? Is it primarily because of current and future blessings? Or is it because I love Jehovah and want to please him?’</p>

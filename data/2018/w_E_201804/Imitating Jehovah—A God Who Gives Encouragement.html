<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>Even before Jehovah’s Son came to earth and set a perfect example of how to impart encouragement, faithful servants of Jehovah were conscious of the need to be encouraging. When threatened by the Assyrians, Hezekiah assembled the military chiefs and the people of Judah to encourage them. “And the people were strengthened by [his] words.”​—<strong>Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:32:6-14:32:8" data-bid="16-1" class="b"><strong>2 Chronicles 32:6-8</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>

<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>Although in need of consolation himself, Job gave his three “troublesome comforters” a lesson in giving encouragement.

<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>Another example in ancient times of someone in need of encouragement is Jephthah’s daughter. Before going out to combat the Ammonites, Judge Jephthah vowed that if Jehovah gave him the victory, the first person who would come out to meet him after the battle would be devoted to Jehovah’s service at the sanctuary. It so happened that it was his daughter, his only child, who came out to celebrate his victory with him. Jephthah’s heart was broken. But he kept his vow and sent his virgin daughter to Shiloh to serve at the tabernacle for the rest of her life.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:11:30-7:11:35" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Judg. 11:30-35</a>.</p>

If anyone, then, needed comfort and encouragement, she did. The Bible account states: “It became a custom in Israel: From year to year, the young women of Israel would go to give commendation to the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite four days in the year.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:11:39-7:11:40" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Judg. 11:39, 40</a>) Do not unmarried Christians who use their singleness to give greater attention to “the things of the Lord” also deserve commendation and encouragement?​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:7:32-46:7:35" data-bid="22-1" class="b">1 Cor. 7:32-35</a>.</p>

<p id="p30" data-pid="30" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><strong><sup>18 </sup></strong>The first-century governing body proved to be a source of encouragement both to those taking the lead and to Christians in general. When Philip the evangelizer preached about Christ to the Samaritans, he received the full backing of those on the governing body.

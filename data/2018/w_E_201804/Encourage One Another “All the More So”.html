<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu"> <strong>1. </strong>Why did the apostle Paul exhort the early Hebrew Christians to encourage one another “all the more so”?</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb">WHY should we intensify our efforts to be encouraging? The apostle Paul gives us the reason in his letter to Hebrew Christians. He told them: “Let us consider one another so as to incite to love and fine works, not forsaking our meeting together, as some have the custom, but encouraging one another, and <em>all the more so as you see the day drawing near.” </em>(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:10:24-58:10:25" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Heb. 10:24, 25</a>) Within just five years, Jewish Christians living in Jerusalem would see a “day of Jehovah” approaching and recognize the sign Jesus had given them to flee for their lives from that city. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:2:19-44:2:20" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Acts 2:19, 20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:21:20-42:21:22" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Luke 21:20-22</a>) That day of Jehovah arrived in 70 C.E. when the Romans executed Jehovah’s judgment on Jerusalem.</p>
<p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="qu"> <strong>2. </strong>Why should we today be increasingly concerned about encouraging one another?</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>Today, we have every reason to believe that the “great and very awe-inspiring” day of Jehovah is near. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/29:2:11-29:2:11" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Joel 2:11</a>) The prophet Zephaniah said: “The great day of Jehovah is near! <span id="page21" class="pageNum" data-no="21" data-before-text="21"></span>It is near and it is approaching very quickly!” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/36:1:14-36:1:14" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Zeph. 1:14</a>) That prophetic warning also applies to our time. In view of the proximity of Jehovah’s day, Paul tells us to “be concerned about one another so as to incite to love and fine works.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:10:24-58:10:24" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Heb. 10:24</a>, ftn.) We should, therefore, be increasingly interested in our brothers, so that we can encourage them whenever needed.</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu"> <strong>3. </strong>What did the apostle Paul state about encouragement? (See opening picture.)</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>“Anxiety in a man’s heart weighs it down, but a good word cheers it up.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:12:25-20:12:25" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Prov. 12:25</a>) This is true of all of us. We all need a word of encouragement from time to time. Paul showed that even one who has the responsibility of encouraging others needs to be built up himself. To Christians living in Rome, he wrote: “I am longing to see you, that I may impart some spiritual gift to you for you to be made firm; or, rather, that we may have an interchange of encouragement by one another’s faith, both yours and mine.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:1:11-45:1:12" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Rom. 1:11, 12</a>) Yes, Paul, who gave outstanding encouragement to others, at times needed to be built up himself.​—<strong>Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:15:30-45:15:32" data-bid="9-1" class="b"><strong>Romans 15:30-32</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>
<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu"><strong>4, 5. </strong>Whom can we encourage today, and why?</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>Those who live a life of self-sacrifice should be commended. Among these are the faithful pioneers. Many have made great sacrifices in order to make room in their lives for the pioneer service. The same is true of missionaries, Bethelites, circuit overseers and their wives, and those who work in remote translation offices. All of these make sacrifices in their lives in order to devote more time to sacred service. They, therefore, ought to receive encouragement. And those whose heart is still in the full-time service but who for various reasons have had to limit their activity also appreciate receiving encouragement.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>Brothers and sisters who remain single because they want to obey the admonition to marry “only in the Lord” make up another group that merits encouragement. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:7:39-46:7:39" data-bid="10-1" class="b">1 Cor. 7:39</a>) Likewise, hardworking wives appreciate hearing upbuilding words from their husbands. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:31:28-20:31:28" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Prov. 31:28,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:31:31-20:31:31" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 31</a>) Also, Christians who remain faithful through persecution or illness need to hear encouragement.

That is as it should be, for these elders are not “masters” over the faith of others but “are fellow workers” for the joy of their brothers.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:1:24-47:1:24" data-bid="15-1" class="b">2 Cor. 1:24</a>.</p>

<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>The apostle Paul set an example to be imitated. He wrote to the persecuted Christians in Thessalonica: “Having tender affection for you, we were determined to impart to you, not only the good news of God but also our very selves, because you became so beloved to us.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/52:2:8-52:2:8" data-bid="16-1" class="b">1 Thess. 2:8</a>.</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:12:15-47:12:15" data-bid="18-1" class="b">2 Cor. 12:15</a>) Similarly, elders should not only encourage and console their brothers with words but also build them up by showing sincere personal interest.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:14:3-46:14:3" data-bid="19-1" class="b">1 Cor. 14:3</a>.</p>

<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>Building one another up may involve giving counsel, but here again, elders should follow the example given in the Bible about how to give counsel in an encouraging way. An outstanding example in this respect was given by Jesus himself after his death and resurrection. He had some firm counsel to give to certain congregations in Asia Minor, but notice how he went about it. Before giving them counsel, he gave warm commendation to the congregations in Ephesus, Pergamum, and Thyatira. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:2:1-66:2:5" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Rev. 2:1-5,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:2:12-66:2:13" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> 12, 13,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:2:18-66:2:19" data-bid="20-3" class="b"> 18, 19</a>) He told the congregation in Laodicea: “All those for whom I have affection, I reprove and discipline. So be zealous and repent.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:3:19-66:3:19" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Rev. 3:19</a>) Elders would do well to imitate Christ’s example when they need to give counsel.</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:4:29-49:4:29" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Eph. 4:29</a>) Each of us should be alert to observe “the need” that others <span id="page23" class="pageNum" data-no="23" data-before-text="23"></span>have. Paul counseled Hebrew Christians: “Strengthen the hands that hang down and the feeble knees, and keep making straight paths for your feet, so that what is lame may not be put out of joint but, rather, may be healed.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:12:12-58:12:13" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Heb. 12:12, 13</a>) All of us, including young ones, can build one another up by words of encouragement.</p>

<p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>Paul gave this advice to all the members of the congregation in Philippi: “If, then, there is any encouragement in Christ, if any consolation of love, if any spiritual fellowship, if any tender affection and compassion, make my joy full by being of the same mind and having the same love, being completely united, having the one thought in mind. Do nothing out of contentiousness or out of egotism, but with humility consider others superior to you, as you look out not only for your own interests, but also for the interests of others.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:2:1-50:2:4" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Phil. 2:1-4</a>.</p>

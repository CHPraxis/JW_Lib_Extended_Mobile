Prophecies of Captivity and Restoration




Many prophecies about the captivity of the Jewish people in ancient Babylon saw a second, greater fulfillment in the much later captivity of the Christian congregation in Babylon the Great. Note some examples.

1. WARNINGS

2. CAPTIVITY

3. RESTORATION



FIRST FULFILLMENT

Before 607 B.C.E.​—Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel warn Jehovah’s people; yet, apostasy still flourishes

607 B.C.E.​—Jerusalem destroyed; God’s people taken captive to Babylon

537 B.C.E. and on​—A faithful remnant returns to Jerusalem, rebuilds the temple, and resumes pure worship


GREATER FULFILLMENT

First Century C.E.​—Jesus, Paul, and John warn the congregation, but apostasy still flourishes

Starting in Second Century C.E.​—True Christians are taken captive within Babylon the Great

1919 C.E. and on​—Under Jesus’ kingship, the faithful anointed saw the end of their spiritual exile and the restoration of pure worship

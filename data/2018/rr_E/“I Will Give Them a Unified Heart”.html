<p id="p52" data-pid="52" class="qu"><strong>1-3. </strong>How do the Babylonians ridicule worshippers of Jehovah, and why?</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[52]" class="sb">IMAGINE that you are a faithful Jew living in the city of Babylon. Your people have been in exile for half a century or so. As is your custom on the Sabbath day, you are going to meet with fellow believers to worship Jehovah. Making your way through the bustling streets, you pass imposing temples as well as shrines beyond counting. The people throng to those places, making offerings and singing hymns to such deities as Marduk.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[52]" class="sb"><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>Away from the crowds, you meet your little group of fellow worshippers.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> You find a quiet spot​—perhaps by one of the city’s canals—​to pray, sing psalms, and reflect on God’s Word together. As you join in prayer, you can hear the gentle creaking of the wooden barges moored along the canal’s edge. You are relieved that there is a measure of peace here. You hope that none of the local people find you and disrupt the meeting as they often do. Why do they do that?</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[52]" class="sb"><span id="page96" class="pageNum" data-no="96" data-before-text="96"></span><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>Babylon has a long record of winning wars, and the people attribute the city’s strength to their false gods. To the Babylonians, the utter destruction of Jerusalem proves that their god Marduk is stronger than Jehovah! Hence, they ridicule your God and his people. Sometimes they mockingly demand: “Sing for us one of the songs of Zion”! (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:137:3-19:137:3" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ps. 137:3</a>) Many psalms celebrate Zion’s triumphs over Jehovah’s enemies. Perhaps the Babylonians love to mock those psalms in particular. Other psalms, though, speak about the Babylonians themselves. One, for example, says: “They have turned Jerusalem into a heap of ruins. . . . Those around us ridicule and jeer us.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:79:1-19:79:1" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ps. 79:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:79:3-19:79:4" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 3, 4</a>.</p>
<p id="p53" data-pid="53" class="qu"><strong>4, 5. </strong>What hope did Ezekiel’s prophecy offer, and what will we consider in this chapter? (See opening picture.)</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[53]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>There are also apostate Jews, who are quick to ridicule your faith in Jehovah and in his prophets. Regardless of such mockery, pure worship brings comfort to you and your family. It feels good to pray and to sing together. Reading God’s Word is soothing. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:94:19-19:94:19" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ps. 94:19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:15:4-45:15:4" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Rom. 15:4</a>) Imagine that on this day, one of your fellow worshippers has brought something special to the gathering​—a scroll containing Ezekiel’s prophecy. You love to hear Jehovah’s promise that he will restore his people to their homeland. Your heart soars as such a prophecy is read aloud, and you contemplate the hope that you and your family may someday return and help in that thrilling time of restoration!</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[53]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>Ezekiel’s prophecy rings again and again with promises of restoration. Let us examine that hopeful theme. How were those promises fulfilled for the exiles? What meaning do such prophecies have in modern times? In some cases, we will also consider a final fulfillment in the future.</p>

<h2 id="p10" data-pid="10"><strong>“They Will Go Into Exile, Into Captivity”</strong></h2>
<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p54" data-pid="54" class="qu"> <strong>6. </strong>How had God repeatedly warned his rebellious people?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[54]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>Through Ezekiel, Jehovah communicated clearly to his people how he would punish them for their rebellious course. “They will go into exile, into captivity,” Jehovah said. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:12:11-26:12:11" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ezek. 12:11</a>) As we saw in <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1102017166/">Chapter 6</a> of this publication, Ezekiel even acted out that sentence. But his was not the first such warning. Since the days of Moses, nearly a millennium earlier, Jehovah had warned his people that if they persisted in a rebellious course, they would suffer exile. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:28:36-5:28:37" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Deut. 28:36, 37</a>) Such prophets as Isaiah and Jeremiah had given similar warnings.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:39:5-23:39:7" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Isa. 39:5-7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:20:3-24:20:6" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> Jer. 20:3-6</a>.</p>
<p id="p55" data-pid="55" class="qu"> <strong>7. </strong>In what ways did Jehovah bring punishment on his people?</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[55]" class="sb"><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>Sadly, though, those warnings largely fell on deaf ears. In time, Jehovah came to feel brokenhearted over his people’s <span id="page97" class="pageNum" data-no="97" data-before-text="97"></span>rebellion, their idolatry, their unfaithfulness, and their corruption under the influence of bad shepherds. He thus allowed them to suffer famine​—which was a disaster and a disgrace, considering that their land had been “one flowing with milk and honey.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:20:6-26:20:7" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Ezek. 20:6, 7</a>) Then, as he had long foretold, Jehovah allowed his wayward people to be punished with exile. In 607 B.C.E., Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon struck the final blow, destroying Jerusalem and her temple. Many thousands of the surviving Jews were carried off into exile in Babylon. There they suffered the mockery and opposition described at the outset of this chapter.</p>
<p id="p56" data-pid="56" class="qu"><strong>8, 9. </strong>How did God provide the Christian congregation with warnings against apostasy?</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[56]" class="sb"><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>Did something similar to the Babylonian exile befall the Christian congregation? It did indeed! Like the Jews of ancient times, Christ’s followers were warned ahead of time. Early in his ministry, Jesus said: “Be on the watch for the false prophets who come to you in sheep’s covering, but inside they are ravenous wolves.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:7:15-40:7:15" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Matt. 7:15</a>) Years later, the apostle Paul was inspired to issue a similar warning: “I know that after my going away oppressive wolves will enter in among you and will not treat the flock with tenderness, and from among you yourselves men will rise and speak twisted things to draw away the disciples after themselves.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:20:29-44:20:30" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Acts 20:29, 30</a>.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[56]" class="sb"><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>Christians were taught how to identify and avoid such dangerous men. Christian elders were instructed to remove apostates from the congregation. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:1:19-54:1:19" data-bid="11-1" class="b">1 Tim. 1:19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:2:16-55:2:19" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 2 Tim. 2:16-19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:2:1-61:2:3" data-bid="11-3" class="b"> 2 Pet. 2:1-3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/63:1:10-63:1:10" data-bid="11-4" class="b"> 2 John 10</a>) Nonetheless, as was the case with Israel and Judah of old, many Christians gradually turned a deaf ear to loving warnings. By the end of the first century, apostasy had taken root in the congregation. John, the last of the apostles still living at the close of the first century C.E., observed that the congregation was suffering such corruption and widespread rebellion. He was the only remaining restraint against that wicked trend. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/53:2:6-53:2:8" data-bid="12-1" class="b">2 Thess. 2:6-8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:2:18-62:2:18" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> 1 John 2:18</a>) What happened after John died?</p>
<p id="p57" data-pid="57" class="qu"><strong>10, 11. </strong>Jesus’ parable of the wheat and the weeds saw what fulfillment from the second century C.E. onward?</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[57]" class="sb"><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>After John’s death, Jesus’ parable of the wheat and the weeds began to see fulfillment. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:13:24-40:13:30" data-bid="13-1" class="b"><strong>Matthew 13:24-30</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>As Jesus had foreseen, Satan oversowed the congregation with “weeds,” or imitation Christians, and the corruption of the congregation sped up. How heartbroken Jehovah must have been to see the congregation his Son had founded become polluted with idolatry, pagan holidays and practices, and false doctrines adopted from godless philosophers and satanic religions! What did Jehovah do? As he had done <span id="page98" class="pageNum" data-no="98" data-before-text="98"></span>with unfaithful Israel, he let his people be taken into exile. From sometime in the second century C.E. onward, the wheatlike ones were lost among the imitation Christians. The true Christian congregation was, in effect, in exile in Babylon the Great, the world empire of false religion, whereas the imitation Christians were absorbed by that corrupt empire. As the imitation Christians flourished, Christendom came into being.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[57]" class="sb"><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>Throughout the dark centuries of Christendom’s dominance, there were some genuine Christians, the “wheat” of Jesus’ parable. Like the Jewish exiles described at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:6:9-26:6:9" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Ezekiel 6:9</a>, they remembered the true God. Some courageously opposed the false doctrines of Christendom. They faced mockery and persecution. Did Jehovah intend to forsake his people permanently in that realm of spiritual darkness? No! As was the case with Israel of old, Jehovah’s anger was expressed to the proper degree and for the right amount of time. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:46:28-24:46:28" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Jer. 46:28</a>) Furthermore, Jehovah did not leave his people without hope. Let us return to those Jewish exiles in ancient Babylon <span id="page99" class="pageNum" data-no="99" data-before-text="99"></span>and see how Jehovah gave them hope for an end to their captivity.</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p58" data-pid="58" class="qu"><strong>12, 13. </strong>Why would Jehovah’s anger against his exiled people of Ezekiel’s day eventually subside?</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[58]" class="sb"><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>Jehovah was forthright about his anger toward his people, but he also reassured them that his righteous indignation would not last forever. Note, for instance, these words: “My anger will come to an end, and my wrath against them will subside, and I will be satisfied. And they will have to know that I, Jehovah, have spoken in my insistence on exclusive devotion, when I have finished unleashing my wrath against them.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:5:13-26:5:13" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Ezek. 5:13</a>) Why would Jehovah’s wrath eventually subside?</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[58]" class="sb"><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>Among the captives were faithful Jews who were taken into exile along with their unfaithful counterparts. In addition, through Ezekiel, God foretold that some of His people would repent while in exile. Those remorseful Jews would recount the shameful things that they had done in rebellion against their God, and they would implore Jehovah for forgiveness and favor. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:6:8-26:6:10" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Ezek. 6:8-10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:12:16-26:12:16" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> 12:16</a>) Ezekiel was among <span id="page100" class="pageNum" data-no="100" data-before-text="100"></span>the faithful ones, as were the prophet Daniel and his three companions. In fact, Daniel lived long enough to see both the beginning and the end of the exile. His heartfelt prayer of repentance over the sins of Israel is recorded in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:9:1-27:9:27" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Daniel chapter 9</a>. No doubt his sentiments represented the feelings of many thousands of exiles who longed for Jehovah’s forgiveness and renewed blessings. How thrilling, then, were Ezekiel’s inspired promises of release and restoration!</p>
<p id="p59" data-pid="59" class="qu"><strong>14. </strong>Why would Jehovah restore his people to their homeland?</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[59]" class="sb"><strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>There was, however, a more important factor in the release and restoration of Jehovah’s people. Their long exile would end, not because they deserved liberation, but because it was again Jehovah’s time to sanctify his own name before all the nations. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:36:22-26:36:22" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Ezek. 36:22</a>) Those Babylonians would know once and for all that their demonic gods, such as Marduk, were no match for the Sovereign Lord Jehovah! Let us consider five promises that Jehovah inspired Ezekiel to share with his fellow exiles. First, let us discuss what each promise would have meant to those faithful ones. Then, we will see how those promises saw a greater fulfillment.</p>

Well, the promises were conditional; Jehovah would fulfill them only to the extent that the people remained obedient and responsive. In time, the Jews again became disobedient and rebellious. But as Joshua pointed out, Jehovah’s word always comes true. So the promises would see a greater, more lasting fulfillment. Let us see how that came about.</p>

<p id="p30" data-pid="30" data-rel-pid="[67]" class="sb"><strong><sup>23 </sup></strong>As students of the Bible, we know that this wicked system of things entered its final decline, its last days, in 1914. For servants of Jehovah, though, this is not an era of sad decline. In fact, the Bible indicates that 1914 saw the beginning of a thrilling period​—“the times of restoration of all things.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:3:21-44:3:21" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Acts 3:21</a>) How do we know that? Well, what happened in heaven in 1914? Jesus Christ was enthroned as the Messianic King! How was that event a restoration? Remember, Jehovah had promised King David that kingship in his family line would endure forever. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:17:11-13:17:14" data-bid="32-1" class="b">1 Chron. 17:11-14</a>) That kingship was interrupted in 607 B.C.E. when the Babylonians destroyed Jerusalem and ended the rule of the Davidic kings.</p>
<p id="p31" data-pid="31" data-rel-pid="[67]" class="sb"><strong><sup>24 </sup></strong>As “the Son of man,” Jesus was a descendant of David and thus became the legal heir to the Davidic kingship. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:1:1-40:1:1" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Matt. 1:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:16:13-40:16:16" data-bid="33-2" class="b"> 16:13-16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:1:32-42:1:33" data-bid="33-3" class="b"> Luke 1:32, 33</a>) In 1914 when Jehovah granted Jesus the heavenly throne, “the times of restoration of all things” began! Now the way was open for Jehovah to use that perfect King to continue the work of restoration.</p>

For decades leading up to 1914, faithful Bible Students had been exposing the gross errors of Christendom and were beginning to separate themselves from that corrupt organization. It was Jehovah’s time to restore them fully. So in early 1919, just a few years into “the harvest season,” God’s people were set completely free from captivity in Babylon the Great.

At the close of the exile, however, God’s people were already making such sacrifices of <span id="page107" class="pageNum" data-no="107" data-before-text="107"></span>praise. They were busy in the preaching work and happily praising God at their meetings. From 1919 on, “the faithful and discreet slave” put greater emphasis on the preaching work and organized it more thoroughly.

In 1919 he appointed his faithful and discreet slave. That small group of loyal anointed Christians took the lead in providing spiritual food, so God’s people were well-cared-for.

(b) What does that prophecy mean to Jehovah’s people today? (See also the box “<a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1102017936/">The Times of Restoration of All Things</a>.”)</p>
<p id="p41" data-pid="41" data-rel-pid="[75]" class="sb"><strong><sup>33 </sup></strong>As we have seen, “the times of restoration of all things” began with the restoration of the Davidic line of kings when Jesus was enthroned in 1914. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:37:24-26:37:24" data-bid="47-1" class="b">Ezek. 37:24</a>) Next, Jehovah empowered Christ to restore pure worship among His people after many centuries of spiritual exile. However, does Christ’s restoration work stop there? Far from it! That work will continue in a spectacular way in the future​—and Ezekiel’s prophecies give us soul-stirring details.</p>
<p id="p42" data-pid="42" data-rel-pid="[75]" class="sb"><strong><sup>34 </sup></strong>Consider, for example, these inspired words: “People will say: ‘The desolate land has become like the garden of Eden.’” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:36:35-26:36:35" data-bid="48-1" class="b">Ezek. 36:35</a>) What did that promise mean to Ezekiel and his fellow exiles? They surely did not expect a full, literal fulfillment​—as if the restored land might actually be mistaken for the original garden, or Paradise, the one planted by Jehovah himself! (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:2:8-1:2:8" data-bid="49-1" class="b">Gen. 2:8</a>) Rather, they no doubt understood that Jehovah was reassuring them that their restored land would be beautiful and fruitful.</p>
<p id="p43" data-pid="43" data-rel-pid="[75]" class="sb"><strong><sup>35 </sup></strong>What does the same promise mean to us today? We do not expect a literal fulfillment now, in the midst of this wicked world ruled by Satan the Devil. Rather, we grasp that those words have a spiritual fulfillment today. As Jehovah’s servants, we inhabit a restored spiritual land, a condition, or environment, wherein we serve productively and make his sacred service the center of our lives. This spiritual land is gradually, steadily becoming ever more paradisaic. What, though, about the future?</p>
<p id="p76" data-pid="76" class="qu"><strong>36, 37. </strong>What promises will be fulfilled in the future Paradise?</p>
<p id="p44" data-pid="44" data-rel-pid="[76]" class="sb"><strong><sup>36 </sup></strong>After the great war of Armageddon, Jesus will expand his restoration work to cover even the physical earth.

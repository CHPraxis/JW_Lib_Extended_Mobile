<p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb">EACH one of us must answer a crucial question: Whom will I worship? Many might say that this issue is complex and that the options are confusing. In reality, however, the choice is clear and simple. Either we worship Jehovah God or we worship Satan the Devil.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>Satan craves worship. That became especially evident when he tempted Jesus. As discussed in <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1102017161/">Chapter 1</a> of this publication, Satan offered Jesus a remarkable prize​—authority over all the kingdoms of the earth. What did the Devil want in return? “Do an act of worship to me,” he urged Jesus. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:4:9-40:4:9" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matt. 4:9</a>) By contrast, the angel who delivered the revelation to the apostle John refused to be venerated. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:22:8-66:22:9" data-bid="3-1" class="b"><strong>Revelation 22:8, 9</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>When John offered to worship the angel, that humble spirit son of God responded: “Do not do that!” Instead of saying, ‘Worship me,’ the angel said, “Worship God.”</p>

Why? Because during the Thousand Year Reign, all nationalistic divisions will have been removed; all people will be subjects of one government, God’s Kingdom. We will <span id="page233" class="pageNum" data-no="233" data-before-text="233"></span>belong to one spiritual nation. By calling these rebels Gog and Magog and saying that they are “nations,” the prophecy indicates that Satan will be successful in fostering divisions among some of God’s people.

The number of those who rebel are “as the sand of the sea.” This expression does not necessarily mean that a large percentage of mankind will rebel. How do we know? Consider the promise made to Abraham. Jehovah said that Abraham’s offspring would become like “the grains of sand on the seashore.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:22:17-1:22:18" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Gen. 22:17, 18</a>) Yet, the number who made up his offspring ended up being 144,001 individuals. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:3:16-48:3:16" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Gal. 3:16,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:3:29-48:3:29" data-bid="31-2" class="b"> 29</a>) That figure, while significant, is only a fraction of the total number of mankind. Similarly, the number who join Satan may be significant, but it will not be overwhelming. The rebels will pose no great threat to Jehovah’s loyal servants.</p>

Along with Satan and the demons, they will cease to exist​—with no prospect of ever coming back to life. Only their bad decisions and the consequences of those decisions will be remembered for all time.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:20:10-66:20:10" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Rev. 20:10</a>.</p>

<p id="p37" data-pid="37" data-rel-pid="[58]" class="sb"><strong><sup>27 </sup></strong>On the other hand, those who pass the final test will have their names permanently inscribed in “the book of life.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:20:15-66:20:15" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Rev. 20:15</a>) Then, as a united family, all of Jehovah’s loyal sons and daughters will give him the worship he so rightly deserves.</p>
<p id="p38" data-pid="38" data-rel-pid="[58]" class="sb"><strong><sup>28 </sup></strong>Think of that future. Ahead of you is a life of rewarding work and enriching friendships. Never again will you or your loved ones need to suffer. On your own merit, you will stand before Jehovah completely without sin. Every person will have an unrestricted friendship with God. And most important of all, in heaven and on earth, pure worship will be carried out in perfection. That will be the ultimate restoration of pure worship!</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p59" data-pid="59" class="qu"><strong>30, 31. </strong>What will the declaration “they will have to know that I am Jehovah” mean (a) to God’s enemies? (b) to God’s people?</p>
<p id="p41" data-pid="41" data-rel-pid="[59]" class="sb"><strong><sup>30 </sup></strong>Throughout the book of Ezekiel, the declaration “they will have to know that I am Jehovah” recurs like a drum beat. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:6:10-26:6:10" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Ezek. 6:10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:39:28-26:39:28" data-bid="34-2" class="b"> 39:28</a>) For God’s enemies, that declaration will mean war and death. They will be compelled to do more than acknowledge that Jehovah exists. They will learn the hard way the meaning of his great name​—“He Causes to Become.” “Jehovah of armies” will become “a powerful warrior” who will fight against them. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:17:45-9:17:45" data-bid="35-1" class="b">1 Sam. 17:45;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:15:3-2:15:3" data-bid="35-2" class="b"> Ex. 15:3</a>) Too late, they will understand an essential truth about Jehovah: Nothing can stop him from fulfilling his purpose.</p>
<p id="p42" data-pid="42" data-rel-pid="[59]" class="sb"><strong><sup>31 </sup></strong>To God’s people, the declaration “they will have to know that I am Jehovah” will mean peace and life. Jehovah will cause us to become what he originally intended us to be​—sons and daughters who perfectly reflect his qualities. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:26-1:1:26" data-bid="36-1" class="b">Gen. 1:26</a>) Already, Jehovah has become to us a loving Father and a protective Shepherd. Soon he will become our conquering King. Before that day arrives, let us take to heart Ezekiel’s message. Let us prove by our words and actions each day that we know who Jehovah is and what he stands for. Then, when the destructive winds of the great tribulation are released, we will not be afraid. On the contrary, we will lift our heads up, for we will know that our deliverance is near. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:21:28-42:21:28" data-bid="37-1" class="b">Luke 21:28</a>) In the meantime, may we help people everywhere to know and love the only God worthy of worship, the One with the greatest of all names​—Jehovah.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:28:26-26:28:26" data-bid="38-1" class="b">Ezek. 28:26</a>.</p>

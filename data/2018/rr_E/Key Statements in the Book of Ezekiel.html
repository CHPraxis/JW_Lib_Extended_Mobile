<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">More than 90 times, Ezekiel is referred to as “son of man.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:2:1-26:2:1" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ezek. 2:1</a>) Jehovah thus reminds him that even though he has received great privileges, he is only an earthling man. Significantly, in the Gospel accounts, Jesus is referred to as “Son of man” some 80 times, showing that he became completely human and was not an angel merely materializing in human form.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:8:20-40:8:20" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matt. 8:20</a>.</p>

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">In the past, our literature has referred to Christendom as the antitype of apostate Jerusalem. The conditions in unfaithful Jerusalem​—including idolatry and widespread corruption—​certainly remind us of what is happening in Christendom. However, in recent years our publications, including the one you are now reading, have not taken the type-antitype approach to prophecy except where the Bible provides a clear basis for doing so. Is there a solid Scriptural basis for referring to Christendom as the antitypical Jerusalem? No.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><strong>Consider the following: </strong>Jerusalem was at one time a center of pure worship; later, its inhabitants turned apostate. By contrast, Christendom has <em>never </em>practiced pure worship. Right from its inception in the fourth century C.E., Christendom has <em>always </em>taught false doctrine.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">In addition, after Jerusalem was destroyed by the Babylonians, Jehovah restored the city to his favor and it again became the center of true worship. Christendom, on the other hand, has never had God’s favor, and once it is destroyed during the great tribulation, it will never rise again.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">In view of the foregoing, what may we conclude? When we examine Bible prophecies that were fulfilled on unfaithful Jerusalem, we may say, ‘This or that reminds us of what we see in Christendom today.’ But there appears to be no Scriptural basis for referring to Christendom as the antitypical Jerusalem.</p>

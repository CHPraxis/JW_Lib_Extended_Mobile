“It Was My Sanctuary That You Defiled”​—Pure Worship Corrupted

EZEKIEL 5:11
FOCUS: Judah and Jerusalem become spiritually and morally corrupt




Jehovah loved and cared for the Israelites as his “treasured possession.” (Ex. 19:5, ftn.) But they repaid Jehovah by worshipping false gods in the very temple that bore his name! They broke Jehovah’s heart and brought reproach upon him. Why did Israel sink so low? What can we learn from Ezekiel’s prophecy about Jerusalem’s destruction? And what lessons can we draw from Israel’s dealings with the surrounding nations?

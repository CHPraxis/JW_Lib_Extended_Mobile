<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">At times, we may feel so overwhelmed by pressures and trials in our life that we are worn out, and we struggle to go on. However, at such moments, we may be fortified if we reflect on the vivid description in Ezekiel’s restoration vision. Why? We can learn from this prophecy that a God who has the power to breathe life into dead bones can surely give us the strength we need to overcome obstacles​—even those that, humanly speaking, are insurmountable.​—<strong>Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:18:29-19:18:29" data-bid="2-1" class="b"><strong>Psalm 18:29;</strong></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:4:13-50:4:13" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Phil. 4:13</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">We may be reminded that many centuries before Ezekiel’s day, the prophet Moses stated that Jehovah has not only the power but also the desire to use his strength in behalf of his people. Moses wrote: “God is a refuge from ancient times, his everlasting arms are beneath you.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:33:27-5:33:27" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Deut. 33:27</a>) Yes, we can be sure that if we turn to our God in times of distress, Jehovah will put his caring arms beneath us, gently lift us up, and help us to get back on our feet.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:37:10-26:37:10" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ezek. 37:10</a>.</p>

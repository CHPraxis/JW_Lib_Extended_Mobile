<p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb">THE news about the prophet Ezekiel’s strange behavior spreads rapidly among the exiled Jews living in the land of Babylon. For a week, he had been sitting dazed and speechless among the exiles, but then, he suddenly got up and shut himself in his house. Now, with his perplexed neighbors looking on, the prophet reappears, picks up a brick, puts it in front of him, and etches it with a drawing. Then, without uttering a word, Ezekiel begins to build a miniature wall.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:3:10-26:3:11" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ezek. 3:10, 11,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:3:15-26:3:15" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 15,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:3:24-26:3:26" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> 24-26;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:4:1-26:4:2" data-bid="2-4" class="b"> 4:1, 2</a>.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb"><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>The spectators, no doubt growing in number, must have wondered, ‘What does all of this mean?’ Only later would those Jewish exiles fully grasp that the prophet Ezekiel’s puzzling behavior foretold the coming of a dreadful event that would express Jehovah God’s righteous indignation. What was that event? How did it affect the ancient nation of Israel? What significance does it have for pure worshippers today?</p>

<p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="qu"><strong>3, 4. </strong>(a) What three aspects of God’s judgment did Ezekiel portray? (b) How did Ezekiel act out the siege of Jerusalem?</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>In about 613 B.C.E., Jehovah instructed Ezekiel to demonstrate by signs three aspects of God’s coming judgment against Jerusalem. They were: the <em>siege </em>of the city, the <em>suffering </em>of its inhabitants, and the <em>destruction </em>of the city and its people.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> Let us consider these three aspects in more detail.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup>The siege of Jerusalem. </strong>Jehovah told Ezekiel: “Take a brick and put it in front of you. . . . Lay siege to it.” <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:4:1-26:4:3" data-bid="3-1" class="b"><strong>Ezekiel 4:1-3</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>The brick represented the city of Jerusalem, while Ezekiel himself portrayed the Babylonian army as used by Jehovah. Ezekiel was also instructed to build a miniature wall and a siege rampart and to make battering rams. He was then to place these around the brick. They represented the instruments of war that Jerusalem’s enemies would use when surrounding the city and attacking it. To indicate the ironlike strength of the enemy soldiers, Ezekiel was to put “an iron griddle,” or plate, between himself and the city. He then set his “face <em>against” </em>the city. Those confrontational actions served as “a sign to the house of Israel” that the unthinkable was about to happen. Jehovah would use an enemy army to lay siege to Jerusalem, the chief city of God’s people, the location of God’s temple!</p>
<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu"> <strong>5. </strong>Describe how Ezekiel portrayed what would happen to the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup>The suffering of Jerusalem’s inhabitants. </strong>Jehovah ordered Ezekiel: “Take wheat, barley, broad beans, lentils, millet, and spelt [a type of wheat] . . . and make them into bread,” and “weigh out and eat 20 shekels of food per day.” Jehovah then explained: “I am cutting off the food supply.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:4:9-26:4:16" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ezek. 4:9-16</a>) In this scene, Ezekiel no longer represented the Babylonian army; rather, he took on the role of the inhabitants of Jerusalem. The prophet’s actions foretold that the coming siege would cause the food supplies in the city to dwindle. At that time, bread would be made from an odd mixture of ingredients, which indicated that the people would have to eat whatever they found. How severe would the starvation become? As if directly addressing the inhabitants of Jerusalem, Ezekiel said: “Fathers among you will eat their sons, and sons will eat their fathers.” In the end, many would suffer because of “the deadly arrows of famine,” and the people would “waste away.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:4:17-26:4:17" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ezek. 4:17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:5:10-26:5:10" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 5:10,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:5:16-26:5:16" data-bid="5-3" class="b"> 16</a>.</p>
<p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="qu"> <strong>6. </strong>(a) What two roles did Ezekiel act out at the same time? (b) What is indicated by God’s command to “weigh and divide the hair”?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup>The destruction of Jerusalem and its people. </strong>In this part of the prophetic enactment, Ezekiel acted out two roles at the same time. First, Ezekiel acted out what Jehovah would do. Jehovah told him: “Take a sharp sword for yourself to use <span id="page64" class="pageNum" data-no="64" data-before-text="64"></span>as a barber’s razor.” <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:5:1-26:5:2" data-bid="6-1" class="b"><strong>Ezekiel 5:1, 2</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>Ezekiel’s hand that wielded the sword portrayed the hand of Jehovah​—his judgment—​as expressed through Babylon’s army. Second, Ezekiel acted out what the Jews would go through. Jehovah said to him: “Shave your head and your beard.” The shaving of Ezekiel’s head represented how the Jews would be attacked and wiped out. Furthermore, the command to “take scales to weigh and divide the hair into portions” implied that Jehovah’s judgment against Jerusalem would be carried out, not haphazardly, but deliberately and thoroughly.</p>

<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu"> <strong>7. </strong>Why did Jehovah tell Ezekiel to divide the hair in three portions and to treat each portion differently?</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>Why did Jehovah tell Ezekiel to divide his shaved-off hair into three portions and to treat each portion differently? <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:5:7-26:5:12" data-bid="7-1" class="b"><strong>Ezekiel 5:7-12</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>Ezekiel burned one portion of hair “inside the city” to demonstrate to onlookers that some inhabitants of Jerusalem would die in the city. Ezekiel struck a portion of hair with the sword “all around the city” to indicate that other inhabitants would be killed outside the city. He scattered the last portion of hair to the wind to illustrate that still other inhabitants would be scattered among the nations, but “a sword” would “chase after them.” Thus, wherever those survivors might end up living, they would find no peace.</p>
<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu"> <strong>8. </strong>(a) What hint of hope did Ezekiel’s enactment contain? (b) How did the prophetic statement about the “few strands” come true?</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>However, Ezekiel’s prophetic enactment also contained a hint of hope. Regarding the hair that Ezekiel had shaved off, Jehovah told the prophet: “Take a few strands . . . and wrap them up in the folds of your garment.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:5:3-26:5:3" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Ezek. 5:3</a>) That command indicated that a few of the Jews who would be scattered among the nations would be preserved. Some of those “few strands” would be among the exiles who were to return to Jerusalem after the 70-year-long captivity in Babylon. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:6:8-26:6:9" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ezek. 6:8, 9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:11:17-26:11:17" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 11:17</a>) Did that prophetic statement come true? Yes. A number of years after the end of the Babylonian captivity, the prophet Haggai reported that some of the scattered Jews had indeed returned to Jerusalem. They were the “old men who had seen the former house,” that is, Solomon’s temple. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/15:3:12-15:3:12" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ezra 3:12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/37:2:1-37:2:3" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> Hag. 2:1-3</a>) Jehovah saw to it that pure worship was preserved, just as he had promised.

As happened with the ancient city of Jerusalem, Jehovah will use secular forces to do the unthinkable<span id="page66" class="pageNum" data-no="66" data-before-text="66"></span>​—to attack all false religious organizations on earth. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:17:16-66:17:18" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Rev. 17:16-18</a>) Just as Jerusalem’s destruction was “a unique calamity,” so the “great tribulation” with its war of Armageddon will be an event that “has not occurred” before.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:5:9-26:5:9" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Ezek. 5:9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:7:5-26:7:5" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 7:5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:21-40:24:21" data-bid="13-3" class="b"> Matt. 24:21</a>.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>God’s Word indicates that individual supporters of false religion will survive the coming destruction of religious institutions.

In 609 B.C.E., Ezekiel learned that the attack against Jerusalem had begun. At that time, the sound of the trumpet summoned the inhabitants to defend their city, but as Ezekiel had foretold, “no one” was “going to the battle.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:7:14-26:7:14" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Ezek. 7:14</a>) Jerusalem’s inhabitants did not rally to the city’s defense to fight the Babylonian invaders. Some Jews may have thought that Jehovah would come to their rescue. He had done so before when the Assyrians had threatened to take Jerusalem and an angel of Jehovah had destroyed most of their army. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:19:32-12:19:32" data-bid="29-1" class="b">2 Ki. 19:32</a>) But no angelic help arrived this time.

<p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><strong><sup>17 </sup></strong>Ezekiel’s prophecy also reminds us that when the coming attack against religious organizations occurs, members of the churches will not be “going to the battle” to defend religion. Instead, as they begin to realize that their cry for help, “Lord, Lord,” is going unanswered, “their hands will hang limp” and they will be “shuddering.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:7:3-26:7:3" data-bid="36-1" class="b">Ezek. 7:3,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:7:14-26:7:14" data-bid="36-2" class="b"> 14,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:7:17-26:7:18" data-bid="36-3" class="b"> 17, 18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:7:21-40:7:23" data-bid="36-4" class="b"> Matt. 7:21-23</a>) What else will they do? <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:7:19-26:7:21" data-bid="37-1" class="b"><strong>Ezekiel 7:19-21</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>Jehovah says: “They will throw their silver into the streets.” That statement regarding the inhabitants of ancient Jerusalem also vividly illustrates what will take place during the <span id="page70" class="pageNum" data-no="70" data-before-text="70"></span>great tribulation. At that time, people will realize that money cannot save them from the coming calamity.</p>
<p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu"><strong>18. </strong>What lesson about setting priorities can we draw from Ezekiel’s prophecy?</p>
<p id="p26" data-pid="26" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><strong><sup>18 </sup></strong>Do you discern a lesson for us in this part of Ezekiel’s prophecy? It is about the need to set the right priorities. Consider this: Only <em>after </em>the inhabitants of Jerusalem understood that the end of their city and their life was upon them and that material goods could not save them, only <em>after </em>that did they drastically change their priorities. They threw their possessions away and began to “seek a vision from a prophet”​—but their change came too late. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:7:26-26:7:26" data-bid="38-1" class="b">Ezek. 7:26</a>) In contrast, we are already fully aware that the end of this wicked world is upon us. Therefore, our faith in God’s promises has moved us to set the right priorities in life. As a result, we are busy pursuing spiritual riches, which have lasting value and will never be thrown “into the streets.”​—<strong>Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:19-40:6:21" data-bid="39-1" class="b"><strong>Matthew 6:19-21,</strong></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:24-40:6:24" data-bid="39-2" class="b"> <strong>24</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>

<p id="p27" data-pid="27" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><strong><sup>19 </sup></strong>In summary, what are some of the ways that Ezekiel’s prophetic statements about the fall of Jerusalem affect us today? They remind us that the time still available for helping others to become God’s servants is limited. Hence, we carry out the disciple-making work with urgency. We rejoice greatly when honesthearted individuals begin to worship our Father, Jehovah. However, even to those who do not take that step, we continue to give the warning that Ezekiel gave to the people in his day: “The end is now upon you.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:3:19-26:3:19" data-bid="40-1" class="b">Ezek. 3:19,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:3:21-26:3:21" data-bid="40-2" class="b"> 21;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:7:3-26:7:3" data-bid="40-3" class="b"> 7:3</a>) At the same time, we are determined to maintain our trust in Jehovah and to keep his pure worship first and foremost in our life.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:52:7-19:52:8" data-bid="41-1" class="b">Ps. 52:7, 8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:11:28-20:11:28" data-bid="41-2" class="b"> Prov. 11:28;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:33-40:6:33" data-bid="41-3" class="b"> Matt. 6:33</a>.</p>

<div class="groupFootnote"><div><p id="p29" data-pid="29">It is reasonable to conclude that Ezekiel acted out all these signs before onlookers. Why?

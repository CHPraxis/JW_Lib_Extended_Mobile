<p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="qu"><strong>1-3. </strong>What causes a change of mood among the Jews in Babylon? (See opening picture.)</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[30]" class="sb">HOW the mood among the Jews in Babylon has changed! For some five years, Ezekiel hammered at their armor of false hopes, but his efforts barely made a dent. No matter what signs he acted out, what illustrations he spoke, what messages he proclaimed, the exiles refused to believe that Jehovah would allow Jerusalem to be destroyed. Even when they learned that the city had come under siege by the Babylonian army, they were still confident that its inhabitants would be safe.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[30]" class="sb"><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>But now, two years after the start of the siege, a refugee from Jerusalem has just arrived in Babylon, bringing the report: “The city has been struck down!” That news devastates the exiles. They struggle to grasp its full significance: the beloved city, the holy temple, the cherished land​—all gone! Their long-held hope gives way to despair.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:21:7-26:21:7" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ezek. 21:7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:33:21-26:33:21" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 33:21</a>.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[30]" class="sb"><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>However, at this moment of desperation, Ezekiel receives a powerful vision of hope. What message does the vision contain <span id="page113" class="pageNum" data-no="113" data-before-text="113"></span>for the shattered exiles? How does this vision relate to God’s people today, and how can we personally benefit from it? To find out, let us examine what Jehovah reveals to Ezekiel.</p>

<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[31]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup>Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:37:1-26:37:10" data-bid="3-1" class="b"><strong>Ezekiel 37:1-10</strong></a><strong>. </strong>In a vision, Ezekiel is set down in a valley plain that is covered with bones. As if to make sure that Ezekiel felt the full impact of the vision, Jehovah ordered the prophet to “pass all around” those widely scattered bones. As Ezekiel walked on the valley plain, two things about the bones especially stood out to him: their number and their condition. “There were <em>very many,” </em>he observed, and “they were <em>very dry.”</em></p>
<p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="qu"> <strong>5. </strong>What two commands did Jehovah give to Ezekiel, and what happened after Ezekiel carried them out?</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[32]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>Then Jehovah gave Ezekiel two commands that would set in motion a progressive restoration. The first command was: “Prophesy over these bones,” telling them to “come to life.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:37:4-26:37:6" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ezek. 37:4-6</a>) As soon as Ezekiel prophesied, “there was a noise, a rattling sound, and the bones began to come together,” after which “sinews and flesh” came on the bones, “and skin covered over them.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:37:7-26:37:8" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ezek. 37:7, 8</a>) The second command was: “Prophesy to the wind,” telling it to “blow upon” the bodies. When Ezekiel prophesied, “breath came into them, and they began to live and to stand on their feet, an extremely large army.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:37:9-26:37:10" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ezek. 37:9, 10</a>.</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="qu"> <strong>6. </strong>What words of Jehovah helped Ezekiel to understand the vision?</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>Jehovah next revealed to Ezekiel how the vision was to be understood, saying: “These bones are the whole house of Israel.” Indeed, after the exiles had learned of Jerusalem’s destruction, they felt that they were as good as dead. Therefore, they lamented: “Our bones are dry, and our hope has perished. We are completely cut off.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:37:11-26:37:11" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ezek. 37:11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:34:20-24:34:20" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> Jer. 34:20</a>) Then in response to their lament, Jehovah revealed that this gloomy vision of bones actually contained a bright message of hope for Israel.</p>
<p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="qu"> <strong>7. </strong>What did Jehovah reveal to Ezekiel, as recorded at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:37:12-26:37:14" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Ezekiel 37:12-14</a>, and what assurance did this give His exiled people?</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><strong><sup>7 </sup>Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:37:12-26:37:14" data-bid="8-1" class="b"><strong>Ezekiel 37:12-14</strong></a><strong>. </strong>Through this vision, Jehovah assured the exiles that he would bring them to life, lead them back to their land, and let them settle there. Moreover, Jehovah addressed them again as “my people.” How uplifting those words must have been for the despondent exiles! Why could they be certain that this promise of restoration would come true? Because Jehovah himself stood behind it. He declared: <em>“I myself, </em>Jehovah, have spoken and <em>I </em>have done it.”</p>
<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu"> <strong>8. </strong>(a) How was “the whole house of Israel” in a deathlike condition? (b) How does <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:37:9-26:37:9" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Ezekiel 37:9</a> indicate the cause of Israel’s symbolic death? (See footnote.)</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><span id="page114" class="pageNum" data-no="114" data-before-text="114"></span><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>How had the ancient nation of Israel experienced the fulfillment of the gloomy part of this prophetic vision? The symbolic demise of Israel had already begun in 740 B.C.E. with the fall and exile of the ten-tribe kingdom. Some 130 years later, when the people of Judah were also deported, “the whole house of Israel” was in captivity. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:37:11-26:37:11" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ezek. 37:11</a>) Symbolically speaking, the whole group of exiles were then as dead as the bones seen in Ezekiel’s vision.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> Also recall that Ezekiel saw not just bones but <em>“very dry” </em>bones, which indicated that their deathlike condition continued for a long time. And, indeed, for Israel and Judah combined, it lasted over 200 years, from 740 to 537 B.C.E.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:50:33-24:50:33" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Jer. 50:33</a>.</p>
<p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="qu"> <strong>9. </strong>What similarities are there between the experiences of ancient natural Israel and those of “the Israel of God”?</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>Restoration prophecies concerning Israel, such as the ones spoken by Ezekiel, have a larger fulfillment. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:3:21-44:3:21" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Acts 3:21</a>) Just as the ancient nation of natural Israel was “killed” and remained symbolically dead for a considerable time, so “the Israel of God,” the anointed Christian congregation, was killed symbolically and experienced deathlike captivity for a long time. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:6:16-48:6:16" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Gal. 6:16</a>) In fact, the captivity of the anointed congregation as a whole continued for so long that their spiritual condition could well be compared to that of bones that “were very dry.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:37:2-26:37:2" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Ezek. 37:2</a>) As explained in the preceding chapter, the captivity of the anointed Christian congregation <span id="page115" class="pageNum" data-no="115" data-before-text="115"></span>began in the second century C.E. and lasted for many centuries, just as Jesus had indicated in his Kingdom illustration of the wheat and the weeds.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:13:24-40:13:30" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Matt. 13:24-30</a>.</p>

<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>In ancient times, Jehovah foretold that his people would experience a progressive restoration to life. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:37:7-26:37:8" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Ezek. 37:7, 8</a>) So, what were some of the factors that gradually restored to God-fearing exiles the faith that their hope of returning to Israel would be fulfilled? One source of hope must have been the prophetic statements made by earlier prophets. For example, Isaiah had foretold that a remnant, “a holy seed,” would return to the land. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:6:13-23:6:13" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Isa. 6:13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:14:7-18:14:9" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> Job 14:7-9</a>) Also, the many prophecies of restoration that Ezekiel had written down no doubt kept that hope alive. Further, the presence in Babylon of such faithful men as the prophet Daniel​—as well as the amazing fall of the city of Babylon in 539 B.C.E.​—must have bolstered the exiles’ hope of return.</p>

<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>How did a similar gradual restoration occur among “the Israel of God,” the anointed Christian congregation? Many centuries into the long period of deathlike captivity, “a noise, a rattling sound,” was heard as God-fearing individuals rose up in behalf of true worship. For instance, in the 16th century, William Tyndale prepared a Bible translation in English. <span id="page116" class="pageNum" data-no="116" data-before-text="116"></span>The Roman Catholic clergy were angered that the Bible could now be read by the common man. Tyndale was killed. Even so, other courageous individuals continued to produce Bible translations in additional languages, and spiritual light gradually spread throughout the dark world.</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>Later, when Charles T. Russell and his associates began to work zealously to restore Bible truths, it was as if “sinews and flesh” came on the bones. <em>Zion’s Watch Tower </em>and other publications helped honesthearted ones to discover spiritual truths, which moved them to join themselves to God’s anointed servants. In the early 1900’s, God’s anointed people were further energized by such tools as the “Photo-Drama of Creation” and the book <em>The Finished Mystery.</em> Shortly thereafter, God’s time came to make his people “stand on their feet.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:37:10-26:37:10" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Ezek. 37:10</a>) When and how did that occur?

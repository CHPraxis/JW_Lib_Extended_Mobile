<p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb">IT IS early autumn of 29 C.E., and Jesus is in the wilderness of Judea, just north of the Dead Sea. He was led to this place by holy spirit, following his baptism and anointing. Here, amid a barren landscape of rocks and ravines, Jesus has had 40 days for some quiet time to fast, pray, and meditate. Perhaps during this time, Jehovah has communicated with his Son, preparing him for what lies ahead.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>Now, when Jesus is weakened by hunger, Satan approaches him. What happens next reveals a vital issue that involves all who love pure worship, including you.</p>

No. That fallen angelic son of God knew full well that Jesus is God’s firstborn Son. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:1:15-51:1:15" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Col. 1:15</a>) Satan no doubt also knew the words Jehovah <span id="page7" class="pageNum" data-no="7" data-before-text="7"></span>spoke from heaven at Jesus’ baptism: “This is my Son, the beloved, whom I have approved.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:3:17-40:3:17" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Matt. 3:17</a>) Perhaps Satan wanted to get Jesus to doubt whether his Father was trustworthy and truly cared about him. With the first temptation​—to turn stones into bread—​Satan, in effect, asked: ‘Since you are God’s Son, why does your Father not feed you in this barren wilderness?’ With the second temptation​—to jump off the battlement of the temple—​Satan, in a sense, asked: ‘Since you are God’s Son, do you really trust your Father to protect you?’</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>Satan uses similar tactics today. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:2:11-47:2:11" data-bid="5-1" class="b">2 Cor. 2:11</a>) The Tempter waits until true worshippers are weakened or discouraged, and then he attacks, often in subtle ways.

The Tempter also tries to get us to believe that Jehovah is not trustworthy, that he will not do as he has promised in his Word. But those are vicious lies.

<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>Consider how Jesus responded to the first two temptations. He had no doubt about his Father’s love for him, and he put absolute trust in his Father. Without hesitation, Jesus rejected Satan by quoting his Father’s inspired Word. Fittingly, Jesus quoted scriptures that contain the divine name, Jehovah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:6:16-5:6:16" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Deut. 6:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:8:3-5:8:3" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 8:3</a>) What better way for God’s Son to show that he trusted in his Father than to use His name​—the unique name that stands as a guarantee that Jehovah will fulfill all his promises?<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span></p>

<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>We can resist Satan’s subtle attacks by drawing on Jehovah’s Word and by reflecting on the meaning of the divine name. If we apply to ourselves what the Scriptures say about Jehovah’s love and concern for his worshippers, including the downhearted, we can reject the satanic lie that Jehovah could never love us or approve of us. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:34:18-19:34:18" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ps. 34:18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:5:8-60:5:8" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 1 Pet. 5:8</a>) And if we keep in mind that Jehovah always lives up to the meaning of his name, we will not doubt that the Fulfiller of promises is worthy of our complete trust.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:3:5-20:3:6" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Prov. 3:5, 6</a>.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>What, though, is Satan’s primary goal? What does he really want from us? The answer became clear when Satan presented Jesus with a third temptation.</p>

Satan <span id="page8" class="pageNum" data-no="8" data-before-text="8"></span>showed Jesus (likely in a vision) “all the kingdoms of the world and their glory”​—but without their corruption.

Satan wanted Jesus to abandon his Father and acknowledge the Tempter as his god. Satan offered Jesus what might seem an easy way out. He implied that Jesus would have all the power and wealth of the nations and would not need to suffer​—no crown of thorns, no scourging, and no torture stake. The temptation was real. Jesus did not question Satan’s dominion over worldly governments!

<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>Today, too, Satan really wants us to give him our worship​—either directly or indirectly.

How can we resist such a temptation?</p>
<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu"><strong>10. </strong>How did Jesus respond to the third temptation, and why?</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>Note how Jesus responded to the third temptation. Showing his undivided loyalty to Jehovah, he immediately dismissed the Tempter, saying: “Go away, Satan!” As he did with the first two temptations, Jesus then quoted a scripture from Deuteronomy that contains the divine name: “It is written: ‘It is Jehovah your God you must worship, and it is to him alone you must render sacred service.’” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:4:10-40:4:10" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Matt. 4:10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:6:13-5:6:13" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> Deut. 6:13</a>) Jesus thus rejected the attraction of a prominent but short-lived worldly career and an easy life without suffering. He recognized that his Father alone deserves to be worshipped and that to perform even a single “act of worship” to Satan would signify submission to him. Jesus steadfastly refused to make the wicked Tempter his god. Having been rebuffed, “the Devil left him.”<span data-fnid="3" class="fn">c<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="3"></span></span></p>

<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>With the final temptation, Satan confirmed that he is the original enemy of pure worship. Thousands of years earlier, in the garden of Eden, Satan first revealed his hatred for worship of Jehovah. By seducing Eve who, in turn, persuaded Adam to disobey Jehovah’s command, Satan brought them under his leadership and control. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:3:1-1:3:5" data-bid="18-1" class="b"><strong>Genesis 3:1-5;</strong></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:11:3-47:11:3" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> 2 Cor. 11:3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:12:9-66:12:9" data-bid="18-3" class="b"> Rev. 12:9</a>) In reality, he became their god, and they became his worshippers, even though they may not have known the real identity of the one misleading them.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:4:11-66:4:11" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Rev. 4:11</a>) When Jehovah created the perfect Adam and Eve and placed them in the garden of Eden, He purposed that eventually the entire earth would be filled with perfect humans who would willingly give Him their worship​—pure worship from pure hearts. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:28-1:1:28" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Gen. 1:28</a>) Satan challenged Jehovah’s sovereignty because he coveted that which rightly belongs only to the Sovereign Lord Jehovah​—worship.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:1:14-59:1:15" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Jas. 1:14, 15</a>.</p>

<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>Did Satan succeed in his attack on pure worship? He managed to turn Adam and Eve away from God. Ever since, Satan has waged war against true worship, seeking to turn as many as possible away from Jehovah God.

In the first century C.E., he wickedly stirred up an apostasy by means of which the Christian congregation became corrupted, and pure worship eventually seemed lost.

<div><p id="p31" data-pid="31">Regarding Satan’s words, one Bible reference work says: “As in the very first account of testing, failed by Adam and Eve . . . , the question centers on a choice between the will of Satan or the will of God, which involves implicitly the rendering of worship to the one or the other. Satan indeed vaunts himself as god in place of the only God.”</p></div>
<div><p id="p32" data-pid="32">Luke’s Gospel lists the temptations in a different order, but Matthew’s account is evidently chronological. Consider three reasons why. (1) Matthew introduces the second temptation with the word “then,” suggesting that it was next in sequence. (2) It seems logical that the two subtle temptations​—each beginning with the phrase, “If you are a son of God”—​would be followed by the overt temptation to break the first commandment. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:20:2-2:20:3" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Ex. 20:2, 3</a>) (3) Jesus’ words “Go away, Satan!” would more naturally have followed the third and final temptation.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:4:5-40:4:5" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Matt. 4:5,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:4:10-40:4:11" data-bid="31-2" class="b"> 10, 11</a>.</p></div>

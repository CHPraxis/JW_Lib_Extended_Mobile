SECTION THREE
“I Will . . . Collect You Together”​—Restoration of Pure Worship Promised

EZEKIEL 20:41
FOCUS: Restoration revealed in Ezekiel’s prophecies




Israel is shattered​—her unity torn by apostasy. She is suffering the consequences of her actions; she defiled pure worship and defamed God’s name. Amid the despair, Jehovah moves Ezekiel to utter a series of prophecies that offer hope. Using striking word pictures and awe-inspiring visions, Jehovah encourages not just the captive Israelites but all who long to see pure worship restored.

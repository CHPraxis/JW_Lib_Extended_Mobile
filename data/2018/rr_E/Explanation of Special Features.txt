TEACHING BOXES





Teaching boxes in this publication are labeled with a chapter number and a sequential letter. For example, the three boxes in Chapter 10 are labeled 10A, 10B, and 10C. In electronic formats, readers have the option to browse all the boxes at once in the “Teaching Boxes” section. Some additional features of this publication are available in electronic formats only.


TIME LINES
Many teaching boxes contain time lines. Folds, as shown in the example, indicate that a span of time has been compressed to fit within the artwork. (For an example, see box 8B.) In some cases, these folds indicate an unknown length of time.​—See box 9E.

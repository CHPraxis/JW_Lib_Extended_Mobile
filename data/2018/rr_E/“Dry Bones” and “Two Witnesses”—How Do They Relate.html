<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">THE year 1919 saw the fulfillment of two related prophecies: one regarding “dry bones,” the other about “two witnesses.” The vision of “dry bones” foretells a very long period (which turned out to be many centuries) that ends with the coming to life of a large group of God’s people. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:37:2-26:37:4" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ezek. 37:2-4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:11:1-66:11:3" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Rev. 11:1-3,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:11:7-66:11:13" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> 7-13</a>) The prophecy about the “two witnesses” describes a short period (fulfilled from late 1914 to early 1919) that ends with the coming to life of a small group of God’s servants. Both prophecies depicted a symbolic resurrection, and both prophecies saw a modern-day fulfillment in 1919 when Jehovah caused his anointed servants “to stand on their feet,” leave their captivity to Babylon the Great, and be gathered in the restored congregation.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:37:10-26:37:10" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ezek. 37:10</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Note, though, that the fulfillment of these two prophecies differs in an important way. The prophecy of the “dry bones” foretells the coming to life of <em>all </em>members of the anointed remnant. However, the prophecy of the “two witnesses” foretells the coming to life of <em>some </em>members of God’s anointed remnant​—those who were taking the lead in the organization and who were appointed as “the faithful and discreet slave.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:45-40:24:45" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matt. 24:45;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:11:6-66:11:6" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Rev. 11:6</a>.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span></p>

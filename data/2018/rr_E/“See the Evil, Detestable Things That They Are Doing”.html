<p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb">AS THE son of a priest, the prophet Ezekiel is well-versed in the Mosaic Law. So he is familiar with the temple in Jerusalem and the pure worship of Jehovah that should be carried out there. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:1:3-26:1:3" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ezek. 1:3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/39:2:7-39:2:7" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Mal. 2:7</a>) But now, in 612 B.C.E., what is happening at Jehovah’s temple would shock any faithful Jew, including Ezekiel.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>Jehovah wants Ezekiel to see the deplorable conditions at the temple and then to tell “the elders of Judah,” fellow Jewish exiles gathered in his house, what he sees. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:8:1-26:8:4" data-bid="3-1" class="b"><strong>Ezekiel 8:1-4;</strong></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:11:24-26:11:25" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Ezek. 11:24, 25;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:20:1-26:20:3" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> 20:1-3</a>) By means of holy spirit, Jehovah transports Ezekiel (in vision) from his house in Tel-abib, near the river Chebar in Babylon, hundreds of miles west to Jerusalem. Jehovah sets the prophet down in the temple, at the north gate of the inner courtyard. Starting here, Jehovah takes him, by means of a vision, on a tour of the temple.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><span id="page53" class="pageNum" data-no="53" data-before-text="53"></span><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>Ezekiel now observes four shocking scenes that reflect the utter spiritual collapse of the nation.

<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu"> <strong>4. </strong>What does Jehovah require of his worshippers?</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>Some nine centuries before Ezekiel’s day, Jehovah clearly stated what he requires of his worshippers. In the second of the Ten Commandments, he told the Israelites:<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> “I, Jehovah your God, am a God who requires exclusive devotion.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:20:5-2:20:5" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ex. 20:5</a>) By the expression “exclusive devotion,” Jehovah indicated that he would not tolerate the worship of any other gods. As we saw in <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1102017162/">Chapter 2</a> of this publication, the first requirement of pure worship is that the recipient of our religious devotion must be Jehovah. His worshippers have to give him the first place in their lives. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:20:3-2:20:3" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ex. 20:3</a>) Put simply, Jehovah expects his worshippers to keep spiritually clean by not mixing true worship with false. In 1513 B.C.E., the Israelites willingly entered into the Law covenant. By so doing, they agreed to give exclusive devotion to Jehovah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:24:3-2:24:8" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ex. 24:3-8</a>) Jehovah is loyal to his covenants, and he expected similar loyalty from his covenant people.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:7:9-5:7:10" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Deut. 7:9, 10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:22:26-10:22:26" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 2 Sam. 22:26</a>.</p>
<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu"><strong>5, 6. </strong>Why did Jehovah deserve exclusive devotion from the Israelites?</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>Was it reasonable for Jehovah to require exclusive devotion from the Israelites? Yes, indeed! He is Almighty God, the Universal Sovereign, and the Source and Sustainer of life. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:36:9-19:36:9" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Ps. 36:9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:17:28-44:17:28" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> Acts 17:28</a>) Jehovah was also the Israelites’ Deliverer. When giving them the Ten Commandments, he reminded the people: “I am Jehovah your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:20:2-2:20:2" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ex. 20:2</a>) Clearly, Jehovah deserved the exclusive place in the hearts of the Israelites.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>Jehovah does not change. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/39:3:6-39:3:6" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Mal. 3:6</a>) He has never wavered in his insistence on exclusive devotion. Imagine, then, how he must have felt about the four disturbing scenes that he now showed to Ezekiel in vision.</p>

At the northern gate of the temple, apostate Jews were worshipping an idolatrous symbol, or image.

<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu"> <strong>8. </strong>What meaning does Ezekiel’s vision of the symbol of jealousy have for our day?</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>What meaning does Ezekiel’s vision of the symbol of jealousy have for our day? Apostate Judah certainly reminds us of Christendom. Idolatry is widespread in the churches of Christendom, which makes invalid any devotion that the people claim to give to God. Since Jehovah does not change, we can be sure that Christendom, like apostate Judah, has provoked his righteous anger. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:1:17-59:1:17" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Jas. 1:17</a>) Surely, Jehovah is far away from this distorted form of Christianity!</p>
<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu"><strong>9, 10. </strong>What warning lesson can we learn from the idolaters in the temple?</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>What warning lesson can we learn from those idolaters in the temple? To render exclusive devotion to Jehovah, we must “flee from idolatry.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:10:14-46:10:14" data-bid="15-1" class="b">1 Cor. 10:14</a>) We might think, ‘I would never use images or symbols in my worship of Jehovah!’ But idolatry comes in various forms, some more subtle than others. One Bible reference work puts it this way: “One may think of idolatry as a metaphor for other goods​—anything of value, worth, or power that becomes our ultimate concern to the exclusion of God.” Idolatry, then, can include material possessions, money, sex, entertainment​—really, anything that could take first place in our lives and thus replace the exclusive devotion that is due Jehovah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:19-40:6:21" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Matt. 6:19-21,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:24-40:6:24" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> 24;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:5:5-49:5:5" data-bid="16-3" class="b"> Eph. 5:5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:3:5-51:3:5" data-bid="16-4" class="b"> Col. 3:5</a>) We must guard against every form of idolatry because Jehovah has exclusive claim to our hearts​—and our worship!​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:5:21-62:5:21" data-bid="17-1" class="b">1 John 5:21</a>.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>The first scene that Jehovah showed Ezekiel involved “terrible, detestable things.” Yet, Jehovah told his faithful prophet: “You will see detestable things that are even more terrible.” What could be more terrible than the worship of that idolatrous symbol of jealousy in the temple area?</p>

The people gave way to unrestrained greed by practicing bribery, extortion, and usury. How it must have pained Jehovah to see his covenant people trampling on his Law and ignoring the loving spirit behind it! Jehovah took their moral bankruptcy personally. He directed Ezekiel to tell the immoral people: “You have entirely forgotten me.”</p>

<p id="p52" data-pid="52" class="qu"><strong>20. </strong>Why do Ezekiel’s words about the moral uncleanness of Judah have meaning for our day?</p>
<p id="p30" data-pid="30" data-rel-pid="[52]" class="sb"><strong><sup>20 </sup></strong>Why do Ezekiel’s words about the moral uncleanness of Judah have meaning for our day? The corruption in apostate Judah reminds us of the morally bankrupt world we live in today. Political rulers have abused their power and oppressed the common people. Religious leaders​—in particular, the clergy of Christendom—​have blessed the wars of the nations that have caused the loss of countless millions of lives. The clergy have watered down the Bible’s pure and clear standards <span id="page61" class="pageNum" data-no="61" data-before-text="61"></span>regarding sexual morality. As a result, the moral standards of the world around us keep sinking ever lower. Surely Jehovah would say to Christendom what he said to apostate Judah: “You have entirely forgotten me.”</p>
<p id="p53" data-pid="53" class="qu"><strong>21. </strong>What can we learn from the moral uncleanness of ancient Judah?</p>
<p id="p31" data-pid="31" data-rel-pid="[53]" class="sb"><strong><sup>21 </sup></strong>What can we as Jehovah’s people learn from the moral uncleanness of ancient Judah? To worship Jehovah acceptably, we must keep our conduct clean in all respects. That is no small challenge in this morally corrupt world. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:1-55:3:5" data-bid="33-1" class="b">2 Tim. 3:1-5</a>) However, we know how Jehovah feels about moral corruption in all its ugly forms. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:6:9-46:6:10" data-bid="34-1" class="b">1 Cor. 6:9, 10</a>) We obey Jehovah’s moral standards because we love him and his laws. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:119:97-19:119:97" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Ps. 119:97;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:5:3-62:5:3" data-bid="35-2" class="b"> 1 John 5:3</a>) To become morally unclean would be unloving toward our holy and clean God. We would never want to give Jehovah just cause to say to us: “You have entirely forgotten me.”</p>
<p id="p54" data-pid="54" class="qu"><strong>22. </strong>(a) After reviewing Jehovah’s exposé of ancient Judah, what are you resolved to do? (b) What will be discussed in the next chapter?</p>
<p id="p32" data-pid="32" data-rel-pid="[54]" class="sb"><strong><sup>22 </sup></strong>We have learned some valuable lessons from reviewing Jehovah’s exposé of the spiritual and moral decline of ancient Judah. Surely we are strengthened in our resolve to give Jehovah the exclusive devotion that he so richly deserves. To that end, we must guard against all forms of idolatry and keep morally clean. What, though, did Jehovah do about his unfaithful people? At the conclusion of Ezekiel’s temple tour, Jehovah plainly told his prophet: “I will act in rage.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:8:17-26:8:18" data-bid="36-1" class="b">Ezek. 8:17, 18</a>) We want to know what action Jehovah took toward unfaithful Judah, for a similar judgment will be executed on this wicked world. The next chapter will discuss how Jehovah’s judgments against Judah were fulfilled.</p>

<div><p id="p35" data-pid="35">The use of the term “jealousy” shows how seriously Jehovah views the matter of faithfulness to him. We may think of the jealous indignation a husband would feel if his wife were to become unfaithful. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:6:34-20:6:34" data-bid="38-1" class="b">Prov. 6:34</a>) Like such a husband, Jehovah rightly became indignant when his covenant people proved unfaithful by taking up image worship. One reference work notes: “God’s jealousy . . . proceeds from His holiness. Because He alone is the Holy One . . . , He will tolerate no rival.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:34:14-2:34:14" data-bid="39-1" class="b">Ex. 34:14</a>.</p></div>

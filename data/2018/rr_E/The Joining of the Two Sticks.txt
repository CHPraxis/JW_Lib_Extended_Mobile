TEACHING BOX 12A
The Joining of the Two Sticks




Ezekiel is instructed by Jehovah to write on one stick “for Judah” and on another stick “for Joseph, the stick of Ephraim.”








“for Judah”

ANCIENT TIMES
Two-tribe kingdom of Judah
MODERN TIMES
The anointed



“for Joseph, the stick of Ephraim”

ANCIENT TIMES
Ten-tribe kingdom of Israel
MODERN TIMES
The other sheep








“they become just one stick in your hand”

ANCIENT TIMES
537 B.C.E. True worshippers return from the nations, rebuild Jerusalem, and worship as one nation.
MODERN TIMES
Since 1919, God’s people are gradually reorganized and united to serve as “one flock.”
Becoming united is the focus
The prophecy does not describe one stick that is first torn in two and then later brought together as one. Rather, it describes two sticks that become united as one. Hence, the prophecy did not focus on how the nation of Israel became divided into two kingdoms. Rather, it focused on how the two kingdoms would become one.

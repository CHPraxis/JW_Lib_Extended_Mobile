<p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb">FOR hundreds of years, Israel had been like a lone sheep amid a pack of wolves. The Ammonites, Moabites, and Edomites menaced Israel on its eastern border. The Philistines, constant enemies of Israel, maintained a foothold to the west. To the north lay the city of Tyre, the rich and powerful hub of a vast trading empire. To the south sprawled the ancient nation of Egypt, ruled by its god-king, Pharaoh.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>When the Israelites relied on Jehovah, he protected them from their enemies. Time and again, though, his people and their kings allowed themselves to be corrupted by the nations that surrounded them. King Ahab is just one example of such a weak-willed ruler. A contemporary of King Jehoshaphat of Judah, he ruled the ten-tribe kingdom of Israel. He married a daughter of the Sidonian king who controlled the prosperous city of Tyre. That woman, named Jezebel, fanatically promoted Baal worship in Israel and influenced her husband to <span id="page72" class="pageNum" data-no="72" data-before-text="72"></span>contaminate pure worship on an unprecedented scale.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:16:30-11:16:33" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Ki. 16:30-33;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:18:4-11:18:4" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 18:4,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:18:19-11:18:19" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> 19</a>.</p>

<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>The <strong><em>Edomites </em></strong>were descendants of Jacob’s twin brother, Esau.

<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>Jehovah called Israel’s extended family to account for the way they treated His people. He said: “I will give . . . the Ammonites as a possession to the people of the East, so that the Ammonites will not be remembered among the nations.” He also said: “I will execute judgment in Moab, and they will have to know that I am Jehovah.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:25:10-26:25:11" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Ezek. 25:10, 11</a>) Some five years after Jerusalem fell, those prophecies began to be fulfilled when the Babylonians conquered Ammon and Moab.

<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>What <strong><em>lessons </em></strong>can we learn from Israel’s dealings with those nations? First, when Israel let down her guard, the corrupting false religious practices of her relatives crept in, such as worship of the Moabite Baal of Peor and the Ammonite god Molech. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:25:1-4:25:3" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Num. 25:1-3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:11:7-11:11:7" data-bid="22-2" class="b"> 1 Ki. 11:7</a>) Something similar could happen to us. We may face pressure from unbelieving relatives who encourage us to drop our guard. For example, they may not understand why we do not celebrate Easter, exchange gifts at Christmas, or share in other popular customs that are associated with false religious beliefs. With the best of intentions, <span id="page75" class="pageNum" data-no="75" data-before-text="75"></span>they may try to get us​—even briefly—​to compromise our standards. How vital it is, though, that we never succumb to such pressure! As the history of Israel shows, even one step off the “cliff” of compromise can lead to disaster.</p>
<p id="p52" data-pid="52" class="qu"><strong>12, 13. </strong>What opposition might we face, but what might happen if we remain loyal?</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[52]" class="sb"><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>We can learn another lesson from Israel’s experiences with Ammon, Moab, and Edom. We may face severe opposition from unbelieving family members. Jesus warned that at times the message we preach would “cause division, with a man against his father, and a daughter against her mother.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:10:35-40:10:36" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Matt. 10:35, 36</a>) Jehovah instructed the Israelites not to start a quarrel with their relatives, and we do not seek confrontation with our nonbelieving family members.

<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[52]" class="sb"><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>Even if our relatives do not directly oppose our worship of Jehovah, we must not let them have more influence over us than Jehovah does. Why not? Because Jehovah deserves first place in our heart. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:10:37-40:10:37" data-bid="25-1" class="b"><strong>Matthew 10:37</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>In addition, if we remain loyal to Jehovah, some of our relatives might prove to be like Zelek, Ithmah, and Ruth and join us in pure worship. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:4:16-54:4:16" data-bid="26-1" class="b">1 Tim. 4:16</a>) Then they too will have the pleasure of serving the only true God and enjoying his love and protection.</p>

Jehovah’s modern-day people have faced opposition from some of the most powerful nations ever to dominate mankind. Unlike Israel, we have maintained a record of steadfast loyalty to Jehovah.

For instance, at the beginning of the 20th century, the government of the United States attempted to stop the work of Jehovah’s people by sentencing those who took the lead in the organization to decades in prison. During the second world war, the Nazi party in Germany tried to wipe out God’s people, imprisoning thousands and killing hundreds.

They will destroy the walls of Tyre and tear down her towers, and I will scrape away soil and make her a shining, bare rock.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:26:1-26:26:5" data-bid="40-1" class="b">Ezek. 26:1-5</a>) For protection, the inhabitants of Tyre trusted in their riches, which they felt provided them with the same <span id="page78" class="pageNum" data-no="78" data-before-text="78"></span>security as the island-city’s 150-foot-high (46 m) walls. They would have done well to pay attention to Solomon’s warning: “The wealth of the rich is his fortified city; it is like a protective wall in his imagination.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:18:11-20:18:11" data-bid="41-1" class="b">Prov. 18:11</a>.</p>

<p id="p32" data-pid="32" data-rel-pid="[59]" class="sb"><strong><sup>24 </sup></strong>From before the days of Joseph to the time when the Babylonians marched on Jerusalem, <strong><em>Egypt </em></strong>wielded considerable political influence in the region of the Promised Land.

<p id="p33" data-pid="33" data-rel-pid="[59]" class="sb"><strong><sup>25 </sup></strong>Apostate King Zedekiah did not recognize that about Egypt.

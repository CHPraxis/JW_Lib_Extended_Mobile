He had to lead God’s people into the Promised Land and conquer the powerful armies of the nations that lived there. Jehovah knew that Joshua had every reason to be afraid, so He told Moses: “Commission Joshua and encourage him and strengthen him, because he is the one who will cross over before this people and he is the one who will cause them to inherit the land that you will see.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:3:28-5:3:28" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 3:28</a>) Then Jehovah himself encouraged Joshua, saying: “Have I not commanded you?

For example, Jehovah knew that the Jews would need encouragement when they were captives in Babylon, and he gave them an encouraging prophecy, stating: “Do not be afraid, for I am with you. Do not be anxious, for I am your God. I will fortify you, yes, I will help you, I will really hold on to you with my right hand of righteousness.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:41:10-23:41:10" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Isaiah 41:10</a>) Later, Jehovah encouraged the early Christians, and he encourages us in the same way.​—<strong>Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:1:3-47:1:4" data-bid="10-1" class="b"><strong>2 Corinthians 1:3, 4</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>

He promised that if Jehovah helped him to win the battle, the first person who met him when he returned home would go to serve Jehovah at the tabernacle. Israel won the battle, and the first person who came to meet Jephthah was his daughter, his only child. Jephthah’s heart was broken.

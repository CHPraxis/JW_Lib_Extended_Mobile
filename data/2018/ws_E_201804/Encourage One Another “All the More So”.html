<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu"> <strong>1. </strong>Why did the apostle Paul urge the early Hebrew Christians to encourage one another “all the more so”?</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb">IN THE first century, the apostle Paul gave this advice to the Hebrew Christians: “Let us consider one another so as to incite to love and fine works, not forsaking our meeting together, as some have the custom, but encouraging one another, and <strong>all the more so as you see the day drawing near.” </strong>(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:10:24-58:10:25" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Hebrews 10:24, 25</a>) The brothers may have wondered why Paul told them to be even more encouraging to one another. Less than five years later, one reason became clear. At that time, they saw that Jehovah’s day of judgment on Jerusalem was near. They recognized that they needed to flee from the city as Jesus had told them to do. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:21:20-42:21:22" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Luke 21:20-22;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:2:19-44:2:20" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Acts 2:19, 20</a>) That day of Jehovah came in the year 70 when the Romans destroyed Jerusalem.</p>
<p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="qu"> <strong>2. </strong>Why should we think even more about encouraging one another today?</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><span id="page22" class="pageNum" data-no="22" data-before-text="22"></span><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>Today, we are in a similar situation. Jehovah’s “great and very awe-inspiring” day is near. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/29:2:11-29:2:11" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Joel 2:11</a>) The words of the prophet Zephaniah also apply to our time: “The great day of Jehovah is near! It is near and it is approaching very quickly!” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/36:1:14-36:1:14" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Zephaniah 1:14</a>) For this reason, we should “be concerned about one another so as to incite to love and fine works.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:10:24-58:10:24" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Hebrews 10:24</a>, footnote) We need to become even more interested in our brothers so that we can encourage them when they need it.</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu"> <strong>3. </strong>What did the apostle Paul say about encouragement? (See opening picture.)</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>“Anxiety in a man’s heart weighs it down, but a good word cheers it up.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:12:25-20:12:25" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Proverbs 12:25</a>) All of us at times need encouragement. Paul made it clear that even those who are responsible for encouraging others also need to be encouraged themselves. He wrote to his brothers in Rome: “I am longing to see you, that I may impart some spiritual gift to you for you to be made firm; or, rather, that we may have an interchange of encouragement by one another’s faith, both yours and mine.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:1:11-45:1:12" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Romans 1:11, 12</a>) So even the apostle Paul needed encouragement at times.​—<strong>Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:15:30-45:15:32" data-bid="9-1" class="b"><strong>Romans 15:30-32</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>
<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu"><strong>4, 5. </strong>Whom can we encourage today, and why?</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>Today, we can encourage those who serve Jehovah full-time, such as faithful pioneers. Many of them have sacrificed things they enjoy in life so that they can pioneer. This is also true of missionaries, Bethelites, circuit overseers and their wives, and those who serve at remote translation offices. They all make sacrifices in order to spend more time serving Jehovah. So we should encourage them. There are also many who wish they could still be in full-time service but are no longer able to. They too are grateful when they receive encouragement.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>Who else deserve encouragement? We can encourage the many brothers and sisters who have chosen to remain single because they want to obey Jehovah and marry “only in the Lord.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:7:39-46:7:39" data-bid="10-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 7:39</a>) Wives are encouraged when their husbands tell them they love them and are grateful for all they do. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:31:28-20:31:28" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Proverbs 31:28,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:31:31-20:31:31" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 31</a>) Christians who endure persecution or sickness also need to be encouraged. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/53:1:3-53:1:5" data-bid="12-1" class="b">2 Thessalonians 1:3-5</a>) Jehovah and Jesus comfort all these faithful ones.​—<strong>Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/53:2:16-53:2:17" data-bid="13-1" class="b"><strong>2 Thessalonians 2:16, 17</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>

<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup>Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:32:1-23:32:2" data-bid="14-1" class="b"><strong>Isaiah 32:1, 2</strong></a><strong>. </strong>We live in difficult times and could easily become sad and discouraged. Jesus Christ uses his anointed brothers and faithful “princes” of the other sheep to encourage us. These congregation elders are not “masters” over our faith but “fellow workers” for our joy. They want to help us be happy and stay faithful.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:1:24-47:1:24" data-bid="15-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 1:24</a>.</p>

He wrote to Christians in Thessalonica who were being persecuted: “Having tender affection for you, we were determined to impart to you, not only the good news of God but also our very selves, because you became so beloved to us.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/52:2:8-52:2:8" data-bid="16-1" class="b">1 Thessalonians 2:8</a>.</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>Elders can be very encouraging by what they say. But is that always enough? Paul told the elders from Ephesus: “You must assist those who are weak and must keep in mind the words of the Lord Jesus, when he himself said: ‘There is more happiness in giving than there is in receiving.’” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:20:35-44:20:35" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Acts 20:35</a>) Paul was willing to “spend and be completely spent for” his brothers. He proved by his actions that he was willing to do his best for them. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:12:15-47:12:15" data-bid="18-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 12:15</a>) In a similar way, elders should encourage and comfort others not only by what they say but also by what they do. This shows that they really care about us.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:14:3-46:14:3" data-bid="19-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 14:3</a>.</p>

<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>To strengthen the brothers, elders sometimes need to give counsel. Elders can learn from the Bible how to do this in an encouraging way. Jesus set an excellent example in giving counsel when he sent messages to the congregations in Asia Minor after his death and resurrection. He had some strong counsel for the congregations in Ephesus, Pergamum, and Thyatira. But before he gave the counsel, he commended them for all the good things they were doing. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:2:1-66:2:5" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Revelation 2:1-5,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:2:12-66:2:13" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> 12, 13,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:2:18-66:2:19" data-bid="20-3" class="b"> 18, 19</a>) Jesus told the congregation in Laodicea: “All those for whom I have affection, I reprove and discipline. So be zealous and repent.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:3:19-66:3:19" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Revelation 3:19</a>) Our elders try to imitate Christ in the way they give counsel.</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:4:29-49:4:29" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Ephesians 4:29</a>) Each of us should be aware of what others need so that we can help them. Paul wrote to the Hebrew Christians: “Strengthen the hands that hang down and the feeble knees, and keep making straight paths for your feet, so that what is lame may not be put out of joint but, rather, may be healed.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:12:12-58:12:13" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Hebrews 12:12, 13</a>) All of us can strengthen and encourage one another by what we say, even if we are very young.</p>

<p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>Paul wrote to the Christians in Philippi: “If, then, there is any encouragement in Christ, if any consolation of love, if any spiritual fellowship, if any tender affection and compassion, make my joy full by being of the same mind and having the same love, being completely united, having the one thought in mind. Do nothing out of contentiousness or out of egotism, but with humility consider others superior to you, as you look out not only for your own interests, but also for the interests of others.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:2:1-50:2:4" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Philippians 2:1-4</a>.</p>

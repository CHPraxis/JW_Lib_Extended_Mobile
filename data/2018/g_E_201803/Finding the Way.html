<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><strong>DO YOU CONSIDER YOURSELF TO BE A HAPPY PERSON? </strong>If so, what makes you happy? Your family, your work, your religious faith? Perhaps you are looking forward to something that may make you happy, such as finishing your schooling, getting a good job, or buying a new car.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Many people experience a measure of happiness when they reach a certain goal or obtain a desired item. But how long does that surge of happiness last? Often, it is only temporary, which can be disappointing.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Happiness has been described as a state of well-being that is characterized by relative permanence, by emotions ranging from mere contentment to deep and intense joy in living, and by a natural desire for it to continue.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Further, as an ongoing state of well-being, <strong>happiness has been described, not as a destination or goal, but as a journey. </strong>To say, “I’ll be happy when . . .” is, in effect, postponing happiness.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">To illustrate, compare happiness with good health. How do we enjoy that state of physical well-being? We follow a wise path in regard to diet, exercise, and overall lifestyle. Likewise, happiness results from following a good path in life, living in harmony with sound principles.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">What principles or qualities of life characterize the way of happiness? While some are more important than others, the following play a key role:</p>
<ul class="noMarker"><li><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="si"><strong>CONTENTMENT AND GENEROSITY</strong></p>
</li>
<li><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="si"><strong>PHYSICAL HEALTH AND RESILIENCE</strong></p>
</li>
<li><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="si"><strong>LOVE</strong></p>
</li>
<li><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="si"><strong>FORGIVENESS</strong></p>
</li>
<li><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="si"><strong>PURPOSE IN LIFE</strong></p>
</li>
<li><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="si"><strong>HOPE</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">A highly respected book of wisdom states: “Happy are those who are blameless in their way.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:119:1-19:119:1" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 119:1</a>) Let us now consider that way.</p>

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><strong>“DURING MY CHILDHOOD, I HEARD A LOT OF INSULTS AND SCREAMING,” </strong>said a woman named Patricia. “I did not learn to forgive. Even as an adult, I would dwell on an offense for days, losing sleep.” Yes, a life filled with anger and resentment is neither a happy one nor a healthy one. Indeed, studies show that unforgiving people may . . .</p>

<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb"><strong>WHAT IS FORGIVENESS? </strong>Forgiveness means pardoning an offender and letting go of anger, resentment, and thoughts of revenge. It does not mean condoning a wrong, minimizing it, or pretending that it did not happen. Rather, forgiveness is a well-thought-out personal choice that reflects a loving commitment to peace and to building or maintaining a good relationship with the other person.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Forgiveness also reflects understanding. A forgiving person understands that we all err, or sin, in word and deed. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:3:23-45:3:23" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Romans 3:23</a>) Reflecting such insight, the Bible says: “Continue putting up with one another and forgiving one another freely even if anyone has a cause for complaint against another.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:3:13-51:3:13" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Colossians 3:13</a>.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">It stands to reason, then, that forgiveness is an important facet of love, which is “a perfect bond of union.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:3:14-51:3:14" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Colossians 3:14</a>) Indeed, according to the Mayo Clinic website, forgiveness leads to . . .</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">After studying the Bible, Patricia, quoted at the outset, learned to forgive. “I feel liberated from the anger that poisoned my life,” she wrote. “I no longer suffer, and I don’t make others suffer. Bible principles confirm that God loves us and wants the best for us.”</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">A man named Ron said: “I could not control the thoughts and actions of others. But I could control my own. If I wanted peace, I had to let go of resentment. I began to view peace and resentment as north and south. I could not be in both places at the same time. I now have a good conscience.”</p>

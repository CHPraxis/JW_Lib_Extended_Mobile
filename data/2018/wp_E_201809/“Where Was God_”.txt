“Where Was God?”

“CONSTANTLY THE QUESTION COMES UP: WHERE WAS GOD?”​—Pope Benedict XVI, while visiting the former concentration camp at Auschwitz, Poland.





WHEN TRAGEDIES STRIKE, DO YOU EVER WONDER, ‘WHERE WAS GOD?’ OR IN YOUR OWN LIFE, HAS A TRAUMATIC EVENT MADE YOU QUESTION WHETHER GOD CARES ABOUT YOU PERSONALLY?
Perhaps you feel as did Sheila, who lives in the United States. Raised in a deeply religious family, she says: “From childhood on, I was drawn to God because he is our Maker. Yet, I never felt close to him. I thought he was watching me, but only from a distance. I didn’t feel that God hated me, but neither did I believe that he cared for me.” Why did Sheila have doubts? She explains: “My family faced one tragedy after another, and it seemed that God wasn’t helping us at all.”
Like Sheila, you may feel sure that Almighty God exists. Yet, you may wonder whether he really cares about you. The righteous man Job, who had faith in the power and wisdom of the Creator, had similar doubts. (Job 2:3; 9:4) After Job was pummeled by one tragedy after another​—with no relief in sight—​he asked God: “Why do you hide your face and consider me your enemy?”​—Job 13:24.
What does the Bible say? Is God to blame when tragedy strikes? Is there any evidence that God cares about humans in general and about each one of us individually? On a personal level, can any of us really know whether he notices us, understands us, empathizes with us, or helps us with our problems?
In the following articles, we will consider what creation teaches us about God’s care for us. (Romans 1:20) Then, we will analyze what the Bible reveals about God’s care. The more you “come to know him” through his creation and his Word, the more you will have the assurance that “he cares for you.”​—1 John 2:3; 1 Peter 5:7.

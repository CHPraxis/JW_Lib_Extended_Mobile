How Does God Feel About Your Suffering?




Some people believe that God neither sees suffering nor cares about it.



CONSIDER WHAT THE BIBLE SAYS

  God both sees and cares
“Jehovah saw that man’s wickedness was great on the earth . . . , and his heart was saddened.”​—Genesis 6:5, 6.

  God will stop all suffering
“Just a little while longer, and the wicked will be no more; you will look at where they were, and they will not be there. But the meek will possess the earth, and they will find exquisite delight in the abundance of peace.”​—Psalm 37:10, 11.

  What God wants for you
“‘I well know the thoughts that I am thinking toward you,’ declares Jehovah, ‘thoughts of peace, and not of calamity, to give you a future and a hope. And you will call me and come and pray to me, and I will listen to you.’”​—Jeremiah 29:11, 12.
“Draw close to God, and he will draw close to you.”​—James 4:8.

DOES GOD CARE ABOUT YOU?

When disaster strikes or people suffer and die, we may wonder whether God sees it or cares about it. The Bible states:
“For the eyes of Jehovah are on the righteous, and his ears listen to their supplication, but the face of Jehovah is against those doing bad things.”​—1 Peter 3:12.
This issue of The Watchtower shows how God helps us and what he is doing to remove all suffering.

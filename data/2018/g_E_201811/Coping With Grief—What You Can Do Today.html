<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">If you look for advice on dealing with grief, you will likely find a myriad of ideas​—some more helpful than others. Perhaps that is because, as mentioned earlier, <strong>everyone grieves differently.</strong> What works for one person may not work for someone else.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Even so, there are some basic guidelines that have proved practical for many. They are frequently cited by grief counselors, and they echo timeless principles found in an ancient book of wisdom, the Bible.</p>

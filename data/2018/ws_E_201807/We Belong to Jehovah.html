(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:12:9-58:12:9" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Hebrews 12:9</a>) Jesus did something similar when he got baptized. Even though he was already part of a nation that was dedicated to Jehovah, he offered himself to Jehovah.

<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>How did Jehovah feel when Jesus got baptized? The Bible says: “After being baptized, Jesus immediately came up from the water; and look! the heavens were opened up, and he saw God’s spirit descending like a dove and coming upon him. Look! Also, a voice from the heavens said: ‘This is my Son, the beloved, whom I have approved.’” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:3:16-40:3:17" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Matthew 3:16, 17</a>) Jesus already belonged to God. But Jehovah was happy when he saw that Jesus was willing to use his life to serve only Him. Jehovah is also pleased when we dedicate our lives to him, and he will bless us.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:149:4-19:149:4" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Psalm 149:4</a>.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>But Jehovah already owns everything! What could we give to him? Imagine a man who has beautiful flowers in his garden. One day his little daughter picks one of the flowers and gives it to him. Even though the flower already belongs to him, the loving father is delighted with the gift. It shows that his daughter loves him. That flower from his daughter is more precious to him than all the other flowers in his garden. In a similar way, Jehovah is delighted when we willingly dedicate our lives to him.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:34:14-2:34:14" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Exodus 34:14</a>.</p>

It is true that <span id="page23" class="pageNum" data-no="23" data-before-text="23"></span>from the moment you began to exist, you already belonged to your Creator, Jehovah. But just think how happy Jehovah will be when you accept him as your Ruler and dedicate yourself to him! (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:23:15-20:23:15" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Proverbs 23:15</a>) Jehovah knows those who willingly serve him, and he writes their names in his “book of remembrance.”</p>

<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>If we want our name to remain in Jehovah’s “book of remembrance,” there is something we must do. Malachi said that we must fear Jehovah and meditate on his name. If we worship anyone or anything else, our name will be removed from Jehovah’s book!​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:32:33-2:32:33" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Exodus 32:33;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:69:28-19:69:28" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> Psalm 69:28</a>.</p>

They may not have been disciplined in the Christian congregation for a serious sin, but they can be a bad influence on their brothers and sisters who are trying hard to be different from the world.​—<strong>Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:2:11-60:2:12" data-bid="29-1" class="b"><strong>1 Peter 2:11, 12</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>

EPHRON
(Eʹphron).
1. [from a root meaning “young one [of the stags]”]. A Hittite son of Zohar who owned a field in Machpelah in front of Mamre, that is, in Hebron. Abraham purchased this field from Ephron, together with the cave located on it, as a burial place for his wife Sarah. (Ge 23:3-20) Abraham paid 400 silver shekels (c. $880) for this family burial plot, yet generations thereafter it was still referred to as “the field of Ephron.”​—Ge 25:9; 49:29, 30; 50:13.
2. [Place of Dust]. A mountain ridge situated between Nephtoah and Kiriath-jearim. (Jos 15:9) It lay on the northern boundary of the tribe of Judah.
3. “Ephron” appears at 2 Chronicles 13:19 in the Masoretic text as well as in the Greek Septuagint and some other versions; however, the marginal reading of the Masoretic text gives “Ephrain.”​—See EPHRAIN.

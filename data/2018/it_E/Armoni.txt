ARMONI
(Ar·moʹni) [Of the Dwelling Tower; Born in the Dwelling Tower].
One of two sons born to Saul by his concubine Rizpah. To expiate Saul’s bloodguilt, seven of his offspring, including Armoni, were given to the Gibeonites, who put them to death and exposed their corpses on the mountain. Rizpah kept watch, not letting fowl or beast molest them, until David had the bones buried.​—2Sa 21:5-14.

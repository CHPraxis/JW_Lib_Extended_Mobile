<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The burial place of Judge Jair. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:10:5-7:10:5" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Jg 10:5</a>) Josephus speaks of Kamon as “a city of Gilead.” (<em>Jewish Antiquities,</em> V, 254 [vii, 6]) This seems to fit the Scriptural reference to Jair’s being a “Gileadite.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:10:3-7:10:3" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Jg 10:3</a>) Two locations E of the Jordan are commonly presented for ancient Kamon. One is Qamm, about 18 km (11 mi) SE of the Sea of Galilee. But its ruins give no evidence of habitation before Roman times. The other suggestion is the site of the less impressive ruins of undetermined antiquity at Qumeim, about 3 km (2 mi) farther S.</p>

OPHNI
(Ophʹni).
A city of Benjamin (Jos 18:21, 24), commonly linked with the Gophna mentioned by Josephus (The Jewish War, III, 55 [iii, 5]) and considered to be modern Jifna. This site is about 5 km (3 mi) NNW of Bethel and therefore seemingly N of Benjamite territory. (Jos 18:11-13) For the identification to be correct, it must be assumed either that Ophni was a Benjamite enclave city in Ephraim or that the Benjamite boundary extended northward near Bethel to include this suggested site of Ophni.

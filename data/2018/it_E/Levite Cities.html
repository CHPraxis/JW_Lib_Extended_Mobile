<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">The Levites were given no territorial allotment, Jehovah being their inheritance.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:35:1-4:35:8" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Nu 35:1-8</a>) Such cities were ultimately assigned to the Levites (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:21:1-6:21:8" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Jos 21:1-8</a>), and 13 of them were priestly cities.

<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The Levites had the right to repurchase at any time houses they sold within their cities, or these were restored to them during the Jubilee year. But the pasturelands adjacent to their cities were never to be sold.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:25:32-3:25:34" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Le 25:32-34</a>; see <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200002731/">LEVITES</a>.</p>

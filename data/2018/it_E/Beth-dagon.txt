BETH-DAGON
(Beth-daʹgon) [House of Dagon].
1. A town in the allotment of territory assigned to the tribe of Judah. (Jos 15:21, 41) Although it is listed along with other towns of the Shephelah or lowland region, the suggested location is on the Plains of Philistia at Khirbet Dajun, a short distance SW of modern Beit Dajan (Bet Dagan) and about 10 km (6 mi) SE of Tel Aviv-Yafo. In this regard, it may be noted that other cities of the Philistine plain are listed in subsequent verses. (Jos 15:45-47) This would make it an enclave city within the territory of Dan, as was also apparently the case with Gederah.​—Jos 15:36.
2. A town in the territory of Asher, evidently in the eastern part thereof and near its border with Zebulun. (Jos 19:24, 27) Identification is uncertain.

SHELEPH
(Sheʹleph).
The second-named son of Joktan; founder of one of the early post-Flood families. (Ge 10:26; 1Ch 1:20) Arabian equivalents of this name are found in Sabean inscriptions (dated before the seventh century B.C.E.) that speak of a Yemenite district of Salaf or Salif. Another form of the name may have survived in Sulaf, a place about 100 km (60 mi) N of Sanʽa, the capital of the Republic of Yemen. These similarities, however, only suggest in a general way where Sheleph’s descendants settled.

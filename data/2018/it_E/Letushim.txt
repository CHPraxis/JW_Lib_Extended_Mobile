LETUSHIM
(Le·tuʹshim) [possibly from a root meaning “sharpen; hammer; forge”].
A name appearing among the descendants of Abraham and Keturah through Dedan. (Ge 25:3) This name has the plural Hebrew ending im, as do the names Asshurim and Leummim appearing in the same text. Because of this, many scholars believe that a tribe or people is meant. In view of their relationship to Dedan, this tribe likely located in the Arabian Peninsula, but precise identification is impossible.​—See MIZRAIM.

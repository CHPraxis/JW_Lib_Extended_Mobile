<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A place on the road from Jezreel to Samaria where, by a cistern, Jehu met and slew the brothers of King Ahaziah of Judah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:10:12-12:10:14" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2Ki 10:12-14</a>) Its name apparently indicates a house where the sheep were bound to facilitate the work of shearing. Some versions render <em>behth-ʽeʹqedh</em> as “meeting house,” indicating an inn where “the shepherds” (<em>ha·ro·ʽimʹ</em>) met; others simply transliterate the Hebrew name, viewing it as the name of a town. It is generally identified with Beit Qad (Bet Qad) about 6 km (3.5 mi) ENE of modern Jenin. There are several cisterns at this place.</p>

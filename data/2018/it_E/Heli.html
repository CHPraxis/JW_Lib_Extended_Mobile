<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">(Heʹli) [from Heb., meaning “High (Exalted)”].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Evidently the father of Mary and maternal grandfather of Jesus Christ. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:3:23-42:3:23" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Lu 3:23</a>) Joseph’s being called the “son of Heli” is understood to mean that he was the son-in-law of Heli.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:7:2-43:7:8" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Joh 7:2-8</a>), he may have become a disciple later.

<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb"><strong>8.</strong> A magician in the city of Samaria who so amazed the nation with his magical arts that the people said of him: “This man is the Power of God, which can be called Great.” Because of Philip’s ministry, Simon “became a believer” and was baptized. Later, when the believers received the holy spirit as a result of the apostles Peter and John laying their hands upon them, Simon displayed a wrong motive, offering money for the authority needed so that those upon whom he laid his hands would receive holy spirit. Peter strongly rebuked him, telling Simon that his heart was not straight in God’s sight and urging him to repent and pray for forgiveness. In response, Simon asked these apostles to make supplication to Jehovah in his behalf.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:8:9-44:8:24" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Ac 8:9-24</a>.</p>

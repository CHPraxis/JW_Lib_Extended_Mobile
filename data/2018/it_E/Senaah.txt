SENAAH
(Se·naʹah).
Over 3,000 “sons of Senaah” returned from exile in Babylon with Zerubbabel in 537 B.C.E. (Ezr 2:1, 2, 35; Ne 7:38) Senaah may be the same as Hassenaah, a name having the Hebrew definite article ha(s).​—Ne 3:3.
Many of the names in the lists of Ezra 2 and Nehemiah 7 are apparently places rather than people, and Senaah is accordingly thought by some to be a place a little N of Jericho, where Eusebius and Jerome mention a tower “Magdalsenna.” (Onomasticon, 154, 16, 17) It is tentatively identified with Khirbet al Beiyudat (Horvat ʼel-Beidat), about 11 km (7 mi) NNE of Jericho.

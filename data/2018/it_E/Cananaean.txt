CANANAEAN
(Ca·na·naeʹan) [from Aramaic, meaning “Zealot; Enthusiast”].
A designation distinguishing the apostle Simon from the apostle Simon Peter. (Mt 10:4; Mr 3:18) The term “Cananaean” is thought to be of Aramaic origin and apparently corresponds to the Greek word ze·lo·tesʹ meaning “zealot; enthusiast.”​—Lu 6:15; Ac 1:13.

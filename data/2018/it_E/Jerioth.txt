JERIOTH
(Jerʹi·oth) [from a root verb meaning “quiver”].
It is likely that Jerioth was a concubine or handmaid of Caleb who bore some of his sons credited to “Azubah his wife.” First Chronicles 2:18 reads: “Caleb . . . became father to sons by Azubah his wife and by Jerioth; and these were her sons.”

JARMUTH
(Jarʹmuth) [from a root meaning “be high (exalted)”].
1. One of five Amorite cities involved in the attempted punitive expedition against the Gibeonites. Its king, Piram, and his allies were defeated by Joshua. Thereafter this city of the Shephelah was assigned to Judah. (Jos 10:3-5, 23-25; 12:7, 11; 15:20, 33, 35) After the Babylonian exile Judeans again resided at Jarmuth. (Ne 11:25, 29) Khirbet Yarmuk (Tel Yarmut), some 26 km (16 mi) WSW of Jerusalem, seems to be the ancient site. Situated on a hilltop, it overlooks the coastal plains as far as Gaza by the Mediterranean Sea.
2. A city in Issachar assigned to the Gershonites. (Jos 21:27-29) It is believed to be the same as Ramoth (1Ch 6:73) and Remeth.​—Jos 19:21; see RAMOTH No. 1.

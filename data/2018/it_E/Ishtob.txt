ISHTOB
(Ishʹtob) [Man of Tob].
One of the small kingdoms that provided fighting men for the sons of Ammon to use against David. The forces from “Ishtob” and their allies were defeated. (2Sa 10, AT, KJ, NW, Yg) Most translators and geographers consider that Ishtob should be rendered “men of Tob,” referring to “the land of Tob” where Jephthah resided. (Jg 11:3-11; see 2Sa 10:6, 8, AS, JB, JP, RS.) However, the reading “Ishtob” has the support of certain ancient versions. (LXX; Sy; Vg) The location of an ancient Ishtob is not now known.​—See TOB.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A fluid produced by the liver and stored in the gallbladder, a small pear-shaped sac that rests on the underside of the right portion of the liver. The gallbladder can hold at one time about one and a half ounces of gall, or bile. It is an extremely bitter yellow or greenish fluid used by the body in digestion. Gall came to be associated <span id="page886" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="886" data-before-text="886"></span>with that which is bitter or poisonous, and the word is so used in the Bible.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:8:23-44:8:23" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ac 8:23</a>.</p>

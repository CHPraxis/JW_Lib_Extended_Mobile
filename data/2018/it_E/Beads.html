<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Small perforated ornaments made of such materials as glass, gems, gold, and silver. They are usually worn as necklaces and have been found on Egyptian mummies, in Greek and Roman graves, and in Assyrian temple ruins, as well as at Megiddo, Ashdod, and Beth-shemesh.</p>

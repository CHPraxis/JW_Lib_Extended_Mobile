<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A city of Benjamin, the site of which is today unknown. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:18:21-6:18:21" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Jos 18:21,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:18:28-6:18:28" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 28</a>) Some scholars think that Ha-eleph may actually be part of the name of the preceding city, “Zelah.” However, those who would combine “Zelah” with “Ha-eleph” thereby reduce the number of cities to 13, and this does not agree with the Bible’s reference to 14 cities.</p>

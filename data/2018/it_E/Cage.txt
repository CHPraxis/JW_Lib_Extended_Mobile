CAGE
An enclosure used for confining birds or other animals. (Jer 5:27; compare Am 8:1, 2, where the same Hebrew word, keluvʹ, is rendered “basket.”) The prophet Ezekiel evidently alluded to King Zedekiah of Judah under the figure of a lion that was put in a cage (Heb., su·gharʹ) and transported to the king of Babylon.​—Eze 19:9; compare Eze 12:13; 17:20; 2Ki 25:5-7.

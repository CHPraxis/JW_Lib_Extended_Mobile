<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">The idea of sharply expressing disapproval or of checking by words or actions is commonly conveyed by the Hebrew verb <em>ga·ʽarʹ.</em> (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:37:10-1:37:10" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ge 37:10</a>) Another Hebrew verb rendered “rebuke” literally means “humiliate” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:11:3-18:11:3" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Job 11:3</a>); one Hebrew noun rendered “rebuke” literally means “a reproving.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:19:3-12:19:3" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2Ki 19:3</a>) In Greek, the sense of “rebuke” is conveyed by <em>e·pi·ti·maʹo,</em> which may also mean “strictly charge,” “sternly tell,” “reprimand.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:12:16-40:12:16" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Mt 12:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:18:39-42:18:39" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Lu 18:39;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:4:2-55:4:2" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> 2Ti 4:2</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">One sense of rebuke not limited to persons is “to check,” “to put a stop to something.” Jehovah’s rebuking sown seed denotes his preventing a good <span id="page759" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="759" data-before-text="759"></span>harvest. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/39:2:3-39:2:3" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Mal 2:3</a>) His rebuking devouring insects means his putting an end to their causing serious harm to crops. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/39:3:11-39:3:11" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Mal 3:11</a>) The psalmist, speaking of the enemies of God’s people under the figure of animals, appealed to the Most High to check their power to do injury: “Rebuke the wild beast of the reeds, the assembly of bulls.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:68:30-19:68:30" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ps 68:30</a>) Jesus Christ rebuked the wind and a fever.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:4:39-41:4:39" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Mr 4:39;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:4:39-42:4:39" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> Lu 4:39</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">At times “rebuke” conveys the thought of “threat.” Thus, the words “rebuke of your face” may indicate that the countenance has taken on a threatening demeanor.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:80:16-19:80:16" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ps 80:16</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The effect of a rebuke may call attention to Jehovah’s great power. A notable example was the parting of the Red Sea.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:106:9-19:106:9" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ps 106:9</a>.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><strong>Valid or Unjustified.</strong> A rebuke may be either valid or unjustified. Because a dream related by Joseph contained thoughts that seemed to violate the natural sense of fitness as regards the parent-child relationship, his father Jacob rebuked him. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:37:10-1:37:10" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Ge 37:10</a>) When Jesus Christ told his disciples that suffering and an executional death awaited him, Peter rebuked him with the words: “Be kind to yourself, Lord; you will not have this destiny at all.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:16:22-40:16:22" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Mt 16:22</a>) Since Peter was wrong, Jesus rightly rebuked him in very strong terms: “Get behind me, Satan, because you think, not God’s thoughts, but those of men.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:8:33-41:8:33" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Mr 8:33</a>.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><strong>Beneficial.</strong> Though a rebuke from a wise person may hurt, the inspired counsel is: “Better is it to hear the rebuke of someone wise than to be the man hearing the song of the stupid ones.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:7:5-21:7:5" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Ec 7:5</a>) The rebuke from a wise man, when accepted in the right spirit and acted on, can bring about improvement in a person’s conduct. The sensible person is more deeply affected by a simple rebuke than is a senseless person who receives 100 strokes for a misdeed. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:17:10-20:17:10" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Pr 17:10</a>) Congregational rebuke in the form of disfellowshipping may bring a wrongdoer to his senses, as it appears to have done in the case of an incestuous man at Corinth.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:2:6-47:2:7" data-bid="16-1" class="b">2Co 2:6, 7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:5:1-46:5:5" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> 1Co 5:1-5</a>.</p>

BLACK MULBERRY TREE
[Gr., sy·kaʹmi·nos].
Also called the sycamine, this tree is mentioned but once, in Jesus’ statement to the apostles relative to their faith. (Lu 17:5, 6, ftn) The Greek word used was regularly applied to the mulberry tree, and the black mulberry (Morus nigra) is commonly cultivated in Israel. It is a sturdy tree growing to a height of about 6 m (20 ft), with large heart-shaped leaves and dark-red or black fruit resembling the blackberry.

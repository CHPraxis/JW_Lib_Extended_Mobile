ELISHAPHAT
(E·li·shaʹphat) [My God Has Judged].
One of the chiefs of hundreds whom Jehoiada the priest took into a covenant and who was among those afterward sent throughout Judah to collect the Levites and the heads of the paternal houses of Israel. (2Ch 23:1, 2) Elishaphat gave his support to Jehoiada in securing the kingship for Jehoash the rightful heir to the throne and in deposing the usurper Athaliah.

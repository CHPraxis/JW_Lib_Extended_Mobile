<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><strong>1.</strong> A mount (Heb., <em>har</em>) where Amorites kept dwelling despite Israel’s conquest of Canaan. It is associated with the territory of the tribe of Dan. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:1:34-7:1:35" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Jg 1:34, 35</a>) Most scholars consider it the equivalent of Ir-shemesh (which is evidently the same as Beth-shemesh on the boundary of Judah and Dan) mentioned at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:19:41-6:19:41" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Joshua 19:41</a>.​—See <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200000710/">BETH-SHEMESH</a> No. 1.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><strong>2.</strong> Gideon returned from warring against the Midianites by “the pass that goes up to Heres.” This place is unknown outside the Biblical reference at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:8:13-7:8:13" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Judges 8:13</a>. Some scholars therefore suggest that the Hebrew text may have originally read “before the sun [<em>ha·cheʹres</em>] was up,” or “from up in the mountains,” instead of “the pass that goes up to Heres.”</p>

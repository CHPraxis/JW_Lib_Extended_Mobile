JANOAH
(Ja·noʹah) [from a root that means “rest; settle down”].
1. A boundary location of Ephraim usually identified with Khirbet Yanun, about 20 km (12 mi) SE of Samaria.​—Jos 16:5-7.
2. A city in the ten-tribe kingdom taken by Tiglath-pileser III during Pekah’s reign (c. 778-759 B.C.E.). Its inhabitants were deported to Assyria. (2Ki 15:29) The exact location of Janoah is uncertain. Although some identify it with Yanouh, about 10 km (6 mi) E of Tyre, this location is considered to be too far W of the other cities listed at 2 Kings 15:29. Most scholars favor Tell en-Naʽmeh, about 10 km (6 mi) NE of Kedesh in Galilee.

NIMRIM
(Nimʹrim) [possibly, Leopards].
In prophecies directed against Moab, both Isaiah and Jeremiah refer to the “waters of Nimrim.” (Isa 15:5-9; Jer 48:34, 35) On the basis of the fertility of the surrounding region, some identify the waters of Nimrim with the Wadi Nimrin, whose waters flow into the Jordan N of the Dead Sea. (See BETH-NIMRAH.) The order in which places are named in the prophecies, however, seems to indicate a location in the S of Moab. Thus many prefer identification with the Wadi en-Numeirah, which flows down into the SE end of the Dead Sea about 17 km (11 mi) WSW of Karak. The prophecies foretell that these waters will become “mere desolations,” either in a figurative sense because of the desolating of the land or perhaps because of a damming up of their streams by enemy forces.

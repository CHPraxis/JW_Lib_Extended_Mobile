JOKNEAM
(Jokʹne·am).
A city in Carmel conquered by Joshua. (Jos 12:7, 22) Originally assigned to the tribe of Zebulun (Jos 19:10, 11), Jokneam subsequently was given to the Merarite Levites. (Jos 21:34) Today it is usually identified with Tell Qeimun (Tel Yoqneʽam), on a mound at the foot of Mount Carmel about 11 km (7 mi) NW of Megiddo and overlooking the Valley of Jezreel. At 1 Kings 4:12 “Jokmeam” may possibly be a spelling error for “Jokneam.”

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:23:31-10:23:31" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2Sa 23:31</a>) He is evidently the Abiel referred to in a parallel passage at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:11:32-13:11:32" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Chronicles 11:32</a>. He is called the Arbathite, perhaps because of coming from the city of Beth-arabah, which lay near the frontier between Benjamin and Judah above the N end of the Dead Sea.

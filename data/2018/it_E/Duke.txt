DUKE
A man who is appointed, installed, invested as a prince or principal one. Five Midianite chieftains, “dukes of Sihon,” called “kings of Midian” at Numbers 31:8, were killed when Israel took vengeance on the Midianites for the affair of the Baal of Peor. (Jos 13:21) The leaders of the enemies of God’s people are called “dukes” (“princes,” AT; KJ; RS) at Psalm 83:11. The Hebrew term na·sikhʹ (duke) appears also at Ezekiel 32:30.
A Messianic prophecy states that, when the enemies of God’s people come against them, “seven shepherds, yes, eight dukes of mankind [“princes of men,” KJ, margin; RS]” will be raised up. Seven representing completeness, the “eight dukes” would evidently mean that a considerable number of capable men appointed under the Messiah would be taking the lead among Jehovah’s people.​—Mic 5:5.

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The tenth letter of the Hebrew alphabet. It is the smallest of the Hebrew letters. The name of the smallest letter of the Greek alphabet, <em>i·oʹta,</em> evidently is akin to the Hebrew <em>yohdh.</em> Since the Law of Moses was originally written and subsequently preserved in Hebrew, it is likely that Jesus was referring back to the Hebrew <em>yohdh</em> when he said that the “smallest letter [Gr., <em>i·oʹta</em>]” would not pass away without its due fulfillment. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:5:18-40:5:18" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Mt 5:18</a>) This letter occurs as the initial letter in the Tetragrammaton, or sacred name Jehovah (reading from right to left: יהוה), and as such was carried over into the earliest copies of the Greek <em>Septuagint.</em> A vellum leaf of the third century C.E. (P. Oxyrhynchus vii. 1007) containing a portion of the <em>Septuagint</em> translation of Genesis represented the divine name Jehovah by a doubled <em>yohdh.</em>​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:2:8-1:2:8" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ge 2:8</a>, ftn.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Because of the similarity between the letters <em>yohdh</em> (י) and <em>waw</em> (ו), they were sometimes confused by copyists. In the Hebrew, at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:119:73-19:119:80" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Psalm 119:73-80</a> each verse begins with the letter <em>yohdh.</em></p>

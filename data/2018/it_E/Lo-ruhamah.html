<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">(Lo-ru·haʹmah) [[She Was] Not Shown Mercy].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A girl borne by Gomer, the wife of Hosea. Jehovah told the prophet to give the child this name because He would “no more show mercy again to the house of Israel.” God thus indicated his rejection of Israel as a whole. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/28:1:6-28:1:8" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ho 1:6-8</a>) Earlier, when Jezreel was born, it was said that Gomer “bore to him [Hosea] a son,” but regarding Lo-ruhamah it is only stated that Gomer “proceeded to become pregnant another time and to give birth to a daughter,” without direct personal reference to Hosea. Though the account does not specifically say, it has been suggested that this child was the fruit of Gomer’s adultery and was not the prophet’s own offspring. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/28:1:2-28:1:3" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ho 1:2, 3</a>) There is allusion to her symbolic name in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/28:2:1-28:2:1" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Hosea 2:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/28:2:23-28:2:23" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 23</a>.</p>

ARTEMAS
(Arʹte·mas).
A companion whom Paul considered sending to Titus in Crete (Tit 3:12), perhaps as a replacement in order that Titus might join Paul in Nicopolis. Since Paul’s choice was to be between Artemas and Tychicus, Artemas was evidently well esteemed, as is indicated by Paul’s remarks about Tychicus at Ephesians 6:21, 22.

NOHAH
(Noʹhah) [from a root meaning “rest; settle down”].
The fourth-listed son of Benjamin. (1Ch 8:1, 2) Since he is not named among those listed in Genesis chapter 46, he was probably born after the family entered Egypt. Some suppose that Nohah was another name for Shephupham or was his descendant.​—Nu 26:39.

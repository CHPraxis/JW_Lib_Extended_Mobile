JEHOVAH-NISSI
(Je·hoʹvah-nisʹsi).
The name of the memorial altar erected by Moses after Israel’s successful battle against the Amalekites at Rephidim.​—Ex 17:8, 13-16.
The name means “Jehovah Is My Signal Pole,” deriving nis·siʹ from nes (signal pole). The Greek Septuagint translators understood nis·siʹ to be derived from nus (flee for refuge), thus giving it the meaning “Jehovah Is My Refuge,” while in the Latin Vulgate it was thought to be derived from na·sasʹ (hoist; lift up), thus giving it the meaning “Jehovah Is My Exaltation.”​—Ex 17:15, ftn.

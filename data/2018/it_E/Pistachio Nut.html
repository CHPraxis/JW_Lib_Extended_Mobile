<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The fruit of the <em>Pistacia vera</em> tree. This deciduous tree thrives in dry areas and seldom reaches a height in excess of 9 m (30 ft). The nuts measure 1.5 to 2 cm (0.6 to 0.8 in.) in length and grow in large clusters. The thin, but hard, light-colored shell of ripe pistachio nuts is covered with a somewhat wrinkly husk. Each nut contains one yellow-green kernel surrounded by thin reddish skin. The kernel has a mild, sweet flavor and is commonly eaten raw or fried. Sometimes kernels are pressed for oil, and ground kernels are used for confectionery items.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Pistachio nuts were among “the finest products of the land” of Canaan that were brought as a gift by Jacob’s sons to one who was a ruler in Egypt. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:43:11-1:43:11" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ge 43:11</a>) Even in modern times large quantities of pistachio nuts have been exported from parts of the Middle East.</p>

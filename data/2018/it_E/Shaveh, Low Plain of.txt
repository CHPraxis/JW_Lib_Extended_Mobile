SHAVEH, LOW PLAIN OF
(Shaʹveh).
“The king’s Low Plain,” where Abraham, victorious over Chedorlaomer and his allies, was met by the king of Sodom and received a blessing from Melchizedek, king of Salem. (Ge 14:17-24) Centuries later, Absalom erected his monument in “the Low Plain of the King,” apparently the same place and likely near Jerusalem. (2Sa 18:18) Josephus indicated that Absalom’s Monument was set up “two stades [370 m; 1,214 ft] distant from Jerusalem.” (Jewish Antiquities, VII, 243 [x, 3]) However, the exact location of the Low Plain of Shaveh cannot now be ascertained.

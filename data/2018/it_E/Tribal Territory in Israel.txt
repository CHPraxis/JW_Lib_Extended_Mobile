Tribal Territory in Israel




Jehovah himself determined the boundaries of the Promised Land. He also gave directions for apportioning the land among the tribes of Israel. Families were given specific portions of land, and these allotments were safeguarded for future generations. What was done in ancient Israel illustrates Jehovah’s sovereign right to assign land to humans in such a way that his purpose is accomplished.​—Ps 24:1.

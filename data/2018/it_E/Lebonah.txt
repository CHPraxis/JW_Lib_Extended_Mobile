LEBONAH
(Le·boʹnah).
A place mentioned as a reference point in connection with the location of Shiloh. (Jg 21:19) It is tentatively identified with el-Lubban (Lubban Sharqiya), about 5 km (3 mi) WNW of the suggested site of Shiloh. However, the Bible’s placing of Shiloh “toward the south of Lebonah” may indicate that originally the city was farther E than this suggested site.

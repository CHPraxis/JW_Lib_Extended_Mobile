<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">When Nehemiah organized the rebuilding of the wall of Jerusalem, he assigned portions to the leaders, or ‘princes,’ and inhabitants of certain ‘districts.’ These districts were named after their principal city, and some (Jerusalem, Beth-zur, Keilah) were double. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:3:9-16:3:9" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ne 3:9,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:3:12-16:3:12" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 12,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:3:14-16:3:18" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> 14-18</a>) They were evidently subdivisions of the Persian “jurisdictional district,” or “province,” of Judah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:1:3-16:1:3" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ne 1:3</a>; <em>KJ, RS</em>) The Hebrew word to designate these districts (<em>peʹlekh</em>) is said to be derived from the Akkadian word <em>pilku,</em> perhaps indicating that they were instituted by the Babylonians after the fall of Jerusalem.​—See <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200002556/">JURISDICTIONAL DISTRICT</a>.</p>

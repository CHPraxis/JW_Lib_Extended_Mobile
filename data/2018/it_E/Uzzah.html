<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">(Uzʹzah) [possibly a shortened form of Uzziah, meaning “My Strength Is Jehovah”].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><strong>1.</strong> A Merarite Levite.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:6:29-13:6:29" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1Ch 6:29</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><strong>2.</strong> A son of Abinadab, undoubtedly a Levite. Uzzah and his brother Ahio led the wagon carrying the ark of the covenant from their house when David wanted it brought to Jerusalem. When the bulls pulling the wagon nearly caused an upset, Uzzah reached out and grabbed hold to steady the Ark, for which Jehovah struck him dead on the spot. David named the place Perez-uzzah because there Jehovah had broken through in “a rupture against Uzzah.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:6:3-10:6:8" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2Sa 6:3-8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:13:7-13:13:11" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 1Ch 13:7-11</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Notwithstanding Uzzah’s presumably good intentions to prevent the Ark from falling, it was judged as an “irreverent act.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:6:7-10:6:7" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2Sa 6:7</a>) This was because deliberate disobedience was involved. Jehovah had instructed that under no circumstances was the Ark to be touched by unauthorized persons, a warning of public knowledge that carried with it the death penalty for violators. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:4:15-4:4:15" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Nu 4:15,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:4:19-4:4:20" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 19, 20</a>) Had authorized ones, Kohathite Levites, carried it with the poles on their shoulders as God had directed, God’s anger would not have been incurred.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:25:13-2:25:14" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ex 25:13, 14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:7:9-4:7:9" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Nu 7:9</a>.</p>

MAHOL
(Maʹhol) [from a root meaning “dance; whirl”; or, possibly from a root meaning “play the flute”].
One whose sons’ wisdom, though great, was not equal to King Solomon’s. (1Ki 4:31) Some view the designation “sons of Mahol” to mean an association of musicians or dancers.​—Compare Ps 150:4, where the same Hebrew word is rendered “circle dance.”

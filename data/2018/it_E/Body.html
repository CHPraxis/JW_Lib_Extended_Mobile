God has set each one in his position in the body, and through the various operations of the holy spirit the body performs what is necessary. The Head, Jesus Christ, as liaison member, supplies the members of the body the things they need through the “joints and ligaments,” the means and arrangements for supplying spiritual nourishment as well as communication and coordination, so that “the body” is spiritually well fed and each part is informed of the task to perform.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:2:19-51:2:19" data-bid="50-1" class="b">Col 2:19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:4:16-49:4:16" data-bid="50-2" class="b"> Eph 4:16</a>.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">(En-ganʹnim) [Fountain (or, Spring) of Gardens].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><strong>1.</strong> A Judean city in the Shephelah, or lowland, mentioned in the same group as Adullam at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:15:33-6:15:35" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Joshua 15:33-35</a>. Its site is possibly at modern Beit Jimal about 2.5 km (1.5 mi) S of Beth-shemesh, or a site nearby. Umm Jina, which lies about 1 km (0.5 mi) W of Beth-shemesh, has been suggested by some as the site, but it is less probable, because no fountain is found there.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><strong>2.</strong> A city located in the tribe of Issachar’s inheritance. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:19:17-6:19:17" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Jos 19:17,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:19:21-6:19:21" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 21</a>) It may be the city that Josephus called Ginae. Today it is identified with Jenin, a town on the S edge of the Valley of Jezreel, lying about 18 km (11 mi) SE of Megiddo and 8 km (5 mi) NE of Dothan, on the main road from Jerusalem to Nazareth. Jenin is surrounded by orchards and gardens and has a spring, which characteristics would harmonize with the meaning of the name En-gannim.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">En-gannim, with its pasture ground, was allotted to the sons of Gershon as a Levite city. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:21:27-6:21:29" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Jos 21:27-29</a>) In <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:6:73-13:6:73" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 Chronicles 6:73</a> it is evidently called Anem.</p>

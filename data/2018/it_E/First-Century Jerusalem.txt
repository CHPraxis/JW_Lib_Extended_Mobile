First-Century Jerusalem




THE Jerusalem that exists today has changed greatly from what it was in the first century. Nevertheless, on the basis of archaeological research, it has been possible to reconstruct in a tentative way some of the key parts of the city. This can help students to visualize the events that took place there in connection with the ministry of Jesus and that of his apostles.
When in Jerusalem at festival times, Jesus taught in the temple area where the crowds were. (Joh 7:14, 28; 18:20) Following his death and resurrection, his disciples ‘filled Jerusalem with their teaching.’ (Ac 5:28) From Jerusalem, their witnessing eventually spread to “the most distant part of the earth.”​—Ac 1:8.
The activity of Jesus and his disciples confronted the nation with an important issue: Would they accept the one whom Jehovah sent as Messiah? Would they recognize their need of the Kingdom of God? Though some put faith in Jesus, most were unresponsive. The nation’s faithless actions were climaxed by the impalement of Jesus, which took place with popular support at Jerusalem. As a result, destruction befell the city in 70 C.E., just as Jesus had foretold.​—Lu 19:41-44.

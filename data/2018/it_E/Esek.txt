ESEK
(Eʹsek) [Contention].
A well of fresh water dug by Isaac’s servants in the torrent valley of Gerar. (Ge 26:20) The Philistine shepherds of that area, however, claimed the well as theirs, and the resultant “quarreling” between the two parties gave the site its name. (Ge 26:12-20) Its exact location is today unknown.

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A city among those reproached by Jesus and located at the N end of the Sea of Galilee. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:11:21-40:11:21" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Mt 11:21</a>; PICTURE, Vol. 2, p. 739) It is usually identified by scholars with Khirbet Kerazeh (Korazim), only about 3 km (2 mi) NNW of the suggested site of ancient Capernaum (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:11:23-40:11:23" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Mt 11:23</a>), the city that Jesus apparently used as a base of operations during his great Galilean ministry of over two years’ duration. Jesus pronounced coming “woe” for the Jewish inhabitants of Chorazin who, during that period, were witnesses of “powerful works” that would have moved the pagans of Tyre and Sidon to repentance, and yet who failed to act on Jesus’ message. After this, in the fall of 32 C.E., when dispatching the 70 disciples during his later Judean ministry, Jesus inserted a reference to Chorazin’s impenitent attitude into his discussion apparently to emphasize that great woe would be experienced by the unresponsive cities against which his disciples were to ‘wipe the dust’ off their feet.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:10:10-42:10:16" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Lu 10:10-16</a>.</p>

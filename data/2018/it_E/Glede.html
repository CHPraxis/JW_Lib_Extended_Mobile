<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The Hebrew name for this bird occurs in the list of unclean birds at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:14:13-5:14:13" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 14:13</a> but does not appear in the corresponding list at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:11:14-3:11:14" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Leviticus 11:14</a>. Four Hebrew manuscripts, and also the Samaritan <em>Pentateuch</em> and the Greek <em>Septuagint,</em> omit <em>dai·yahʹ</em> at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:14:13-5:14:13" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 14:13</a>. Some scholars believe that it may be a scribal correction originally placed in the margin but which eventually was introduced into the text itself. However, the plural form (<em>dai·yohthʹ</em>) appears at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:34:15-23:34:15" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Isaiah 34:15</a> as describing birds gathered at the ruins of Edom following its desolation.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The identification of this bird is uncertain. It is suggested that the Hebrew name is derived from the verb meaning “pounce” or “come darting.” “Glede” is a suitable translation, since it is a term variously applied to any of several birds of prey, though especially to the red kite (<em>Milvus milvus</em>). Most modern scholars relate the Hebrew <em>dai·yahʹ</em> to the kite, there being more than one variety of this bird found in Palestine.​—See <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200002636/">KITE</a>.</p>

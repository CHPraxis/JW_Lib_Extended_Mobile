Exodus From Egypt




JEHOVAH instructed Moses to appear before Pharaoh and, speaking in Jehovah’s name, to say: “Send my people away.” (Ex 5:1) Pharaoh refused. He did not want to lose a nation of slaves. More than that, Pharaoh did not know, or recognize, Jehovah as the true God. (Ex 5:2) Pharaoh worshiped the gods of Egypt and even considered himself to be a god! Thus the issue was pressed to the fore: Who is the true God? By means of ten plagues Jehovah executed judgment “on all the gods of Egypt,” resulting in Israel’s release and giving evidence that Jehovah is the living and true God.​—Ex 12:12.
As a group, Israel departed from Rameses in Egypt on Nisan 15, 1513 B.C.E. As the throng moved to the east they were undoubtedly joined by others from Goshen. After they reached Etham, Jehovah ordered them to “turn back and encamp before Pihahiroth . . . by the sea.” To the Egyptians, it appeared that the people were lost. (Ex 13:20; 14:1-3) They seemed to be trapped between the Red Sea and the mountains. With the Egyptian war chariots behind them, there appeared to be no way out! It was under these circumstances that Jehovah delivered Israel and destroyed Pharaoh and his army. (Ex 14:13-31) Thus, Jehovah demonstrated his great power and caused what he did for Israel to be talked about “in all the earth.”​—Ex 9:16; Jos 2:10; 9:9.

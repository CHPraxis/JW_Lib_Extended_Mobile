<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">(Kadʹmon·ites) [from a root meaning “east”].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A people listed among other nations whose lands Jehovah promised to Abram’s seed. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:15:18-1:15:21" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ge 15:18-21</a>) They were evidently a pastoral or nomadic tribe, like the Kenites and Kenizzites with whom they are mentioned. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:15:19-1:15:19" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ge 15:19</a>) <span id="page143" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="143" data-before-text="143"></span>The exact location of their territory is uncertain, although it is suggested that they inhabited the Syrian desert between Palestine-Syria and the Euphrates River.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The Hebrew name of this people (<em>qadh·moh·niʹ</em>) has the same form as the adjective <em>qadh·moh·niʹ</em> (eastern, <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:47:18-26:47:18" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Eze 47:18</a>); thus some suggest that it may merely mean “Easterners.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:8:10-7:8:10" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Jg 8:10</a>) However, the fact that this Hebrew term is used as a name at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:15:19-1:15:19" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Genesis 15:19</a> shows that it can refer to a specific tribe.</p>

SHEBAT
(Sheʹbat).
The postexilic name of the 11th Jewish lunar month of the sacred calendar, but the fifth of the secular calendar. (Zec 1:7; De 1:3; 1Ch 27:14) It corresponds to part of January and part of February. The meaning of the name is uncertain.
This midwinter month comes somewhat after the peak of the heavy rains but is still a time of major rainfall. Average temperatures run about 7° C. (45° F.) in Jerusalem and about ten degrees higher along the Mediterranean Coast. The pink and white flowers of the almond tree are the first to brighten up the winter scenery and herald the approach of spring.
Shebat was not marked by any festival seasons in the Bible record.

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><strong>1.</strong> Joseph’s firstborn son and a grandson of Jacob. After Joseph became Egypt’s food administrator, Pharaoh gave him Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera the priest of On, as a wife, and she bore Joseph two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim. Joseph named his firstborn Manasseh, because, he said: “God has made me forget all my trouble and all the house of my father.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:41:45-1:41:45" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ge 41:45,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:41:50-1:41:52" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 50-52</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">When Jacob blessed Manasseh and Ephraim, he persisted in putting his right hand on Ephraim and his left on Manasseh, thereby placing the younger Ephraim before Manasseh. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:48:13-1:48:20" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ge 48:13-20</a>) As indicated thereby, Ephraim was to become greater than Manasseh.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Manasseh had sons by a Syrian concubine (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:7:14-13:7:14" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1Ch 7:14</a>), and Joseph lived long enough to see the sons of Manasseh’s son Machir.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:50:22-1:50:23" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ge 50:22, 23</a>.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><strong>2.</strong> The tribe of Israel that descended from Joseph’s son Manasseh and consisted of seven tribal families. About a year after the Israelites left Egypt, Manasseh’s able-bodied men from 20 years old upward numbered 32,200. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:1:34-4:1:35" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Nu 1:34, 35</a>) This doubtless included Gaddi, one of the ten men bringing back a bad report after spying out the Promised Land.

<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><strong>Conquests on Both Sides of Jordan River.</strong> When the Israelites defeated Amorite Kings Sihon and Og, Moses granted their conquered land to the Reubenites, the Gadites, and half of the tribe of Manasseh on condition that these tribes participate in the conquest of the territory W of the Jordan.

<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Later, men from “the half tribe of Manasseh” that had received their inheritance did cross the Jordan and shared in the conquest of the land to the west.

<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb"><strong>Land Inheritance.</strong> Half of the tribe of Manasseh, of course, already had its inheritance E of the Jordan. It included Bashan and a part of Gilead. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:13:29-6:13:31" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Jos 13:29-31</a>) To the S lay Gad, the border city being Mahanaim.

Here were located Golan, one of the six cities of refuge, and Beeshterah (Ashtaroth), another Levite city.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:20:8-6:20:9" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Jos 20:8, 9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:21:27-6:21:27" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> 21:27;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:6:71-13:6:71" data-bid="18-3" class="b"> 1Ch 6:71</a>.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">The remaining half of the Manassites received as their inheritance territory W of the Jordan.

(Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:16:5-6:16:8" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Jos 16:5-8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:17:7-6:17:10" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> 17:7-10</a>.) Whereas the Ephraimites had certain enclave cities in Manasseh, the Manassites were assigned enclave cities (Beth-shean, Ibleam, Dor, En-dor, Taanach, and Megiddo, as well as their dependent towns) both in Issachar and Asher.

Two of these enclave cities, Taanach (Aner?) and Ibleam (Bileam or Gath-rimmon?), were assigned to Kohathite Levites.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:21:25-6:21:26" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Jos 21:25, 26;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:6:70-13:6:70" data-bid="24-2" class="b"> 1Ch 6:70</a>.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb"><strong>History.</strong> After the distribution of the land had been completed, Joshua blessed the men of Reuben, Gad, and the eastern “half tribe of Manasseh” and encouraged them to continue serving Jehovah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:22:1-6:22:8" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Jos 22:1-8</a>) They left Shiloh, traveled to the Jordan, and then near that river built an altar. This almost precipitated civil war, as the other tribes regarded this as an act of unfaithfulness and rebellion. However, the issue was settled peaceably when it was explained that the altar had been erected, not for sacrifice, but to serve as a memorial of faithfulness to Jehovah.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:22:9-6:22:31" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Jos 22:9-31</a>.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">In a later period Manassite Judge Gideon was the one used by Jehovah to deliver the Israelites from Midianite oppression.

<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Sometime during the reign of Israel’s first king, Saul, the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the eastern “half tribe of Manasseh” gained a decisive victory over the Hagrites and their allies.

<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">Years later, the extensive religious reforms undertaken by Judean King Asa prompted many Manassites to desert the northern kingdom “when they saw that Jehovah his God was with him.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:15:8-14:15:9" data-bid="32-1" class="b">2Ch 15:8, 9</a>) On the occasion of a grand assembly in the 15th year of Asa’s reign (963 B.C.E.), they <span id="page307" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="307" data-before-text="307"></span>joined with others in making a covenant to search for Jehovah.

Thereafter these responsive ones shared in destroying appendages of idolatry.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:30:1-14:30:1" data-bid="34-1" class="b">2Ch 30:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:30:10-14:30:11" data-bid="34-2" class="b"> 10, 11,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:30:18-14:30:18" data-bid="34-3" class="b"> 18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:31:1-14:31:1" data-bid="34-4" class="b"> 31:1</a>.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">Earlier (c. 760 B.C.E.), Tiglath-pileser (Tilgath-pilneser) III had taken the Manassites living E of the Jordan into exile.

This Judean king also had repair work done on the temple, the work itself being financed by contributions received from Israelites of various tribes, including Manasseh.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:34:1-14:34:11" data-bid="37-1" class="b">2Ch 34:1-11</a>.</p>

<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb"><strong>3.</strong> A name appearing in the Masoretic text at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:18:30-7:18:30" data-bid="41-1" class="b">Judges 18:30</a>, because of scribal modification. The account concerns Danite apostasy, and the <em>New World Translation</em> says that “Jonathan the son of Gershom, Moses’ son, he and his sons became priests to the tribe of the Danites.” (See also <em>AT; Mo; Ro; RS.</em>) Jewish scribes inserted a suspended letter (<em>nun</em> = n) between the first two letters in the original Hebrew name so as to give the reading “Manasseh’s” instead of “Moses’,” doing so out of regard for Moses. The scribes thus sought to hide the reproach or disgrace that might be brought upon the name of Moses because of Jonathan’s action. In addition to the altered Masoretic text, “Manasseh’s” appears in the Vatican Manuscript No. 1209 of the Greek <em>Septuagint</em> and in the Syriac <em>Peshitta.</em> However, “Moses’” is found in the Alexandrine Manuscript of the Greek <em>Septuagint</em> and in the Latin <em>Vulgate</em> at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:18:30-7:18:30" data-bid="42-1" class="b">Judges 18:30</a>.</p>

He made his sons pass through the fire, practiced magic, employed divination, and promoted spiritistic practices. Manasseh also put the graven image of the sacred pole he had made into the house of Jehovah.

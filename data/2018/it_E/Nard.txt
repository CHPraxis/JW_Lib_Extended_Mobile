NARD
The precious “perfumed oil” that Mary, the sister of Lazarus, applied to Jesus’ head and feet. By reason of its costliness, nard (Gr., narʹdos) was often subjected to adulteration and even counterfeiting. It may be noteworthy, therefore, that both Mark and John use the expression “genuine nard.” (Mr 14:3; Joh 12:3) Valuable ointment sealed in a small alabaster container anciently served as a good investment.​—Joh 12:5; see SPIKENARD.

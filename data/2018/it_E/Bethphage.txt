BETHPHAGE
(Bethʹpha·ge) [from Heb., probably meaning “House of the Early Figs”].
Bethphage figures in the account of Jesus’ approach to Jerusalem and as the point from which he sent out his disciples to obtain the ass upon which he rode during his triumphal entry into Jerusalem, Nisan 9, of the year 33 C.E. (Mt 21:1, 2; Mr 11:1, 2; Lu 19:29, 30) The references show it to be located on the Mount of Olives, near Jerusalem, and also near Bethany. While some consider Bethphage to have been located across the ravine to the SE of Bethany at present-day Abu Dis, the traditional location is between Bethany and Jerusalem at et-Tur, on the SE slope of the Mount of Olives. From this point it is but a short distance to one of the peaks of the Mount of Olives. Descending from there, one would have the city of Jerusalem in full view.​—Compare Lu 19:37, 41.
Talmudic references to Bethphage indicate that it was considered as at the limit of the sabbatical zone around the city of Jerusalem.​—Babylonian Talmud, Menahot 78b; compare Ac 1:12, ftn.

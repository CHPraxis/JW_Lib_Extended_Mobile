<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A place mentioned in two prophecies against Moab. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:48:24-24:48:24" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Jer 48:24;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/30:2:2-30:2:2" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Am 2:2</a>) The meaning of its name may indicate that the city was comprised of several smaller towns. Kerioth’s exact location is uncertain. Some scholars tentatively suggest Saliya, a site about 16 km (10 mi) ESE of Dibon and N of the Arnon. Others believe that Kerioth is perhaps the same as Ar, S of Arnon. This view seems to find some support in the fact that Ar and Kerioth, although figuring as principal cities (compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/30:2:1-30:2:3" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Am 2:1-3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:2:9-5:2:9" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> De 2:9,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:2:18-5:2:18" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> 18</a>), do not appear together in lists of Moabite towns.​—Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:15:1-23:15:9" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Isa 15</a> and <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:16:1-23:16:14" data-bid="4-1" class="b">16</a>; <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:48:1-24:48:47" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Jer 48</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The Moabite Stone, although giving no hint as to the location of Kerioth, does indicate that the god Chemosh had a sanctuary there.</p>

OBADIAH
(O·ba·diʹah) [Servant of Jehovah].
1. A family head in the tribe of Issachar; son of Izrahiah and descendant of Tola.​—1Ch 7:1-3.
2. A Zebulunite whose son was a prince of that tribe during David’s rule.​—1Ch 27:19, 22.
3. A mighty Gadite warrior who crossed the Jordan at flood stage and supported David when he lived as a fugitive from Saul’s wrath.​—1Ch 12:8, 9, 14, 15.
4. The household steward of King Ahab. Even though King Ahab and Jezebel practiced wickedness, Obadiah greatly feared Jehovah, hiding 100 prophets of Jehovah “by fifties in a cave” when Jezebel had ordered them all slaughtered. During the divinely imposed drought foretold by Elijah, Obadiah’s master Ahab divided certain territory with him, and each was searching for grass to feed the livestock when Elijah met up with Obadiah. Elijah had not been seen by Ahab during the drought, a period of some three years. Upon being told to inform Ahab that Elijah had returned, Obadiah, out of great fear, hesitated to go until given assurance that the prophet would not leave, for Ahab would surely kill his servant if this report proved false.​—1Ki 18:1-16.

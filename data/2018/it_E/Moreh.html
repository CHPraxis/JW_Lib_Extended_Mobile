<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><strong>1.</strong> At least by Abraham’s time the big trees of Moreh constituted a well-known landmark near Shechem and seemingly continued to be such for centuries afterward. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:12:6-1:12:6" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ge 12:6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:11:30-5:11:30" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> De 11:30</a>; perhaps also alluded to at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:35:4-1:35:4" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ge 35:4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:24:25-6:24:26" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Jos 24:25, 26;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:9:6-7:9:6" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> Jg 9:6</a>.) Some scholars link “the big tree of Meonenim” with “the big trees of Moreh.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:9:37-7:9:37" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Jg 9:37</a>) “Moreh” was perhaps the name of the original owner of the plot near Shechem that had one especially prominent tree or a clump or grove of big trees.</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:7:1-7:7:1" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Jg 7:1</a>) This hill is generally thought to be the bare gray ridge of Jebel Dahi (Givʽat Ha-More), about 8 km (5 mi) N of the suggested site for the well of Harod.</p>

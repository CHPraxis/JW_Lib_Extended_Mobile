UZZEN-SHEERAH
(Uzʹzen-sheʹe·rah) [possibly, Ear of Sheerah].
A city that Sheerah, an Ephraimite woman, built. In what sense she ‘built’ is not stated; perhaps this was in the sense of her contributing in some major way to the progress and development of it as well as other places listed. (1Ch 7:22-24) Uzzen-sheerah’s location is not definitely known. However, some geographers identify it with Beit Sira, about 4 km (2 mi) W of the suggested site of Lower Beth-horon and about 21 km (13 mi) NW of Jerusalem.

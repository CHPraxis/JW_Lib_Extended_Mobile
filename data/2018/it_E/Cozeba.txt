COZEBA
(Co·zeʹba) [probably, Liar].
A site in Judah where descendants of Shelah the son of Judah resided. (1Ch 4:21, 22) Most scholars consider Cozeba to be the same as Achzib (“Chezib” in some versions) mentioned at Genesis 38:5 and Joshua 15:44, and on this basis it is tentatively identified with Tell el-Beida (Horvat Lavnin), 5 km (3 mi) WSW of Adullam. The men of Cozeba are apparently included in the expression “they were the potters.”​—1Ch 4:23; see ACHZIB No. 1.

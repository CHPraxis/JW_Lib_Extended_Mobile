ADADAH
(A·daʹdah).
One of the cities in the southern part of the territory originally assigned to Judah, lying toward the border of Edom. (Jos 15:22) The Vatican Manuscript No. 1209 of the Greek Septuagint here reads A·rou·el. On this basis, as well as 1 Samuel 30:28, some scholars favor identifying it with Aroer in Judah.​—See AROER No. 3.

BARSABBAS
(Barʹsab·bas).
This may have been a family name or just an added name given to two individuals: Joseph, surnamed Justus, who was the rejected candidate for the apostleship vacated by Judas Iscariot; and Judas, who accompanied Paul, Barnabas, and Silas from Jerusalem to Antioch in about 49 C.E. There is no evidence that the two men were brothers.​—Ac 1:23; 15:22; see JOSEPH No. 11; JUDAS No. 7.

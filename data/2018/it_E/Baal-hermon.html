<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">(Baʹal-herʹmon) [Owner of Hermon].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">This name appears at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:3:3-7:3:3" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Judges 3:3</a> and <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:5:23-13:5:23" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Chronicles 5:23</a>. In the first instance it describes a point in the region inhabited by the Sidonians and the Hivites who remained unconquered by the Israelites, and it is here referred to as “Mount Baal-hermon.” It is usually identified with Mount Hermon itself but may refer to the Anti-Lebanon Range in general or to some portion thereof. At <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:5:23-13:5:23" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Chronicles 5:23</a> “Baal-hermon” is used along with Senir and Mount Hermon and the region of Bashan to outline the territory occupied by the half tribe of Manasseh. While it may refer to a town or place near Mount Hermon, it may likewise be a designation for the mountainous region of Hermon.​—See <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200001999/">HERMON</a>.</p>

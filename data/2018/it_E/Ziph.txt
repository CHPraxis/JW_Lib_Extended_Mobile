ZIPH
1. A descendant of Judah through Jehallelel.​—1Ch 4:15, 16.
2. An unidentified city in the southern part of Judah.​—Jos 15:21, 24.
3. A city in the mountainous region of Judah. (Jos 15:20, 48, 55, 57) It is apparently the Ziph ‘fathered’ by Mesha. (1Ch 2:42) Geographers generally connect it with Tell Zif, some 6 km (3.5 mi) SE of Hebron. David sought refuge from King Saul in the wilderness surrounding Ziph, and the men of the city twice revealed his whereabouts to the king. (1Sa 23:14, 15, 19, 24, 29; 26:1, 2; compare Ps 54:Sup.) This Ziph apparently was the one later fortified by Rehoboam.​—2Ch 11:5-8.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A depression between bluffs, hills, or mountains. Jehovah God is properly credited with the development of earth’s topographical features, including its many valleys. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:104:8-19:104:8" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ps 104:8</a>) In Scripture, some were called merely valleys. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:8:11-6:8:11" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Jos 8:11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:13:18-9:13:18" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 1Sa 13:18</a>) Others were “valley plains,” low-lying level areas between mountains and hills. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:11:11-5:11:11" data-bid="3-1" class="b">De 11:11</a>; see <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200003508/">PLAIN</a>.) There were also “torrent valleys,” sometimes having perennial streams but often flowing with water only in the rainy season. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:8:7-5:8:7" data-bid="4-1" class="b">De 8:7</a>; see <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200004455/">TORRENT VALLEY</a>.) Certain translations use “vale” or “valley(s)” where the references are to “low plain(s)” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:14:3-1:14:3" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ge 14:3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:12:15-13:12:15" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 1Ch 12:15</a>), and “vale” or “lowland(s)” for the “Shephelah,” the hilly lowland between the Philistine coastal plain and the highlands of central Palestine.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:1:7-5:1:7" data-bid="6-1" class="b">De 1:7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:10:27-11:10:27" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 1Ki 10:27</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Among the notable valleys mentioned in the Scriptures are the Valley of Moab “in front of Beth-peor” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:3:29-5:3:29" data-bid="7-1" class="b">De 3:29;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:34:6-5:34:6" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 34:6</a>) and the Valley of Salt (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:8:13-10:8:13" data-bid="8-1" class="b">2Sa 8:13</a>), as well as those of Hinnom (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:11:30-16:11:30" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ne 11:30</a>), Iphtah-el (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:19:14-6:19:14" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Jos 19:14</a>), Zeboim (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:13:18-9:13:18" data-bid="11-1" class="b">1Sa 13:18</a>), and Zephathah (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:14:10-14:14:10" data-bid="12-1" class="b">2Ch 14:10</a>). The ‘valley plains’ of Scriptural record include those of Shinar (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:11:2-1:11:2" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Ge 11:2</a>), Jericho (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:34:3-5:34:3" data-bid="14-1" class="b">De 34:3</a>), Mizpeh (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:11:8-6:11:8" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Jos 11:8</a>), Lebanon (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:12:7-6:12:7" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Jos 12:7</a>), Ono (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:6:2-16:6:2" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Ne 6:2</a>), and Megiddo (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:35:22-14:35:22" data-bid="18-1" class="b">2Ch 35:22;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/38:12:11-38:12:11" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> Zec 12:11</a>).</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><strong>Figurative and Prophetic Use.</strong> A dark valley, or ravine, with pitfalls and wild beasts would be perilous to a flock, especially at night, were it not for the care of a good shepherd. Though similarly faced with the threat of various calamities, David was secure in the knowledge that Jehovah was his Shepherd. Therefore, he could declare: “Even though I walk in the valley of deep shadow, I fear nothing bad.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:23:1-19:23:1" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Ps 23:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:23:4-19:23:4" data-bid="19-2" class="b"> 4</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">“The pronouncement of the valley of the vision” evidently relates to ancient Jerusalem. Though of considerable elevation, the city is like a “valley” in being surrounded by higher mountains.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:22:1-23:22:1" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Isa 22:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:22:5-23:22:5" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> 5</a>.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Evidently by clearing out all obstacles that stood in the way of the return of his people from Babylonian exile, Jehovah, in effect, ‘raised up every valley,’ ‘leveled hills and mountains,’ and made “rugged ground a valley plain” for them. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:40:4-23:40:4" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Isa 40:4</a>) En route, the Jewish remnant did not suffer thirst. Jehovah’s words through Isaiah were fulfilled: “Upon bare hills I shall open up rivers, and in the midst of the valley plains, springs.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:41:18-23:41:18" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Isa 41:18</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:35:6-23:35:7" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Isa 35:6, 7,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:35:10-23:35:10" data-bid="23-2" class="b"> 10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:43:19-23:43:21" data-bid="23-3" class="b"> 43:19-21;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:48:20-23:48:21" data-bid="23-4" class="b"> 48:20, 21</a>.</p>

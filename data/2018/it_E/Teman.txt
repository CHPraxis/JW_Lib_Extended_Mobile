TEMAN
(Teʹman) [Right Side; South].
1. A descendant of Esau through his firstborn Eliphaz (Ge 36:10, 11; 1Ch 1:35, 36); an Edomite sheik.​—Ge 36:15, 16, 34, 42.
2. A place identified by some scholars with Tawilan, about 5 km (3 mi) E of Petra. It was evidently an Edomite city or district (the land of the Temanites), where the descendants of Teman resided. (Ge 36:34; Jer 49:7, 20; Eze 25:13; Am 1:11, 12; Ob 9) The place became noted as a center of wisdom. (Jer 49:7) In the book of Habakkuk, God is spoken of as coming from “Teman, even a Holy One from Mount Paran.” This may refer to Jehovah’s shining forth in glory, his splendor reflecting from the mountains as he brought his newly formed nation past Edom en route to the Promised Land.​—Hab 3:3, 4; compare De 33:2.

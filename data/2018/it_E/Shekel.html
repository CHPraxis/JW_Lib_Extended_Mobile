<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">(shekʹel).</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The basic Hebrew unit of weight (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:17:5-9:17:5" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1Sa 17:5,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:17:7-9:17:7" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:4:10-26:4:10" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> Eze 4:10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/30:8:5-30:8:5" data-bid="1-4" class="b"> Am 8:5</a>) and of monetary value. Based on the average of some 45 inscribed shekel weights, the shekel may be reckoned at 11.4 g (0.403 oz avdp; 0.367 oz t). One shekel equaled 20 gerahs (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:3:47-4:3:47" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Nu 3:47;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:18:16-4:18:16" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 18:16</a>), and there is evidence that 50 shekels equaled one mina. (See <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200003064/">MINA</a>.) Calculated in modern values, a shekel of silver would be worth $2.20, and a shekel of gold, $128.45.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The shekel is often referred to in connection with silver or gold. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:21:25-13:21:25" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1Ch 21:25;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:5:15-16:5:15" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Ne 5:15</a>) Before coins were used, pieces of silver (and, less frequently, gold) were used for money, the weight being checked at the time the transaction was made. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:23:15-1:23:16" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ge 23:15, 16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:7:21-6:7:21" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Jos 7:21</a>) Things pertaining to the tabernacle were sometimes stated in terms of shekels “by the shekel of the holy place.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:30:13-2:30:13" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ex 30:13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:5:15-3:5:15" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Le 5:15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:27:2-3:27:7" data-bid="5-3" class="b"> 27:2-7,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:27:25-3:27:25" data-bid="5-4" class="b"> 25</a>) This may have been to emphasize that the weight should be precise or, perhaps, that it should conform to a standard weight kept at the tabernacle.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">It is generally thought that the “silver pieces” often mentioned in the Hebrew Scriptures were silver shekels, the standard monetary unit. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:16:5-7:16:5" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Jg 16:5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:10:29-11:10:29" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 1Ki 10:29;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/28:3:2-28:3:2" data-bid="6-3" class="b"> Ho 3:2</a>) This is borne out by the <em>Septuagint</em> (in which the Greek word for “silver pieces” at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:20:16-1:20:16" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Genesis 20:16</a> is the same as the Greek word for “shekels” at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:23:15-1:23:16" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Genesis 23:15, 16</a>) as well as by the Targums. According to <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:32:9-24:32:9" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Jeremiah 32:9</a>, the prophet paid “seven shekels and ten silver pieces” for a field. Perhaps this was simply a legal formula meaning 17 silver shekels (<em>AS, Da, NE, RS</em>), or possibly, it meant seven <em>gold</em> shekels and ten silver shekels.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:14:26-10:14:26" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Second Samuel 14:26</a> may indicate that there was a “royal” shekel different from the common shekel, or the reference may be to a standard weight kept at the royal palace.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">(Beth-tapʹpu·ah) [House of the Apple [Tree]].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A city in the hill country near Hebron and part of Judah’s territorial inheritance. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:15:20-6:15:20" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Jos 15:20,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:15:48-6:15:48" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 48,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:15:53-6:15:53" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> 53</a>) Some suggest that it received its name from the Judean named Tappuah (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:2:42-13:2:43" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1Ch 2:42, 43</a>); however, it is also possible that Beth-tappuah was named after the apple trees that likely once grew there in abundance. It is identified today with modern Taffuh, about 6 km (3.5 mi) WNW of Hebron.</p>

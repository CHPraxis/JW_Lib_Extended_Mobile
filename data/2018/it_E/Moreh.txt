MOREH
(Moʹreh).
1. At least by Abraham’s time the big trees of Moreh constituted a well-known landmark near Shechem and seemingly continued to be such for centuries afterward. (Ge 12:6; De 11:30; perhaps also alluded to at Ge 35:4; Jos 24:25, 26; Jg 9:6.) Some scholars link “the big tree of Meonenim” with “the big trees of Moreh.” (Jg 9:37) “Moreh” was perhaps the name of the original owner of the plot near Shechem that had one especially prominent tree or a clump or grove of big trees.
2. The name of a hill, in the vicinity of which the Midianites were defeated by Gideon. (Jg 7:1) This hill is generally thought to be the bare gray ridge of Jebel Dahi (Givʽat Ha-More), about 8 km (5 mi) N of the suggested site for the well of Harod.

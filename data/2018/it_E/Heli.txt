HELI
(Heʹli) [from Heb., meaning “High (Exalted)”].
Evidently the father of Mary and maternal grandfather of Jesus Christ. (Lu 3:23) Joseph’s being called the “son of Heli” is understood to mean that he was the son-in-law of Heli. While not listing her, Luke evidently traces the natural descent of Jesus’ mother Mary from David.​—Lu 3:31; see GENEALOGY OF JESUS CHRIST.

Since the priest received tithes for his household’s sustenance, the daughter could share in this provision. This assured that she would not face poverty, and thus averted reproach that might otherwise have come upon the priesthood.

<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><strong>Christian Assistance to Widows.</strong> During the emergency that arose in the Christian congregation shortly after the day of Pentecost 33 C.E., the Greek-speaking widows were being overlooked in the daily distribution. When this was brought to the attention of the apostles, they considered the matter so important that they appointed “seven certified men . . . full of spirit and wisdom” to supervise the distribution of food with equity.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:6:1-44:6:6" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Ac 6:1-6</a>.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">The apostle Paul, at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:5:3-54:5:16" data-bid="14-1" class="b">1 Timothy 5:3-16</a>, gave complete instructions for the loving care of widows in the Christian congregation. The congregation was to care for destitute widows. But if the widow had children or grandchildren, they should assume the responsibility of providing for her needs, or, as Paul instructed, “if any believing woman has widows [that is, widows related to her], let her relieve them, and let the congregation not be under the burden. Then it can relieve those who are actually widows [that is, actually bereaved, without help].” A widow put on the list for material help by the congregation was one “who has become not less than sixty years old,” having a good record of morality, of faithful and loving devotion to Jehovah, and of hospitality and love toward others. On the other hand, the apostle recommends that young widows remarry, bear children, and manage a household, thereby avoiding a snare because of sexual impulses and the danger of being “unoccupied, . . . gossipers and meddlers in other people’s affairs.”</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A mode of capital punishment not prescribed by the Mosaic Law. It was one form of execution that existed in most of the nations. In Israel, when a beheading was performed, it was usually after the individual had been slain and was generally done to bring the person’s death before public attention as a reproach or as a public notice of judgment or warning.</p>

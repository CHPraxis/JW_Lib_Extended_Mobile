RECORDER
A highly responsible officer in the royal court of Israel. The title is translated from a form of the Hebrew word za·kharʹ (remember) and literally means “remembrancer.” (2Sa 8:16, ftn) His duties are not described in the Bible, but it appears that he was the official chronicler of the kingdom, furnishing the king with information on developments in the realm and also reminding him of important matters for his attention, supplying advice on them.
On occasion the recorder represented the king on important national matters. Joah the son of Asaph was one of the officials of King Hezekiah who went out to speak to the Assyrian Rabshakeh when that one threatened Jerusalem. (2Ki 18:18, 37) Another recorder, Joah the son of Joahaz, officiated in connection with the repairing of the temple. (2Ch 34:8) A recorder is named also in the courts of David and Solomon.​—2Sa 8:16; 20:24; 1Ki 4:3; see CITY RECORDER.

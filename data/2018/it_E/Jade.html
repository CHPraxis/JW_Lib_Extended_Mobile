<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A hard, durable, usually green-colored ornamental stone used for jewelry and carvings; in Hebrew, <em>ya·shephehʹ.</em> It occurs as two distinct minerals, “nephrite” and “jadeite.” Nephrite is the most common variety. It varies from translucent to opaque and is found in colors such as dark green, black, gray, yellow, and white. Jadeite is more valuable than nephrite because of its more attractive coloring and rarity. Jade is particularly suitable for engraving because of its composition.</p>

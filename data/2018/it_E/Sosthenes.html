<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The presiding officer of the Corinthian synagogue during Paul’s visit in Corinth; possibly the successor of Crispus, who became a Christian. When Proconsul Gallio declined to hear the Jews’ charges against Paul’s religious teaching, the crowd took Sosthenes and beat him. Certain manuscripts say the crowd was composed of anti-Jewish “Greeks”; others read “Jews.” Both, however, are interpolations, since the three oldest manuscripts do not tell us which partisan group attacked Sosthenes.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:18:8-44:18:8" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ac 18:8,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:18:12-44:18:17" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 12-17</a>.</p>

SUBMISSIVENESS
Willingness to be in subjection, to yield, or to submit​—to superiors, to law, or to a particular arrangement of things. Included are the subjection of Jesus Christ to his Father (1Co 15:27, 28), the Christian congregation to Jesus (Eph 5:24) and to God (Heb 12:9; Jas 4:7), individual Christians to those taking the lead in the congregation (1Co 16:15, 16; Heb 13:17, ftn; 1Pe 5:5), Christian women to the arrangement in the congregation regarding teaching (1Ti 2:11), slaves to their owners (Tit 2:9; 1Pe 2:18), wives to their husbands (Eph 5:22; Col 3:18; Tit 2:5; 1Pe 3:1, 5), children to their parents (1Ti 3:4; compare Lu 2:51; Eph 6:1), and the ruled to the rulers or the superior authorities (Ro 13:1, 5; Tit 3:1; 1Pe 2:13).​—See HEADSHIP; OBEDIENCE; SUPERIOR AUTHORITIES.
The submissiveness, or subjection, that a Christian displays toward humans involves conscience and is governed by his relationship to God. Therefore, when submissiveness would lead to compromise or a violation of divine law, God rather than men must be obeyed. (Ac 5:29) Thus, Paul and Barnabas “did not yield by way of submission” to the false brothers who, contrary to God’s revealed purpose, advocated circumcision and adherence to the Mosaic Law as requirements for gaining salvation.​—Ga 2:3-5; compare Ac 15:1, 24-29.
At 2 Corinthians 9:13 contributions made in behalf of needy fellow Christians are shown to be an evidence of an individual’s submissiveness to the good news, it being a Christian obligation to assist needy fellow believers.​—Jas 1:26, 27; 2:14-17.

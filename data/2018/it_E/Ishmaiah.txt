ISHMAIAH
(Ish·maʹiah) [May Jehovah Hear (Listen); Jehovah Has Heard (Listened)].
1. An outstanding Gibeonite warrior who joined David’s army at Ziklag before Saul’s death. (1Ch 12:1, 4) In this early list of David’s “thirty” leading warriors, Ishmaiah is called their head, but the absence of his name in later lists suggests that he may have died in the meantime.​—2Sa 23:8, 18, 19; 1Ch 11:10, 11, 20, 21.
2. The prince over the tribe of Zebulun in David’s time; son of Obadiah.​—1Ch 27:19, 22.

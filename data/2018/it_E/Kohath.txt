KOHATH
(Koʹhath).
The second named of the three sons of Levi (Ge 46:11; Ex 6:16; 1Ch 6:1) and father of Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel. (Ex 6:18; Nu 3:19; 1Ch 6:2) He was the progenitor of the Kohathites, one of the three main divisions of the Levites. (Nu 3:17, 27) He was likely born in the land of Canaan and is listed among the 66 souls who “came to Jacob into Egypt.” (Ge 46:8, 11, 26; see, however, BENJAMIN No. 1.) Kohath’s descendants included Moses, Aaron, Miriam (Ex 6:18, 20; Nu 26:58, 59), and rebellious Korah. (Nu 16:1-3) Kohath lived 133 years.​—Ex 6:18.

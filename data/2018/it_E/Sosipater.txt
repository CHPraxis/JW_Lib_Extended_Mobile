SOSIPATER
(So·sipʹa·ter) [Saving the Father].
A companion of Paul when in Corinth, whom the apostle described as ‘my relative,’ and whose greetings are sent from Corinth in Paul’s letter to the Romans. (Ro 16:21) He is possibly the same person as Sopater, mentioned at Acts 20:4 as associated with Paul in Greece.

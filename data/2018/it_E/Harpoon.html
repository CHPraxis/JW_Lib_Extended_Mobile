<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A barbed, spearlike instrument generally used in striking large fish. Reference is made to the harpoon only at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:41:7-18:41:7" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Job 41:7</a>, drawing attention to the armorlike quality of the skin of Leviathan (the crocodile), which resists penetration by an ordinary harpoon.</p>

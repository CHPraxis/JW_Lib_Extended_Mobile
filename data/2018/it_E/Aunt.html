<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">The sister of one’s mother or father; the wife of one’s uncle. Only in the Hebrew Scriptures is this kinship mentioned. There, sexual intercourse with such a near relative as an aunt is classified as incest and is strictly forbidden under the Mosaic Law.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:18:12-3:18:14" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Le 18:12-14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:20:19-3:20:20" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 20:19, 20</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Concerning Moses’ parents, the Masoretic text reads: “Now Amram took Jochebed his father’s sister as his wife.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:6:20-2:6:20" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ex 6:20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:26:59-4:26:59" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Nu 26:59</a>) Such a marriage at that time was permissible, as it occurred over 80 years before the Law was given.​—See <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200002478/">JOCHEBED</a>.</p>

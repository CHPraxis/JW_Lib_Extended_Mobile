URIJAH
(U·riʹjah) [My Light Is Jehovah].
1. A priest during the reign of King Ahaz of Judah (761-746 B.C.E.). When Ahaz went to Damascus to offer tribute to Tiglath-pileser III, he sent Urijah the design and pattern of the great altar he saw there and told him to build one like it, later instructing him to use it instead of Jehovah’s altar. Urijah complied. (2Ki 16:8-16) Urijah (Uriah) also witnessed a writing of Isaiah. (Isa 8:1, 2) Though not so identified, he was presumably high priest, in view of his importance and the absence of any other person so titled at this time.
2. A prophet of Jehovah, son of Shemaiah from Kiriath-jearim. During the reign of Jehoiakim, Urijah prophesied against Judah and Jerusalem just as Jeremiah did. However, when Urijah learned that Jehoiakim sought his death, he fled to Egypt, but he was brought back and slain, his body being cast into a common graveyard.​—Jer 26:20-23.
3. Son of Hakkoz; a priest whose son Meremoth was one of the priests in whose care Ezra entrusted the gold and silver and temple vessels brought to Jerusalem. Urijah’s son Meremoth later helped to repair Jerusalem’s wall.​—Ezr 8:33; Ne 3:4, 21.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">(Beth-merʹhak) [House Far Away; Distant House].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">When King David withdrew from Jerusalem because of the rebellion of his son Absalom, he stopped at Beth-merhak, perhaps the last house of Jerusalem in the direction of the Mount of Olives before crossing the Kidron Valley. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:15:17-10:15:17" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2Sa 15:17,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:15:23-10:15:23" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 23</a>) It appears that at this point King David reviewed his forces as they were crossing over the valley, thus indicating that David was not engaged in a wild, panicky flight but, rather, was making an orderly withdrawal from the city.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:15:18-10:15:26" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2Sa 15:18-26</a>.</p>

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Although the literal meaning of this musical term is “the eighth,” its exact significance is uncertain. It may refer to a particular musical register, or mode, a lower one, and if any musical instruments were associated with the term, they would probably be those used to play the bass tones of the musical scale.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">At <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:15:21-13:15:21" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Chronicles 15:21</a>, harps are spoken of as being “tuned to Sheminith [“possibly referring to the eighth key or a lower octave,” <em>NW</em> ftn; “probably the bass octave,” <em>Da</em> ftn <em>z</em>].” Consistently, the superscriptions of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:6:0-19:6:0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Psalms 6</a> and <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:12:0-19:12:0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">12</a> (both psalms being of somber character) read: “To the director (on stringed instruments) on the lower octave [<em>shemi·nithʹ</em>],” which may indicate that these songs would be accompanied by music in a lower range and sung accordingly.​—See <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200000189/">ALAMOTH</a>.</p>

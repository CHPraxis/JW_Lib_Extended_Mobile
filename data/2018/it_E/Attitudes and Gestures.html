<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">The Scriptures richly abound in references to forms of posture and gestures, the descriptions in the Bible being sufficient to show that they were much the same as those practiced in the Middle East today. These Orientals are considerably more demonstrative and less inhibited in the expression of their feelings than are many of the Western peoples. Either accompanied by words or without words, attitudes and gestures carried considerable force and meaning.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><strong>Prayer and Homage.</strong> <em>Standing.</em> Among the Hebrews and many of the other nations mentioned in the Bible, there was no set form of posture for prayer. All the attitudes assumed were highly respectful. Standing was a common posture. Jesus spoke of this position for prayer. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:11:25-41:11:25" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Mr 11:25</a>) Immediately after being baptized, Jesus was evidently standing and praying when the heaven was opened up and the holy spirit in bodily shape like a dove came down upon him, and God’s own voice was heard from the heavens.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:3:21-42:3:22" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Lu 3:21, 22</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><em>Kneeling</em> was a common attitude of prayer. Jesus himself knelt in the garden of Gethsemane. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:22:41-42:22:41" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Lu 22:41</a>) In representing the nation of Israel in prayer Solomon knelt at the inauguration of the temple. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:8:54-11:8:54" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1Ki 8:54</a>) While many of the instances in the Bible use the word “knees” in the plural, it may be that at times a person would kneel upon one knee, as is done sometimes by modern Orientals.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:9:40-44:9:40" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ac 9:40;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:20:36-44:20:36" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 20:36;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:21:5-44:21:5" data-bid="5-3" class="b"> 21:5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:3:14-49:3:14" data-bid="5-4" class="b"> Eph 3:14</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><em>Bowing.</em> The Jews, wherever they were found, when worshiping turned their faces toward the city of Jerusalem and its temple. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:8:42-11:8:42" data-bid="6-1" class="b">1Ki 8:42,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:8:44-11:8:44" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 44;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:6:10-27:6:10" data-bid="6-3" class="b"> Da 6:10</a>) In vision Ezekiel saw 25 men with their backs toward the temple of Jehovah, bowing with their faces toward the E. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:8:16-26:8:16" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Eze 8:16</a>) Temples of the sun worshipers were built in such a manner that the entrance was on the W side, making the worshipers face E on entering. But the temple of Jehovah was built with the entrance in the E so that the worshipers of Jehovah there turned their backs on the place of the rising of the sun.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><em>Extending the arms.</em> In the postures of standing and kneeling, the palms of the hands would sometimes be spread out to the heavens, or the hands would be lifted up or extended forward as in supplication. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:8:22-11:8:22" data-bid="8-1" class="b">1Ki 8:22;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:6:13-14:6:13" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 2Ch 6:13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:8:6-16:8:6" data-bid="8-3" class="b"> Ne 8:6</a>) The face would sometimes be uplifted (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:22:26-18:22:26" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Job 22:26</a>), or a person might lift up his eyes toward the heavens.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:14:19-40:14:19" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Mt 14:19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:7:34-41:7:34" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> Mr 7:34;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:1-43:17:1" data-bid="10-3" class="b"> Joh 17:1</a>.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><em>Sitting and prostrating.</em> Sitting was another posture employed in prayer, the petitioner evidently kneeling and then sitting back upon his heels. <span id="page216" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="216" data-before-text="216"></span>(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:17:16-13:17:16" data-bid="11-1" class="b">1Ch 17:16</a>) From this position he could bow his head or rest it on his bosom. Or, as Elijah did, he might crouch to the earth and put his face between his knees. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:18:42-11:18:42" data-bid="12-1" class="b">1Ki 18:42</a>) ‘Falling down’ or ‘falling on one’s face’ is often the way the Scriptures express a person’s prostrating himself. This was usually done by falling on the knees and bowing forward, resting on the hands or, more often, the elbows, with the head touching the ground. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:24:26-1:24:26" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Ge 24:26,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:24:48-1:24:48" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 48;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:8:6-16:8:6" data-bid="13-3" class="b"> Ne 8:6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:16:22-4:16:22" data-bid="13-4" class="b"> Nu 16:22,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:16:45-4:16:45" data-bid="13-5" class="b"> 45;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:26:39-40:26:39" data-bid="13-6" class="b"> Mt 26:39</a>) In great sorrow or very fervent prayer the petitioner might actually lie on his face with his body outstretched. In cases of extreme distress, the petitioner might wear sackcloth. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:21:16-13:21:16" data-bid="14-1" class="b">1Ch 21:16</a>) False worshipers also bowed down before their idols. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:20:5-2:20:5" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Ex 20:5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:25:2-4:25:2" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> Nu 25:2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:5:18-12:5:18" data-bid="15-3" class="b"> 2Ki 5:18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:3:5-27:3:12" data-bid="15-4" class="b"> Da 3:5-12</a>) Additionally, false worshipers would often kiss their idols.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:19:18-11:19:18" data-bid="16-1" class="b">1Ki 19:18</a>.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><em>Religious gestures toward an object.</em> Job pointed out the danger of letting one’s heart be enticed toward some object of reverence such as the sun or the moon to the point of making a worshipful gesture toward it, perhaps placing one’s hand to one’s mouth in a kiss the way pagan moon worshipers and those giving homage to idols did. Job realized that this was a denial of the true God and would require an accounting for such error.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:31:26-18:31:28" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Job 31:26-28</a>.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb"><em>Christian postures for prayer.</em> Jesus prayed publicly, in sincerity, as did Paul and others. He also recommended private prayer. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:5-40:6:6" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Mt 6:5, 6</a>) But Jesus condemned ostentatiousness in making long prayers for a pretense, a practice into which some of the scribes had fallen. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:12:40-41:12:40" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Mr 12:40;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:20:47-42:20:47" data-bid="19-2" class="b"> Lu 20:47</a>) However, Christians adopted many of the customs and practices of the Jewish synagogue​—ones that God did not disapprove—​and the same attitudes and postures of prayer are mentioned in the Christian Greek Scriptures. Nowhere do they give support to a facial or bodily attitude of assumed piety and sanctimoniousness. They do not make any given posture, such as placing the palms together or clasping the hands when offering prayer, essential. In fact, prayers can be made silently and completely without outward manifestation, when the individual is carrying on an assigned duty or is faced with an emergency. (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:2:4-16:2:4" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Ne 2:4</a>.) Christians are told to carry on prayer “with every form of prayer and supplication.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:6:18-49:6:18" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Eph 6:18</a>.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb"><strong>Respect, Humility.</strong> <em>Kneeling.</em> The attitudes and postures of the Orientals in expressing respect for one another and especially when petitioning superiors were much the same as the attitudes assumed in prayer. We find examples of kneeling in supplication before others. This was not in worship of the person but in acknowledgment of that one’s position or office, with deep respect.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:17:14-40:17:14" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Mt 17:14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:1:40-41:1:40" data-bid="22-2" class="b"> Mr 1:40;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:10:17-41:10:17" data-bid="22-3" class="b"> 10:17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:1:13-12:1:13" data-bid="22-4" class="b"> 2Ki 1:13</a>.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb"><em>Bowing</em> was more frequently used in greeting others, in approaching them on a matter of business, or in displaying a high degree of respect. Jacob bowed seven times on meeting Esau. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:33:3-1:33:3" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Ge 33:3</a>) Solomon, even though he was king, showed respect to his mother by bowing to her.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:2:19-11:2:19" data-bid="24-1" class="b">1Ki 2:19</a>.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">Bowing could also be a symbol of acknowledgment of defeat. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:60:14-23:60:14" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Isa 60:14</a>) Those persons defeated might appear before their conqueror in sackcloth and, additionally, with ropes upon their heads in an appeal for mercy. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:20:31-11:20:32" data-bid="26-1" class="b">1Ki 20:31, 32</a>) Some think that the ropes mentioned were put about their necks to symbolize their captivity and submission.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Although it was a common thing for the Jews to bow before authority to show respect, Mordecai refused to bow before Haman. This was because Haman, as an Agagite, was very likely an Amalekite, concerning whom Jehovah had said that he would completely wipe out their remembrance from under the heavens and that he would have war with Amalek from generation to generation. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:17:14-2:17:16" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Ex 17:14-16</a>) Since bowing down or prostration would have a connotation of peace toward Haman, Mordecai refused to perform this act, because he would have violated God’s command in doing so.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/17:3:5-17:3:5" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Es 3:5</a>.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb"><em>Prostrating.</em> Joshua prostrated himself before an angel, “as prince of the army of Jehovah,” not in worship, but in acknowledgment of the superior office the angel held and of the fact that the angel was obviously sent from Jehovah with a command for him.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:5:14-6:5:14" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Jos 5:14</a>.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">When Jesus was on earth, persons would prostrate themselves before him to petition and to do obeisance to him, and he did not reprove them. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:5:12-42:5:12" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Lu 5:12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:9:38-43:9:38" data-bid="30-2" class="b"> Joh 9:38</a>) This was because he was the appointed King, the King-Designate, as he himself said: “God’s royal majesty has approached” (<em>ED</em>); “The kingdom of God has drawn near.” (<em>NW,</em> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:1:15-41:1:15" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Mr 1:15</a>) Jesus was the heir to the throne of David and therefore was rightfully honored as a king.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:21:9-40:21:9" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Mt 21:9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:12:13-43:12:15" data-bid="32-2" class="b"> Joh 12:13-15</a>.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">However, the apostles of Jesus Christ refused to permit others to prostrate themselves before them. This was because, in the instances described, prostration was done as an attitude of worship, as though the power of the holy spirit in the apostles, which performed the healing and other powerful works, were their own. The apostles realized that the power was from God and that credit for these things should be given to him and all worship should be directed toward Jehovah <span id="page217" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="217" data-before-text="217"></span>through Jesus Christ, of whom they were merely the representatives.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:10:25-44:10:26" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Ac 10:25, 26</a>.</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">In connection with the respect paid to Jesus, the word often used is <em>pro·sky·neʹo,</em> a word having the basic meaning “do obeisance,” but also translated “worship.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:2:11-40:2:11" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Mt 2:11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:4:8-42:4:8" data-bid="34-2" class="b"> Lu 4:8</a>) Jesus was not accepting worship, which belongs to God alone (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:4:10-40:4:10" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Mt 4:10</a>), but recognized the act of the one doing obeisance as recognition of the authority given Him by God. The angel whom Jesus Christ sent to bring the Revelation to John expressed the principle that man’s worship belongs only to God, when he refused to accept worship from John.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:19:10-66:19:10" data-bid="36-1" class="b">Re 19:10</a>; see <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200003293/">OBEISANCE</a>; <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200004630/">WORSHIP</a>.</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb"><em>Covering the head</em> was a sign of respect on the part of women. This custom was followed in the Christian congregation. In discussing the principle of Christian headship, the apostle Paul stated: “Every woman that prays or prophesies with her head uncovered shames her head . . . That is why the woman ought to have a sign of authority upon her head because of the angels.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:11:3-46:11:10" data-bid="37-1" class="b">1Co 11:3-10</a>; see <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200001945/">HEADSHIP</a>.</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb"><em>Removing one’s sandals</em> was a gesture of respect or reverence. Moses was commanded to do this at the burning bush and Joshua in the presence of an angel. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:3:5-2:3:5" data-bid="38-1" class="b">Ex 3:5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:5:15-6:5:15" data-bid="38-2" class="b"> Jos 5:15</a>) Since the tabernacle and the temple were holy places, the priests are said to have performed their duties at the sanctuary barefoot. Likewise, the loosening of the laces of another person’s sandals or bearing his sandals for him was considered a menial duty and an expression of one’s humility and consciousness of insignificance when contrasted with his master. It is still a practice in the Middle East that when one enters a house, his sandals are taken off, sometimes by a servant.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:3:11-40:3:11" data-bid="39-1" class="b">Mt 3:11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:1:27-43:1:27" data-bid="39-2" class="b"> Joh 1:27</a>; see <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200003830/">SANDAL</a>.</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb"><em>Pouring water on another’s hands.</em> Elisha was identified as the minister or servant of Elijah by the expression “[he] poured out water upon the hands of Elijah.” This was a service performed particularly after meals. In the Middle East it was not the custom to use knives and forks, but fingers, and the servant would afterward pour water over the hands of his master for washing. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:3:11-12:3:11" data-bid="40-1" class="b">2Ki 3:11</a>) A similar practice was the washing of feet, performed as an act of hospitality, also of respect and, in certain relationships, of humility.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:13:5-43:13:5" data-bid="41-1" class="b">Joh 13:5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:24:32-1:24:32" data-bid="41-2" class="b"> Ge 24:32;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:43:24-1:43:24" data-bid="41-3" class="b"> 43:24;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:5:10-54:5:10" data-bid="41-4" class="b"> 1Ti 5:10</a>.</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb"><strong>Agreement, Sharing Together.</strong> <em>Handshaking</em> and <em>striking the palms</em> of the hands were gestures employed to express agreement, ratification, or confirmation of a contract or bargain. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/15:10:19-15:10:19" data-bid="42-1" class="b">Ezr 10:19</a>) The Scriptures warn against doing this in guaranteeing security of a loan for another person. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:6:1-20:6:3" data-bid="43-1" class="b">Pr 6:1-3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:17:18-20:17:18" data-bid="43-2" class="b"> 17:18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:22:26-20:22:26" data-bid="43-3" class="b"> 22:26</a>) Joint participation, or sharing together, was also denoted by a handshake or grasping of another’s hand.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:10:15-12:10:15" data-bid="44-1" class="b">2Ki 10:15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:2:9-48:2:9" data-bid="44-2" class="b"> Ga 2:9</a>.</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb"><strong>Blessing.</strong> <em>Putting hands on head; lifting hands.</em> Since the Hebrew word <em>ba·rakhʹ</em> has to do with bending the knees and kneeling as well as blessing, it is probable that, when receiving a blessing, persons knelt down and bowed themselves toward the one giving the blessing. Then the one blessing would put his hands on the head of the one being blessed. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:48:13-1:48:14" data-bid="45-1" class="b">Ge 48:13, 14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:10:16-41:10:16" data-bid="45-2" class="b"> Mr 10:16</a>) In bestowing a blessing upon a group of people, it was common to lift the hands toward them as the blessing was uttered.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:9:22-3:9:22" data-bid="46-1" class="b">Le 9:22;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:24:50-42:24:50" data-bid="46-2" class="b"> Lu 24:50</a>.</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb"><strong>Swearing.</strong> <em>Raising hand; placing hand under thigh.</em> In making an oath, it was customary to raise the right hand. God speaks of himself as doing this, symbolically. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:32:40-5:32:40" data-bid="47-1" class="b">De 32:40;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:62:8-23:62:8" data-bid="47-2" class="b"> Isa 62:8</a>) The angel in Daniel’s vision raised both his right hand and his left to heaven to utter an oath. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:12:7-27:12:7" data-bid="48-1" class="b">Da 12:7</a>) Another method of confirming an oath was to place one’s hand under the other’s thigh (hip), as Abraham’s steward did in swearing that he would get a wife for Isaac from Abraham’s relatives (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:24:2-1:24:2" data-bid="49-1" class="b">Ge 24:2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:24:9-1:24:9" data-bid="49-2" class="b"> 9</a>), and as Joseph did for Jacob in swearing not to bury Jacob in Egypt. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:47:29-1:47:31" data-bid="50-1" class="b">Ge 47:29-31</a>) The word “thigh” applies to the upper part of the leg from the hip to the knee, in which the femur is located. According to the Jewish rabbi Rashbam, this method of swearing was used when a superior adjured an inferior, such as a master his servant or a father his son, who also owes him obedience. And according to another Jewish scholar, Abraham Ibn Ezra, it was the custom in those days for a servant to take an oath in this manner, placing his hand under his master’s thigh, the latter sitting upon his hand. This signified that the servant was under his master’s authority.​—<em>The Soncino Chumash,</em> edited by A. Cohen, London, 1956, p. 122.</p>

<p id="p54" data-pid="54" class="sb">It was the custom of kings or men of authority to <em>lean on the arm</em> of a servant or one in an inferior position, as did King Jehoram of Israel.

<p id="p55" data-pid="55" class="sb"><strong>Illustrative Usage.</strong> <em>Washing another’s feet.</em> Jesus employed one of the Oriental customs in an illustrative way when, giving his disciples a lesson in humility and serving one another, he washed his disciples’ feet. Peter spoke up, asking him to wash not only his feet but also his hands and his head. But Jesus replied: “He that has bathed does not need to have more than his feet washed, but is wholly clean.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:13:3-43:13:10" data-bid="136-1" class="b">Joh 13:3-10</a>) Here Jesus was referring to the fact that after one had been to the bath he would, on returning from the bath to his house, need only to wash the dust of the road from his sandaled feet. He used this cleanness as figurative of spiritual cleanness.</p>
<p id="p56" data-pid="56" class="sb"><em>Walking.</em> Another illustrative expression is “to walk,” meaning to follow a certain course of action, as “Noah walked with the true God.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:6:9-1:6:9" data-bid="137-1" class="b">Ge 6:9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:5:22-1:5:22" data-bid="137-2" class="b"> 5:22</a>) Those walking with God followed the life course outlined by God and found his favor. The Christian Greek Scriptures, using this same expression, picture the two contrasting courses of action pursued by one before and after becoming a servant of God. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:2:2-49:2:2" data-bid="138-1" class="b">Eph 2:2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:2:10-49:2:10" data-bid="138-2" class="b"> 10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:4:17-49:4:17" data-bid="138-3" class="b"> 4:17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:5:2-49:5:2" data-bid="138-4" class="b"> 5:2</a>) In a similar manner “running” is used to symbolize a course of action. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:4:4-60:4:4" data-bid="139-1" class="b">1Pe 4:4</a>) God said that the prophets in Judah “ran” though not sent by him, meaning that they took the prophetic course falsely, unauthorized. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:23:21-24:23:21" data-bid="140-1" class="b">Jer 23:21</a>) Paul describes the Christian course in terms of “running.” He likens it to a race that a person must run according to the rules in order to win the prize.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:9:24-46:9:24" data-bid="141-1" class="b">1Co 9:24;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:2:2-48:2:2" data-bid="141-2" class="b"> Ga 2:2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:5:7-48:5:7" data-bid="141-3" class="b"> 5:7</a>.</p>

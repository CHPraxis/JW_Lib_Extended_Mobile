<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">As Jesus was dying on the torture stake, about the ninth hour, or about 3:00 p.m., he called out: <em>“Eʹli, Eʹli, laʹma sa·bach·thaʹni?”</em> (“My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?”) (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:27:46-40:27:46" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Mt 27:46;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:15:34-41:15:34" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Mr 15:34</a>) Bystanders thought that he was calling for Elijah. Perhaps they misunderstood Jesus’ words because his speech was indistinct as a result of his intense suffering or because his dialect differed from theirs. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:27:47-40:27:47" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Mt 27:47;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:15:35-41:15:35" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Mr 15:35</a>) In calling out to his heavenly Father, acknowledging him as his God, Jesus fulfilled <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:22:1-19:22:1" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Psalm 22:1</a>.</p>

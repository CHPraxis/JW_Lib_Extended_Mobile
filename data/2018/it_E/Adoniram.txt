ADONIRAM
(Ad·o·niʹram) [(My) Lord Is High (Exalted)].
A prince, able administrator, and the son of Abda. Adoniram served as overseer of those conscripted for forced labor during the reigns of David, Solomon, and Rehoboam, playing an important part in Solomon’s many building projects. Later, when the ten tribes revolted against the harsh dictates of Rehoboam at Shechem in 997 B.C.E., the king sent this conscriptor for forced labor to the people, but they “pelted him with stones, so that he died.” (2Ch 10:18) He is variously referred to as Adoniram (1Ki 4:6; 5:14), as Adoram (2Sa 20:24; 1Ki 12:18), and as Hadoram.​—2Ch 10:18.

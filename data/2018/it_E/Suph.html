<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">One of the locations mentioned to indicate where Moses spoke to the Israelites in the 40th year of their wilderness wandering. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:1:1-5:1:1" data-bid="1-1" class="b">De 1:1</a>, ftn) Instead of “Suph,” the Greek <em>Septuagint</em> (Bagster) and the Latin <em>Vulgate</em> read “the Red Sea,” perhaps because it was thought that the Hebrew word <em>yam</em> (meaning “sea”) had been dropped, leaving <em>Suph</em> as an abbreviation for <em>yam-suphʹ</em> (Red Sea). In such a case, the reference would be to that part of the sea called the Gulf of ʽAqaba. However, taken as it stands, the Hebrew Masoretic text says that Moses spoke to Israel “on the desert plains in front of Suph.” And <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:1:5-5:1:5" data-bid="2-1" class="b">verse 5</a> adds that this was “in the region of the Jordan in the land of Moab.” Therefore, though its exact site is unknown, Suph apparently was a place E of the <span id="page1046" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="1046" data-before-text="1046"></span>Jordan. It is tentatively identified with Khirbet Sufa, about 6 km (3.5 mi) SSE of Madaba.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">(Jaʹir).</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><strong>1.</strong> A descendant of Judah through his grandson Hezron. Hezron married a woman from the tribe of Manasseh. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:2:21-13:2:22" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1Ch 2:21, 22</a>) Jair is reckoned as a descendant of Manasseh rather than Judah, likely because of his exploits in the territory of Manasseh, where he captured a number of tent cities and named them after himself, which name they kept for many generations.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:32:41-4:32:41" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Nu 32:41;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:3:14-5:3:14" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> De 3:14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:13:30-6:13:30" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> Jos 13:30;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:4:13-11:4:13" data-bid="2-4" class="b"> 1Ki 4:13</a>; see <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200001922/">HAVVOTH-JAIR</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><strong>2.</strong> The seventh judge of Israel. Since he was a Gileadite of high standing and each of his 30 sons is connected with one of the above-mentioned tent cities of Jair, he was likely a descendant of No. 1 above. Jair judged Israel for 22 years, after which he died and was buried in Kamon.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:10:3-7:10:5" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Jg 10:3-5</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><strong>3.</strong> Father of Mordecai; tribe of Benjamin.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/17:2:5-17:2:5" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Es 2:5</a>.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><strong>4.</strong> Father of the Elhanan who slew Goliath’s brother Lahmi. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:20:5-13:20:5" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1Ch 20:5</a>) The corresponding passage at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:21:19-10:21:19" data-bid="6-1" class="b">2 Samuel 21:19</a> evidently contains a copyist’s error.​—See <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200002666/">LAHMI</a>.</p>

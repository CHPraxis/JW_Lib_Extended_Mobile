THEBEZ
(Theʹbez).
A city having a strong tower. When Abimelech had taken Thebez and was attempting to assault the tower where the populace had sought refuge, a woman pitched an upper millstone upon him from atop the wall. His skull shattered by the blow, Abimelech had his attendant put him to death so that no one could say, “It was a woman that killed him.”​—Jg 9:50-54; 2Sa 11:21.
Thebez is tentatively connected with modern Tubas, about 15 km (9.5 mi) NNE of Shechem, although no suitable remains have been found.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A black, brittle, and porous form of carbon, usually the residue of partially burned wood. In ancient times it was made by covering a pile of wood with earth and burning it slowly for several days with only a sufficient amount of air to burn off the gases. This practice left behind a relatively pure form of carbon. It was a time-consuming process requiring careful supervision, but charcoal was a favored fuel when intense, sustained heat without smoke was desired. There is no evidence that natural mineral coal was used in ancient Israel.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Charcoal, in an open fire or in a brazier, was used to warm oneself in cold weather. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:47:14-23:47:14" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Isa 47:14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:36:22-24:36:22" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Jer 36:22;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:18:18-43:18:18" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> Joh 18:18</a>) Its even heat with an absence of flame and smoke also highly recommended it for cooking. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:21:9-43:21:9" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Joh 21:9</a>) For smelting and refining metals, charcoal was indispensable; without it, reaching and sustaining the great temperatures required to reduce the ores to pure metals was hardly possible. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:44:12-23:44:12" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Isa 44:12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:54:16-23:54:16" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 54:16</a>; see <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200003672/">REFINE, REFINER</a>.) Much the same as is done today in charging an iron blast furnace, the ore was sandwiched in between layers of charcoal. This practice apparently gave rise to the proverb: Kindness toward an enemy is like coals of fire upon his head; it softens his anger and brings out the good in him. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:25:22-20:25:22" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Pr 25:22;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:12:20-45:12:20" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Ro 12:20</a>) The glow of slow-burning charcoal was used by the “wise woman” of Tekoa as an illustration of living posterity.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:14:1-10:14:7" data-bid="5-1" class="b">2Sa 14:1-7</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">However, the Hebrew words <em>ga·cheʹleth</em> and <em>pe·chamʹ</em> are not always rendered “charcoal,” for they often simply refer to coals, burning coals, or embers. Wood was used as fuel for the tabernacle altar (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:1:7-3:1:8" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Le 1:7, 8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:3:5-3:3:5" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 3:5</a>), and on the Day of Atonement “burning coals of fire from off the altar” made the incense overspread the ark of the covenant like a cloud. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:16:12-3:16:13" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Le 16:12, 13</a>) Isaiah described the idolater that makes a god out of part of the same tree with which he builds a fire, the coals of which bake his bread.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:44:14-23:44:15" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Isa 44:14, 15,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:44:19-23:44:19" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 19</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">In a number of Scripture passages “coals” are used in a somewhat figurative or illustrative sense, indicating any kind of glowing, hot, burning substance.

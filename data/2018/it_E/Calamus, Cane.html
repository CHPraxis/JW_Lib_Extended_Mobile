<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">[Heb., <em>qa·nehʹ</em>].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The Hebrew <em>qa·nehʹ</em> is the original source of the English word “cane” (as well as of the word “canon”), and <em>qa·nehʹ</em> is often translated as “stalk” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:41:5-1:41:5" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ge 41:5,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:41:22-1:41:22" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 22</a>), ‘branch’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:25:31-2:25:32" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ex 25:31, 32</a>), or “reed” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:14:15-11:14:15" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1Ki 14:15</a>). In certain texts, however, either the context or a modifying word indicates that an aromatic plant is referred to, and <em>qa·nehʹ</em> is thus translated “calamus” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:30:23-2:30:23" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ex 30:23</a>) and “cane.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/22:4:14-22:4:14" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ca 4:14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:43:24-23:43:24" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Isa 43:24</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Among the ingredients used in preparing the holy anointing oil was “sweet calamus,” the sweetness referring to its odor, not its taste. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:30:22-2:30:25" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ex 30:22-25</a>) The <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/22:4:14-22:4:14" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Song of Solomon (4:14</a>) includes “cane” among other odoriferous spices. Jehovah through his prophet <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:43:24-23:43:24" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Isaiah (43:24</a>) reproved the sinful Israelites for ‘having bought’ (Heb., <em>qa·niʹtha</em>) for his temple service no “[sweet] cane” (<em>qa·nehʹ</em>), thereby making a play on words in Hebrew. <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:6:20-24:6:20" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Jeremiah (6:20</a>) refers to cane received from a “land far away,” while <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:27:3-26:27:3" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ezekiel (27:3,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:27:19-26:27:19" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> 19</a>) includes cane among the products for which wealthy Tyre traded.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The English word “calamus” is derived from the Greek <em>kaʹla·mos,</em> used by the translators of the Greek <em>Septuagint</em> to render the Hebrew <em>qa·nehʹ.</em> Like the Hebrew word, <em>kaʹla·mos</em> also has the basic meaning of reed or cane, whereas the English word “calamus” today is used principally to refer to the sweet flag (<em>Acorus calamus</em>) or its aromatic root.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Regarding the sweet cane, or calamus, of the Hebrew Scriptures, many scholars prefer to identify it with an aromatic reed grass of India, such as <em>Cymbopogon martini,</em> a perennial grass whose leaves when crushed produce a fragrant oil known as ginger-grass oil. Other varieties of these Indian grasses produce citronella oil and lemongrass oil. The view that one or more of such sweet-scented grasses is represented by the sweet cane, or calamus, is based mainly on Jeremiah’s reference to the product as coming from a “land far away,” which in this case would be India. Other areas, however, may have been producers of the aromatic cane, or calamus, as is indicated by Ezekiel’s prophecy (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:27:19-26:27:19" data-bid="11-1" class="b">27:19</a>). Thus, while some kind of aromatic reed or cane is meant, the plant’s precise identification remains uncertain.</p>

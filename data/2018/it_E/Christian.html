At any rate, by about 58 C.E., in the city of Caesarea, the term was well known and used even by public officials, for at that time King Herod Agrippa II said to Paul: “In a short time you would persuade me to become a Christian.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:26:28-44:26:28" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ac 26:28</a>.</p>

<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">It was first in Syrian Antioch that Christ’s followers became known as Christians. It is most unlikely that the Jews first styled Jesus’ followers “Christians” (Greek) or “Messianists” (Hebrew), for they would not reject Jesus as being the Messiah, or Christ, and then tacitly recognize him as the Anointed One, or Christ, by stamping his followers “Christians.” Some think the heathen population may have nicknamed them Christians out of jest or scorn, but the Bible shows that it was a God-given name; they “were <em>by divine providence</em> called Christians.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:11:26-44:11:26" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ac 11:26</a>.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">The Greek verb <em>khre·ma·tiʹzo</em> in this text is generally rendered simply “were called,” and that is what is done at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:11:26-44:11:26" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Acts 11:26</a> in most translations. However, there are translations that indicate that God had something to do with selecting the name ‘Christian.’ Noteworthy in this regard are the <em>New World Translation, Young’s Literal Translation,</em> and <em>The Simple English Bible. Young’s</em> reads: “The disciples also were divinely called first in Antioch Christians.”</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">The Greek word <em>khre·ma·tiʹzo</em> as used in the Christian Greek Scriptures is always associated with something supernatural, oracular, or divine. Strong’s <em>Exhaustive Concordance of the Bible,</em> in its Greek dictionary (1890, p. 78), defines it as “to utter an oracle . . . i.e. divinely intimate.” Edward Robinson’s <em>Greek and English Lexicon</em> (1885, p. 786) gives the meaning: “Spoken in respect to a divine response, oracle, declaration, to give response, to speak as an oracle, to warn from God.” Thayer’s <em>Greek-English Lexicon of the New Testament</em> (1889, p. 671): “to give a divine command or admonition, to teach from heaven . . . to be divinely commanded, admonished, instructed . . . to be the mouthpiece of divine revelations, to promulge the commands of God.” Thomas Scott in his <em>Explanatory Notes</em> on this text (1832, Vol. III, p. 419) says: “The word implies that this was done by divine revelation: for it has generally this signification in the New Testament, and is rendered ‘warned from God’ or ‘warned of God,’ even when there is no word for GOD in the Greek.” Concerning <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:11:26-44:11:26" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Acts 11:26</a>, Clarke’s <em>Commentary</em> says: “The word [<em>khre·ma·tiʹsai</em>] in our common text, which we translate <em>were called,</em> signifies in the New Testament, to <em>appoint, warn,</em> or <em>nominate,</em> by <em>Divine direction.</em> In this sense, the word is used, <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:2:12-40:2:12" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Matt. ii. 12</a> . . .

In this way observers of these first-century Christians readily recognized them not only by their activity but also by their name as altogether different from the practitioners of Judaism; here was a growing association where there was neither Jew nor Greek but all were one under their Head and Leader, Jesus Christ.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:3:26-48:3:28" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Ga 3:26-28;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:3:11-51:3:11" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> Col 3:11</a>.</p>

<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">It is understandable why people with such high principles of morality and integrity, accompanied by an electrifying message delivered with fiery zeal and outspokenness, quickly gained attention in the first century. Paul’s missionary travels, for example, were like a spreading prairie fire that set city after city ablaze​—Antioch in Pisidia, Iconium, Lystra, Derbe, and Perga on one trip; Philippi, Thessalonica, Beroea, Athens, and Corinth on another​—causing people to stop, think, and take their stand, either accepting or rejecting the good news of God’s Kingdom.

This, in turn, made them objects of hatred and persecution, which was instigated chiefly by the false religious leaders and misinformed political rulers. Their leader Jesus Christ, the Prince of Peace, had been put to death on the charge of sedition; now peace-loving Christians were accused of “disturbing our city,” ‘overturning the inhabited earth,’ and being a people ‘that everywhere is spoken against.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:16:20-44:16:20" data-bid="37-1" class="b">Ac 16:20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:17:6-44:17:6" data-bid="37-2" class="b"> 17:6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:28:22-44:28:22" data-bid="37-3" class="b"> 28:22</a>) By the time Peter wrote his first letter (c. 62-64 C.E.) it seems that the activity of Christians was well known in places such as “Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:1:1-60:1:1" data-bid="38-1" class="b">1Pe 1:1</a>.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb"><strong>Non-Christian Testimony.</strong> Secular writers of the first two centuries also acknowledged the presence and influence of early Christians in their pagan world. For example, Tacitus, a Roman historian born about 55 C.E., tells of the rumor charging that Nero was the one responsible for burning Rome (64 C.E.), and then says: “Therefore, to scotch the rumour, Nero substituted as culprits, and punished with the utmost refinements of cruelty, a class of men, loathed for their vices [as the Romans viewed matters], whom the crowd styled Christians. . . . First, then, the confessed members of the sect were arrested; next, on their disclosures, vast numbers were convicted, not so much on the count of arson as for hatred of the human race. And derision accompanied their end: they were covered with wild beasts’ skins and torn to death by dogs; or they were fastened on crosses, and, when daylight failed were burned to serve as lamps by night.” (<em>The Annals,</em> XV, XLIV) Suetonius, another Roman historian, born toward the end of the first century C.E., relates events that occurred during Nero’s reign, saying: “Punishment was inflicted on the Christians, a class of men given to a new and mischievous superstition.”​—<em>The Lives of the Caesars</em> (Nero, XVI, 2).</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Flavius Josephus, in his <em>Jewish Antiquities</em> (XVIII, 64 [iii, 3]), mentions certain events in the life of Jesus, adding: “And the tribe of the Christians, so called after him, has still to this day <span id="page442" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="442" data-before-text="442"></span>[about 93 C.E.] not disappeared.” Pliny the Younger, governor of Bithynia in 111 or 112 C.E., faced with the ‘Christian problem,’ wrote to Emperor Trajan, outlining the methods he was using and asking for advice. “I have asked them in person if they are Christians,” wrote Pliny. If they admitted it, they were punished. However, others “denied that they were or ever had been Christians.” Put to the test, not only did these offer up pagan sacrifices but they even “reviled the name of Christ: none of which things, I understand, any genuine Christian can be induced to do.” In answering this letter, Trajan commended Pliny on the way he had handled the matter: “You have followed the right course of procedure . . . in your examination of the cases of persons charged with being Christians.”​—<em>The Letters of Pliny,</em> X, XCVI, 3, 5; XCVII, 1.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">First-century Christianity had no temples, built no altars, used no crucifixes, and sponsored no garbed and betitled ecclesiastics. Early Christians celebrated no state holidays and refused all military service. “A careful review of all the information available goes to show that, until the time of Marcus Aurelius [who ruled 161-180 C.E.], no Christian became a soldier; and no soldier, after becoming a Christian, remained in military service.”​—<em>The Rise of Christianity,</em> by E. Barnes, 1947, p. 333.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">Nevertheless, as indicated in Pliny’s letter, not all who bore the name Christian were uncompromisingly such when put to the test. Just as had been foretold, the spirit of apostasy was already at work before the apostles fell asleep.

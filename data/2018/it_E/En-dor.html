<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">[possibly, Fountain (Spring) of the Generation].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A plains city located in the territory of Issachar but assigned to Manasseh. The Canaanites there were not entirely dispossessed but came under forced labor. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:17:11-6:17:13" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Jos 17:11-13</a>) En-dor is usually identified with Khirbet Safsafeh (Horvat Zafzafot), about 11 km (7 mi) SE of Nazareth.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">At <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:83:9-19:83:10" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Psalm 83:9, 10</a>, En-dor is connected with Jehovah’s victory over Sisera. While not mentioned in the battle account at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:4:1-7:4:24" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Judges chapters 4</a> and <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:5:1-7:5:31" data-bid="4-1" class="b">5</a>, it evidently lay only a few miles S of Mount Tabor, from which Barak’s army descended. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:4:6-7:4:6" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Jg 4:6,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:4:12-7:4:12" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 12</a>) It was also in the general region of Taanach and Megiddo and the torrent valley of Kishon, where Sisera’s forces were miraculously disrupted. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:17:11-6:17:11" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Jos 17:11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:5:19-7:5:19" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> Jg 5:19</a>) So, some feature of the battle evidently extended as far as En-dor, and the psalmist, well acquainted with the historical and geographic details, could speak of En-dor as the place where many of the fleeing Canaanites were annihilated.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">En-dor is best known as the place where King Saul went to consult a “mistress of spirit mediumship” shortly before Israel’s defeat at the hands of the Philistines.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:28:7-9:28:7" data-bid="7-1" class="b">1Sa 28:7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:31:1-9:31:13" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 31:1-13</a>.</p>

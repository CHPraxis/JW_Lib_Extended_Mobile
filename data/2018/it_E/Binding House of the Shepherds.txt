BINDING HOUSE OF THE SHEPHERDS
A place on the road from Jezreel to Samaria where, by a cistern, Jehu met and slew the brothers of King Ahaziah of Judah. (2Ki 10:12-14) Its name apparently indicates a house where the sheep were bound to facilitate the work of shearing. Some versions render behth-ʽeʹqedh as “meeting house,” indicating an inn where “the shepherds” (ha·ro·ʽimʹ) met; others simply transliterate the Hebrew name, viewing it as the name of a town. It is generally identified with Beit Qad (Bet Qad) about 6 km (3.5 mi) ENE of modern Jenin. There are several cisterns at this place.

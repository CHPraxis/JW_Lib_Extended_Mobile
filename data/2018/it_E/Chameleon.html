<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">[Heb., <em>tin·sheʹmeth</em>].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The name of this reptile is included among “the swarming creatures” that were “unclean” under the Mosaic Law. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:11:29-3:11:30" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Le 11:29, 30</a>) The name is considered to have been derived from <em>na·shamʹ,</em> a root word meaning “pant.” (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:42:14-23:42:14" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Isa 42:14</a>.) Koehler and Baumgartner, by a comparison with Arabic, suggest “snorter” as the meaning. (<em>Lexicon in Veteris Testamenti Libros,</em> Leiden, 1958, p. 1035) While identification is uncertain, the name may apply to the chameleon. The common <em>Chamaeleo chamaeleon</em> is frequently found in Egypt and Palestine.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The chameleon is a slow-moving, tree-dwelling lizard noted for its color-changing ability. Color response is primarily determined by temperature, light intensity, and emotional state.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">At <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:11:18-3:11:18" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Leviticus 11:18</a> the same Hebrew word is applied to the swan as among “unclean” fowl.</p>

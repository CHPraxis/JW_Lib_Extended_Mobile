<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The name associated with a spring on the boundary between Judah and Benjamin. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:15:1-6:15:1" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Jos 15:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:15:9-6:15:9" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:18:11-6:18:11" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> 18:11,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:18:15-6:18:15" data-bid="1-4" class="b"> 15</a>) This spring is usually identified with the one at Lifta (ʽEn Neftoah), to the E of Kiriath-jearim and about 4 km (2.5 mi) WNW of the Temple Mount in Jerusalem. Although this identification would agree with <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:15:9-6:15:9" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Joshua 15:9,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:18:15-6:18:16" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Joshua 18:15, 16</a> appears to place “the spring of the waters of Nephtoah” W of Kiriath-jearim. Bible translators have variously handled this seeming discrepancy. Following the reading of the Greek <em>Septuagint, The Jerusalem Bible</em> replaces “westward” with “towards Gasin.” In the <em>Revised Standard Version</em> the text has been changed in harmony with <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:15:9-6:15:9" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Joshua 15:9</a> and reads “to Ephron” instead of “westward.” Ronald A. Knox translates the Hebrew word <em>yamʹmah</em> (westward) according to its literal meaning as “seaward” and, in a footnote, explains: “This ought to mean westwards, towards the Mediterranean, but it seems quite clear that at this point the boundary of Benjamin turned eastwards; and the sea is presumably the Dead Sea, its eastward limit.”</p>

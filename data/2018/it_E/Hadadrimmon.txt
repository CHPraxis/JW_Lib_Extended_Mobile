HADADRIMMON
(Ha·dad·rimʹmon).
Evidently a location in the valley plain of Megiddo. (Zec 12:11) Hadadrimmon is often identified with Rummana, a site about 7 km (4.5 mi) SSE of Megiddo.
The ‘great wailing’ at Hadadrimmon mentioned in Zechariah’s prophecy perhaps alludes to the lamentation over King Josiah, killed in battle at Megiddo. (2Ki 23:29; 2Ch 35:24, 25) But some associate this lamentation with ritualistic mourning ceremonies like those for the false god Tammuz (compare Eze 8:14) and consider “Hadadrimmon” to be the composite name of a god. This is unlikely, especially since Jehovah’s words, through Zechariah, are part of a prophecy concerning the Messiah. Hardly could idolatrous weeping ceremonies serve as a prophetic illustration; but the mourning for a faithful Judean king could well do so.​—Compare Joh 19:37 and Re 1:7 with Zec 12:10-14.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">(Ibʹle·am) [possibly from a root meaning “swallow down”].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A city in the territory of Issachar but assigned with its dependent towns to Manasseh. The Manassites, however, failed to dispossess the Canaanites from Ibleam. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:17:11-6:17:13" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Jos 17:11-13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:1:27-7:1:27" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Jg 1:27</a>) Ibleam appears to be the same as the Bileam in Manasseh given to the Kohathite Levites. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:6:70-13:6:70" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1Ch 6:70</a>) But the parallel passage mentioning Levite cities in the territory of the half tribe of Manasseh (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:21:25-6:21:25" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Jos 21:25</a>) reads “Gath-rimmon” instead of “Bileam” or “Ibleam.” Generally this is attributed to scribal error, “Gath-rimmon,” the name of a city in Dan, probably having been inadvertently repeated from <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:21:24-6:21:24" data-bid="4-1" class="b">verse 24</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Ibleam has been identified with Khirbet Belʽameh, about 18 km (11 mi) SSE of Megiddo.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Near Ibleam, King Ahaziah of Judah was fatally struck down at the command of Jehu. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:9:27-12:9:27" data-bid="5-1" class="b">2Ki 9:27</a>) Later, Jehu’s dynasty ended with the assassination of Zechariah at Ibleam (according to the Lagardian edition of the <em>LXX</em>).​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:15:10-12:15:12" data-bid="6-1" class="b">2Ki 15:10-12</a>, <em>JB, NW, RS.</em></p>

AUNT
The sister of one’s mother or father; the wife of one’s uncle. Only in the Hebrew Scriptures is this kinship mentioned. There, sexual intercourse with such a near relative as an aunt is classified as incest and is strictly forbidden under the Mosaic Law.​—Le 18:12-14; 20:19, 20.
Concerning Moses’ parents, the Masoretic text reads: “Now Amram took Jochebed his father’s sister as his wife.” (Ex 6:20; Nu 26:59) Such a marriage at that time was permissible, as it occurred over 80 years before the Law was given.​—See JOCHEBED.

LASHA
(Laʹsha).
A place mentioned in the earliest Canaanite boundary description. (Ge 10:19) Its exact location is uncertain. Either Lasha was “near” Zeboiim (NW; JP [1962 ed.]) or the Canaanite boundary extended from the area around Zeboiim “as far as” Lasha. (AT; RS; JB) On the basis of Jerome’s identification and Jewish tradition, many place Lasha at Callirrhoe, near the eastern shore of the Dead Sea below the Wadi Zarqa Maʽin. Others link Lasha with Laish (Dan).

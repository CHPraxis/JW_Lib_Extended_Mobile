BELL
A hollow metallic vessel. This instrument is usually pear-shaped or cuplike, and gives a dominant musical note when struck.
The first mention of bells in the Bible is in connection with the tabernacle service in the book of Exodus, where the Hebrew word pa·ʽamohnʹ occurs seven times. On the hem of the solid-blue coat of the high priest were attached golden bells alternated with pomegranates of blue, purple, and scarlet material.​—Ex 28:33-35; 39:25, 26.
In Zechariah 14:20 the Hebrew word metsil·lahʹ is used to denote the bells attached to the harnesses of horses. It comes from a root meaning “tingle.” (1Sa 3:11) The fact that horse bells were to be engraved with the words “Holiness belongs to Jehovah,” the same words as found on “the shining plate” attached to the turban of the high priest of Israel, would indicate that everything would be pervaded with an awareness of Jehovah’s holiness.​—Ex 39:30, 31; compare Zec 14:21.

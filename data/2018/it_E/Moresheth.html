<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">(Moʹresh·eth), <strong>Moresheth-gath</strong> [Possession of Gath].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Apparently the home of the prophet Micah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:26:18-24:26:18" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Jer 26:18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/33:1:1-33:1:1" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Mic 1:1</a>) Tell el-Judeideh (Tel Goded), about 35 km (22 mi) SW of Jerusalem and about 10 km (6 mi) SE of Gath, is a possible identification. The composite name Moresheth-gath (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/33:1:14-33:1:14" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Mic 1:14</a>) implies that the city was in some way associated with Gath. Perhaps it was at times dominated by that Philistine city, since the Philistines controlled places other than their five major cities (Gath being one of the five).​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:6:18-9:6:18" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1Sa 6:18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:27:5-9:27:5" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 27:5</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Some view <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/33:1:14-33:1:14" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Micah 1:14</a> as a play on the name Moresheth (meaning “Possession”). The Hebrew term for “parting gifts” in this text signifies a person or possession that is temporarily or permanently given up or sent away. Accordingly, Zion (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/33:1:13-33:1:13" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Mic 1:13</a>) would lose this city, Moresheth itself constituting the “parting gifts.”</p>

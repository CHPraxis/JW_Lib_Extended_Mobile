JEHOVAH-SHALOM
(Je·hoʹvah-shaʹlom) [Jehovah Is Peace].
The name given to the altar that Gideon built at Ophrah W of the Jordan. After having seen Jehovah’s angel, Gideon feared that he would die. But he was assured: “Peace be yours. Do not fear. You will not die.” Out of gratitude, Gideon built the altar, evidently not for sacrifice, but as a memorial to Jehovah.​—Jg 6:22-24.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">(Parʹsin).</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">One of the words mysteriously written on the wall of Belshazzar’s palace and read and interpreted by Daniel. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:5:25-27:5:25" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Da 5:25</a>) It is the plural number of “Peres,” which means “a half shekel,” a division of a shekel. In giving the interpretation, Daniel did not use the plural “Parsin,” but used the singular form (Peres). (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:5:28-27:5:28" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Da 5:28</a>) Perhaps this was because only Belshazzar was present to hear the prophet explain the prophetic message, although it applied to both rulers of the Babylonian Empire, Belshazzar and Nabonidus.​—See <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200003436/">PERES</a>.</p>

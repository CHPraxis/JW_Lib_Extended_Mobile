<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">(Haʹzar-suʹsah) [Courtyard (Settlement) of the Mare].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A Simeonite enclave city in the southern part of Judah (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:19:1-6:19:2" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Jos 19:1, 2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:19:5-6:19:5" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 5</a>), also called Hazar-susim. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:4:31-13:4:31" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1Ch 4:31</a>) A similar list of cities originally assigned to Judah has “Sansannah” in place of Hazar-susah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:15:21-6:15:21" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Jos 15:21,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:15:31-6:15:31" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 31</a>) Some view them as separate locations, placing Sansannah to the NNE of Beer-sheba and Hazar-susah about 26 km (16 mi) to the W of Beer-sheba at Sbalat Abu Susein, near the Plains of Philistia. A number of scholars, however, view it as probable that Hazar-susah is simply a secondary name for Sansannah, such secondary name, by its meaning, describing a notable function of the place. If it is the same as Sansannah, Hazar-susah may tentatively be identified with Khirbet esh-Shamsaniyat to the NNE of Beer-sheba, a short distance from the suggested site of Madmannah (likely Beth-marcaboth), mentioned before (Hazar-susah, Hazar-susim, or Sansannah) in the foregoing texts.​—See <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200000697/">BETH-MARCABOTH</a>.</p>

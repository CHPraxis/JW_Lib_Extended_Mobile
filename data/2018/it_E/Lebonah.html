<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A place mentioned as a reference point in connection with the location of Shiloh. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:21:19-7:21:19" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Jg 21:19</a>) It is tentatively identified with el-Lubban (Lubban Sharqiya), about 5 km (3 mi) WNW of the suggested site of Shiloh. However, the Bible’s placing of Shiloh “toward the south of Lebonah” may indicate that originally the city was farther E than this suggested site.</p>

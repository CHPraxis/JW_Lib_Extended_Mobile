KADMIEL
(Kadʹmi·el) [God Confronts; God Goes in Front].
A Levite returning to Jerusalem (with Zerubbabel) accompanied by members of his family. (Ezr 2:1, 2, 40; Ne 7:6, 7, 43; 12:1, 8, 24) Kadmiel and his sons helped supervise the temple reconstruction.​—Ezr 3:9.
The time period between the return from Babylonian exile (537 B.C.E.) and the confession of the nation’s sins against Jehovah in Nehemiah’s day (455 B.C.E.), which was followed by the attesting by seal of the “trustworthy arrangement” (Ne 9:4, 5, 38; 10:1, 9, 10), does not allow for the same Kadmiel to be identified with all these affairs. No doubt a representative of Kadmiel’s house participated in these latter two events.

CANNEH
(Can πneh).
A place mentioned along with Haran and Eden as being among the traders of ancient Tyre. (Eze 27:23) Its association with Haran and Eden would seem to place it in northern Mesopotamia, along the middle course of the Euphrates River. Some scholars view the name as a contracted form of Calneh.

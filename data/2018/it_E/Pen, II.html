<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">An implement for writing with ink or similar fluid. When ancients wrote on clay, wax, or soft metal they used a stylus (see <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200004252/">STYLUS</a>), but writing was also done on parchment or papyrus with pen and ink. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/64:1:13-64:1:13" data-bid="1-1" class="b">3Jo 13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/63:1:12-63:1:12" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 2Jo 12</a>) The Greek word translated “pen” (<em>kaʹla·mos</em>) refers to a reed or cane and can literally be rendered “writing-reed.” Among ancient Egyptians the reed pen was made with a flat chisel-shaped head that was cut or sliced so that it would act as a brush. The reeds may have been dried and hardened by leaving them under dung heaps for several months, as has been the practice in recent years. The Greeks and Romans used a reed pen that was pointed and slit, as was later done with quill pens and as has been done even in recent times with pen points.</p>

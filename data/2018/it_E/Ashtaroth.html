<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">(Ashʹta·roth).</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A city in the region of Bashan, generally identified today with Tell ʽAshtarah about 32 km (20 mi) E of the Sea of Galilee. The low hill there is surrounded by a well-watered plain. Its name may indicate that it was a center of worship of the goddess Ashtoreth.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Biblical references to it are principally with regard to giant King Og of Bashan, who is spoken of as reigning “in Ashtaroth, in Edrei.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:1:4-5:1:4" data-bid="1-1" class="b">De 1:4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:9:10-6:9:10" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Jos 9:10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:12:4-6:12:4" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> 12:4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:13:12-6:13:12" data-bid="1-4" class="b"> 13:12</a>) The conquered territory of Og’s kingdom was originally assigned to the Machirites of the tribe of Manasseh, but Ashtaroth later passed to the Gershonites as a Levite city.

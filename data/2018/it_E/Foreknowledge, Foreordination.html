<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Foreknowledge means knowledge of a thing before it happens or exists; also called prescience. In the Bible it relates primarily, though not exclusively, to Jehovah God the Creator and his purposes. Foreordination means the ordaining, decreeing, or determining of something beforehand; or the quality or state of being foreordained.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><strong>Original-Language Words.</strong> The words generally translated as “foreknow,” “foreknowledge,” and “foreordain” are found in the Christian Greek Scriptures, although the same basic ideas are expressed in the Hebrew Scriptures.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“Foreknowledge” translates the Greek <em>proʹgno·sis</em> (from <em>pro,</em> before, and <em>gnoʹsis,</em> knowledge). (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:2:23-44:2:23" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ac 2:23;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:1:2-60:1:2" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 1Pe 1:2</a>) The related verb <em>pro·gi·noʹsko</em> is used in two cases with regard to humans: in Paul’s statement that certain Jews were “previously acquainted” with him (knew him beforehand), and in Peter’s reference to the “advance knowledge” had by those addressed in his second letter. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:26:4-44:26:5" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ac 26:4, 5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:3:17-61:3:17" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 2Pe 3:17</a>) In this latter case it is obvious that such foreknowledge was not infinite; that is, it did not mean that those Christians knew <em>all</em> the details of time, place, and circumstance about the future events and conditions Peter had discussed. But they did have a <em>general</em> outline of what to expect, received as a result of God’s inspiration of Peter and of other contributors to the Bible.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">“Foreordain” translates the Greek <em>pro·o·riʹzo</em> (from <em>pro,</em> before, and <em>ho·riʹzo,</em> mark out or set the bounds). (The English word “horizon” transliterates the Greek word <em>ho·riʹzon,</em> meaning the “bounding” or “limiting.”) Illustrating the sense of the Greek verb <em>ho·riʹzo</em> is Jesus Christ’s statement that, as “the Son of man,” he was “going his way according to what [was] marked out [<em>ho·ri·smeʹnon</em>].” Paul said that God had “decreed [marked out, <em>ho·riʹsas</em>] the appointed times and the set limits of the dwelling of men.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:22:22-42:22:22" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Lu 22:22;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:17:26-44:17:26" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Ac 17:26</a>) The same verb is used of human determination, as when the disciples “determined [<em>hoʹri·san</em>]” to send relief to their needy brothers. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:11:29-44:11:29" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ac 11:29</a>) However, specific references to <em>fore</em>ordaining in the Christian Greek Scriptures are applied only to God.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><span id="page852" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="852" data-before-text="852"></span><strong>Factors to Recognize.</strong> To understand the matter of foreknowledge and foreordination as relating to God, certain factors necessarily must be recognized.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">First, God’s ability to foreknow and foreordain is clearly stated in the Bible. Jehovah himself sets forth as proof of his Godship this ability to foreknow and foreordain events of salvation and deliverance, as well as acts of judgment and punishment, and then to bring such events to fulfillment. His chosen people are witnesses of these facts. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:44:6-23:44:9" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Isa 44:6-9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:48:3-23:48:8" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 48:3-8</a>) Such divine foreknowledge and foreordination form the basis for all true prophecy. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:42:9-23:42:9" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Isa 42:9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:50:45-24:50:45" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> Jer 50:45;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/30:3:7-30:3:8" data-bid="6-3" class="b"> Am 3:7, 8</a>) God challenges the nations opposing his people to furnish proof of the godship they claim for their mighty ones and their idol-gods, calling on them to do so by foretelling similar acts of salvation or judgment and then bringing them to pass. Their impotence in this respect demonstrates their idols to be ‘mere wind and unreality.’​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:41:1-23:41:10" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Isa 41:1-10,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:41:21-23:41:29" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 21-29;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:43:9-23:43:15" data-bid="7-3" class="b"> 43:9-15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:45:20-23:45:21" data-bid="7-4" class="b"> 45:20, 21</a>.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">A second factor to be considered is the free moral agency of God’s intelligent creatures. The Scriptures show that God extends to such creatures the privilege and responsibility of free choice, of exercising free moral agency (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:30:19-5:30:20" data-bid="8-1" class="b">De 30:19, 20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:24:15-6:24:15" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> Jos 24:15</a>), thereby making them accountable for their acts. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:2:16-1:2:17" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ge 2:16, 17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:3:11-1:3:19" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 3:11-19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:14:10-45:14:12" data-bid="9-3" class="b"> Ro 14:10-12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:4:13-58:4:13" data-bid="9-4" class="b"> Heb 4:13</a>) They are thus not mere automatons, or robots. Man could not truly have been created in “God’s image” if he were not a free moral agent. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:26-1:1:27" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ge 1:26, 27</a>; see <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200001568/">FREEDOM</a>.) Logically, there should be no conflict between God’s foreknowledge (as well as his foreordaining) and the free moral agency of his intelligent creatures.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">A third factor that must be considered, one sometimes overlooked, is that of God’s moral standards and qualities, including his justice, honesty, impartiality, love, mercy, and kindness. Any understanding of God’s use of the powers of foreknowledge and foreordination must therefore harmonize with not only some of these factors but with all of them. Clearly, whatever God foreknows must inevitably come to pass, so that God is able to call “things that are not as though they were.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:4:17-45:4:17" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Ro 4:17</a>.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sn"><strong><em>Does God know in advance everything that people will do?</em></strong></p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">The question then arises: Is his exercise of foreknowledge infinite, without limit? Does he foresee and foreknow all future actions of all his creatures, spirit and human? And does he foreordain such actions or even predestinate what shall be the final destiny of all his creatures, even doing so before they have come into existence?</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">Or, is God’s exercise of foreknowledge selective and discretionary, so that whatever he chooses to foresee and foreknow, he does, but what he does not choose to foresee or foreknow, he does not? And, instead of preceding their existence, does God’s determination of his creatures’ eternal destiny await his judgment of their course of life and of their proved attitude under test? The answers to these questions must necessarily come from the Scriptures themselves and the information they provide concerning God’s actions and dealings with his creatures, including what has been revealed through his Son, Christ Jesus.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:2:16-46:2:16" data-bid="12-1" class="b">1Co 2:16</a>.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb"><strong><em>Predestinarian view.</em></strong> The view that God’s exercise of his foreknowledge is infinite and that he does foreordain the course and destiny of all individuals is known as predestinarianism. Its advocates reason that God’s divinity and perfection require that he be omniscient (all-knowing), not only respecting the past and present but also regarding the future. According to this concept, for him not to foreknow all matters in their minutest detail would evidence imperfection. Examples such as the case of Isaac’s twin sons, Esau and Jacob, are presented as evidence of God’s foreordaining creatures before their birth (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:9:10-45:9:13" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Ro 9:10-13</a>); and texts such as <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:1:4-49:1:5" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Ephesians 1:4, 5</a> are cited as evidence that God foreknew and foreordained the future of all his creatures even before the start of creation.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">To be correct, this view would, of course, have to harmonize with all the factors previously mentioned, including the Scriptural presentation of God’s qualities, standards, and purposes, as well as his righteous ways in dealing with his creatures. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:15:3-66:15:4" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Re 15:3, 4</a>) We may properly consider, then, the implications of such a predestinarian view.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">This concept would mean that, prior to creating angels or earthling man, God exercised his powers of foreknowledge and foresaw and foreknew all that would result from such creation, including the rebellion of one of his spirit sons, the subsequent rebellion of the first human pair in Eden (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:3:1-1:3:6" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Ge 3:1-6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:8:44-43:8:44" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> Joh 8:44</a>), and all the bad consequences of such rebellion down to and beyond this present day. This would necessarily mean that all the wickedness that history has recorded <span id="page853" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="853" data-before-text="853"></span>(the crime and immorality, oppression and resultant suffering, lying and hypocrisy, false worship and idolatry) once existed, before creation’s beginning, only in the mind of God, in the form of his foreknowledge of the future in all of its minutest details.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">If the Creator of mankind had indeed exercised his power to foreknow all that history has seen since man’s creation, then the full weight of all the wickedness thereafter resulting was deliberately set in motion by God when he spoke the words: “Let us make man.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:26-1:1:26" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Ge 1:26</a>) These facts bring into question the reasonableness and consistency of the predestinarian concept; particularly so, since the disciple James shows that disorder and other vile things do not originate from God’s heavenly presence but are “earthly, animal, demonic” in source.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:3:14-59:3:18" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Jas 3:14-18</a>.</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb"><strong><em>Infinite exercise of foreknowledge?</em></strong> The argument that God’s not foreknowing all future events and circumstances in full detail would evidence imperfection on his part is, in reality, an arbitrary view of perfection. Perfection, correctly defined, does not demand such an absolute, all-embracing extension, inasmuch as the perfection of anything actually depends upon its measuring up completely to the standards of excellence set by one qualified to judge its merits. (See <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200003440/">PERFECTION</a>.) Ultimately, God’s own will and good pleasure, not human opinions or concepts, are the deciding factors as to whether anything is perfect.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:32:4-5:32:4" data-bid="19-1" class="b">De 32:4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:22:31-10:22:31" data-bid="19-2" class="b"> 2Sa 22:31;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:46:10-23:46:10" data-bid="19-3" class="b"> Isa 46:10</a>.</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">To illustrate this, God’s almightiness is undeniably perfect and is infinite in capacity. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:29:11-13:29:12" data-bid="20-1" class="b">1Ch 29:11, 12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:36:22-18:36:22" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> Job 36:22;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:37:23-18:37:23" data-bid="20-3" class="b"> 37:23</a>) Yet his perfection in strength does not require him to use his power to the full extent of his omnipotence in any or in all cases. Clearly he has not done so; if he had, not merely certain ancient cities and some nations would have been destroyed, but the earth and all in it would have been obliterated long ago by God’s executions of judgment, accompanied by mighty expressions of disapproval and wrath, as at the Flood and on other occasions. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:6:5-1:6:8" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Ge 6:5-8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:19:23-1:19:25" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> 19:23-25,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:19:29-1:19:29" data-bid="21-3" class="b"> 29</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:9:13-2:9:16" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Ex 9:13-16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:30:23-24:30:24" data-bid="22-2" class="b"> Jer 30:23, 24</a>.) God’s exercise of his might is therefore not simply an unleashing of limitless power but is constantly governed by his purpose and, where merited, tempered by his mercy.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:9:31-16:9:31" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Ne 9:31;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:78:38-19:78:39" data-bid="23-2" class="b"> Ps 78:38, 39;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:30:11-24:30:11" data-bid="23-3" class="b"> Jer 30:11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/25:3:22-25:3:22" data-bid="23-4" class="b"> La 3:22;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:20:17-26:20:17" data-bid="23-5" class="b"> Eze 20:17</a>.</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">Similarly, if, in certain respects, God chooses to exercise his infinite ability of foreknowledge in a selective way and to the degree that pleases him, then assuredly no human or angel can rightly say: “What are you doing?” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:9:12-18:9:12" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Job 9:12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:45:9-23:45:9" data-bid="24-2" class="b"> Isa 45:9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:4:35-27:4:35" data-bid="24-3" class="b"> Da 4:35</a>) It is therefore not a question of ability, what God <em>can</em> foresee, foreknow, and foreordain, for “with God all things are possible.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:19:26-40:19:26" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Mt 19:26</a>) The question is what God <em>sees fit</em> to foresee, foreknow, and foreordain, for “everything that he delighted to do he has done.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:115:3-19:115:3" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Ps 115:3</a>.</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb"><strong><em>Selective exercise of foreknowledge.</em></strong> The alternative to predestinarianism, the selective or discretionary exercise of God’s powers of foreknowledge, would have to harmonize with God’s own righteous standards and be consistent with what he reveals of himself in his Word. In contrast with the theory of predestinarianism, a number of texts point to an examination by God of a situation then current and a decision made on the basis of such examination.</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">Thus, at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:11:5-1:11:8" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Genesis 11:5-8</a> God is described as directing his attention earthward, surveying the situation at Babel, and, at that time, determining the action to be taken to break up the unrighteous project there. After wickedness developed at Sodom and Gomorrah, Jehovah advised Abraham of his decision to investigate (by means of his angels) to “see whether they act altogether according to the outcry over it that has come to me, and, if not, <em>I can get to know it.”</em> (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:18:20-1:18:22" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Ge 18:20-22;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:19:1-1:19:1" data-bid="28-2" class="b"> 19:1</a>) God spoke of ‘becoming acquainted with Abraham,’ and after Abraham went to the point of attempting to sacrifice Isaac, Jehovah said, “For <em>now I do know</em> that you are God-fearing in that you have not withheld your son, your only one, from me.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:18:19-1:18:19" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Ge 18:19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:22:11-1:22:12" data-bid="29-2" class="b"> 22:11, 12</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:9:7-16:9:8" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Ne 9:7, 8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:4:9-48:4:9" data-bid="30-2" class="b"> Ga 4:9</a>.</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">Selective foreknowledge means that God could choose <em>not</em> to foreknow indiscriminately all the future acts of his creatures. This would mean that, rather than all history from creation onward being a mere rerun of what had already been foreseen and foreordained, God could with all sincerity set before the first human pair the prospect of everlasting life in an earth free from wickedness. His instructions to his first human son and daughter to act as his perfect and sinless agents in filling the earth with their offspring and making it a paradise, as well as exercising control over the animal creation, could thus be expressed as the grant of a truly loving privilege and as his genuine desire toward them​—not merely as the giving of a commission that, on their part, was foredoomed to failure. God’s arranging for a test by means of “the tree of the knowledge of good and bad” and his creation of “the tree of life” in the garden of Eden also would <span id="page854" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="854" data-before-text="854"></span>not be meaningless or cynical acts, made so by his foreknowing that the human pair would sin and never be able to eat of “the tree of life.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:28-1:1:28" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Ge 1:28;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:2:7-1:2:9" data-bid="31-2" class="b"> 2:7-9,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:2:15-1:2:17" data-bid="31-3" class="b"> 15-17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:3:22-1:3:24" data-bid="31-4" class="b"> 3:22-24</a>.</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">To offer something very desirable to another person on conditions known beforehand to be unreachable is recognized as both hypocritical and cruel. The prospect of everlasting life is presented in God’s Word as a goal for all persons, one possible to attain. After urging his listeners to ‘keep on asking and seeking’ good things from God, Jesus pointed out that a father does not give a stone or a serpent to his child that asks for bread or a fish. Showing his Father’s view of disappointing the legitimate hopes of a person, Jesus then said: “Therefore, if you, although being wicked, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more so will your Father who is in the heavens give good things to those asking him?”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:7:7-40:7:11" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Mt 7:7-11</a>.</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">Thus, the invitations and opportunities to receive benefits and everlasting blessings set before all men by God are bona fide. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:21:22-40:21:22" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Mt 21:22;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:1:5-59:1:6" data-bid="33-2" class="b"> Jas 1:5, 6</a>) He can in all sincerity urge men to ‘turn back from transgression and keep living,’ as he did with the people of Israel. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:18:23-26:18:23" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Eze 18:23,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:18:30-26:18:32" data-bid="34-2" class="b"> 30-32</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:29:11-24:29:12" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Jer 29:11, 12</a>.) Logically, he could not do this if he foreknew that they were individually destined to die in wickedness. (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:17:30-44:17:31" data-bid="36-1" class="b">Ac 17:30, 31;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:2:3-54:2:4" data-bid="36-2" class="b"> 1Ti 2:3, 4</a>.) As Jehovah told Israel: “Nor said I to the seed of Jacob, ‘Seek me simply for nothing, you people.’ I am Jehovah, speaking what is righteous, telling what is upright. . . . Turn to me and be saved, all you at the ends of the earth.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:45:19-23:45:22" data-bid="37-1" class="b">Isa 45:19-22</a>.</p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">In a similar vein, the apostle Peter writes: “Jehovah is not slow respecting his promise [of the coming day of reckoning], as some people consider slowness, but he is patient with you because he does not desire any to be destroyed but desires all to attain to repentance.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:3:9-61:3:9" data-bid="38-1" class="b">2Pe 3:9</a>) If God already foreknew and foreordained millenniums in advance precisely which individuals would receive eternal salvation and which individuals would receive eternal destruction, it may well be asked how meaningful such ‘patience’ of God could be and how genuine his desire could be that ‘all attain to repentance.’ The inspired apostle John wrote that “God is love,” and the apostle Paul states that love “hopes all things.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:4:8-62:4:8" data-bid="39-1" class="b">1Jo 4:8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:13:4-46:13:4" data-bid="39-2" class="b"> 1Co 13:4,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:13:7-46:13:7" data-bid="39-3" class="b"> 7</a>) It is in harmony with this outstanding, divine quality that God should exercise a genuinely open, kindly attitude toward all persons, he being desirous of their gaining salvation, until they prove themselves unworthy, beyond hope. (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:3:9-61:3:9" data-bid="40-1" class="b">2Pe 3:9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:6:4-58:6:12" data-bid="40-2" class="b"> Heb 6:4-12</a>.)

<p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb">Finally if, by God’s foreknowledge, the opportunity to receive the benefits of Christ Jesus’ ransom sacrifice were already irrevocably sealed off from some, perhaps for millions of individuals, even before their birth, so that such ones could never prove worthy, it could not truly be said that the ransom was made available to all men.

<p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb"><strong>The Things Foreknown and Foreordained.</strong> Throughout the Bible record, God’s exercise of foreknowledge and foreordination is consistently tied in with his own purposes and will. “To purpose” means to set something before oneself as an aim or an object to be attained. (The Greek word <em>proʹthe·sis,</em> translated “purpose,” means, literally, “a placing or a setting forth or before [of something].”) Since God’s purposes are certain of accomplishment, he can foreknow the results, the ultimate realization of his purposes, and can foreordain them as well as the steps he may see fit to take to accomplish them. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:14:24-23:14:27" data-bid="46-1" class="b">Isa 14:24-27</a>) Thus, Jehovah is spoken of as ‘forming’ or ‘fashioning’ (from the Hebrew <em>ya·tsarʹ,</em> related to the word for “potter” [<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:18:4-24:18:4" data-bid="47-1" class="b">Jer 18:4</a>]) his purpose concerning future events or actions. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:19:25-12:19:25" data-bid="48-1" class="b">2Ki 19:25;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:46:11-23:46:11" data-bid="48-2" class="b"> Isa 46:11</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:45:9-23:45:13" data-bid="49-1" class="b">Isa 45:9-13,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:45:18-23:45:18" data-bid="49-2" class="b"> 18</a>.) As the Great Potter, God “operates all things according to the way his will counsels,” in harmony with his purpose (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:1:11-49:1:11" data-bid="50-1" class="b">Eph 1:11</a>), and “makes all his works cooperate together” for the good of those loving him. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:8:28-45:8:28" data-bid="51-1" class="b">Ro 8:28</a>) It is, therefore, specifically in connection with his own foreordained purposes that God tells “from the beginning the finale, and from long ago the things that have not been done.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:46:9-23:46:13" data-bid="52-1" class="b">Isa 46:9-13</a>.</p>
<p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sb">When God created the first human pair they were perfect, and God could look upon the result <span id="page855" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="855" data-before-text="855"></span>of all his creative work and find it “very good.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:26-1:1:26" data-bid="53-1" class="b">Ge 1:26,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:31-1:1:31" data-bid="53-2" class="b"> 31;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:32:4-5:32:4" data-bid="53-3" class="b"> De 32:4</a>) Instead of distrustfully concerning himself with what the human pair’s future actions would be, the record says that he “proceeded to rest.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:2:2-1:2:2" data-bid="54-1" class="b">Ge 2:2</a>) He could do so since, by virtue of his almightiness and his supreme wisdom, no future action, circumstance, or contingency could possibly present an insurmountable obstacle or an irremediable problem to block the realization of his sovereign purpose. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:20:6-14:20:6" data-bid="55-1" class="b">2Ch 20:6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:14:27-23:14:27" data-bid="55-2" class="b"> Isa 14:27;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:4:35-27:4:35" data-bid="55-3" class="b"> Da 4:35</a>) There is, therefore, no Scriptural basis for the argument of predestinarianism that for God to refrain from exercising his powers of foreknowledge in this way would jeopardize God’s purposes, making them “always liable to be broken through want of foresight, and [that] he must be continually putting his system to rights, as it gets out of order, through the contingence of the actions of moral agents.” Nor would this selective exercise of foresight give his creatures the power to “break [God’s] measures, make him continually to change his mind, subject him to vexation, and bring him into confusion,” as predestinarians claim. (M’Clintock and Strong’s <em>Cyclopædia,</em> 1894, Vol. VIII, p. 556) If even God’s earthly servants have no real need to be “anxious about the next day,” it follows that their Creator, to whom mighty nations are as “a drop from a bucket,” neither had nor has such anxiety.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:34-40:6:34" data-bid="56-1" class="b">Mt 6:34;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:40:15-23:40:15" data-bid="56-2" class="b"> Isa 40:15</a>.</p>
<p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="sb"><strong><em>Concerning classes of persons.</em></strong> Cases are also presented in which God did foreknow the course that certain <em>groups, nations,</em> or the <em>majority of mankind</em> would take, and thus he foretold the basic course of their future actions and foreordained what corresponding action he would take regarding them. However, such foreknowledge or foreordination does not deprive the individuals within such collective groups or divisions of mankind of exercising free choice as to the particular course they will follow. This can be seen from the following examples:</p>
<p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="sb">Prior to the Flood of Noah’s day, Jehovah announced his purpose to bring about this act of destruction, resulting in loss of human as well as animal life. The Biblical account shows, however, that such divine determination was made after the conditions developed that called for such action, including violence and other badness. Additionally, God, who is able to “know the heart of the sons of mankind,” made examination and found that “every inclination of the thoughts of [mankind’s] heart was only bad all the time.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:6:30-14:6:30" data-bid="57-1" class="b">2Ch 6:30;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:6:5-1:6:5" data-bid="57-2" class="b"> Ge 6:5</a>) Yet <em>individuals,</em> Noah and his family, gained God’s favor and escaped destruction.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:6:7-1:6:8" data-bid="58-1" class="b">Ge 6:7, 8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:7:1-1:7:1" data-bid="58-2" class="b"> 7:1</a>.</p>
<p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="sb">Similarly, although God gave the nation of Israel the opportunity to become “a kingdom of priests and a holy nation” by keeping his covenant, yet some 40 years later, when the nation was at the borders of the Promised Land, Jehovah foretold that they would break his covenant and, as a nation, would be forsaken by him. This foreknowledge was not without prior basis, however, as national insubordination and rebellion already had been revealed. Hence, God said: “For I well know their inclination that they are developing today before I bring them into the land about which I have sworn.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:19:6-2:19:6" data-bid="59-1" class="b">Ex 19:6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:31:16-5:31:18" data-bid="59-2" class="b"> De 31:16-18,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:31:21-5:31:21" data-bid="59-3" class="b"> 21;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:81:10-19:81:13" data-bid="59-4" class="b"> Ps 81:10-13</a>) The results to which such manifest inclination would now lead in the way of increased wickedness could be foreknown by God without its making him responsible for such conditions, even as one’s foreknowing that a certain structure built of inferior materials and with shoddy workmanship will deteriorate does not make that one responsible for such deterioration. The divine rule governs that ‘what is sown is what will be reaped.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:6:7-48:6:9" data-bid="60-1" class="b">Ga 6:7-9</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/28:10:12-28:10:13" data-bid="61-1" class="b">Ho 10:12, 13</a>.) Certain prophets delivered prophetic warnings of God’s foreordained expressions of judgment, all of which had basis in already existing conditions and heart attitudes. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:7:8-19:7:9" data-bid="62-1" class="b">Ps 7:8, 9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:11:19-20:11:19" data-bid="62-2" class="b"> Pr 11:19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:11:20-24:11:20" data-bid="62-3" class="b"> Jer 11:20</a>) Here again, however, individuals could and did respond to God’s counsel, reproof, and warnings and so merited his favor.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:21:8-24:21:9" data-bid="63-1" class="b">Jer 21:8, 9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:33:1-26:33:20" data-bid="63-2" class="b"> Eze 33:1-20</a>.</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:26:4-44:26:5" data-bid="66-1" class="b">Ac 26:4, 5</a>) Jesus predicted woes for unrepentant Jerusalem and other cities, but he did not indicate that his Father had foreordained that each individual of those cities should so suffer.

<p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="sb"><strong><em>Concerning individuals.</em></strong> In addition to foreknowledge concerning classes, certain individuals are specifically involved in divine forecasts. These include Esau and Jacob (mentioned earlier), the Pharaoh of the Exodus, Samson, Solomon, Josiah, Jeremiah, Cyrus, John the Baptizer, Judas Iscariot, and God’s own Son Jesus.</p>
<p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="sb">In the cases of Samson, Jeremiah, and John the Baptizer, Jehovah exercised foreknowledge prior to their birth. This foreknowledge, however, did not specify what their final destiny would be. Rather, on the basis of such foreknowledge, Jehovah foreordained that Samson should live according to the Nazirite vow and should initiate the deliverance of Israel from the Philistines, that Jeremiah should serve as a prophet, and that John the Baptizer should do a preparatory work as a forerunner of the Messiah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:13:3-7:13:5" data-bid="71-1" class="b">Jg 13:3-5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:1:5-24:1:5" data-bid="71-2" class="b"> Jer 1:5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:1:13-42:1:17" data-bid="71-3" class="b"> Lu 1:13-17</a>) While highly favored by such privileges, this did not guarantee their gaining eternal salvation or even that they would remain faithful until death (although all three did). Thus, Jehovah foretold that one of David’s many sons would be named Solomon and he foreordained that Solomon would be used to build the temple. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:7:12-10:7:13" data-bid="72-1" class="b">2Sa 7:12, 13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:6:12-11:6:12" data-bid="72-2" class="b"> 1Ki 6:12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:22:6-13:22:19" data-bid="72-3" class="b"> 1Ch 22:6-19</a>) However, though favored in this way and even privileged to write certain books of the Holy Scriptures, Solomon nevertheless fell into apostasy in his later years.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:11:4-11:11:4" data-bid="73-1" class="b">1Ki 11:4,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:11:9-11:11:11" data-bid="73-2" class="b"> 9-11</a>.</p>
<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="sb">Likewise with Esau and Jacob, God’s foreknowledge did not fix their eternal destinies but, rather, determined, or foreordained, which of the national groups descending from the two sons would gain a dominant position over the other. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:25:23-1:25:26" data-bid="74-1" class="b">Ge 25:23-26</a>) This foreseen dominance also pointed to the gaining of the right of the firstborn by Jacob, a right that brought along with it the privilege of being in the line of descent through which the Abrahamic “seed” would come. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:27:29-1:27:29" data-bid="75-1" class="b">Ge 27:29;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:28:13-1:28:14" data-bid="75-2" class="b"> 28:13, 14</a>) By this means Jehovah God made clear that his choice of individuals for certain uses is not bound by the usual customs or procedures conforming to men’s expectations. Nor are divinely assigned privileges to be dispensed solely on the basis of works, which might allow a person to feel he has ‘earned the right’ to such privileges and that they are ‘owed to him.’ The apostle Paul stressed this point in showing why God, by undeserved kindness, could grant to the Gentile nations privileges once seemingly reserved for Israel.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:9:1-45:9:6" data-bid="76-1" class="b">Ro 9:1-6,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:9:10-45:9:13" data-bid="76-2" class="b"> 10-13,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:9:30-45:9:32" data-bid="76-3" class="b"> 30-32</a>.</p>
<p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="sb">Paul’s quotations concerning Jehovah’s ‘love for Jacob [Israel] and his hatred for Esau [Edom]’ comes from <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/39:1:2-39:1:3" data-bid="77-1" class="b">Malachi 1:2, 3</a>, written long after Jacob and Esau’s time. So the Bible does not necessarily say that Jehovah held such opinion of the twins before their birth. It is a scientifically established fact that much of a child’s general disposition and temperament is determined at the time of conception because of the genetic factors contributed by each parent. That God can see such factors is self-evident; David speaks of Jehovah as seeing “even the embryo of me.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:139:14-19:139:16" data-bid="78-1" class="b">Ps 139:14-16</a>; see also <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:11:5-21:11:5" data-bid="79-1" class="b">Ec 11:5</a>.) To what extent such divine insight affected Jehovah’s foreordination concerning the two boys cannot be said, but at any rate, his choice of Jacob over Esau did not of itself doom Esau or his descendants, the Edomites, to destruction. Even individuals from among the accursed Canaanites gained the privilege of association with God’s covenant people and received blessings. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:9:25-1:9:27" data-bid="80-1" class="b">Ge 9:25-27;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:9:27-6:9:27" data-bid="80-2" class="b"> Jos 9:27</a>; see <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200000874/">CANAAN, CANAANITE</a> No. 2.) The “change of mind” that Esau earnestly sought with tears, however, was only an unsuccessful attempt to change his father Isaac’s decision that the firstborn’s special blessing should remain entirely with Jacob. Hence, this indicated no repentance before God on Esau’s part as to his materialistic attitude.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:27:32-1:27:34" data-bid="81-1" class="b">Ge 27:32-34;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:12:16-58:12:17" data-bid="81-2" class="b"> Heb 12:16, 17</a>.</p>
<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="sb">Jehovah’s prophecy concerning Josiah called for some descendant of David to be so named, and it foretold his acting against false worship in the city of Bethel. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:13:1-11:13:2" data-bid="82-1" class="b">1Ki 13:1, 2</a>) Over three centuries later a king so named fulfilled this prophecy.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:35:20-14:35:24" data-bid="84-1" class="b">2Ch 35:20-24</a>) Hence, while foreknown by God and foreordained to do a particular work, Josiah was still a free moral agent able to choose to heed or disregard advice.</p>
<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="sb">Similarly, Jehovah foretold nearly two centuries beforehand that he would use a conqueror named Cyrus to effect the release of the Jews from Babylon. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:44:26-23:44:28" data-bid="85-1" class="b">Isa 44:26-28;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:45:1-23:45:6" data-bid="85-2" class="b"> 45:1-6</a>) But the Persian to whom that name eventually was given in fulfillment of divine prophecy is not stated in the Bible to have become a genuine worshiper of Jehovah, and secular history shows him continuing his worship of false gods.</p>
<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="sb">These cases of foreknowledge prior to the individual’s birth thus do not conflict with God’s revealed <span id="page857" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="857" data-before-text="857"></span>qualities and announced standards. Nor is there any indication that God coerced the individuals to act against their own will. In the cases of Pharaoh, Judas Iscariot, and God’s own Son, there is no evidence that Jehovah’s foreknowledge was exercised prior to the person’s coming into existence. Within these individual cases certain principles are illustrated, bearing on God’s foreknowledge and foreordination.</p>
<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="sb">One such principle is God’s testing of individuals by causing or allowing certain circumstances or events, or by causing such individuals to hear his inspired messages, the result being that they are obliged to exercise their free choice to make a decision and thus reveal a definite heart attitude, read by Jehovah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:15:11-20:15:11" data-bid="86-1" class="b">Pr 15:11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:1:6-60:1:7" data-bid="86-2" class="b"> 1Pe 1:6, 7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:4:12-58:4:13" data-bid="86-3" class="b"> Heb 4:12, 13</a>) According to the way the individuals respond, God can also mold them in the course they have selected of their own volition.

<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="sb">The case of faithful Abraham, already discussed, illustrates these principles. A contrasting case is that of the unresponsive Pharaoh of the Exodus. Jehovah foreknew that Pharaoh would refuse permission for the Israelites to leave “except by a strong hand” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:3:19-2:3:20" data-bid="91-1" class="b">Ex 3:19, 20</a>), and he foreordained the plague resulting in the death of the firstborn. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:4:22-2:4:23" data-bid="92-1" class="b">Ex 4:22, 23</a>) The apostle Paul’s discussion of God’s dealings with Pharaoh is often incorrectly understood to mean that God arbitrarily hardens the heart of individuals according to his foreordained purpose, without regard for the individual’s prior inclination, or heart attitude. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:9:14-45:9:18" data-bid="93-1" class="b">Ro 9:14-18</a>) Likewise, according to many translations, God advised Moses that he would “harden [Pharaoh’s] heart.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:4:21-2:4:21" data-bid="94-1" class="b">Ex 4:21</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:9:12-2:9:12" data-bid="95-1" class="b">Ex 9:12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:10:1-2:10:1" data-bid="95-2" class="b"> 10:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:10:27-2:10:27" data-bid="95-3" class="b"> 27</a>.) However, some translations render the Hebrew account to read that Jehovah “let [Pharaoh’s] heart wax bold” (<em>Ro</em>); “let [Pharaoh’s] heart become obstinate.” (<em>NW</em>) In support of such rendering, the appendix to Rotherham’s translation shows that in Hebrew the <em>occasion</em> or <em>permission</em> of an event is often presented as if it were the <em>cause</em> of the event, and that “even <em>positive commands</em> are occasionally to be accepted as meaning no more than <em>permission.”</em> Thus at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:1:17-2:1:17" data-bid="96-1" class="b">Exodus 1:17</a> the original Hebrew text literally says that the midwives “caused the male children to live,” whereas in reality they <em>permitted</em> them to live by refraining from putting them to death. After quoting Hebrew scholars M. M. Kalisch, H. F. W. Gesenius, and B. Davies in support, Rotherham states that the Hebrew sense of the texts involving Pharaoh is that “God permitted Pharaoh to harden his own heart​—spared him—​gave him the opportunity, the occasion, of working out the wickedness that was in him. That is all.”​—<em>The Emphasised Bible,</em> appendix, p. 919; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:10:5-23:10:7" data-bid="97-1" class="b">Isa 10:5-7</a>.</p>

<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="sb">The traitorous course of Judas Iscariot fulfilled divine prophecy and demonstrated Jehovah’s foreknowledge as well as that of his Son. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:41:9-19:41:9" data-bid="102-1" class="b">Ps 41:9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:55:12-19:55:13" data-bid="102-2" class="b"> 55:12, 13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:109:8-19:109:8" data-bid="102-3" class="b"> 109:8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:1:16-44:1:20" data-bid="102-4" class="b"> Ac 1:16-20</a>) Yet it cannot be said that God foreordained or predestinated Judas himself to such a course. The prophecies foretold that some intimate acquaintance of Jesus would be his betrayer, but they did not specify which of those sharing such acquaintance it would be. Again, Bible principles rule against God’s having foreordained Judas’ actions. The divine standard stated by the apostle is: “Never lay your hands hastily upon any man; neither be a sharer in the sins of others; preserve yourself chaste.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:5:22-54:5:22" data-bid="103-1" class="b">1Ti 5:22</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:3:6-54:3:6" data-bid="104-1" class="b">3:6</a>.) Evidencing his <span id="page858" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="858" data-before-text="858"></span>concern that the selection of his 12 apostles be wisely and properly made, Jesus spent the night in prayer to his Father before making known his decision.

<p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="sb">Thus, it seems evident that at the time of his being selected as an apostle, Judas’ heart presented no definite evidence of a treasonous attitude. He allowed a ‘poisonous root to spring up’ and defile him, resulting in his deviation and in his accepting, not God’s direction, but the Devil’s leading in a course of thievery and treachery.

<p id="p56" data-pid="56" class="sb"><strong>Fatalism and Predestinarianism.</strong> Among the pagan peoples of ancient times, including the Greeks and Romans, one’s fate, particularly the length of the individual’s life, was often considered to be determined beforehand for all individuals by the gods. Grecian mythology represented the control of men’s destiny by three goddesses: <em>Clotho</em> (spinner), who spun the thread of life; <em>Lachesis</em> (disposer of lots), who determined the length of life; and <em>Atropos</em> (inflexible), who cut life off when the time expired. A similar triad was found among the Roman deities.</p>
<p id="p57" data-pid="57" class="sb">According to Jewish historian Josephus (first century C.E.), the Pharisees endeavored to harmonize the idea of fate with their belief in God and with the free moral agency granted to man. (<em>The Jewish War,</em> II, 162, 163 [viii, 14]; <em>Jewish Antiquities,</em> XVIII, 13, 14 [i, 3]) <em>The New Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge</em> says: “Previous to Augustine [of the fourth and fifth centuries C.E.] there was no serious development in Christianity of a theory of predestination.” <span id="page860" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="860" data-before-text="860"></span>Before Augustine, earlier so-called “Church Fathers” such as Justin, Origen, and Irenaeus “know nothing of unconditional predestination; they teach free will.” (Hastings’ <em>Encyclopædia of Religion and Ethics,</em> 1919, Vol. X, p. 231) In their refutation of Gnosticism, they are described as regularly expressing their belief in the free moral agency of man as “the distinguishing characteristic of human personality, the basis of moral responsibility, a divine gift whereby man might choose that which was well-pleasing to God,” and as speaking of “the autonomy of man and the counsel of God who constraineth not.”​—<em>The New Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge,</em> edited by S. Jackson, 1957, Vol. IX, pp. 192, 193.</p>

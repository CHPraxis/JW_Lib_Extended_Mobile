MEUNIM
(Me·uʹnim).
On the basis of the name, the Meunim are considered to have been an Arabian people residing in and around Maʽan, a city about 32 km (20 mi) ESE of Petra.
Judean King Uzziah (829-778 B.C.E.), with Jehovah’s help, successfully warred against the Meunim. (2Ch 26:1, 7) Perhaps at that time some of the Meunim captives were constituted temple slaves, and therefore, their descendants are later listed among the Nethinim returning from Babylonian exile.​—Ezr 2:1, 2, 43, 50; Ne 7:52; compare Ps 68:18.
During Hezekiah’s reign (745-717 B.C.E.) a band of Simeonites struck down the tent-dwelling Meunim in the vicinity of Gedor.​—1Ch 4:24, 39-41; see AMMONIM.

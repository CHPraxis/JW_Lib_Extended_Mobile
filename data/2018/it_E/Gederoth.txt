GEDEROTH
(Ge·deʹroth) [Stone Pens].
A city in the Shephelah assigned to Judah (Jos 15:20, 33, 41) and one of the places taken by the Philistines during the reign of King Ahaz (761-746 B.C.E.). (2Ch 28:18, 19) Some geographers locate Gederoth at Qatra, an abandoned village on a mound within modern Gedera, about 13 km (8 mi) ENE of Ashdod, though others say this is too far W to be in the Shephelah.

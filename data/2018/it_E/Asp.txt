ASP
[Gr., a·spisʹ].
A name popularly used today for several unrelated poisonous snakes.
The word “asps” appears once in the Holy Bible, at Romans 3:13, where the apostle Paul, speaking of sinners, says: “Poison of asps is behind their lips.” Here the apostle is quoting from Psalm 140:3: “The venom of the horned viper is under their lips.” Therefore, the asps referred to at Romans 3:13 must be horned vipers.​—See VIPER, HORNED.

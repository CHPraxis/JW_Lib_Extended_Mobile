BILEAM
(Bilʹe·am) [possibly, One Swallowing Down].
A town assigned to the Levites of the family of Kohath, given to them from the territory of the half tribe of Manasseh located W of the Jordan River. (1Ch 6:70; LXX, “Ieblaam”) The listing of Levite cities at Joshua 21:11-39 does not include Bileam, but many scholars believe that a scribal error caused Gath-rimmon to be repeated in verse 25 in place of Bileam. Bileam appears to be a variant spelling of Ibleam, this latter form being more frequently used.

HAURAN
(Ha·u·ranʹ) [Grown Pale].
A boundary site in Ezekiel’s vision of Israel’s inheritance. (Eze 47:13, 15, 16, 18) According to some scholars it embraced approximately the same area earlier covered by the term “Bashan.” (See BASHAN.) Hauran is apparently the district referred to in ancient Egyptian texts (Huruna) and Assyrian documents of Shalmaneser III (Hauranu). It also appears to correspond to the smaller region called Auranitis in Greco-Roman times. The name Hauran is applied today to the rolling prairie of rich, red soil between Damascus and the Yarmuk.

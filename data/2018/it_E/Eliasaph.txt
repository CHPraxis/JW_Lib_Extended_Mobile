ELIASAPH
(E·liʹa·saph) [God Has Added (Increased)].
1. Son of Deuel (or Reuel) of the tribe of Gad; one of the 12 chieftains whom Jehovah selected to assist Moses and Aaron in taking the sum of the males for the army. (Nu 1:1-4, 14; 2:14) Eliasaph was over the army of his tribe, which was a part of the three-tribe division of the camp of Reuben. (Nu 2:10-15; 10:18-20) Besides sharing in the group presentation made by the chieftains after the setting up of the tabernacle, Eliasaph thereafter presented his own offering on the sixth day for the inauguration of the altar.​—Nu 7:1, 2, 10, 42-47.
2. Son of Lael and chieftain of the paternal house of the Gershonites. Under the direction of Eliasaph, the Gershonites transported the tent coverings and the screen of the tabernacle entrance, the screen of the courtyard entrance and the hangings of the courtyard as well as the tent cords.​—Nu 3:21-26.

AMMAH
(Amʹmah) [possibly, Cubit].
A hill “in front of Giah on the way to the wilderness of Gibeon.” Here Abner, Saul’s former chief of the army and now fighting for Saul’s son and heir, Ish-bosheth, made his last stand against the pursuing forces of Joab and Abishai, after they had defeated Abner in the battle at the Pool of Gibeon. At this hill Abner persuaded Joab to stop pursuing him, and the battle ended. (2Sa 2:12-32) While Ammah probably lay to the E of Gibeon, it is not known exactly which of the hills of this region bore this name.

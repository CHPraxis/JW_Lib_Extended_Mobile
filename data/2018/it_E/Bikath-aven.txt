BIKATH-AVEN
(Bikʹath-aʹven) [Valley Plain of Hurtfulness (Something Hurtful)].
A place or valley plain associated with Damascus and Beth-eden in Jehovah’s prophecy through Amos foretelling the exile of the people of Syria. (Am 1:5) In the absence of any record of a Syrian city or town by that name, some scholars connect Bikath-aven with the Beqaʽ Valley between the Lebanon and the Anti-Lebanon mountains. The predicted cutting-off of the inhabitants of Bikath-aven evidently came about as a result of Assyrian King Tiglath-pileser III’s conquest of Syria.​—2Ki 16:9, 10.

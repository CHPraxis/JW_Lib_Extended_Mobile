<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">The Greek <em>pneuʹma</em> (spirit) comes from <em>pneʹo,</em> meaning “breathe or blow,” and the Hebrew <em>ruʹach</em> (spirit) is believed to come from a root having the same meaning. <em>Ruʹach</em> and <em>pneuʹma,</em> then, basically mean “breath” but have extended meanings beyond that basic sense. (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/35:2:19-35:2:19" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Hab 2:19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:13:15-66:13:15" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Re 13:15</a>.) They can also mean <em>wind;</em> the <em>vital force</em> in living creatures; <em>one’s spirit; spirit persons,</em> including God and his angelic creatures; and <em>God’s active force,</em> or <em>holy spirit.</em> (Compare Koehler and Baumgartner’s <em>Lexicon in Veteris Testamenti Libros,</em> Leiden, 1958, pp. 877-879; Brown, Driver, and Briggs’ <em>Hebrew and English Lexicon of the Old Testament,</em> 1980, pp. 924-926; <em>Theological Dictionary of the New Testament,</em> edited by G. Friedrich, translated by G. Bromiley, 1971, Vol. VI, pp. 332-451.) All these meanings have something in common: They all refer to that which is invisible to human sight and which gives evidence of force in motion. Such invisible force is capable of producing visible effects.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Another Hebrew word, <em>nesha·mahʹ</em> (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:2:7-1:2:7" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ge 2:7</a>), also means “breath,” but it is more limited in range of meaning than <em>ruʹach.</em> The Greek <em>pno·eʹ</em> seems to have a similar limited sense (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:17:25-44:17:25" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ac 17:25</a>) and was used by the <em>Septuagint</em> translators to render <em>nesha·mahʹ.</em></p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><strong>Wind.</strong> Consider first the sense that is perhaps easiest to grasp. The context in many cases shows <em>ruʹach</em> to mean “wind,” as the “east wind” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:10:13-2:10:13" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ex 10:13</a>), “the four winds.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/38:2:6-38:2:6" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Zec 2:6</a>) The mention of such things as clouds, storm, the blowing of chaff or things of similar nature appearing in the context often makes evident this sense. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:11:31-4:11:31" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Nu 11:31;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:18:45-11:18:45" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 1Ki 18:45;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:19:11-11:19:11" data-bid="6-3" class="b"> 19:11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:21:18-18:21:18" data-bid="6-4" class="b"> Job 21:18</a>) Because the four winds are used to mean the four directions​—east, west, north, and south—​<em>ruʹach</em> at times may be <span id="page1018" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="1018" data-before-text="1018"></span>rendered as ‘direction’ or ‘side.’​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:9:24-13:9:24" data-bid="7-1" class="b">1Ch 9:24;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:49:36-24:49:36" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> Jer 49:36;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:52:23-24:52:23" data-bid="7-3" class="b"> 52:23;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:42:16-26:42:20" data-bid="7-4" class="b"> Eze 42:16-20</a>.</p>

Thus the thought of an <em>invisible force</em> is present, the basic characteristic of the Hebrew <em>ruʹach.</em></p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Evidently the only case in the Christian Greek Scriptures in which <em>pneuʹma</em> is used in the sense of “wind” is at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:3:8-43:3:8" data-bid="9-1" class="b">John 3:8</a>.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Man cannot exercise control over the wind; he cannot guide, direct, restrain, or possess it. Because of this, “wind [<em>ruʹach</em>]” frequently stands for that which is uncontrollable or unattainable by man​—elusive, transitory, in vain, of no genuine benefit.

<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">This does not mean that God is an impersonal, bodiless force like the wind. The Scriptures unmistakably testify to his personality; he also has location so that Christ could speak of ‘going to his Father,’ this in order that he might “appear before the person of God [literally, “face of God”] for us.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:16:28-43:16:28" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Joh 16:28;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:9:24-58:9:24" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> Heb 9:24</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:8:43-11:8:43" data-bid="16-1" class="b">1Ki 8:43;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:11:4-19:11:4" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> Ps 11:4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:113:5-19:113:6" data-bid="16-3" class="b"> 113:5, 6</a>; see <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200002391/">JEHOVAH</a> (The Person Identified by the Name).</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">The expression “my spirit” (<em>ru·chiʹ</em>) used by God at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:6:3-1:6:3" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Genesis 6:3</a> may mean “I the Spirit,” even as his use of “my soul” (<em>naph·shiʹ</em>) has the sense of “I the person,” or “my person.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:1:14-23:1:14" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Isa 1:14</a>; see <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200004192/">SOUL</a> [God as Having Soul].) He thereby contrasts his heavenly spiritual position with that of earthly, fleshly man.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb"><strong><em>God’s Son.</em></strong> God’s “only-begotten son,” the Word, was a spirit person like his Father, hence “existing in God’s form” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:2:5-50:2:8" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Php 2:5-8</a>), but later “became flesh,” residing among mankind as the man Jesus.

(<em>RS, JP, AT, JB</em>) Such translation of the Hebrew text is not inadmissible (compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:148:8-19:148:8" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Ps 148:8</a>); however, the apostle Paul’s quotation of the text (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:1:7-58:1:7" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Heb 1:7</a>) coincides with that of the Greek <em>Septuagint</em> and harmonizes with the rendering first given. (In the Greek text of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:1:7-58:1:7" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Hebrews 1:7</a>, the definite article [<em>tous</em>] is used before “angels,” not before “spirits [<em>pneuʹma·ta</em>],” making the angels the subject being discussed.) <em>Barnes’ Notes on the New Testament</em> (1974) says: “It is to be presumed that [Paul], who had been trained in the knowledge of the Hebrew language, would have had a better opportunity of knowing its [referring to <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:104:4-19:104:4" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Psalm 104:4</a>] fair construction than we can; and it is morally certain, that he would employ the passage <em>in an argument</em> as it was commonly understood by those to whom he wrote​—that is, to those who were familiar with the Hebrew language and literature.”​—Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:1:14-58:1:14" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Heb 1:14</a>.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">God’s angels, though capable of materializing human form and appearing to men, are not by nature material or fleshly, hence are invisible. They are actively alive and able to exert great force, and the terms <em>ruʹach</em> and <em>pneuʹma</em> therefore aptly describe them.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:6:12-49:6:12" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Ephesians 6:12</a> speaks of Christians wrestling, “not against blood and flesh, but against the governments, against the authorities, against the world rulers of this darkness, against the wicked spirit forces in the heavenly places.” The latter part of the text in Greek literally reads: “Toward the spiritual (things) [Gr., <em>pneu·ma·ti·kaʹ</em>] of the wickedness in the heavenly [places].” Most modern translations recognize that the reference here is not simply to something abstract, “spiritual wickedness” (<em>KJ</em>), but refers to wickedness carried out by spirit <em>persons.</em> Thus, we have such renderings as: “the spirit-forces of evil on high” (<em>AT</em>), <span id="page1019" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="1019" data-before-text="1019"></span>“the spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places” (<em>RS</em>), “the spiritual army of evil in the heavens” (<em>JB</em>), “the superhuman forces of evil in the heavens” (<em>NE</em>).</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb"><strong>God’s Active Force; Holy Spirit.</strong> By far the majority of occurrences of <em>ruʹach</em> and <em>pneuʹma</em> relate to God’s spirit, his active force, his holy spirit.</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb"><strong><em>Not a person.</em></strong> Not until the fourth century C.E. did the teaching that the holy spirit was a person and part of the “Godhead” become official church dogma. Early church “fathers” did not so teach; Justin Martyr of the second century C.E. taught that the holy spirit was an ‘influence or mode of operation of the Deity’; Hippolytus likewise ascribed no personality to the holy spirit. The Scriptures themselves unite to show that God’s holy spirit is not a person but is God’s <em>active force</em> by which he accomplishes his purpose and executes his will.</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">It may first be noted that the words “in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one” (<em>KJ</em>) found in older translations at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:5:7-62:5:7" data-bid="34-1" class="b">1 John 5:7</a> are actually spurious additions to the original text. A footnote in <em>The Jerusalem Bible,</em> a Catholic translation, says that these words are “not in any of the early Greek MSS [manuscripts], or any of the early translations, or in the best MSS of the Vulg[ate] itself.” <em>A Textual Commentary on the Greek New Testament,</em> by Bruce Metzger (1975, pp. 716-718), traces in detail the history of the spurious passage. It states that the passage is first found in a treatise entitled <em>Liber Apologeticus,</em> of the fourth century, and that it appears in Old Latin and Vulgate manuscripts of the Scriptures, beginning in the sixth century. Modern translations as a whole, both Catholic and Protestant, do not include them in the main body of the text, because of recognizing their spurious nature.​—<em>RS, NE, NAB.</em></p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb"><strong><em>Personification does not prove personality.</em></strong> It is true that Jesus spoke of the holy spirit as a “helper” and spoke of such helper as ‘teaching,’ ‘bearing witness,’ ‘giving evidence,’ ‘guiding,’ ‘speaking,’ ‘hearing,’ and ‘receiving.’ In so doing, the original Greek shows Jesus at times applying the masculine personal pronoun to that “helper” (paraclete). (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:14:16-43:14:17" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Joh 14:16, 17,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:14:26-43:14:26" data-bid="35-2" class="b"> 26;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:15:26-43:15:26" data-bid="35-3" class="b"> 15:26;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:16:7-43:16:15" data-bid="35-4" class="b"> 16:7-15</a>.) However, it is not unusual in the Scriptures for something that is not actually a person to be personalized or personified. Wisdom is personified in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:1:20-20:1:33" data-bid="36-1" class="b">the book of Proverbs (1:20-33;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:8:1-20:8:36" data-bid="36-2" class="b"> 8:1-36</a>); and feminine pronominal forms are used of it in the original Hebrew, as also in many English translations. (<em>KJ, RS, JP, AT</em>) Wisdom is also personified at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:11:19-40:11:19" data-bid="37-1" class="b">Matthew 11:19</a> and <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:7:35-42:7:35" data-bid="38-1" class="b">Luke 7:35</a>, where it is depicted as having both “works” and “children.” The apostle Paul personalized sin and death and also undeserved kindness as “kings.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:5:14-45:5:14" data-bid="39-1" class="b">Ro 5:14,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:5:17-45:5:17" data-bid="39-2" class="b"> 17,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:5:21-45:5:21" data-bid="39-3" class="b"> 21;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:6:12-45:6:12" data-bid="39-4" class="b"> 6:12</a>) He speaks of sin as “receiving an inducement,” ‘working out covetousness,’ ‘seducing,’ and ‘killing.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:7:8-45:7:11" data-bid="40-1" class="b">Ro 7:8-11</a>) Yet it is obvious that Paul did not mean that sin was actually a person.</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">So, likewise with John’s account of Jesus’ words regarding the holy spirit, his remarks must be taken in context. Jesus personalized the holy spirit when speaking of that spirit as a “helper” (which in Greek is the masculine substantive <em>pa·raʹkle·tos</em>). Properly, therefore, John presents Jesus’ words as referring to that “helper” aspect of the spirit with masculine personal pronouns. On the other hand, in the same context, when the Greek <em>pneuʹma</em> is used, John employs a neuter pronoun to refer to the holy spirit, <em>pneuʹma</em> itself being neuter. Hence, we have in John’s use of the masculine personal pronoun in association with <em>pa·raʹkle·tos</em> an example of conformity to grammatical rules, not an expression of doctrine.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:14:16-43:14:17" data-bid="41-1" class="b">Joh 14:16, 17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:16:7-43:16:8" data-bid="41-2" class="b"> 16:7, 8</a>.</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb"><strong><em>Lacks personal identification.</em></strong> Since God himself is a Spirit and is holy and since all his faithful angelic sons are spirits and are holy, it is evident that if the “holy spirit” were a person, there should reasonably be given some means in the Scriptures to distinguish and identify such spirit <em>person</em> from all these other ‘holy spirits.’ It would be expected that, at the very least, the definite article would be used with it in all cases where it is not called “God’s holy spirit” or is not modified by some similar expression. This would at least distinguish it as THE Holy Spirit. But, on the contrary, in a large number of cases the expression “holy spirit” appears in the original Greek without the article, thus indicating its lack of personality.​—Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:6:3-44:6:3" data-bid="42-1" class="b">Ac 6:3,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:6:5-44:6:5" data-bid="42-2" class="b"> 5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:7:55-44:7:55" data-bid="42-3" class="b"> 7:55;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:8:15-44:8:15" data-bid="42-4" class="b"> 8:15,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:8:17-44:8:17" data-bid="42-5" class="b"> 17,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:8:19-44:8:19" data-bid="42-6" class="b"> 19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:9:17-44:9:17" data-bid="42-7" class="b"> 9:17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:11:24-44:11:24" data-bid="42-8" class="b"> 11:24;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:13:9-44:13:9" data-bid="42-9" class="b"> 13:9,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:13:52-44:13:52" data-bid="42-10" class="b"> 52;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:19:2-44:19:2" data-bid="42-11" class="b"> 19:2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:9:1-45:9:1" data-bid="42-12" class="b"> Ro 9:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:14:17-45:14:17" data-bid="42-13" class="b"> 14:17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:15:13-45:15:13" data-bid="42-14" class="b"> 15:13,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:15:16-45:15:16" data-bid="42-15" class="b"> 16,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:15:19-45:15:19" data-bid="42-16" class="b"> 19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:12:3-46:12:3" data-bid="42-17" class="b"> 1Co 12:3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:2:4-58:2:4" data-bid="42-18" class="b"> Heb 2:4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:6:4-58:6:4" data-bid="42-19" class="b"> 6:4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:1:21-61:1:21" data-bid="42-20" class="b"> 2Pe 1:21;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/65:1:20-65:1:20" data-bid="42-21" class="b"> Jude 20</a>, <em>Int</em> and other interlinear translations.</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb"><strong><em>How baptized in its “name.”</em></strong> At <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:28:19-40:28:19" data-bid="43-1" class="b">Matthew 28:19</a> reference is made to “the name of the Father and of the Son and of the holy spirit.” A “name” can mean something other than a personal name. When, in English, we say, “in the name of the law,” or “in the name of common sense,” we have no reference to a person as such. By “name” in these expressions we mean ‘what the law stands for or its authority’ and ‘what common sense represents or calls for.’ The Greek term for “name” (<em>oʹno·ma</em>) also can have this sense. Thus, while some translations (<em>KJ, AS</em>) follow the Greek text <span id="page1020" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="1020" data-before-text="1020"></span>at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:10:41-40:10:41" data-bid="44-1" class="b">Matthew 10:41</a> literally and say that the one that “receiveth a prophet <em>in the name of</em> a prophet, shall receive a prophet’s reward; and he that receiveth a righteous man <em>in the name of</em> a righteous man, shall receive a righteous man’s reward,” more modern translations say, “receives a prophet <em>because he is</em> a prophet” and “receives a righteous man <em>because he is</em> a righteous man,” or similar. (<em>RS, AT, JB, NW</em>) Thus, Robertson’s <em>Word Pictures in the New Testament</em> (1930, Vol. I, p. 245) says on <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:28:19-40:28:19" data-bid="45-1" class="b">Matthew 28:19</a>: “The use of name (<em>onoma</em>) here is a common one in the Septuagint and the papyri for power or authority.” Hence baptism ‘in the name of the holy spirit’ implies recognition of that spirit as having its source in God and as exercising its function according to the divine will.</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb"><strong><em>Other evidence of its impersonal nature.</em></strong> Further evidence against the idea of personality as regards the holy spirit is the way it is used in association with other impersonal things, such as water and fire (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:3:11-40:3:11" data-bid="46-1" class="b">Mt 3:11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:1:8-41:1:8" data-bid="46-2" class="b"> Mr 1:8</a>); and Christians are spoken of as being baptized “in holy spirit.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:1:5-44:1:5" data-bid="47-1" class="b">Ac 1:5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:11:16-44:11:16" data-bid="47-2" class="b"> 11:16</a>) Persons are urged to become “filled with spirit” instead of with wine. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:5:18-49:5:18" data-bid="48-1" class="b">Eph 5:18</a>) So, too, persons are spoken of as being ‘filled’ with it along with such qualities as wisdom and faith (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:6:3-44:6:3" data-bid="49-1" class="b">Ac 6:3,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:6:5-44:6:5" data-bid="49-2" class="b"> 5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:11:24-44:11:24" data-bid="49-3" class="b"> 11:24</a>) or joy (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:13:52-44:13:52" data-bid="50-1" class="b">Ac 13:52</a>); and holy spirit is inserted, or sandwiched in, with a number of such qualities at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:6:6-47:6:6" data-bid="51-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 6:6</a>. It is most unlikely that such expressions would be made if the holy spirit were a divine person. As to the spirit’s ‘bearing witness’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:5:32-44:5:32" data-bid="52-1" class="b">Ac 5:32;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:20:23-44:20:23" data-bid="52-2" class="b"> 20:23</a>), it may be noted that the same thing is said of the water and the blood at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:5:6-62:5:8" data-bid="53-1" class="b">1 John 5:6-8</a>. While some texts refer to the spirit as ‘witnessing,’ ‘speaking,’ or ‘saying’ things, other texts make clear that it spoke through persons, having no personal voice of its own. (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:3:7-58:3:7" data-bid="54-1" class="b">Heb 3:7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:10:15-58:10:17" data-bid="54-2" class="b"> 10:15-17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:95:7-19:95:7" data-bid="54-3" class="b"> Ps 95:7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:31:33-24:31:34" data-bid="54-4" class="b"> Jer 31:33, 34;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:19:2-44:19:6" data-bid="54-5" class="b"> Ac 19:2-6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:21:4-44:21:4" data-bid="54-6" class="b"> 21:4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:28:25-44:28:25" data-bid="54-7" class="b"> 28:25</a>.) It may thus be compared to radio waves that can transmit a message from a person speaking into a microphone and cause his voice to be heard by persons a distance away, in effect, ‘speaking’ the message by a radio loudspeaker. God, by his spirit, transmits his messages and communicates his will to the minds and hearts of his servants on earth, who, in turn, may convey that message to yet others.</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb"><strong><em>Distinguished from “power.”</em></strong><em> Ruʹach</em> and <em>pneuʹma,</em> therefore, when used with reference to God’s holy spirit, refer to God’s invisible active force by which he accomplishes his divine purpose and will. It is “holy” because it is from Him, not of an earthly source, and is free from all corruption as “the spirit of holiness.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:1:4-45:1:4" data-bid="55-1" class="b">Ro 1:4</a>) It is not Jehovah’s “power,” for this English word more correctly translates other terms in the original languages (Heb., <em>koʹach;</em> Gr., <em>dyʹna·mis</em>)<em>. Ruʹach</em> and <em>pneuʹma</em> are used in close association or even in parallel with these terms signifying “power,” which shows that there is an inherent connection between them and yet a definite distinction. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/33:3:8-33:3:8" data-bid="56-1" class="b">Mic 3:8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/38:4:6-38:4:6" data-bid="56-2" class="b"> Zec 4:6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:1:17-42:1:17" data-bid="56-3" class="b"> Lu 1:17,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:1:35-42:1:35" data-bid="56-4" class="b"> 35;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:10:38-44:10:38" data-bid="56-5" class="b"> Ac 10:38</a>) “Power” is basically the ability or capacity to act or do things and it can be latent, dormant, or inactively resident in someone or something. “Force,” on the other hand, more specifically describes energy <em>projected</em> and <em>exerted</em> on persons or things, and may be defined as “an influence that produces or tends to produce motion, or change of motion.” “Power” might be likened to the energy stored in a battery, while “force” could be compared to the electric current flowing from such battery. “Force,” then, more accurately represents the sense of the Hebrew and Greek terms as relating to God’s spirit, and this is borne out by a consideration of the Scriptures.</p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb"><strong>Its Use in Creation.</strong> Jehovah God accomplished the creation of the material universe by means of his spirit, or active force. Regarding the planet Earth in its early formative stages, the record states that “God’s active force [or “spirit” (<em>ruʹach</em>)] was moving to and fro over the surface of the waters.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:2-1:1:2" data-bid="57-1" class="b">Ge 1:2</a>) <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:33:6-19:33:6" data-bid="58-1" class="b">Psalm 33:6</a> says: “By the word of Jehovah the heavens themselves were made, and by the spirit of his mouth all their army.” Like a powerful breath, God’s spirit can be sent forth to exert power even though there is no bodily contact with that which is acted upon. (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:15:8-2:15:8" data-bid="59-1" class="b">Ex 15:8,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:15:10-2:15:10" data-bid="59-2" class="b"> 10</a>.) Where a human craftsman would use the force of his hands and fingers to produce things, God uses his spirit. Hence that spirit is also spoken of as God’s “hand” or “fingers.”​—Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:8:3-19:8:3" data-bid="60-1" class="b">Ps 8:3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:19:1-19:19:1" data-bid="60-2" class="b"> 19:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:12:28-40:12:28" data-bid="60-3" class="b"> Mt 12:28</a> with <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:11:20-42:11:20" data-bid="61-1" class="b">Lu 11:20</a>.</p>
<p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb">Modern science speaks of matter as organized energy, like bundles of energy, and recognizes that “matter can be changed into energy and energy into matter.” (<em>The World Book Encyclopedia,</em> 1987, Vol. 13, p. 246) The immensity of the universe that man has thus far been able to discern with his telescopes gives some slight concept of the inexhaustible source of energy to be found in Jehovah God. As the prophet wrote: “Who has taken the proportions of the spirit of Jehovah?”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:40:12-23:40:13" data-bid="62-1" class="b">Isa 40:12, 13,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:40:25-23:40:26" data-bid="62-2" class="b"> 25, 26</a>.</p>
<p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb"><strong><em>Source of animate life, reproductive powers.</em></strong> Not only inanimate creation but also all animate creation owes its existence and life to the operation of Jehovah’s spirit that produced the original living creatures through whom all living creatures today have come to exist. (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:33:4-18:33:4" data-bid="63-1" class="b">Job 33:4</a>; see <span id="page1021" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="1021" data-before-text="1021"></span>section of this article under “Breath; Breath of Life; Life-Force.”) Jehovah used his holy spirit to revive the reproductive powers of Abraham and Sarah, and therefore Isaac could be spoken of as “born in the manner of spirit.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:4:28-48:4:29" data-bid="64-1" class="b">Ga 4:28, 29</a>) By his spirit God also transferred his Son’s life from heaven to earth, causing conception in the womb of the virgin Jewess Mary.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:1:18-40:1:18" data-bid="65-1" class="b">Mt 1:18,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:1:20-40:1:20" data-bid="65-2" class="b"> 20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:1:35-42:1:35" data-bid="65-3" class="b"> Lu 1:35</a>.</p>
<p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sb"><strong>Spirit Used on Behalf of God’s Servants.</strong> A principal operation of God’s spirit involves its ability to inform, to illuminate, to reveal things. Therefore David could pray: “Teach me to do your will, for you are my God. Your spirit is good; may it lead me in the land of uprightness.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:143:10-19:143:10" data-bid="66-1" class="b">Ps 143:10</a>) Much earlier, Joseph had given the interpretation of Pharaoh’s prophetic dreams, being enabled to do so by God’s help.

Prophecy, as the apostle shows, did not spring from human interpretation of circumstances and events; it was not the result of some innate ability of the prophets to explain the meaning and significance of these or to forecast the shape of coming events. Rather, such men were “borne along by holy spirit”​—conveyed, moved, and guided by God’s active force.

<p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="sb">God’s spirit, then, not only brings revelation and understanding of God’s will but also energizes his servants to accomplish things in accord with that will. That spirit acts as a driving force that moves and impels them, even as Mark says the spirit “impelled” Jesus to go into the wilderness after his baptism. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:1:12-41:1:12" data-bid="72-1" class="b">Mr 1:12</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:4:1-42:4:1" data-bid="73-1" class="b">Lu 4:1</a>.)

Yet it is not merely some unconscious, blind impulse, for their minds and hearts are affected as well so that they can intelligently cooperate with the active force given them. Thus the apostle could say of those who had received the gift of prophecy in the Christian congregation that the “gifts of the spirit of the prophets are to be controlled by the prophets,” so that good order might be maintained.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:14:31-46:14:33" data-bid="78-1" class="b">1Co 14:31-33</a>.</p>

<p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="sb"><strong>Breath; Breath of Life; Life-Force.</strong> The account of the creation of man states that God formed man from the dust of the ground and proceeded to “blow [form of <em>na·phachʹ</em>] into his nostrils the breath [form of <em>nesha·mahʹ</em>] of life, and the man came to be a living soul [<em>neʹphesh</em>].” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:2:7-1:2:7" data-bid="149-1" class="b">Ge 2:7</a>; see <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200004192/">SOUL</a>.) <em>Neʹphesh</em> may be translated literally as “a breather,” that is, “a breathing creature,” either human or animal. <em>Nesha·mahʹ</em> is, in fact, used to mean “breathing thing [or creature]” and as such is used as a virtual synonym of <em>neʹphesh,</em> “soul.” (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:20:16-5:20:16" data-bid="150-1" class="b">De 20:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:10:39-6:10:40" data-bid="150-2" class="b"> Jos 10:39, 40;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:11:11-6:11:11" data-bid="150-3" class="b"> 11:11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:15:29-11:15:29" data-bid="150-4" class="b"> 1Ki 15:29</a>.) The record at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:2:7-1:2:7" data-bid="151-1" class="b">Genesis 2:7</a> uses <em>nesha·mahʹ</em> in describing God’s causing Adam’s body to have life so that the man became “a living soul.” Other texts, however, show that more was involved than simple breathing of air, that is, more than the mere introduction of air into the lungs and its expulsion therefrom. Thus, at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:7:22-1:7:22" data-bid="152-1" class="b">Genesis 7:22</a>, in describing the destruction of human and animal life outside the ark at the time of the Flood, we read: “Everything in which the breath [form of <em>nesha·mahʹ</em>] of the force [or, “spirit” (<em>ruʹach</em>)] of life was active in its nostrils, namely, all that were on the dry ground, died.” <em>Nesha·mahʹ,</em> “breath,” is thus directly associated or linked with <em>ruʹach,</em> which here describes the spirit, or life-force, that is active in all living creatures​—human and animal souls.</p>
<p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="sb">As the <em>Theological Dictionary of the New Testament</em> (Vol. VI, p. 336) states: “Breath may be discerned only in movement [as in the movement of the chest or the expanding of the nostrils], and it is also a sign, condition and agent of life, which seems to be esp[ecially] tied up with breathing.” Hence, the <em>nesha·mahʹ,</em> or “breath,” is both the product of the <em>ruʹach,</em> or life-force, and also a principal means of sustaining that life-force in living creatures. It is known from scientific studies, for example, that life is present in every single cell of the body’s one hundred trillion cells and that, while thousands of millions of cells die each minute, constant reproduction of new living cells goes on. The life-force active in all the living cells is dependent upon the oxygen that breathing brings into the body, which oxygen is transported to all the cells by the bloodstream. Without oxygen some cells begin to die after several minutes, others after a longer period. While a person can go without breathing for a few minutes and still survive, without the <em>life-force</em> in his cells he is dead beyond all human ability to revive him. The Hebrew Scriptures, inspired by man’s Designer and Creator, evidently use <em>ruʹach</em> to denote this vital force that is the very principle of life, and <em>nesha·mahʹ</em> to represent the breathing that sustains it.</p>
<p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="sb">Because breathing is so inseparably connected with life, <em>nesha·mahʹ</em> and <em>ruʹach</em> are used in clear parallel in various texts. Job voiced his determination to avoid unrighteousness “while my breath [form of <em>nesha·mahʹ</em>] is yet whole within me, and the spirit [<em>weruʹach</em>] of God is in my nostrils.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:27:3-18:27:5" data-bid="153-1" class="b">Job 27:3-5</a>) Elihu said: “If that one’s spirit [form of <em>ruʹach</em>] and breath [form of <em>nesha·mahʹ</em>] he [God] gathers to himself, all flesh will expire [that is, “breathe out”] together, and earthling man himself will return to the very dust.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:34:14-18:34:15" data-bid="154-1" class="b">Job 34:14, 15</a>) Similarly, <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:104:29-19:104:29" data-bid="155-1" class="b">Psalm 104:29</a> says of earth’s creatures, human and animal: “If you [God] take away their spirit, they expire, and back to their dust they go.” At <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:42:5-23:42:5" data-bid="156-1" class="b">Isaiah 42:5</a> Jehovah is spoken of as “the One laying out the earth and its produce, the One giving breath to the people on it, and spirit to those walking in it.” The breath (<em>nesha·mahʹ</em>) sustains their existence; the spirit (<em>ruʹach</em>) energizes and is the life-force that enables man to be an animated creature, to move, walk, be actively alive. (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:17:28-44:17:28" data-bid="157-1" class="b">Ac 17:28</a>.)

<p id="p50" data-pid="50" class="sb">While <em>nesha·mahʹ</em> (breath) and <em>ruʹach</em> (spirit; active force; life-force) are sometimes used in a parallel sense, they are not identical. True, the “spirit,” or <em>ruʹach,</em> is at times spoken of as though it were the respiration (<em>nesha·mahʹ</em>) itself, but this seems to be simply because breathing is the prime visible evidence of the life-force in one’s body.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:9:18-18:9:18" data-bid="159-1" class="b">Job 9:18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:19:17-18:19:17" data-bid="159-2" class="b"> 19:17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:27:3-18:27:3" data-bid="159-3" class="b"> 27:3</a>.</p>
<p id="p51" data-pid="51" class="sb">Thus at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:37:1-26:37:10" data-bid="160-1" class="b">Ezekiel 37:1-10</a> the symbolic vision of the valley of dry bones is presented, the bones coming together, becoming covered with sinews, flesh, and skin, but “as regards breath [<em>weruʹach</em>], there was none in them.” Ezekiel was told to prophesy to “the wind [<em>ha·ruʹach</em>],” saying, “From the four winds [form of <em>ruʹach</em>] come in, O wind, and blow upon these killed people, that they may come to life.” The reference to the <em>four</em> winds <span id="page1025" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="1025" data-before-text="1025"></span>shows that wind is the appropriate rendering for <em>ruʹach</em> in this case. However, when such “wind,” which is simply air in motion, entered the nostrils of the dead persons of the vision, it became “breath,” which is also air in motion. Thus, the rendering of <em>ruʹach</em> as “breath” at this point of the account (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:37:10-26:37:10" data-bid="161-1" class="b">vs 10</a>) is also more appropriate than “spirit” or “life-force.” Ezekiel also would be able to see the bodies begin to breathe, even though he could not see the life-force, or spirit, energizing their bodies. As <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:37:11-26:37:14" data-bid="162-1" class="b">verses 11-14</a> show, this vision was symbolic of a spiritual (not physical) revivification of the people of Israel who were for a time in a spiritually dead state due to their Babylonian exile. Since they were already physically alive and breathing, it is logical to render <em>ruʹach</em> as “spirit” in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:37:14-26:37:14" data-bid="163-1" class="b">verse 14</a>, where God states that he will put ‘his spirit’ in his people so that they would become alive, spiritually speaking.</p>
<p id="p52" data-pid="52" class="sb">A similar symbolic vision is given at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:11:1-66:11:19" data-bid="164-1" class="b">Revelation chapter 11</a>. The picture is presented of “two witnesses” who are killed and whose corpses are allowed to lie on the street for three and a half days. Then “spirit [or breath, <em>pneuʹma</em>] of life from God entered into them, and they stood upon their feet.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:11:1-66:11:11" data-bid="165-1" class="b">Re 11:1-11</a>) This vision again draws on a physical reality to illustrate a spiritual revivification. It also shows that the Greek <em>pneuʹma,</em> like the Hebrew <em>ruʹach,</em> may represent the life-giving force from God that animates the human soul or person. As <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:2:26-59:2:26" data-bid="166-1" class="b">James 2:26</a> states: “The body without spirit [<em>pneuʹma·tos</em>] is dead.”​—<em>Int.</em></p>
<p id="p53" data-pid="53" class="sb">Therefore, when God created man in Eden and blew into his nostrils “the breath [form of <em>nesha·mahʹ</em>] of life,” it is evident that, in addition to filling the man’s lungs with air, God caused the life-force, or spirit (<em>ruʹach</em>), to vitalize all the cells in Adam’s body.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:2:7-1:2:7" data-bid="167-1" class="b">Ge 2:7</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:104:30-19:104:30" data-bid="168-1" class="b">Ps 104:30;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:17:25-44:17:25" data-bid="168-2" class="b"> Ac 17:25</a>.</p>
<p id="p54" data-pid="54" class="sb">This life-force is passed on from parents to offspring through conception. Since Jehovah was the original Source of this life-force for man, and the Author of the procreation process, one’s life can properly be attributed to Him, though received not directly but indirectly through one’s parents.​—Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:10:9-18:10:12" data-bid="169-1" class="b">Job 10:9-12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:139:13-19:139:16" data-bid="169-2" class="b"> Ps 139:13-16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:11:5-21:11:5" data-bid="169-3" class="b"> Ec 11:5</a>.</p>
<p id="p55" data-pid="55" class="sb"><strong><em>Life-force, or spirit, is impersonal.</em></strong> As noted, the Scriptures refer to the <em>ruʹach,</em> or life-force, as being not only in humans but also in animals. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:6:17-1:6:17" data-bid="170-1" class="b">Ge 6:17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:7:15-1:7:15" data-bid="170-2" class="b"> 7:15,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:7:22-1:7:22" data-bid="170-3" class="b"> 22</a>) <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:3:18-21:3:22" data-bid="171-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 3:18-22</a> shows that man dies in the same manner as the beasts, for “they all have but one spirit [<em>weruʹach</em>], so that there is no superiority of the man over the beast,” that is, as to the life-force common to both. This being so, it is clear that the “spirit,” or life-force (<em>ruʹach</em>), as used in this sense is impersonal. As an illustration, one might compare it to another invisible force, electricity, which may be used to make various types of machines operate​—causing stoves to produce heat, fans to produce wind, computers to solve problems, television sets to produce figures, voices and other sounds—​yet which electric current never takes on any of the characteristics of the machines in which it functions or is active.</p>
<p id="p56" data-pid="56" class="sb">Thus, <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:146:3-19:146:4" data-bid="172-1" class="b">Psalm 146:3, 4</a> says that when man’s “spirit [form of <em>ruʹach</em>] goes out, he goes back to his ground; in that day <em>his thoughts do perish.”</em> The spirit, or life-force, that was active in man’s body cells does not retain any of the characteristics of those cells, such as the brain cells and their part in the thinking process. If the spirit, or life-force (<em>ruʹach; pneuʹma</em>), were not impersonal, then it would mean that the children of certain women who were resurrected by the prophets Elijah and Elisha were actually in conscious existence somewhere in the period during which they were dead. So, too, with Lazarus, who was resurrected some four days after his death. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:17:17-11:17:23" data-bid="173-1" class="b">1Ki 17:17-23;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:4:32-12:4:37" data-bid="173-2" class="b"> 2Ki 4:32-37;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:11:38-43:11:44" data-bid="173-3" class="b"> Joh 11:38-44</a>) If such had been the case, it is reasonable that they would have remembered such conscious existence during that period and upon being resurrected would have described it, told about it. There is nothing to indicate that any of them did so. Hence, the personality of the dead individual is not perpetuated in the life-force, or spirit, that stops functioning in the deceased person’s body cells.</p>
<p id="p57" data-pid="57" class="sb"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:12:7-21:12:7" data-bid="174-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 12:7</a> states that at death the person’s body returns to the dust, “and the spirit itself returns to the true God who gave it.” The person himself was never in heaven with God; what “returns” to God is therefore the vital force that enabled the person to live.</p>
<p id="p58" data-pid="58" class="sb">In view of the impersonal nature of the life-force, or spirit, found in man (as also in the animal creation), it is evident that David’s statement at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:31:5-19:31:5" data-bid="175-1" class="b">Psalm 31:5</a>, quoted by Jesus at the time of his death (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:23:46-42:23:46" data-bid="176-1" class="b">Lu 23:46</a>), “Into your hand I entrust my spirit,” meant that God was being called upon to guard, or care for, that one’s life-force. (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:7:59-44:7:59" data-bid="177-1" class="b">Ac 7:59</a>.) That there be an actual and literal transmission of some force from this planet to the heavenly presence of God is not necessarily required.

<p id="p59" data-pid="59" class="sb"><strong>Impelling Mental Inclination.</strong> <em>Ruʹach</em> and <em>pneuʹma</em> are both used to designate the force that causes a person to display a certain attitude, disposition, or emotion or to take a certain action or course. While that force within the person is itself invisible, it produces visible effects. This use of the Hebrew and Greek terms rendered “spirit” and basically related to breath or to air in motion is paralleled to a considerable degree by English expressions. Thus, we speak of a person as ‘putting on airs,’ or of manifesting an ‘air of calmness’ or of ‘having a bad spirit.’ We speak of ‘breaking a person’s spirit,’ in the sense of discouraging and disheartening him. As applying to a group of persons and the dominant force activating them, we may talk of ‘getting into the spirit of an occasion,’ or we may refer to the ‘mob spirit’ that infects them. Metaphorically we may refer to an ‘atmosphere of discontent’ or to ‘winds of change and revolution blowing through a nation.’ By all of these we refer to this invisible activating force working in persons, moving them to speak and act as they do.</p>

<p id="p62" data-pid="62" class="sb"><strong><em>Heart and spirit.</em></strong> The heart is frequently tied in with the spirit, indicating a definite relationship. Since the figurative heart is shown to have the capacity for thinking and motivation, and to be intimately related with emotions and affection (see <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200001948/">HEART</a>), it undoubtedly has a major share in the development of the spirit (the dominant mental inclination) that one shows. <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:35:21-2:35:21" data-bid="197-1" class="b">Exodus 35:21</a> places heart and spirit in parallel in saying that “everyone whose heart impelled him, . . . everyone whose spirit incited him,” brought contributions for the tabernacle construction. Conversely, on learning of Jehovah’s powerful works on behalf of Israel, the Canaanites’ ‘hearts began to melt and no spirit arose among them,’ that is, there was no urge to initiate action against the Israelite forces.

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A fruit that, when ripe, is of a maroon color, shaped like an apple, with a rosette or crown extending around the bottom. Within the hard rind it is crowded with small capsules full of juice, each containing a small pink or red seed.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The pomegranate tree (<em>Punica granatum</em>), also denoted by the Hebrew word <em>rim·mohnʹ,</em> grows throughout the Middle East. It seldom passes 4.5 m (15 ft) in height. The spreading branches are numerous and have dark-green leaves that are shaped like the head of a lance and that produce blossoms with coral-red to scarlet flowers.​—PICTURE, Vol. 1, p. 742.</p>

The Shulammite maiden’s veiled temples were compared to “a segment of pomegranate” and her skin to “a paradise of pomegranates.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/22:4:3-22:4:3" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ca 4:3,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/22:4:13-22:4:13" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/22:6:7-22:6:7" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> 6:7</a>.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">By means of Moses, Jehovah promised the nation of Israel that He would bring them into a land of wheat, barley, vines, figs, pomegranates, olives, and honey. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:8:7-5:8:9" data-bid="3-1" class="b">De 8:7-9</a>) Prior to this the spies who went into the land had returned with grapes, figs, and pomegranates.

<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">The pomegranate was extensively cultivated in Bible times, and the place-names of Rimmon, En-rimmon, and Gath-rimmon doubtless were derived from the abundance of these trees in their area.

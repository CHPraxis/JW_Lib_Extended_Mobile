In the wilderness the mixed crowd and the Israelites longed for the garlic they used to eat there. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:11:4-4:11:5" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Nu 11:4, 5</a>) The Greek historian Herodotus (II, 125) tells of an inscription that listed garlic as one of the foods provided for the laborers on a certain pyramid. Garlic is still widely used by the inhabitants of Mediterranean areas. In the Mishnah (<em>Nedarim</em> 3:10), the Jews referred to themselves as garlic-eaters. Garlic has been used medicinally as a digestive stimulant, as an antibiotic, and as an antispasmodic.</p>

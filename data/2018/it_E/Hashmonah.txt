HASHMONAH
(Hash·moʹnah).
An Israelite camping site, apparently between Mithkah and Moseroth. (Nu 33:29, 30) Its exact location is uncertain. Hashmonah has been linked with the Wadi Hashim near the suggested location of Kadesh-barnea, and according to another view, it may be the same as Azmon.​—Nu 34:4, 5; see AZMON.

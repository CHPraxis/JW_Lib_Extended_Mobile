<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">(Nerʹgal).</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A Babylonian deity especially worshiped at Cuthah, a city that history says was dedicated to Nergal. The people of Cuth (Cuthah), whom the king of Assyria settled in the territory of Samaria, continued worshiping this deity. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:17:24-12:17:24" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2Ki 17:24,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:17:30-12:17:30" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 30,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:17:33-12:17:33" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> 33</a>) Some scholars suggest that Nergal was originally associated with fire and the heat of the sun and that later he came to be regarded as a god of war and hunting as well as a bringer of pestilence. The appellatives applied to Nergal in religious texts indicate that he was basically viewed as a destroyer. He is called “the raging king,” “the violent one,” and “the one who burns.” Nergal also came to be regarded as the god of the underworld and the consort of Eresh-Kigal. The human-headed and winged lion is thought to have been the emblem of Nergal.</p>

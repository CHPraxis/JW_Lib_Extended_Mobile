<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><strong>1.</strong> [possibly, Store Up]. One of the Horite sheiks in the land of Seir. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:36:20-1:36:21" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ge 36:20, 21,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:36:30-1:36:30" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 30</a>) The Horites were later dispossessed and annihilated by the sons of Esau. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:2:22-5:2:22" data-bid="2-1" class="b">De 2:22</a>) The name Ezer in this case possibly means “Store Up,” because of a difference in the spelling in the original Hebrew. At <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:1:38-13:1:38" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Chronicles 1:38</a> it has been misprinted “Ezar” in many modern editions of the <em>King James Version,</em> although it was correct in the edition of 1611 as well as other early editions.</p>

<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><strong>3.</strong> A son of Hur of the tribe of Judah, and “the father” of Hushah.

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><strong>4.</strong> The chief one of the 11 valiant Gadites who separated themselves to David in the wilderness while he was still under restriction because of Saul.

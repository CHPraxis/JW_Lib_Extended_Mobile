<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Basically, a raised structure or place on which sacrifices are offered or incense is burned in worship of the true God or of another deity. The Hebrew word <em>miz·beʹach</em> (altar) comes from the root verb <em>za·vachʹ</em> (slaughter; sacrifice) and thus basically refers to a place of slaughtering or sacrificing. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:8:20-1:8:20" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ge 8:20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:12:21-5:12:21" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> De 12:21;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:16:2-5:16:2" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> 16:2</a>) Similarly, the Greek <em>thy·si·a·steʹri·on</em> (altar) comes from the root verb <em>thyʹo,</em> also meaning “slaughter; sacrifice.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:22:4-40:22:4" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Mt 22:4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:14:12-41:14:12" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Mr 14:12</a>) The Greek word <em>bo·mosʹ</em> refers to the altar of a false god.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:17:23-44:17:23" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ac 17:23</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The first mention of an altar occurs after the Flood when “Noah began to build an altar to Jehovah” and offered burnt offerings thereon. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:8:20-1:8:20" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ge 8:20</a>) The only offerings mentioned prior to the Flood were those of Cain and Abel, and though it is likely that they did so, it is not stated whether they used altars or not.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:4:3-1:4:4" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ge 4:3, 4</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Abraham built an altar at Shechem (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:12:7-1:12:7" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ge 12:7</a>), at a point between Bethel and Ai (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:12:8-1:12:8" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ge 12:8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:13:3-1:13:3" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 13:3</a>), at Hebron (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:13:18-1:13:18" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Ge 13:18</a>), and also evidently on Mount Moriah, where he sacrificed a ram given him by God in substitution for Isaac. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:22:9-1:22:13" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ge 22:9-13</a>) Only in this last case is a sacrifice specifically mentioned as being offered on these altars by Abraham. However, the basic meaning of the Hebrew word indicates that offerings were likely made in each case. Isaac later built an altar at Beer-sheba (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:26:23-1:26:23" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ge 26:23,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:26:25-1:26:25" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> 25</a>), and Jacob built altars at Shechem and at Bethel.

<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Moses constructed an altar following the victory over Amalek, naming it Jehovah-nissi (Jehovah Is My Signal Pole). (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:17:15-2:17:16" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Ex 17:15, 16</a>) At the making of the Law covenant with Israel, an altar was built by <span id="page82" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="82" data-before-text="82"></span>Moses at the foot of Mount Sinai, and sacrifices were offered up on it.

<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><strong>Tabernacle Altars.</strong> With the setting up of the tabernacle, two altars were constructed according to divine pattern. The altar of burnt offering (also called “the altar of copper” [<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:39:39-2:39:39" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Ex 39:39</a>]) was made of acacia wood in the form of a hollow chest, apparently without top or bottom. It was 2.2 m (7.3 ft) square and 1.3 m (4.4 ft) high with “horns” projecting from the upper four corners. All its surfaces were overlaid with copper. A grating, or network, of copper was placed below the altar’s rim “down within,” “toward the center.” Four rings were placed at the four extremities near the grating, and these appear to be the same rings through which the two copper-sheathed acacia-wood poles were passed for carrying the altar. This might mean that a slot was cut through two sides of the altar allowing for a flat grating to be inserted, with the rings extending out on both sides. There is considerable difference of opinion among scholars on the subject, and many consider it likely that two sets of rings were involved, the second set, for insertion of the carrying poles, being attached directly to the outside of the altar. Copper equipment was made in the form of cans and shovels for the ashes, bowls for catching the blood of the animals, forks for handling the flesh, and fire holders.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:27:1-2:27:8" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Ex 27:1-8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:38:1-2:38:7" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> 38:1-7,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:38:30-2:38:30" data-bid="16-3" class="b"> 30;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:4:14-4:4:14" data-bid="16-4" class="b"> Nu 4:14</a>.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">This copper altar for burnt offerings was placed before the entrance of the tabernacle. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:40:6-2:40:6" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Ex 40:6,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:40:29-2:40:29" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> 29</a>) While it was of relatively low height, thus not necessarily requiring a means of approach, for ease of handling the sacrifices placed within it the earth may have been raised around it or there may have been a ramp leading up to it. (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:9:22-3:9:22" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Le 9:22</a>, which states that Aaron “came down” from making offerings.) Since the animal was sacrificed “at the side of the altar to the north” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:1:11-3:1:11" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Le 1:11</a>), “the place for the fatty ashes” removed from the altar was to the E (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:1:16-3:1:16" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Le 1:16</a>), and the basin of copper for washing was located to the W (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:30:18-2:30:18" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Ex 30:18</a>), this would logically leave the S as the open side on which such a means of approach might be placed.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><strong><em>Altar of incense.</em></strong> The altar of incense (also called “the altar of gold” [<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:39:38-2:39:38" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Ex 39:38</a>]) was likewise made of acacia wood, the top and sides being overlaid with gold. A border of gold ran around the top. The altar measured 44.5 cm (17.5 in.) square and 89 cm (2.9 ft) high, and also had “horns” extending out from the four top corners. Two gold rings were made for the insertion of the carrying poles made of acacia overlaid with gold, and these rings were placed underneath the gold border on opposite sides of the altar. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:30:1-2:30:5" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Ex 30:1-5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:37:25-2:37:28" data-bid="23-2" class="b"> 37:25-28</a>) A special incense was burned on this altar twice daily, in the morning and in the evening.

<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb"><strong>Temple Altars.</strong> Prior to the dedication of Solomon’s temple, the copper altar made in the wilderness served for Israel’s sacrificial offerings at the high place in Gibeon. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:3:4-11:3:4" data-bid="43-1" class="b">1Ki 3:4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:16:39-13:16:40" data-bid="43-2" class="b"> 1Ch 16:39, 40;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:21:29-13:21:30" data-bid="43-3" class="b"> 21:29, 30;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:1:3-14:1:6" data-bid="43-4" class="b"> 2Ch 1:3-6</a>) The copper altar thereafter made for the temple covered an area 16 times as large as the one made for the tabernacle, measuring about 8.9 m (29.2 ft) square and about 4.5 m (14.6 ft) high. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:4:1-14:4:1" data-bid="44-1" class="b">2Ch 4:1</a>) In view of its height, some means of approach was essential.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:20:26-2:20:26" data-bid="45-1" class="b">Ex 20:26</a>) Some believe that the linen drawers worn by Aaron and his sons served to obviate this command and thus made steps allowable.

Josephus (<em>The Jewish War,</em> V, 225 [v, 6]) indicates that such an approach was used for the temple altar later built by Herod. If the arrangement of the altar of the temple followed that of the tabernacle, the ramp was probably on the S side of the altar. “The molten sea,” where the priests washed, would thus be convenient, as it also lay toward the south.

It was to this altar, therefore, that Jesus made reference in his day.

The altar consisted of several sections successively indented or recessed. Its dimensions are given in measurements of the long cubit (51.8 cm; 20.4 in.). The base of the altar was one cubit thick and had a “lip” of one span (perhaps 26 cm; 10 in.) as a border around the top, thus forming a sort of gutter or channel, perhaps for receiving blood poured out.

It also had a border surrounding it of a half cubit (c. 26 cm; 10 in.), perhaps forming a second channel or a protective ledge. Finally, the altar hearth extended up yet another four cubits and was also stepped in one cubit from the preceding section; out from it extended four “horns.” Stairs from the E provided approach to the altar hearth.

HORESH
(Hoʹresh) [Wooded Place].
A site in the Wilderness of Ziph where David hid from Saul. Here also Jonathan acknowledged David as the next king of Israel, and the two men “concluded a covenant” of mutual support. (1Sa 23:15-19) Horesh is tentatively identified with modern-day Khirbet Khoreisa, about 9 km (5.5 mi) SSE of Hebron.

RHEGIUM
(Rheʹgi·um).
A city in southern Italy today called Reggio or Reggio di Calabria. The ship on which the apostle Paul was traveling as a prisoner made a stop at Rhegium when he was on his way to appear before Caesar in Rome, about the year 59 C.E.
Rhegium is situated on the Strait of Messina, which separates Italy and Sicily. Just N of Rhegium the ship on which Paul was traveling would have had to navigate past the promontory Scylla on the Italian side of the strait and the whirlpool Charybdis on the Sicilian side, both considered hazardous by ancient mariners. A day after their arrival at Rhegium a S wind sprang up and this moved them safely through the strait and NNW to Puteoli.​—Ac 28:13.

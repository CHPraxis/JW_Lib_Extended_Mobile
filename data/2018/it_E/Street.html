<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A public way in a city or town. The common Hebrew term for street (<em>chuts</em>) basically means “outside.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:42:2-23:42:2" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Isa 42:2</a>, ftn) In ancient towns and cities of Bible lands it appears that most streets were unpaved. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:18:42-19:18:42" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ps 18:42;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:10:6-23:10:6" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Isa 10:6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/25:2:21-25:2:21" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> La 2:21</a>) However, channels for water drainage from the streets have been discovered in Jericho and Gezer.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Generally, streets were narrow and winding. But there were also “broad ways.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:14:21-42:14:21" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Lu 14:21</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:21-66:21:21" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Re 21:21</a>.) Nineveh’s streets were wide enough to accommodate chariots. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/34:2:4-34:2:4" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Na 2:4</a>) Babylon and Damascus had broad avenues or processional ways, and some streets bore names. During the Roman period, “the street called Straight” in Damascus was a three-lane thoroughfare about 26 m (85 ft) wide.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:9:11-44:9:11" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ac 9:11</a>; see <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200004243/">STRAIGHT</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">An open area, the public square, likely near a city gate, might serve as a place to transact business or meet for instruction. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:23:10-1:23:18" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ge 23:10-18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:8:1-16:8:3" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> Ne 8:1-3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:5:1-24:5:1" data-bid="7-3" class="b"> Jer 5:1</a>) There children played (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/38:8:4-38:8:5" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Zec 8:4, 5</a>); the streets in general were usually filled with sounds of activity. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:18:17-18:18:17" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Job 18:17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:33:10-24:33:11" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> Jer 33:10, 11</a>; contrast <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:15:3-23:15:3" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Isa 15:3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:24:11-23:24:11" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> 24:11</a>.) They were places of commercial enterprise, shops of a certain kind sometimes being grouped together, as on “the street of the bakers” in Jerusalem. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:37:21-24:37:21" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Jer 37:21</a>) The “streets” that Ben-hadad offered to be assigned to Ahab in Damascus were evidently for the establishment of bazaars, or markets, to promote Ahab’s commercial interests in that Syrian capital. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:20:34-11:20:34" data-bid="12-1" class="b">1Ki 20:34</a>) At night the streets of some cities apparently were under the vigilant eyes of watchmen.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/22:3:1-22:3:3" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Ca 3:1-3</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The streets also were places where news was announced. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:1:20-10:1:20" data-bid="14-1" class="b">2Sa 1:20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:11:6-24:11:6" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> Jer 11:6</a>) There Jesus Christ taught, and cured the ailing, though not wrangling and crying aloud in the broad ways, which would have caused a public sensation, magnifying his own name and drawing attention away from Jehovah God and the Kingdom good news. <span id="page1040" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="1040" data-before-text="1040"></span>(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:8:1-42:8:1" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Lu 8:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:12:13-40:12:19" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> Mt 12:13-19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:42:1-23:42:2" data-bid="15-3" class="b"> Isa 42:1, 2</a>) Jesus, therefore, was not like the hypocrites whom he condemned for praying “on the corners of the broad ways to be visible to men.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:5-40:6:5" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Mt 6:5</a>.</p>

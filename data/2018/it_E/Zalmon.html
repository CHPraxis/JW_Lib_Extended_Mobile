<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">(Zalʹmon).</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><strong>1.</strong> An Ahohite warrior of David. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:23:8-10:23:8" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2Sa 23:8,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:23:28-10:23:28" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 28</a>) Apparently called Ilai at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:11:29-13:11:29" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Chronicles 11:29</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><strong>2.</strong> A mountain near Shechem. From Mount Zalmon, Abimelech and his forces cut wood with which to burn down the vault belonging to the city of Shechem. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:9:48-7:9:49" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Jg 9:48, 49</a>) As the only mountains near Shechem are Ebal and Gerizim, Zalmon was either a peak or slope of one of these, or else it was some other less important hill nearby.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><strong>3.</strong> A lofty peak evidently in Bashan, E of the Jordan. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:68:14-19:68:15" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ps 68:14, 15</a>) It was perhaps the highest peak of Mount Hauran (Jebel ed Druz).</p>

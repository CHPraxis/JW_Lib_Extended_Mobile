OMER
(oʹmer).
A dry measure amounting to one tenth of an ephah. (Ex 16:16, 18, 22, 32, 33, 36) The ephah measure is calculated at 22 L (20 dry qt) on the basis of archaeological evidence concerning the capacity of the corresponding liquid-measure bath. (Compare Eze 45:10, 11.) An omer measure would therefore equal 2.2 L (2 dry qt).
A comparison of the Hebrew text of Exodus 29:40 and Numbers 28:5 reveals that a ‘tenth part’ means a tenth of an ephah, or an omer. This provides a basis for rendering the Hebrew ‘tenth part’ as “tenth of an ephah.”​—Nu 15:4, AT, NW, Ro, JP.

KABZEEL
(Kabʹze·el) [God Has Collected].
A city in the southern part of Judah. (Jos 15:21) It is tentatively identified with Khirbet Hora (Horvat Hur), about 10 km (6 mi) ENE of Beer-sheba. The Hebrew text of 2 Samuel 23:20 and 1 Chronicles 11:22 has been variously understood to mean that Kabzeel was (1) the home of the distinguished warrior Benaiah, (2) the home of one of his progenitors or the place where such a one performed notable deeds, or (3) the scene for Benaiah’s many deeds. (Compare AS; KJ; JB; Le; NW; RS.) An alternate form, “Jekabzeel,” appears at Nehemiah 11:25 in a listing of postexilic settlements in Judah.

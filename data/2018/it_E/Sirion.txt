SIRION
(Sirʹi·on).
The old Sidonian name for Mount Hermon, called Senir by the Amorites. (De 3:9) The name Sirion appears in the Ugaritic texts found at Ras Shamra on the coast of northern Syria, thus corroborating the Bible’s exactness. Like Senir, Sirion perhaps also designates a particular part of Mount Hermon. (Compare 1Ch 5:23.) At Psalm 29:6 Sirion and Lebanon are mentioned together. For this reason it has been suggested that Sirion perhaps refers to the Anti-Lebanon Range.​—See HERMON.

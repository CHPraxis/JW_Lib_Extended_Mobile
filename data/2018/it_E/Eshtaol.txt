ESHTAOL
(Eshʹta·ol) [possibly, Place of Making Inquiry [of God]].
A city in the Shephelah, assigned to Judah. (Jos 15:20, 33) It was later listed as a town on Dan’s border. (Jos 19:40, 41) Judge Samson was first impelled by Jehovah’s spirit in this vicinity, and upon his death he was buried there. (Jg 13:25; 16:31) The 5 Danites spying out Laish and the 600 who subsequently captured it departed from Eshtaol and Zorah.​—Jg 18:1, 2, 7, 11, 27.
Scholars generally identify Eshtaol with the partially occupied present-day site of Eshwaʽ (Eshtaʼol). It stands on a platform of rock about 21 km (13 mi) W of Jerusalem.

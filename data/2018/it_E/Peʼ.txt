PEʼ
[פ; final, ף].
The 17th letter of the Hebrew alphabet. It is one of the five Hebrew letters that have a different form when used as the final letter of a word. The name assigned to the letter means “mouth.”
The Hebrew sound corresponds to the English “p,” when it has the point (daghesh lene) in it; but without this point it is pronounced like “ph,” as in “philosophy.” This letter initiates each of the eight verses in the Hebrew text of Psalm 119:129-136.​—See HEBREW, II.

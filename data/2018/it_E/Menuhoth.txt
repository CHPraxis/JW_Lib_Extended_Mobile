MENUHOTH
(Me·nuʹhoth) [Resting-Places].
According to the Masoretic text, apparently a Judean family descended through Shobal. (1Ch 2:4, 52) But some scholars prefer emending the Hebrew text to read “the Manahathites,” as in verse 54. (JB, Mo) And a Jewish commentary on Chronicles gives the alternate reading “who supervised half of the resting-places” and notes: “Shobal was in charge of half the caravan stations in the land of Judah.”​—Soncino Books of the Bible, edited by A. Cohen, London, 1952, p. 15.

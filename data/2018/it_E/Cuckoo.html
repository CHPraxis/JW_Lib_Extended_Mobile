<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">[Heb., plural, <em>bar·bu·rimʹ</em>].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">In the Bible, this name occurs only once at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:4:23-11:4:23" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Kings 4:23</a>, where the list of daily provisions of food for Solomon’s court includes “cuckoos [<em>bar·bu·rimʹ</em>].” (<em>JB; NW</em>) While other versions (<em>KJ, RS</em>) here read “fowl,” <em>bar·bu·rimʹ</em> seems to refer to a specific kind of bird rather than being simply a general term. Though some have identified it with the capon, the guinea hen, or the goose, lexicographer W. Baumgartner (<em>Hebräisches und Aramäisches Lexikon zum Alten Testament,</em> Leiden, 1967, p. 147) suggests the “cuckoo,” and this seems to be indicated by the Arabic name for that bird, <em>abu burbur.</em></p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The common cuckoo (<em>Cuculus canorus</em>) and the great spotted cuckoo (<em>Clamator glandarius</em>) both pass through Palestine on their northern migration, arriving in early March. The cuckoo is a moderate-sized bird, resembling a small hawk, with a slightly curved, sharp, pointed beak. Usually cuckoos have inconspicuous colors such as light gray or light brown to reddish-brown or black. The underparts are often whitish with narrow black bars.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">While some consider the cuckoo to be a rather small bird to be used on Solomon’s menu, it may be noted that even plucked sparrows were anciently sold in Middle Eastern markets. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:10:29-40:10:29" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Mt 10:29</a>) Additionally, these cuckoos were “fattened” ones, and concerning such <em>The American Cyclopædia</em> says: “In autumn they are fat and esteemed as food; the ancients were very partial to them, and their flesh was supposed to have valuable medicinal properties.”​—1883, Vol. V, p. 557.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">The cuckoo is neither a carrion eater nor a bird of prey, but a valuable consumer of insects. It was legally “clean” and fit for use on Solomon’s royal table. While “the cuckow” is included in the <em>King James Version</em> as among the unclean birds, at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:11:16-3:11:16" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Leviticus 11:16</a> and <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:14:15-5:14:15" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 14:15</a>, this translation (of the Hebrew <em>shaʹchaph</em>) is no longer considered acceptable.​—See <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200001781/">GULL</a>.</p>

SHULAMMITE
(Shuʹlam·mite).
The designation for the beautiful country girl who is the principal character of The Song of Solomon (6:13). Likely this title portrays her as from the city of Shunem (modern Sulam). (Compare 1Ki 1:3.) Lending support to this view is the fact that the Greek Septuagint (Vatican Manuscript No. 1209) calls the girl the “Sunamite.” Also, the ecclesiastical writer Eusebius referred to Shunem as Shulem.​—Onomasticon, 158, 11.

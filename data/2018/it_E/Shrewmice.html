<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Small, mouselike animals covered with fine, short fur. The original-language term is thought to be derived from a root signifying “dig” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:26:15-1:26:15" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ge 26:15</a>), and therefore a number of scholars have suggested that it may denote any of a variety of burrowing animals, including rats, mice, mole rats, jerboas, and the like. However, according to Koehler and Baumgartner, <em>chaphar·pa·rohthʹ</em> designates <span id="page937" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="937" data-before-text="937"></span>“shrewmice.”​—<em>Lexicon in Veteris Testamenti Libros,</em> Leiden, 1958, p. 322.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">These creatures have long, slender snouts, tiny eyes, and rounded ears with a rather crumpled appearance. Of enormous appetite, shrewmice can devour more than their own weight in food in a day. They subsist largely on insects and worms, although also feeding on small animals their own size and larger, such as mice. The kind of shrewmouse mentioned in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:2:20-23:2:20" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Isaiah 2:20</a> is identified by I. Aharoni as <em>Crocidura religiosa.</em>​—<em>Osiris,</em> Brugge, 1938, Vol. 5, p. 463.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A long, low, narrow ship powered by one or more tiers of oars and used mainly for naval warfare.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Isaiah represents the inhabitants of Jerusalem as saying: “There the Majestic One, Jehovah, will be for us a place of rivers, of wide canals. On it no galley fleet [literally, fleet of ships of oar] will go, and no majestic ship will pass over it. For Jehovah is our Judge, Jehovah is our Statute-giver, Jehovah is our King; he himself will save us.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:33:21-23:33:22" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Isa 33:21, 22</a>) Jerusalem had no great rivers or canals as defenses against attack. Yet, just as rivers and canals protected cities such as Babylon and No-amon (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/34:3:8-34:3:8" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Na 3:8</a>), Jehovah would protect Jerusalem. So powerful would these “rivers” of God’s salvation be that strong enemy forces, symbolized by a fleet of hostile galleys or a majestic ship, would be wrecked in the mighty “waters” if they came up against Jerusalem. Jehovah thereby assured Jerusalem, in a figurative way, of her security under the defense he himself, ruling as her King, would provide for her salvation.</p>

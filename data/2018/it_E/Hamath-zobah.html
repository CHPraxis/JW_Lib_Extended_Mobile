<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">This place was apparently conquered by Solomon and thus figuring in his only military engagement alluded to in Scripture. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:8:3-14:8:3" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2Ch 8:3</a>) The exact identity of Hamath-zobah is uncertain. Hamath and Zobah may have been adjoining kingdoms (compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:18:9-13:18:9" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1Ch 18:9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:8:4-14:8:4" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 2Ch 8:4</a>), whence the compound name “Hamath-zobah.” That two neighboring geographic locations may be joined in this way is illustrated by <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:6:78-13:6:78" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Chronicles 6:78</a>. The literal Hebrew of this text reads “the Jordan Jericho,” or “the Jordan of Jericho,” and is usually rendered “the Jordan at [by] Jericho.”​—<em>NW, RS, KJ.</em></p>

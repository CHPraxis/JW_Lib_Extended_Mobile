<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">These terms evidently embrace numerous reedlike plants commonly growing in wet places. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:40:21-18:40:21" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Job 40:21;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:68:30-19:68:30" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Ps 68:30;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:19:6-23:19:6" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> Isa 19:6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:35:7-23:35:7" data-bid="1-4" class="b"> 35:7</a>; see <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200000861/">CALAMUS, CANE</a>.) Some scholars believe that in many cases the “reed” intended is <em>Arundo donax.</em> This plant is common in Egypt, Palestine, and Syria. Its stem, terminating in a large plume of white flowers, has a diameter of 5 to 8 cm (2 to 3 in.) at the base and grows to a height of 2.5 to 5.5 m (8 to 18 ft). The leaves measure from 30 to 90 cm (1 to 3 ft) in length. The common reed (<em>Phragmites australis</em>) is also found in swamps and on the banks of rivers in Israel. It is a leafy grass 1.5 to 5 m (5 to 16 ft) high and has fluffy flower clusters atop its stiff, smooth stems.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">In mockery, Roman soldiers placed a reed, representative of a royal scepter, in Jesus’ right hand and later hit him with it. Also, a reed was used to convey a sponge soaked with sour wine to the impaled Jesus.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:27:29-40:27:30" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Mt 27:29, 30,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:27:48-40:27:48" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 48;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:19:29-43:19:29" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> Joh 19:29</a>; see <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200002122/">HYSSOP</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The reed was also used for measuring. The <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:40:5-26:40:5" data-bid="3-1" class="b">book of Ezekiel (40:5</a>) indicates that a measuring reed was 6 cubits long. So a reed based on the common cubit measured 2.67 m (8.75 ft), and one based on the long cubit measured 3.11 m (10.2 ft).​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:11:1-66:11:1" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Re 11:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:15-66:21:16" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 21:15, 16</a>; see <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200004596/">WEIGHTS AND MEASURES</a>.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><strong>Figurative Use.</strong> “Reed” is used in the Bible to represent instability and frailty. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:14:15-11:14:15" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1Ki 14:15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:29:6-26:29:7" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Eze 29:6, 7</a>) Egypt was compared to a crushed reed, the sharp, pointed slivers of which would penetrate the palm of anyone leaning upon it.

A reed being tossed by a wind?” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:11:7-40:11:7" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Mt 11:7</a>) These words may have been intended to show that John the Baptizer was not a person who was wavering or vacillating but one who was firm, stable, and upright. At <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:12:20-40:12:20" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Matthew 12:20</a> (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:42:3-23:42:3" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Isa 42:3</a>), the “bruised reed” seems to represent oppressed people like the man with the withered hand whom Jesus healed on the Sabbath.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:12:10-40:12:14" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Mt 12:10-14</a>; see <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:23:4-40:23:4" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Mt 23:4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:6:34-41:6:34" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> Mr 6:34</a>.</p>

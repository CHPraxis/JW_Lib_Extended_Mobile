HILKIAH
(Hil·kiʹah) [My Portion (Share) Is Jehovah].
1. A Levite of the family of Merari; son of Amzi and forefather of the Ethan appointed by David as a singer at the sanctuary.​—1Ch 6:31, 32, 44-46.
2. A Levite gatekeeper of the family of Merari who received this assignment in David’s time; a son of Hosah.​—1Ch 26:10-12.
3. Father of the Eliakim who was an official in King Hezekiah’s court.​—2Ki 18:37.
4. The high priest in the days of King Josiah; son of Shallum and father of Azariah; apparently a forefather of Ezra the copyist. (2Ki 22:3, 4; 1Ch 6:13; Ezr 7:1, 2, 6) Hilkiah, as high priest, figured prominently in the restoration of true worship undertaken by Josiah. During the course of the temple repair work, Hilkiah found the very “book of Jehovah’s law by the hand of Moses.” What made the find outstanding was most likely the manuscript’s being the original book written by Moses. Hilkiah gave it to Shaphan the secretary, who took the manuscript to the king. Upon hearing Shaphan read the book, King Josiah dispatched a delegation headed by High Priest Hilkiah to Huldah the prophetess to inquire of Jehovah in behalf of the king and the people.​—2Ki 22:3-14; 2Ch 34:14.

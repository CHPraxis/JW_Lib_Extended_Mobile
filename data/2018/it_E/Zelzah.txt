ZELZAH
(Zelʹzah).
A location in Benjamin. As one sign confirming Saul’s leadership over Israel, he was to meet and receive a message about his father’s lost she-asses from two men “close by the tomb of Rachel in the territory of Benjamin at Zelzah.” (1Sa 10:1, 2, 7) The Greek Septuagint has been translated to read “leaping mightily” instead of “Zelzah,” though the latter term appears in the Hebrew Masoretic text. Rachel was buried at an unknown point ‘on the way from Bethel to Bethlehem’ (Ge 35:16-20), and the site of Zelzah remains undetermined.

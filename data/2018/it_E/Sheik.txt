SHEIK
A title usually given to the Edomite and Horite tribal chiefs, the sons of Esau and the sons of Seir the Horite. (Ex 15:15) In Hebrew the designation is ʼal·luphʹ, meaning “chief,” “leader of a thousand.” (See Ge 36:15, ftn.) The ancient Edomite and Horite designation corresponds to the title “sheik” as used for tribal leaders among modern Bedouin. In some Bible translations such titles as “chief,” “chieftain,” and “duke” are used instead of “sheik.”
Seven sheiks of the Horites are listed, all “sons of Seir.” (Ge 36:20, 21, 29, 30) The sheiks of Edom were evidently 14 in number: seven grandsons from Esau’s firstborn Eliphaz the son of his wife Adah, four grandsons from his son Reuel the son of his wife Basemath, and three of his sons by his wife Oholibamah. (Ge 36:15-19) There is a question, however, whether the sheik Korah who is included among the sons of Eliphaz should be counted. If the inclusion of the sheik Korah is a scribal error, as some believe, this would mean that there were only 13 sheiks of Edom. (Ge 36:16, ftn) The clans that developed from the sheiks came to bear their names as clan names.
At Genesis 36:40-43 and 1 Chronicles 1:51-54 a different listing is given of the “sheiks of Esau [Edom].” These may be later sheiks than those listed earlier. Some commentators, however, believe the names to be those, not of persons, but of the cities or regions where the various sheikdoms were centered. Following this view, the translation of the Jewish Publication Society reads: “the chief of Timna, the chief of Alvah,” and so forth.

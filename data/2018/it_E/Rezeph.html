<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">(Reʹzeph).</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A place cited in Sennacherib’s message to King Hezekiah boasting that Assyrian kings had ruined various “nations.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:19:8-12:19:12" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2Ki 19:8-12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:37:12-23:37:12" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Isa 37:12</a>) Rezeph’s exact location is not known, several places having had this name. One such site, thought by some to have been part of an ancient district, is identified with modern Rusaʼfeh, located W of the Euphrates about 145 km (90 mi) S of modern Haran. It is thus in the vicinity of the suggested site of Gozan, with which Rezeph is mentioned.</p>

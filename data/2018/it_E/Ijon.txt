One of the places taken by the military forces of Syria’s King Ben-hadad I during the reign of Baasha. (1Ki 15:20, 21; 2Ch 16:4) Nearly two centuries later, Assyrian King Tiglath-pileser III conquered Ijon and exiled its population. (2Ki 15:29) Ijon is generally linked with Tell ed-Dibbin about 15 km (9 mi) NNW of Dan.

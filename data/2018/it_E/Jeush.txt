JEUSH
(Jeʹush) [possibly, May He Lend Aid].
1. A son of Esau by his Hivite wife Oholibamah. Jeush was born in Canaan, but later the family moved to Edom.​—Ge 36:2, 5-8, 14, 18; 1Ch 1:35.
2. A descendant of Benjamin; a warrior and founder of a tribal family.​—1Ch 7:6, 10.
3. A Gershonite Levite; son of Shimei. As both Jeush and his brother Beriah had very few sons, their descendants in David’s time merged to form one paternal house.​—1Ch 23:7, 10, 11.
4. The first-named son of King Rehoboam, presumably by his wife Mahalath. Because Rehoboam loved a different wife more, Jeush was passed up in the royal succession.​—2Ch 11:18-23.
5. A Benjamite; one of King Saul’s descendants.​—1Ch 8:33, 39.

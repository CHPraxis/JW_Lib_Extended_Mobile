GESHUR
(Geshʹur).
1. An Aramaean kingdom bordering on the Argob region of Bashan, E of the Jordan River. Its northerly neighbor was Maacath. Although Israel’s early conquests extended as far as Geshur, the region itself was not taken. (De 3:14; Jos 12:1, 4, 5; 13:13) It was to Geshur, the realm of his maternal grandfather Talmai, that Absalom fled after murdering his half brother Amnon. There he continued in banishment for three years, until he was brought back to Jerusalem by Joab. (2Sa 3:2, 3; 13:28-38; 14:23; 15:8) At a later period Geshur and Syria annexed many Israelite cities E of the Jordan.​—1Ch 2:23.
2. Domain of the Geshurites in southern Palestine, near Philistine territory. (Jos 13:2; 1Sa 27:7-11) With reference to this area, the form “Geshur” is not specifically employed.

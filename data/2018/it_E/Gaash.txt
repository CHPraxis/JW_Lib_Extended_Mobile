GAASH
(Gaʹash) [possibly, Shaking; Shaken].
The name of a hill in the mountainous region of Ephraim, S of Timnath-heres (or Timnath-serah). (Jos 24:30; Jg 2:9) The torrent valleys of Gaash, mentioned in 2 Samuel 23:30 and 1 Chronicles 11:32, apparently refer to ravines in the vicinity of that hill.

URIEL
(U·riʹel) [God Is Light].
1. A Levite descendant of Kohath; son of Tahath.​—1Ch 6:22, 24.
2. Chief of the Kohathites at the time David had the ark of the covenant brought to Jerusalem.​—1Ch 15:5, 11, 12, 15.
3. Father of Micaiah (Maacah), who was the wife of King Rehoboam and mother of Abijah. (2Ch 13:1, 2; 11:21) Maacah was Absalom’s granddaughter. Since Absalom’s three sons apparently died young and childless (2Sa 14:27; 18:18), Micaiah must have been the child of Absalom’s daughter Tamar and of Uriel, not the son of Absalom, but the son-in-law.

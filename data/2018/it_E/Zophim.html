<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">(Zoʹphim).</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A field on the top of Pisgah where Balaam had seven altars built, where sacrifices were offered, and where the prophet took up one of his proverbial utterances regarding Israel. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:23:14-4:23:24" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Nu 23:14-24</a>) The name Zophim seems to be preserved at Telaʽat es-Safa near the suggested location of Pisgah, E of the N end of the Dead Sea. Some scholars, however, translate the word <em>tsoh·phimʹ</em> instead of considering it a proper name, using such expressions as “the field of the watchmen.”​—<em>Le;</em> compare <em>JB, NE.</em></p>

BREASTBAND
A sash or girdle worn by a bride on her wedding day. It marked her status as a married woman. Jehovah as a “husband” to Israel illustrates the sin and extreme disregard of Israel toward him, saying: “Can a virgin forget her ornaments, a bride her breastbands? And yet my own people​—they have forgotten me days without number.” Israel’s God should have been her greatest ornament, but she had forsaken him for other gods.​—Jer 2:32; Isa 3:20; compare Isa 49:18.

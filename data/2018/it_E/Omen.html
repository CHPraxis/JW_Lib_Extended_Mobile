<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Anything viewed as giving some indication about the future; a situation or occurrence thought of as portending good or evil. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:30:27-1:30:27" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ge 30:27;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:24:1-4:24:1" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Nu 24:1</a>) Looking for omens, as a form of divination, was specifically prohibited by God’s law to Israel. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:19:26-3:19:26" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Le 19:26;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:18:10-5:18:10" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> De 18:10</a>) But apostates like Judean King Manasseh did look for omens. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:17:17-12:17:17" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2Ki 17:17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:21:6-12:21:6" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 21:6</a>) Since this practice is condemned in the Scriptures, evidently faithful Joseph’s comment about use of his silver cup to read omens was merely part of a ruse. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:44:5-1:44:5" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ge 44:5,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:44:15-1:44:15" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 15</a>) By making the comment, Joseph represented himself, not as one having faith in Jehovah, but as an administrator of a land where false worship prevailed. He thus gave no hint of having anything in common with his brothers and kept his true identity concealed from them.​—See <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200001200/">DIVINATION</a>.</p>

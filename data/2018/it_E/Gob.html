<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A site where David’s men twice struck down giant warriors of the Philistines’ forces. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:21:18-10:21:19" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2Sa 21:18, 19</a>) The parallel narrative at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:20:4-13:20:4" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Chronicles 20:4</a> lists the place of the first encounter as “Gezer” (“Gath” in some copies of the Greek <em>Septuagint</em> and the Syriac <em>Peshitta</em>), while leaving the place of the second encounter unnamed. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:20:5-13:20:5" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1Ch 20:5</a>) Both accounts, however, show that a third confrontation took place at “Gath” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:21:20-10:21:20" data-bid="4-1" class="b">2Sa 21:20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:20:6-13:20:6" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 1Ch 20:6</a>), and therefore many scholars have assumed that “Gob” is a scribal error for “Gath.” To others, however, it seems unlikely that such an oversight would occur <em>twice</em> in consecutive verses, and they conclude that Gob may simply have been the name of a now unidentified site near Gezer.</p>

HARODITE
(Haʹrod·ite) [Of (Belonging to) Harod].
A resident of Harod or a person living near a place called Harod. The term is applied to Shammah and Elika, two of David’s mighty men. (2Sa 23:8, 25) If “Shammah” and “Shammoth” are the same person, then the use of “Harorite” at 1 Chronicles 11:27 is possibly a scribal error for “Harodite,” the change perhaps arising from the similarity between the Hebrew letters “r” (ר) and “d” (ד).

TIBERIAS
(Ti·beʹri·as).
1. A city founded by Herod Antipas about 18 C.E. and named after Tiberius Caesar, emperor of the Roman Empire at the time. It is still called Tiberias (Teverya) and is situated about 25 km (15 mi) ENE of Nazareth, on a comparatively narrow strip along the western shore of the Sea of Galilee, 210 m (690 ft) below the level of the Mediterranean. Tiberias was about 15 km (9.5 mi) around the sea from Capernaum and 9 km (5.5 mi) above where the Jordan leaves that body of water. Here Herod as the tetrarch made his residence. Nearby, to the S of the city, were famous warm springs. The city is mentioned only once in the Scriptures.​—Joh 6:23; PICTURE, Vol. 2, p. 739.
2. The Sea of Galilee (Yam Kinneret) was sometimes called Tiberias, after the city by that name located on its western shore.​—Joh 6:1; 21:1.

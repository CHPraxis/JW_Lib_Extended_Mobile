<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A uniting together of different parties, families, individuals, or states, whether by marriage, mutual agreement, or legal compact. An alliance usually implies resultant mutual benefit or the joint pursuit of a desired purpose. The Hebrew word <em>cha·varʹ</em> literally means “be joined” but is used figuratively to mean “be allied; have partnership.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:28:7-2:28:7" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ex 28:7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:94:20-19:94:20" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Ps 94:20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:20:35-14:20:35" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> 2Ch 20:35</a>) The related <em>cha·verʹ</em> denotes an ally or partner.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:20:11-7:20:11" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Jg 20:11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:119:63-19:119:63" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Ps 119:63</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Abraham entered into an early alliance with Mamre, Eshcol, and Aner of the Amorites. The nature of the confederacy is not stated, but they joined him in his march to rescue his nephew Lot from invading kings. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:14:13-1:14:24" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ge 14:13-24</a>) Abraham was then dwelling as an alien in land controlled by petty kingdoms, and in this case, some formal declaration in the form of a covenant may have been required of him as a prerequisite for peaceful residence in their midst. However, Abraham avoided unnecessarily obligating himself to such political rulers, as is manifest by his statement to the king of Sodom at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:14:21-1:14:24" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Genesis 14:21-24</a>. Later, at Gerar, the Philistine king Abimelech reminded Abraham of his alien status and that he resided in the land of Philistia by Abimelech’s consent, and he requested of him the swearing of an oath guaranteeing faithful conduct. Abraham acquiesced and later, following a water-rights dispute, made a covenant with Abimelech.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:20:1-1:20:1" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ge 20:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:20:15-1:20:15" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:21:22-1:21:34" data-bid="5-3" class="b"> 21:22-34</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Abraham’s son Isaac also came to dwell in Gerar, although he was later asked by Abimelech to move out of the immediate vicinity, and he willingly complied. Disputes over water rights again occurred, but thereafter Abimelech and his chief associates approached Isaac requesting an oath of obligation and a covenant, doubtless as a renewal of that made with Abraham. Sworn statements were made by both parties guaranteeing reciprocal peaceful conduct. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:26:16-1:26:16" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ge 26:16,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:26:19-1:26:22" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 19-22,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:26:26-1:26:31" data-bid="6-3" class="b"> 26-31</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:31:48-1:31:53" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ge 31:48-53</a>.)

<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">A different situation prevailed with the entry of the nation of Israel into Canaan, the Land of Promise. The Sovereign God had given Israel full right to the land in fulfillment of his promise to their forefathers. They were, therefore, not entering as alien residents, and Jehovah prohibited their making alliances with the pagan nations in the land.

Such alliances would intimately involve them not only with pagan wives but with pagan relatives and their false religious practices and customs, and this would result in apostasy and a snare.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:7:2-5:7:4" data-bid="11-1" class="b">De 7:2-4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:34:16-2:34:16" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> Ex 34:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:23:12-6:23:13" data-bid="11-3" class="b"> Jos 23:12, 13</a>.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><strong>Marriage Alliances.</strong> The Hebrew verb <em>cha·thanʹ,</em> meaning “form a marriage alliance,” is related to <em>cho·thenʹ</em> (father-in-law), <em>cha·thanʹ</em> (bridegroom; son-in-law), <em>cho·theʹneth</em> (mother-in-law), <span id="page76" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="76" data-before-text="76"></span>and <em>chathun·nahʹ</em> (marriage).​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:18:22-9:18:22" data-bid="12-1" class="b">1Sa 18:22;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:3:1-2:3:1" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> Ex 3:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:4:25-2:4:25" data-bid="12-3" class="b"> 4:25;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:19:14-1:19:14" data-bid="12-4" class="b"> Ge 19:14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:27:23-5:27:23" data-bid="12-5" class="b"> De 27:23;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/22:3:11-22:3:11" data-bid="12-6" class="b"> Ca 3:11</a>.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Abraham insisted that Isaac’s wife not be taken from among the Canaanites. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:24:3-1:24:4" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Ge 24:3, 4</a>) Isaac gave similar instruction to Jacob. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:28:1-1:28:1" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Ge 28:1</a>) At the time of Dinah’s violation by Shechem the Hivite, the family of Jacob was urged by Hamor, Shechem’s father, to enter into marriage alliances with that tribe.

<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">In the battle with Midian, the Israelites preserved alive only virgins from among the women and girls.

<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Marriage alliances were sometimes arranged with a view to achieving certain ends, as when David was invited by King Saul to form a marriage alliance with him by taking his daughter Michal as wife. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:18:21-9:18:27" data-bid="23-1" class="b">1Sa 18:21-27</a>) One of the six wives who later bore David sons at Hebron was the daughter of the king of Geshur (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:3:3-10:3:3" data-bid="24-1" class="b">2Sa 3:3</a>), and some consider this to be a marriage alliance entered into by David with a view to weakening the position of rival Ish-bosheth, since Geshur was a petty kingdom lying on the other side of Mahanaim, Ish-bosheth’s capital. Early in his reign King Solomon formed a marriage alliance with Pharaoh, taking his daughter as wife. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:3:1-11:3:1" data-bid="25-1" class="b">1Ki 3:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:9:16-11:9:16" data-bid="25-2" class="b"> 9:16</a>) This marriage, along with others to Moabite, Ammonite, Edomite, Sidonian, and Hittite women, eventually caused Solomon to succumb to gross idolatry. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:11:1-11:11:6" data-bid="26-1" class="b">1Ki 11:1-6</a>) King Ahab’s marriage alliance with the king of Sidon by marrying his daughter Jezebel brought similar disastrous results for the northern kingdom of Israel. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:16:31-11:16:33" data-bid="27-1" class="b">1Ki 16:31-33</a>) King Jehoshaphat thereafter formed an unwise marriage alliance with the idolatrous house of Ahab, with lasting bad consequences for the kingdom of Judah.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:18:1-14:18:1" data-bid="28-1" class="b">2Ch 18:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:21:4-14:21:6" data-bid="28-2" class="b"> 21:4-6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:22:2-14:22:4" data-bid="28-3" class="b"> 22:2-4</a>.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Following the exile, Ezra was shocked to find that even the priests and Levites had made marriage alliances with the Canaanites and others, a situation that was promptly corrected.

<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb"><strong>Covenants.</strong> Other alliances aside from marriage alliances were made, and these were generally in the form of a covenant. The covenant made with the Gibeonites was, of course, entered into by Israel because of a deception. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:9:3-6:9:15" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Jos 9:3-15</a>) Nevertheless, once made, the covenant was thereafter respected so that Israel was willing to fight to protect the Gibeonites.

<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb"><strong>Unwise Alliances With Other Nations.</strong> Though God’s prophets gave strong warnings against the forming of alliances with other nations, in times of danger or under the pressure of ambition the kings of Judah and Israel frequently ignored such warnings.

In a later period the religious Sadducees were especially prominent in favoring political collaboration as a means toward ultimate national independence. Neither they nor the Pharisees accepted the Kingdom message proclaimed by Christ Jesus but allied themselves with Rome, declaring: “We have no king but Caesar.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:19:12-43:19:15" data-bid="60-1" class="b">Joh 19:12-15</a>) Their religiopolitical alliance with Rome, however, ended in the disastrous destruction of Jerusalem in 70 C.E.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:19:41-42:19:44" data-bid="61-1" class="b">Lu 19:41-44;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:21:20-42:21:24" data-bid="61-2" class="b"> 21:20-24</a>.</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">Political and religious alliances are indicated in the symbolisms of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:17:1-66:17:2" data-bid="62-1" class="b">Revelation 17:1, 2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:17:10-66:17:18" data-bid="62-2" class="b"> 10-18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:18:3-66:18:3" data-bid="62-3" class="b"> 18:3</a>. (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:4:1-59:4:4" data-bid="63-1" class="b">Jas 4:1-4</a>.) Thus, throughout the Scriptural record the principle stated by Paul is stressed: “Do not become unevenly yoked with unbelievers. For what fellowship do righteousness and lawlessness have? Or what sharing does light have with darkness? . . . Get out from among them, and separate yourselves.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:6:14-47:6:17" data-bid="64-1" class="b">2Co 6:14-17</a>.</p>

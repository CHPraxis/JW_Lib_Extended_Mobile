ARVAD
(Arʹvad).
In Ezekiel’s prophetic dirge concerning Tyre reference is made to men from Arvad who served as skilled rowers in Tyre’s navy and as valorous warriors in her army. (Eze 27:8, 11) Arvad is identified with the small rocky island today known as Arwad, lying about 3 km (2 mi) off the coast of northern Syria, about 186 km (116 mi) NNE of Tyre. The inhabitants were descendants of Canaan.​—Ge 10:15, 18.

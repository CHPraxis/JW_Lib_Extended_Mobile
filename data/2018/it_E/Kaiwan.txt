KAIWAN
(Kaiʹwan).
Apparently a star-god, as indicated by the fact that the name Kaiwan is put in a parallelism with “the star of your god.” (Am 5:26) Evidently the Akkadian star kaimanu or kaiwanu is meant, since this occurs in Akkadian inscriptions as the name of Saturn (a star-god). In the Masoretic text the name was intentionally vowel pointed to correspond with the Hebrew word shiq·qutsʹ (disgusting thing). In the Greek Septuagint, “Kaiwan” is rendered Rhai·phanʹ, presumably the Egyptian designation for Saturn; and in Stephen’s quotation, at Acts 7:43, Rhom·phaʹ appears in the Westcott and Hort Greek text.​—See ASTROLOGERS; REPHAN.

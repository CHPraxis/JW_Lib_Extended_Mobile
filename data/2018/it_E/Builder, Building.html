<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon is known mainly for his military exploits. Nonetheless, he was a great builder. At Babylon he built many temples to false gods. He was also a notable builder of public works. His inscriptions concern themselves not with his military exploits but with his building projects, including temples, palaces, streets, embankments, and walls. He made Babylon the wonder city of the ancient world, and in all of Babylonia no building compared with the famous Hanging Gardens that King Nebuchadnezzar <span id="page373" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="373" data-before-text="373"></span>built to satisfy the homesick longings of his Median queen. Those gardens were rated as one of the seven wonders of the ancient world.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">King Herod the Great rebuilt the second temple of Jehovah at Jerusalem. Because of distrust on the part of the Jews, he was compelled to bring the materials in first, then to raze the second temple piecemeal as he constructed the new one. Due to their distrust and dislike of Herod, the Jews do not consider it the third temple, although it is often designated as such by others. By the year 30 C.E. reconstruction in the temple area had been under way for 46 years (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:2:20-43:2:20" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Joh 2:20</a>), and it continued for many more years.

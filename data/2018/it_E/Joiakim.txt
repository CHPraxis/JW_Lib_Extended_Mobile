JOIAKIM
(Joiʹa·kim) [shortened form of Jehoiakim, possibly meaning “Jehovah Raises Up”].
Son and evidently the successor of postexilic High Priest Jeshua. (Ne 12:10, 12, 26) He evidently held office at the time Ezra returned. (Jewish Antiquities, XI, 121 [v, 1]) However, by the time of Nehemiah’s arrival later (455 B.C.E.), Joiakim’s son Eliashib had become high priest.​—Ne 3:1.

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><strong>1.</strong> A torrent valley that served as a boundary between Ephraim and Manasseh. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:16:8-6:16:8" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Jos 16:8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:17:9-6:17:9" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 17:9</a>) Today it is usually linked with the Wadi Qanah (Nahal Qana). This small stream rises in the hill country a few kilometers SW of Nablus and, as the Wadi Ishkar, flows in a southwesterly direction and then joins the Wadi Yarkon (Nahal Yarqon), which empties into the Mediterranean Sea N of Tel Aviv-Yafo. However, some scholars believe that in Joshua’s day the lower course of the Wadi Qanah perhaps flowed directly into the Mediterranean at a point about 10 km (6 mi) farther N.</p>

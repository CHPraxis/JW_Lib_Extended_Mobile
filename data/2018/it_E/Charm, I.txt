CHARM, I
The Hebrew word chen has the meaning of favor, charm, or elegance, in form and conduct, and it is generally rendered “favor” (Ge 6:8), though in certain instances it is translated “charm.” For example, a prostitute may be “attractive with charm” (Na 3:4), but as observed in the Proverbs: “Charm may be false, and prettiness may be vain; but the woman that fears Jehovah is the one that procures praise for herself.” Also, “a woman of charm is the one that takes hold of glory.” (Pr 31:30; 11:16; see also Pr 5:18, 19.) Divine wisdom and understanding can be a real ornamental charm (Pr 3:21, 22; 4:7-9), as is also true of proper speech. (Ps 45:2; Pr 22:11) When the Jews returned from exile in Babylon, Zerubbabel was encouraged to press forward with the temple building, being assured that with the laying of the headstone, “there will be shoutings to it: ‘How charming! How charming!’”​—Zec 4:7.

JATTIR
(Jatʹtir) [from a root meaning “more than enough; overflow”].
A priestly city in the mountainous region of Judah. (Jos 15:20, 48; 21:9, 10, 14; 1Ch 6:54, 57) It was to Jattir that David sent a portion of the spoils of victory taken from Amalekite raiders. Perhaps this was in appreciation for hospitality and friendship accorded to him, a fugitive from King Saul.​—1Sa 30:17-20, 26, 27, 31.
Jattir is usually identified with Khirbet ʽAttir (Horvat Yattir), about 21 km (13 mi) SSW of Hebron.

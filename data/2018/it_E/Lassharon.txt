LASSHARON
(Las·sharʹon).
A royal Canaanite city whose king was defeated by the Israelites under Joshua. (Jos 12:7, 8, 18) Lassharon is often linked with the district called Sarona, situated, according to Eusebius, between Mount Tabor and the Sea of Galilee. Possibly modern Sarona (Sharona), about 10 km (6 mi) SW of Tiberias, marks the ancient site.

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Daniel used this Aramaic word when interpreting the handwriting on the wall, “MENE, MENE, TEKEL and PARSIN.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:5:25-27:5:25" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Da 5:25,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:5:28-27:5:28" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 28</a>) Dr. Judah Slotki points out that the handwriting means “a maneh, a maneh, a shekel and half shekels.” (<em>Soncino Books of the Bible,</em> edited by A. Cohen, London, 1951; see also <em>Peake’s Commentary on the Bible,</em> edited by M. Black and H. H. Rowley, London, 1964, p. 596.) Since “Peres” is the singular number of “Parsin,” it would mean “a half shekel.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">In the prophet’s interpretation of “Peres,” he employed two other Aramaic words spelled with the same three consonants but vocalized differently. “PERES [<em>Peresʹ</em>], your kingdom has been divided [<em>peri·sathʹ</em>] and given to the Medes and the Persians [<em>u·Pha·rasʹ</em>].” Thus the inspired explanation included a double play on the word “Peres” and the root meaning “divide.” The subsequent events of that night proved the accuracy of the interpretation.​—See <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200003389/">PARSIN</a>.</p>

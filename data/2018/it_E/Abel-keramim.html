<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The most distant point to which Jephthah pursued the Ammonites in their defeat. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:11:33-7:11:33" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Jg 11:33</a>) It is generally held to be situated between Heshbon and Rabbah, or Rabbah Ammon (modern ʽAmman). It is generally identified today with Khirbet es-Suq, about 8 km (5 mi) S of Rabbah (ʽAmman), which possibly fits Eusebius’ description. (<em>Onomasticon,</em> 32, 15-16) Some recommend Naʽur, about 14 km (9 mi) SW of Rabbah Ammon as the probable location.</p>

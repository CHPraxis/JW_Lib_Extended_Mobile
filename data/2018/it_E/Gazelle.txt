GAZELLE
[Heb., tseviʹ; tsevi·yahʹ (female gazelle); tsa·vaʼʹ; tseva·ʼahʹ (female gazelle); Gr., dor·kasʹ].
Any of a variety of swift and graceful small antelope. The Gazella dorcas, encountered in Arabia, Egypt, Palestine, and Syria, likely was familiar to the ancient Hebrews. This animal is about 1 m (3.5 ft) long and stands approximately 0.6 m (2 ft) high at the shoulder. Both male and female have lyre-shaped, ringed horns that may measure as much as 0.3 m (1 ft) in length. The general coloration of this gazelle is pale fawn, with dark and light stripes on the face and with white underparts and hindquarters. The hair is short and smooth. Another variety of gazelle with which the Israelites may have been acquainted is the somewhat larger, darker, fawn-colored Gazella arabica.​—PICTURE, Vol. 2, p. 955.
The speed of the gazelle, which ranks among the fastest of mammals, is alluded to in Scripture. (Ca 2:17; 8:14) The swiftness of Joab’s brother Asahel and of certain Gadites was likened to that of the gazelle. (2Sa 2:18; 1Ch 12:8) Babylon’s fall was foretold to cause her foreign supporters and hangers-on to flee like a gazelle to their respective lands. (Isa 13:14) This creature is also cited as an example of acting quickly so as to avoid being ensnared.​—Pr 6:5.
Probably with reference to its beauty and gracefulness, the gazelle figures in certain vivid descriptions contained in The Song of Solomon (2:9; 4:5; 7:3). The gazelle is also mentioned in the oath under which the Shulammite placed the daughters of Jerusalem, in effect obligating them by all that is beautiful and graceful.​—Ca 2:7; 3:5.
By the terms of the Law given through Moses, the gazelle could be used for food. (De 12:15, 22; 14:4, 5; 15:22) It constituted one of the regularly provided meats for Solomon’s sumptuous table.​—1Ki 4:22, 23.

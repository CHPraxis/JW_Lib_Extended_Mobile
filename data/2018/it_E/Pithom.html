<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">One of two storage cities built by the enslaved Israelites in Egypt, the other being Raamses. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:1:11-2:1:11" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ex 1:11</a>) No positive identification of the site has been made. Archaeologists have apparently been influenced in their conclusions by the popular view that the Pharaoh of the Israelite oppression was Ramses II, a view that is not soundly founded.​—See <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200003611/">RAAMSES, RAMESES</a>.</p>

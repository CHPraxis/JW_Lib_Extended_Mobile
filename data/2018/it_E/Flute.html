<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A musical instrument of the woodwind class. Although there is some dispute as to which modern musical instrument corresponds to the Hebrew <em>cha·lilʹ</em> and its Greek equivalent <em>au·losʹ,</em> many modern translations render the words as “flute,” in harmony with the identification given by lexicographers. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:10:5-9:10:5" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1Sa 10:5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:14:7-46:14:7" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 1Co 14:7</a>, <em>AT, JB, NW, RS</em>) The Hebrew root word from which <em>cha·lilʹ</em> is believed to have been derived signifies “pierce” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:51:9-23:51:9" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Isa 51:9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:53:5-23:53:5" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 53:5</a>), and it may refer to a process used to make a simple flute, namely, to drill out the center of a section of reed, cane, or even bone or ivory and then to perforate it at suitable intervals. Egyptian inscriptions indicate that a variety of flutelike instruments existed in that country. One type was held in an oblique position, with the mouth against the side of the instrument; they also developed a double flute, with the mouth at the end of the two pipes.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The Greek <em>au·losʹ</em> appears to have been used also as a general designation that included instruments of two types: those utilizing a reed in the mouthpiece, as well as simple flutelike pipes. <em>Cha·lilʹ</em> may also have come to be a general term for all woodwinds, but in modern Hebrew the name is applied only to the flute, and traditional Jewish belief is that the <em>cha·lilʹ</em> of Scripture was the flute.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The flute was one of the most popular of all musical instruments, being played at joyous times such as banquets and weddings (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:5:12-23:5:12" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Isa 5:12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:30:29-23:30:29" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 30:29;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:1:40-11:1:40" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> 1Ki 1:40</a>), a custom imitated by children in public places. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:11:16-40:11:17" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Mt 11:16, 17</a>) It was also played at times of sadness. Professional mourners were often accompanied by flutists playing mournful tunes.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:9:23-40:9:24" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Mt 9:23, 24</a>.</p>

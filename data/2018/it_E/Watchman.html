<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">One who guards against possible harm to persons or property, often during the night, and who may sound an alarm in the face of threatened danger. In military service a watchman is usually called a guard or sentry.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:51:12-24:51:12" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Jer 51:12</a>, ftn; <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:12:6-44:12:6" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ac 12:6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:28:16-44:28:16" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 28:16</a>; see <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200001775/">GUARD</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">As a protection against thieves and vandals, persons often were stationed to watch over ripening vineyards or flocks of animals, positioning themselves perhaps in booths or elevated <span id="page1172" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="1172" data-before-text="1172"></span>watchtowers built for that purpose.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:51:12-24:51:12" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Jer 51:12</a>) When King Saul was in the field camp with his army he also had personal watchmen whose responsibility was to look out for their king’s welfare.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:14:16-9:14:16" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1Sa 14:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:26:15-9:26:16" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 26:15, 16</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Watchmen were often stationed on the city walls and towers to observe those approaching before they got close.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/22:3:3-22:3:3" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ca 3:3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/22:5:7-22:5:7" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 5:7</a>) Fearful persons, awake during the dangerous hours of the night, might repeatedly inquire of the watchmen if all was well (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:21:11-23:21:12" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Isa 21:11, 12</a>), and it was only natural for watchmen themselves to long for the daylight to come. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:130:6-19:130:6" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ps 130:6</a>) Happy the city that, in addition to the watchmen, had Jehovah watching over it.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:127:1-19:127:1" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ps 127:1</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><strong>Figurative Use.</strong> Jehovah raised up prophets who served as figurative watchmen to the nation of Israel (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:6:17-24:6:17" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Jer 6:17</a>), and they, in turn, sometimes spoke of watchmen in a symbolic way.

Of course, if the people were unresponsive and failed to heed the warning, their blood was upon themselves.

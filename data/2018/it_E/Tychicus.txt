TYCHICUS
(Tychʹi·cus) [from a root meaning “fortune; success”].
One of Paul’s aides, a “beloved brother and faithful minister and fellow slave in the Lord” from the District of Asia. (Col 4:7) Tychicus was a member of Paul’s party returning from Greece through Macedonia into Asia Minor; but whether or not Tychicus went all the way to Jerusalem is not stated. (Ac 20:2-4) Tychicus is one of several persons suggested as “the brother” who, while in Greece, helped Titus to arrange the collection for the brothers in Judea. (2Co 8:18, 19; 12:18) From his prison in Rome, Paul sent Tychicus with letters to Ephesus and Colossae, promising that Tychicus would tell them more about his state of affairs and be of comfort to them; Onesimus is mentioned in the letter to the Colossians as accompanying him. (Eph 6:21, 22; Col 4:7-9) Following Paul’s release from prison, he contemplated sending either Artemas or Tychicus to Crete. (Tit 3:12) When the apostle was back in a Roman prison for the second time, he dispatched Tychicus to Ephesus.​—2Ti 4:12.

ACCIDENT, ACCIDENTAL
Unforeseen occurrences that result from ignorance, carelessness, or unavoidable events and that cause loss or injury are commonly called accidents. The Hebrew word ʼa·sohnʹ evidently literally means “a healing” and is used as a euphemism for “a fatal accident.” (Compare Ge 42:4, ftn.) The Hebrew miq·rehʹ, which is derived from a root that means “meet; befall” (Ge 44:29; De 25:18), is rendered not only “accident” (1Sa 6:9) but also “eventuality” (Ec 2:14, 15; 3:19) and “by chance.”​—Ru 2:3.
Jacob feared that a fatal accident might befall his beloved son Benjamin if allowed to go to Egypt with his brothers. (Ge 42:4, 38) The Philistines returned the ark of Jehovah to prove whether the plague of piles they suffered really was from Jehovah or was just “an accident.” (1Sa 6:9) Solomon recognized that anyone may become a victim of unforeseen occurrence.​—Ec 9:11.
The Mosaic Law differentiated between an accident that proved fatal and one that was not. (Ex 21:22-25) It also distinguished between killing intentionally and unintentionally. For deliberate murder, capital punishment was mandatory; for those guilty of accidental homicide, cities of refuge were set up. (Nu 35:11-25, 31; see CITIES OF REFUGE.) The law applied equally to native Israelite and alien resident, and instructions for the necessary sacrifices to atone for accidental or unintentional sins were provided.​—Le 4:1-35; 5:14-19; Nu 15:22-29.

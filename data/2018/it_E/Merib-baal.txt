MERIB-BAAL
(Merʹib-baʹal) [possibly, Contender Against Baal; or, Baal Makes a Legal Defense].
Grandson of King Saul, son of Jonathan, and the father of Micah. (1Ch 8:33, 34) This is apparently another name for Mephibosheth. Other persons also had two names, such as Eshbaal, also called Ish-bosheth.​—Compare 2Sa 2:8 with 1Ch 8:33.
The name Merib-baal is found in two somewhat different Hebrew forms (Merivʹ baʹʽal and Meri-vaʹʽal) at 1 Chronicles 9:40. The first form is also used at 1 Chronicles 8:34. Indicating similar identity is the fact that Mephibosheth had a boy named Mica and Merib-baal had a son named Micah. (Compare 2Sa 9:12 with 1Ch 9:40.) The forms “Mica” and “Micah” are due merely to a slight variation in the Hebrew spelling of these names.

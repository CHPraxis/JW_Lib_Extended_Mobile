SIBMAH
(Sibʹmah).
A town E of the Jordan, taken by Israel from Amorite King Sihon and assigned to the Reubenites, who desired it because of surrounding pasturelands. Apparently it was also called Sebam. (Nu 32:2-5, 37, 38; Jos 13:15, 19, 21) Originally a city of the Moabites (compare Nu 21:25, 26), it reverted to them at an undisclosed time. It was noted for its vineyards and summer fruitage. (Isa 16:8, 9, 13, 14; Jer 48:32, 46, 47) The exact location of Sibmah (Sebam) is now unknown, though it is mentioned with Heshbon and Nebo (Nu 32:3), and Jerome’s commentary on Isaiah 16:8 says that it was only about 500 paces from Heshbon. However, some tentatively identify it with Qurn el-Kibsh, about 5 km (3 mi) WSW of Heshbon (modern Hisban).

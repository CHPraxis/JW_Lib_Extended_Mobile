ABDA
(Abʹda) [Servant].
1. The father of Adoniram. (1Ki 4:6) His son, Adoniram, was a prince over those conscripted for forced labor during David’s, Solomon’s, and Rehoboam’s reigns, and is evidently the Adoram, or Hadoram, referred to in other texts. (2Sa 20:24; 1Ki 12:18; 2Ch 10:18) Hence, Abda probably was a contemporary of King David.
2. A descendant of Jeduthun, of the tribe of Levi. (Ne 11:17, 18) Abda the Levite is evidently the same as the “Obadiah” mentioned at 1 Chronicles 9:16. He was among the exiles to return to Jerusalem from Babylon.

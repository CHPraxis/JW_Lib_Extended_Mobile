<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Generally, a heating device consisting of a panlike receptacle elevated off the ground by means of legs and designed for holding burning coals or charcoal. The Hebrew word rendered “brazier” (<em>ʼach</em>) is of Egyptian origin, suggesting that the brazier itself was an innovation from Egypt.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">It appears that in the better homes the brazier was preferred to a depression in the floor of the house, in which a fire could be built. King Jehoiakim had a brazier, likely one made of metal, in his winter house.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:36:22-24:36:23" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Jer 36:22, 23</a>.</p>

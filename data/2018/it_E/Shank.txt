SHANK
The lower part of the leg, between the knee and the ankle. In each appearance of the word in the Bible, the limb of an animal is referred to, usually with reference to animals prepared for sacrifice. (Le 1:9, 13; 4:11, 12; 8:21; 9:14) The Hebrew term rendered “shanks” is once used for the “leaper legs” of winged swarming creatures. (Le 11:21) At Amos 3:12, Jehovah’s prophet uses the figure of a shepherd snatching two shanks away from the mouth of a lion (evidently to exonerate himself from responsibility for the loss of one of his herd). Here the prophet graphically portrays the destruction coming upon Samaria, particularly the leaders thereof. There would be very few who would escape the lionlike devouring by Samaria’s enemies.

HALAK, MOUNT
(Haʹlak) [Smooth Mountain].
A mountain marking the southern geographic limit of Israel’s conquest of the Promised Land under the leadership of Joshua. (Jos 11:16, 17; 12:7) Halak is generally identified with Jebel Halaq (Har He-Halaq), the last W Palestinian height on the road from Beer-sheba to the Arabah. The range that begins with Jebel Halaq divides the pastureland on the E from the sandy desert on the W. If this identification is correct, then the Biblical description of Halak as ‘going up,’ or ‘rising,’ toward Seir may mean that the broad side of this mountain, running from SW to NE, faces Seir.

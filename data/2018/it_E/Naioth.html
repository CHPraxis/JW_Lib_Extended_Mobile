<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Seemingly a place where certain prophets resided in the time of Samuel. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:19:18-9:20:1" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1Sa 19:18–20:1</a>) It may refer to a certain locality or quarter of the town of Ramah, in the hill country of Ephraim. (See <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200003630/">RAMAH</a> No. 5.) Textual critic S. R. Driver corroborates this view, observing: “Probably it is the name of some locality in Ramah, the signification of which is lost to us.”​—<em>Notes on the Hebrew Text and the Topography of the Books of Samuel,</em> Oxford, 1966, p. 159.</p>

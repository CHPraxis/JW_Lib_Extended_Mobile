DIPHATH
(Diʹphath).
A descendant of Noah through Japheth and Gomer; called Riphath in the Latin Vulgate, the Greek Septuagint, and about 30 Hebrew manuscripts, as well as at Genesis 10:3. (1Ch 1:4-6, ftn) The spelling “Diphath” found in the Masoretic text at 1 Chronicles 1:6 may have arisen through a copyist’s error, since the Hebrew letters for “R” (ר) and “D” (ד) look very much alike.

JAHZEIAH
(Jah·zeiʹah) [May Jah Behold; Jah Has Beheld].
One who perhaps opposed Ezra’s proposal that the sons of Israel send away their foreign wives and the children born to them; son of Tikvah. (Ezr 10:3, 10, 11, 15) However, it has been suggested that this opposition of Jahzeiah and Jonathan was not against Ezra’s suggestion but against the procedure adopted for carrying it out. According to the Greek Septuagint and Latin Vulgate, Jahzeiah and the others assisted rather than opposed Ezra. Hence, an alternate rendering of Ezra 10:15 says that Jonathan and Jahzeiah “were the ones that acted representatively in this behalf.”​—NW ftn; see also KJ; AS, ftn; Dy; Kx.

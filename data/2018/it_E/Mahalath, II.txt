MAHALATH, II
(Maʹha·lath).
Probably a musical term, perhaps one of a technical nature, found in the superscriptions of Psalms 53 and 88. Some believe that this term may be related to a Hebrew root verb meaning “grow weak; fall sick,” thereby suggesting a gloomy and melancholy tune. This would harmonize with the somewhat somber content of the two songs, particularly that of Psalm 88.

SEPHARVAIM
(Seph·ar·vaʹim).
A city from which the king of Assyria brought people to dwell in Samaria after the Israelites had been taken into exile. (2Ki 17:24) Earlier, Sepharvaim and its king appear to have experienced defeat at the hands of the Assyrians. (2Ki 19:13; Isa 37:13) Being mentioned along with places in Syria and Babylonia, Sepharvaim was perhaps in one of these areas.

AHITUB
(A·hiʹtub) [My Brother Is Goodness].
1. A descendant of Aaron’s son Ithamar; son of Phinehas and grandson of High Priest Eli. (1Sa 14:3; 1Ch 24:3) Following the death of his father and grandfather on the same day, Ahitub possibly officiated as high priest. (1Sa 4:17, 18) His son, High Priest Ahimelech, was slain at Saul’s command.​—1Sa 22:9-20.
2. Son of Amariah, a descendant of Aaron’s son Eleazar. (1Ch 6:3-8) There is no indication that he acted as high priest; this office was in the line of Ithamar at the time. Ahitub’s son Zadok served as a secondary priest, not as high priest, during the reign of David, and then was assigned to replace Abiathar as high priest during the reign of Solomon.​—2Sa 8:17; 1Ch 18:16; 1Ki 1:8; 2:27.
3. Another priest who descended from Ahitub No. 2. Genealogical listings are interrupted to call him “a leader of the house of the true God.” (1Ch 9:11; Ne 11:11) His father’s name was also Amariah, and from 1 Chronicles 9:11 and Nehemiah 11:11 it appears that his son was Meraioth and his grandson was Zadok.​—1Ch 6:11, 12; Ezr 7:2.

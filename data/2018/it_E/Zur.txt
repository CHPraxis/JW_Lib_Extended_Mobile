ZUR
[Rock].
1. One of the five kings of Midian at the time Israel approached the Promised Land. Zur is also called a chieftain and “a head one of the clans of a paternal house,” as well as a ‘duke of Sihon.’ His daughter Cozbi was the Midianitess whom Zimri took for immoral relations and whom Phinehas slew. Zur himself was killed when the Israelites punished Midian for luring some men of Israel into immoral intercourse and false worship.​—Nu 25:14-18; 31:1, 2, 7, 8; Jos 13:21.
2. A Benjamite, son of Jeiel and evidently a brother of Ner, Saul’s grandfather.​—1Ch 8:29, 30; 9:35, 36, 39.

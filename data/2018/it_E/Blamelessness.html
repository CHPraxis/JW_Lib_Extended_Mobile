<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">One Hebrew word rendered “blameless” is <em>tam.</em> It is used regarding the exemplary moral standing of Job and concerning the flawless beauty of the Shulammite. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:1:1-18:1:1" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Job 1:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:1:8-18:1:8" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/22:5:2-22:5:2" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> Ca 5:2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/22:6:9-22:6:9" data-bid="1-4" class="b"> 6:9</a>) By reason of his peaceful, quiet life in tents as contrasted with his brother’s wild, adventurous life as a hunter, Jacob was said to be blameless. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:25:27-1:25:27" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ge 25:27</a>) Another Hebrew word at times rendered “blameless” is <em>ta·mimʹ,</em> having the sense of being “faultless; sound; perfect.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:2:21-20:2:21" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Pr 2:21;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:11:5-20:11:5" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 11:5,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:11:20-20:11:20" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> 20</a>) The Hebrew words <em>tam</em> and <em>ta·mimʹ</em> come from the root verb <em>ta·mamʹ,</em> which has the meaning “be complete, completed; come to perfection; come to a finish.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:19:13-19:19:13" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ps 19:13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:6:22-11:6:22" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 1Ki 6:22;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:18:5-23:18:5" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> Isa 18:5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:24:10-24:24:10" data-bid="4-4" class="b"> Jer 24:10</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:16:11-9:16:11" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1Sa 16:11</a>, where the phrase translated “Are these all the boys?” literally means “Are the boys completed?”) In the Greek <em>Septuagint,</em> the Hebrew word <em>tam</em> is sometimes translated <em>aʹmem·ptos.</em> (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:1:1-18:1:1" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Job 1:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:1:8-18:1:8" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:2:3-18:2:3" data-bid="6-3" class="b"> 2:3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:9:20-18:9:20" data-bid="6-4" class="b"> 9:20</a>) Forms of this word also appear in the Christian Greek Scriptures and may be defined as “blameless; faultless.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:1:6-42:1:6" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Lu 1:6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:3:6-50:3:6" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> Php 3:6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:8:7-58:8:7" data-bid="7-3" class="b"> Heb 8:7</a>; see <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200003440/">PERFECTION</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">When used in describing humans, the term “blameless” must always be viewed as relative, not absolute. Suffering Job drew wrong conclusions about Jehovah, including how the Almighty regarded blameless ones. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:9:20-18:9:22" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Job 9:20-22</a>) Zechariah, the father of John the Baptizer, manifested lack of faith in Jehovah’s declaration through the angel Gabriel. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:1:18-42:1:20" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Lu 1:18-20</a>) Still, Job and Zechariah were said to be blameless, for they measured up to what Jehovah expected of humans who, though faithful, were marred by imperfection.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:1:1-18:1:1" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Job 1:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:1:6-42:1:6" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> Lu 1:6</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">From the standpoint of his Jewish contemporaries, Paul was blameless before he became a disciple of Jesus Christ. He did what the Law commanded, fulfilling the obligations placed upon him and refraining from what was forbidden. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:3:6-50:3:6" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Php 3:6</a>) But Paul did not then enjoy a blameless standing before Jehovah. He was guilty of grave sin as a persecutor of Christ’s brothers and was a blasphemer and an insolent man.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:1:13-54:1:13" data-bid="12-1" class="b">1Ti 1:13,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:1:15-54:1:15" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> 15</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The Most High takes pleasure in those whose conduct is a reflection of their spiritual soundness, their purity, their blamelessness. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:11:20-20:11:20" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Pr 11:20</a>) So it is vital that Christians live in a manner that is blameless, free from justifiable censure.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:2:15-50:2:15" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Php 2:15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/52:5:23-52:5:23" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> 1Th 5:23</a>.</p>

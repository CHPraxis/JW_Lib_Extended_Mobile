ZELA(H)
(Zeʹla[h]) [possibly from a root meaning “rib; side”].
A city in Benjamin. (Jos 18:21, 28) The bones of Saul and Jonathan were buried at Zela. Earlier, Saul’s father Kish had been interred there. (2Sa 21:14) Its exact location is unknown. Some scholars think that in Joshua “Zelah” should be combined with the name that follows, “Ha-eleph”; however, see HA-ELEPH.

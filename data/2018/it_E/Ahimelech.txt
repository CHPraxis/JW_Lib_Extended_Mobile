AHIMELECH
(A·himʹe·lech).
1. Son of Ahitub and great-grandson of Eli; high priest at the tabernacle located at Nob. Because of giving aid to David, not knowing he was a fugitive from Saul, Ahimelech (along with 84 other priests of Jehovah as well as the men, women, and children of Nob) was massacred by the Edomite Doeg. Abiathar was the only son of Ahimelech to escape. (1Sa chaps 21, 22) David, later composing Psalm 52, recounted Doeg’s heinous act. (Ps 52:Sup) Jesus too recalled David’s experience with Ahimelech.​—Mt 12:3, 4; Mr 2:25, 26; Lu 6:3, 4; see AHIJAH No. 3.
2. Son of Abiathar and grandson of Ahimelech, whom Doeg killed.​—1Ch 18:16; 24:3, 6, 31.
3. A Hittite who was invited but who did not accompany David when he slipped into Saul’s camp at night.​—1Sa 26:6, 7.

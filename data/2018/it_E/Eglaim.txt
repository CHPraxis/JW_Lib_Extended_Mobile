EGLAIM
(Eg·laʹim).
Evidently one of the geographic extremities of Moab that, according to Isaiah 15:1, 8, was due to ‘howl’ over that nation’s despoiling. The exact location of the ancient site is uncertain. However, the name Eglaim and a similar name, Agallim, mentioned by Eusebius (Onomasticon, 36, 19-21) as about 12 km (7.5 mi) S of Rabbath-Moab, may be preserved at Rujm el-Jilimeh in that area or at Khirbet Jeljul, a location dating from Nabataean-Roman times, 7 km (4 mi) farther south. Yohanan Aharoni suggests identifying it with Mazraʽ, an oasis NE of the Lisan Peninsula.

ONO
(Oʹno).
A city built evidently by the Benjamite Shemed, ‘son’ of Elpaal. (1Ch 8:1, 12) After the Babylonian exile Ono was reoccupied by Benjamites. (Ezr 2:1, 33; Ne 7:6, 37; 11:31, 35) Kafr ʽAna (Ono), about 11 km (7 mi) ESE of Joppa, is identified with the ancient site. This location is just a few kilometers from the suggested sites of ancient Lod and Hadid. “The valley plain of Ono” (Ne 6:2) possibly denotes the wide valley in which Kafr ʽAna lies. This “valley plain” has also been associated with “the valley of the craftsmen [geh ha·chara·shimʹ].” (Ne 11:35) But some scholars understand the Hebrew geh ha·chara·shimʹ to designate another location and transliterate it as a proper name, “Ge-harashim.”​—JP; compare 1Ch 4:14.

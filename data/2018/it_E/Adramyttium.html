<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">(Ad·ra·mytʹti·um).</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A seaport city on the Aegean Sea, located in Mysia at the NW corner of Asia Minor, N of Pergamum. In modern Turkey the inland town of Edremit (E of the harbor) preserves the earlier name.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Adramyttium was part of the province of Asia under Roman rule and was evidently at one time a maritime commercial center of some importance, since it lay on the Roman road that passed through Pergamum and Ephesus to the S and Assos, Troas, and the Hellespont to the W and N. It is likely that Paul passed through Adramyttium on his third missionary tour. The only direct Bible reference to the place, however, is at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:27:2-44:27:2" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Acts 27:2</a>. At Caesarea, Paul, as a prisoner in the custody of the Roman officer Julius, boarded a ship from Adramyttium that was sailing to points along the coast of Asia Minor. Paul’s party left the ship at Myra in Lycia, transferring to a grain boat from Alexandria that was sailing for Italy.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:27:3-44:27:6" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ac 27:3-6</a>.</p>

BAAL-HAZOR
(Baʹal-haʹzor) [Owner of the Courtyard (Settlement)].
A place near “Ephraim” (perhaps the city of Ephrain[m] mentioned at 2Ch 13:19; compare Joh 11:54) that served as the site of Absalom’s sheepshearing festival in which he maneuvered the death of his brother Amnon. (2Sa 13:23, 28) It is identified with the 1,032-m-high (3,386 ft) mountain Jebel ʽAsur (Baʽal Hazor), about 8 km (5 mi) NE of Bethel. From Baal-hazor Absalom fled to the small kingdom of Geshur, E of the Sea of Galilee.

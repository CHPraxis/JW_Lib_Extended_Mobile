<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">One of two rocks, or toothlike crags, associated with Jonathan’s victory over the Philistines, recorded at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:14:4-9:14:14" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Samuel 14:4-14</a>. Jonathan, looking for a passage to cross over to attack the Philistine outpost, saw the two crags, one on the N facing Michmash (where the Philistines were encamped), the other on the S facing Geba. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:13:16-9:13:16" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1Sa 13:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:14:5-9:14:5" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 14:5</a>) Between these two cities the Wadi Suweinit (Nahal Mikhmas) descends toward the Jordan and becomes a deep gorge with nearly vertical cliffs somewhat to the E of the cities. The location of the two crags is considered to have been at the point where the wadi makes a sharp bend, though the precise identification of the crags is conjectural.</p>

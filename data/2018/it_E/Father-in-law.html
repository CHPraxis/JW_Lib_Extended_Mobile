<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">In the Hebrew Scriptures, the word <em>cham</em> designates the husband’s father (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:38:13-1:38:13" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ge 38:13,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:38:25-1:38:25" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 25;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:4:19-9:4:19" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> 1Sa 4:19,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:4:21-9:4:21" data-bid="1-4" class="b"> 21</a>), and its feminine form, <em>cha·mohthʹ,</em> the husband’s mother (the wife’s mother-in-law).​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/8:1:14-8:1:14" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ru 1:14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/33:7:6-33:7:6" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Mic 7:6</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The Hebrew verb <em>cha·thanʹ</em> means “form a marriage alliance.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:7:3-5:7:3" data-bid="3-1" class="b">De 7:3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:18:20-9:18:27" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 1Sa 18:20-27;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:3:1-11:3:1" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> 1Ki 3:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:18:1-14:18:1" data-bid="3-4" class="b"> 2Ch 18:1</a>) The father-in-law on the bride’s side, the wife’s father, is designated by a masculine participial form of <em>cha·thanʹ.</em> Its feminine participial form refers to mother-in-law.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:27:23-5:27:23" data-bid="4-1" class="b">De 27:23</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Because an engaged couple were considered as bound although the couple had not yet come together in marriage, the woman was spoken of as the man’s wife. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:14:20-7:14:20" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Jg 14:20</a>) Therefore, the man was called “son-in-law” (a noun drawn from <em>cha·thanʹ</em> being used) regardless of whether the marriage alliance had been fully consummated (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:19:5-7:19:5" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Jg 19:5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:22:14-9:22:14" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 1Sa 22:14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:6:18-16:6:18" data-bid="6-3" class="b"> Ne 6:18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:13:28-16:13:28" data-bid="6-4" class="b"> 13:28</a>) or was only contemplated, as in the case of Lot’s “sons-in-law.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:19:12-1:19:12" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ge 19:12,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:19:14-1:19:14" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 14</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:15:6-7:15:6" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Jg 15:6</a>.) Lot’s daughters were only betrothed; otherwise they would most likely have been with their husbands and not living in their father’s house. That the two men were only prospective, not actual, sons-in-law (engaged to Lot’s daughters but not as yet married to them) is indicated by the Hebrew, which allows for the rendering: “[Lot’s] sons-in-law who <em>were to take</em> [or, were intending to take] his daughters.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:19:14-1:19:14" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ge 19:14</a>, <em>NW; Ro;</em> compare <em>JB; Mo; RS.</em></p>

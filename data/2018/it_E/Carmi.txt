CARMI
(Carʹmi) [possibly, Vinedresser].
1. A son of Reuben and the brother of Hanoch, Pallu, and Hezron; forefather of the Carmites. Carmi, with the rest of Jacob’s household, came to Egypt.​—Ge 46:9; Ex 6:14; Nu 26:6; 1Ch 5:3.
2. Father of Achan; a descendant of Judah and Tamar through Zerah and Zabdi. (Jos 7:1, 18) The designation “sons of Judah” at 1 Chronicles 4:1, where Carmi is listed, evidently is to be understood as including later descendants.​—Compare 1Ch 2:4-7.

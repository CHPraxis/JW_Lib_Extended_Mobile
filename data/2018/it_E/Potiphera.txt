POTIPHERA
(Pot·iʹphe·ra) [from Egyptian, meaning “He Whom Ra Has Given”].
Joseph’s father-in-law, whose daughter Asenath bore Manasseh and Ephraim. (Ge 41:45, 50; 46:20) Potiphera was the priest, likely of the sun-god Ra, officiating at On, a center of Egyptian sun worship. In the Cairo Museum there is a stele, a funeral pillar, procured in 1935, that has on it the name “Putiphar.”​—Annales du service des antiquités de lʼÉgypte, Cairo, 1939, Vol. XXXIX, pp. 273-276.

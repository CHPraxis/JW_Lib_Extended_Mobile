<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">(Beʹer) [Well].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The Hebrew word <em>beʼerʹ</em> usually refers to a well in contrast to a natural spring (Heb., <em>ʽaʹyin</em>). It commonly occurs in compound place-names.​—Compare <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200000609/">BEER-ELIM</a>; <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200000615/">BEER-SHEBA</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><strong>1.</strong> After passing the Arnon on their approach to the Promised Land, the Israelites came to Beer. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:21:13-4:21:16" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Nu 21:13-16</a>) Here a well was dug, apparently by the princely heads of the tribes, using their own staffs, and water sprang up. This event was cause for the poetic song set forth in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:21:17-4:21:18" data-bid="2-1" class="b">verses 17, 18</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Due to the part played by the princes in the digging of the well, some suggest that this is the same place as Beer-elim (meaning “Well of the Big Trees”). (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:15:8-23:15:8" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Isa 15:8</a>) The location is uncertain, but it is considered likely to have been in the torrent <span id="page276" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="276" data-before-text="276"></span>valley called the Wadi Thamad, N of the Arnon and some 56 km (35 mi) E of the Dead Sea. Water is often found here quite easily by scooping out the soil.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><strong>2.</strong> A place to which Jotham, Gideon’s (Jerubbaal’s) son, fled after exposing Abimelech’s treachery. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:9:3-7:9:5" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Jg 9:3-5,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:9:21-7:9:21" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 21</a>) Al-Bira, about 12 km (7.5 mi) N of Beth-shan and SE of Mount Tabor, is suggested by some as the probable location; others connect it with Beeroth. (See <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200000612/">BEEROTH</a>.) In view of the absence of any indication of the direction of Jotham’s flight from Mount Gerizim, however, the identification is uncertain.</p>

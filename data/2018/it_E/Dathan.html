<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Son of Eliab of the tribe of Reuben and the brother of Abiram and Nemuel. Dathan and Abiram supported the Levite Korah in his rebellion against the authority of Moses and Aaron and, in effect, challenged Jehovah’s promises by referring to Egypt as the “land flowing with milk and honey.” Because of their rebellion, Dathan and Abiram as well as their households perished when the ground swallowed them up.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:16:1-4:16:35" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Nu 16:1-35;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:26:7-4:26:11" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 26:7-11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:11:6-5:11:6" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> De 11:6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:106:17-19:106:17" data-bid="1-4" class="b"> Ps 106:17</a>; see <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200000048/">ABIRAM</a> No. 1.</p>

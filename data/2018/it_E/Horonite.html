<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A designation applied to Sanballat, one of the men opposing the work of Nehemiah.

But the view generally favored is that “Horonite” probably means a native, or inhabitant, of Beth-horon. Both Upper and Lower Beth-horon were located in territory originally assigned to Ephraim.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:16:1-6:16:1" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Jos 16:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:16:3-6:16:3" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 3,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:16:5-6:16:5" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> 5</a>.</p>

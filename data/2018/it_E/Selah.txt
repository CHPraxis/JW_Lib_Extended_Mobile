SELAH
(Seʹlah).
A transliterated Hebrew expression found frequently in the Psalms and also appearing in Habakkuk chapter 3. Although it is generally thought to be a technical term for music or recitation, its exact significance is unknown. It is held by some to mean a “pause, suspension, or holding back,” either of the singing of the psalm for a musical interlude or of both singing and instrumental music for silent meditation. In either event, the pause was doubtless used to make the fact or sentiment just expressed more impressive, to allow the full import of the last utterance to sink in. The Greek Septuagint rendering of Selah is di·aʹpsal·ma, defined as “a musical interlude.” Selah always appears at the end of a clause and generally at the end of a strophe, every occurrence being in a song containing some kind of musical direction or expression. In Psalm 9:16 it is accompanied by “Higgaion,” there understood by some to be associated with the music of the harp.

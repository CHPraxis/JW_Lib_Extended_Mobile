HUPPIM
(Hupʹpim).
A son, or descendant, of Benjamin included in the list of those who came into Egypt with Jacob’s household in 1728 B.C.E. or were born there during Jacob’s lifetime. (Ge 46:8, 21) Other passages suggest that he was either a grandson or great-grandson through Bela and Iri. (1Ch 7:6, 7, 12; in 8:1-5 he is apparently called Huram.) Time barely allows for Benjamin to have had grandsons when entering Egypt, but Genesis 46:8 might be understood to indicate that all these souls had been born while Jacob was still alive even down in Egypt, not necessarily born before he and his household went there. (See BENJAMIN No. 1.) The family that Huppim (also called Hupham) founded, called Huphamites, is numbered among the tribe of Benjamin in the second wilderness census of the Israelites. (Nu 26:1-4, 38, 39) Huppim is mentioned also at 1 Chronicles 7:14, 15 in association with Manasseh, but the connection is unclear.

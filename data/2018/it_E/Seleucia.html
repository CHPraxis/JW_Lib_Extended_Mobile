<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A fortified Mediterranean port town serving Syrian Antioch and located about 20 km (12 mi) SW of that city. The two sites were connected by road; and the navigable Orontes River, which flowed past Antioch, emptied into the Mediterranean Sea a short distance S of Seleucia. Accompanied by Barnabas, Paul sailed from Seleucia at the start of his first missionary journey, in about 47 C.E. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:13:4-44:13:4" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ac 13:4</a>) Though thereafter unnamed in the Acts account, Seleucia likely figured in events narrated therein. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:14:26-44:14:26" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ac 14:26;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:15:30-44:15:41" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 15:30-41</a>) To distinguish this city from other similarly named sites in the ancient Middle East, it is sometimes called Seleucia Pieria. It was just N of modern-day Süveydiye, or Samandag, in Turkey. Silt from the Orontes has converted ancient Seleucia’s harbor into a marsh.</p>

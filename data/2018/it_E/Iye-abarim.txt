IYE-ABARIM
(Iʹye-abʹa·rim) [Ruins of the Fords (Crossings); Ruins of the Borderland (Regions Beyond)].
One of Israel’s wilderness encampments. Its exact location is uncertain, but it was evidently on the southern border of Moab and near the torrent valley of Zered. (Nu 21:11, 12; 33:44) Perhaps Iye-abarim marked the southernmost point of the Abarim region. (Nu 33:47, 48; see ABARIM.) Yohanan Aharoni suggests an identification with el-Medeiyineh at the ford of the Brook Zered, about 60 km (37 mi) S of Dibon-gad, the next encampment listed.​—The Land of the Bible, 1979, pp. 202, 436.

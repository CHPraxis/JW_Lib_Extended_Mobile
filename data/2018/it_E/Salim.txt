SALIM
(Saʹlim).
A place mentioned at John 3:23 to help locate Aenon, where John the Baptizer immersed persons. Hence, Salim must have been well known at the time. Today its situation is uncertain, but Tell Ridgha (Tel Shalem), about 12 km (7 mi) S of Beth-shean, has been suggested as a possible identification.​—See AENON.

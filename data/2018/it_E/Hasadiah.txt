HASADIAH
(Has·a·diʹah) [Loving-Kindness of Jah; Jah Is Loving-Kindness].
One of Zerubbabel’s sons. The fact that the sons of Zerubbabel are listed in two different groups (the first two names being separated from the other five by the mention of Shelomith in the genealogy of King David’s descendants) may possibly mean that they were sons of different mothers.​—1Ch 3:1, 19, 20.

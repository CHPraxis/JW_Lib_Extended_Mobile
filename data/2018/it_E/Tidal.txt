TIDAL
(Tiʹdal).
The king of Goiim and an ally of Elamite King Chedorlaomer when they and two other monarchs subjugated five kings near the Dead Sea. Following 12 years of domination, the five defeated kings staged a rebellion. Tidal, Chedorlaomer, and the others came W to put it down, and in doing so took spoil and captives, including Abraham’s nephew Lot. Abraham pursued the oppressors and recovered the prisoners and pillaged goods, but there is no indication that Tidal or those kings with him were captured or slain.​—Ge 14:1-17.

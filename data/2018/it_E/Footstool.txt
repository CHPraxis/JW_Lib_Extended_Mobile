FOOTSTOOL
A low stool, designed to serve as a rest or a support for the feet when the individual is seated. The Hebrew word keʹvesh appears only once in the Scriptures and is used with reference to the gold footstool of King Solomon’s throne. (2Ch 9:18) The Hebrew expression hadhomʹ ragh·laʹyim (literally, “stool of the feet”) occurs six times and is used figuratively to refer to the temple (1Ch 28:2; Ps 99:5; 132:7; La 2:1), to the earth (Isa 66:1), and to the enemies to be crushed by Messiah’s rule (Ps 110:1). James reproves those practicing class distinctions in the congregation, using the illustration of a poor man who was told: “Take that seat there under my footstool.” (Jas 2:3) All other occurrences of the word “footstool” in the Christian Greek Scriptures are quotations from or references to the Hebrew Scriptures.​—Mt 5:35; Ac 7:49; “stool for your [or, his] feet” in Lu 20:43; Ac 2:35; Heb 1:13; 10:13.

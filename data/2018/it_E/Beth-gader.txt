BETH-GADER
(Beth-gaʹder) [House of the Stone Wall].
A name appearing in the genealogy of Judah. (1Ch 2:50, 51) The name appears to be more geographic than personal, causing some scholars to regard it as relating to a town in Judah. Beth-gader may possibly be linked with Geder, a town whose king was among those conquered by Joshua in the region W of the Jordan.​—Jos 12:13.

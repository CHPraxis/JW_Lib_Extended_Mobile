<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">(El-bethʹel) [The God of Bethel].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The name given by Jacob to the spot where he erected an altar in obedience to God’s command. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:35:1-1:35:1" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ge 35:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:35:7-1:35:7" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 7</a>) Certain scholars consider “The God of Bethel” to be an unlikely name for a location, and note that in the Greek <em>Septuagint,</em> Latin <em>Vulgate,</em> Syriac <em>Peshitta,</em> and Arabic versions the initial “El” was omitted. However, it should be remembered that the area around Bethel was full of meaning for Jacob. It was in this area over 20 years earlier that God revealed himself to Jacob in a dream, promising to protect him. At that time the patriarch was moved to respond, “Truly Jehovah is in this place.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:28:10-1:28:22" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ge 28:10-22</a>) Since this was the case, when later naming the altar site, Jacob was saying in effect, ‘God is in Bethel.’​—Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:33:20-1:33:20" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ge 33:20</a>.</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:15:27-11:15:27" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1Ki 15:27</a>) Gibbethon was under Philistine control some 24 years later when Omri, army chief of Israel, encamped against it. Acclaimed as king by the Israelite camp there, Omri broke off the siege of Gibbethon to attack the rival Israelite king Zimri.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:16:15-11:16:18" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1Ki 16:15-18</a>.</p>

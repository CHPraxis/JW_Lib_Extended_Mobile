<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A people or region mentioned with Pekod and Shoa at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:23:23-26:23:23" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ezekiel 23:23</a> and foretold by Jehovah to supply part of the enemy forces that would assault unfaithful Jerusalem and Judah. Koa was probably located E of Babylonia and has been generally linked with the <em>Qutu,</em> a people who resided E of the Tigris on the steppes between the upper ʽAdhaim and Diyala rivers. The <em>Qutu</em> are frequently coupled with the <em>Sutu</em> (perhaps the Shoa of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:23:23-26:23:23" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Eze 23:23</a>) in Assyrian inscriptions, such records showing them as fighting against Assyria.</p>

GRANDPARENTS
Parents of one’s father and/​or one’s mother. The term “grandparents,” as well as “grandfather” and “grandmother,” is rarely found in Bible translations. “Grandmother” at 1 Kings 15:10, 13 is translated from the same word as “mother” and is appropriately so rendered because Maacah was Asa’s grandmother, not his mother. (1Ki 15:1, 2, 8) It appears that Maacah continued as the queen mother during Asa’s reign until she was removed for her idolatry. (1Ki 15:13) Correspondingly, “father” on occasion indicated a grandfather or forefather. (Ge 28:13; 2Sa 9:7) Grandparents are also identified by such expressions as “the father of your mother” and “mother’s father.”​—Ge 28:2; Jg 9:1.
“Children or grandchildren,” the apostle says, should “keep paying a due compensation to their parents and grandparents [Gr., pro·goʹnois].” (1Ti 5:4) Another form of the same word (pro·goʹnon) is rendered “forefathers” at 2 Timothy 1:3. Timothy’s grandmother (Gr., mamʹme) Lois is commended for having ‘faith without hypocrisy,’ and she apparently assisted in the development of Timothy’s faith and spiritual growth.​—2Ti 1:5; 3:14, 15.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">The organ of sight, a highly efficient, self-adjusting “camera” that transmits impulses to the brain, where the object focused on the eye’s retina is interpreted as sight. The Hebrew <em>ʽaʹyin</em> and the Greek <em>o·phthal·mosʹ</em> are both used in literal and figurative senses. The Hebrew term is also used to denote a “fountain” or ‘spring.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:24:13-1:24:13" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ge 24:13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:15:27-2:15:27" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Ex 15:27</a>) The possession of two eyes, as in the human body, provides stereoscopic vision. The loss of sight is a tremendous handicap because sight is probably the most important channel of communication to the mind.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The eye is one of the most beautiful parts of the body.

<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The structure of the eye reveals marvelous design on the part of its Maker, and the process by which the brain interprets what is transmitted through the eye is far from being understood by scientists. All of this points to its Designer’s intelligence. Jehovah God himself testifies to his creatorship of the eye, saying: “The One forming the eye, can he not look?”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:94:9-19:94:9" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ps 94:9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:20:12-20:20:12" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> Pr 20:12</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><strong>Jehovah’s Eyes.</strong> God helps humans to understand and appreciate things about himself by likening them to things that we see and know well. Thus he speaks figuratively of his “eyes” being on his people, evidently indicating his watchfulness and loving care for them. The apostle Peter says: “The eyes of Jehovah are upon the righteous ones.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:3:12-60:3:12" data-bid="7-1" class="b">1Pe 3:12</a>) God emphasizes this care and sensitiveness for their welfare when he speaks of his servants as “the pupil” of his eye, metaphorically representing their preciousness in his sight and his quickness to act in their behalf when touched by the enemy.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:32:10-5:32:10" data-bid="8-1" class="b">De 32:10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:17:8-19:17:8" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> Ps 17:8</a>.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Describing God’s observation of the actions of all men, Jeremiah wrote that His “eyes are opened upon all the ways of the sons of men, in order to give to each one according to his ways.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:32:19-24:32:19" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Jer 32:19</a>) Of Jehovah’s omniscience and his purpose to exercise justice toward all, the apostle Paul wrote: “There is not a creation that is not manifest to his sight, but all things are naked and openly exposed to the eyes of him with whom we have an accounting.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:4:13-58:4:13" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Heb 4:13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:16:9-14:16:9" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> 2Ch 16:9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:66:7-19:66:7" data-bid="10-3" class="b"> Ps 66:7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:15:3-20:15:3" data-bid="10-4" class="b"> Pr 15:3</a>) Of the searching quality of God’s examination of men, the psalmist says: “His own eyes behold, his own beaming eyes examine the sons of men.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:11:4-19:11:4" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Ps 11:4</a>.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Jehovah’s ability to know a person’s characteristics and tendencies or his genetic makeup even while he is being formed in the womb, as was the case with Jacob and Esau (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:25:21-1:25:23" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Ge 25:21-23;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:9:10-45:9:13" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> Ro 9:10-13</a>), is indicated by the psalmist David’s words: “Your eyes saw even the embryo of me, and in your book all its parts were down in writing, as regards the days when they were formed and there was not yet one among them.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:139:15-19:139:16" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Ps 139:15, 16</a>.</p>

Satan tempted Eve by causing her to desire something seen with her eyes. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:3:6-1:3:6" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Ge 3:6</a>) He attempted to induce Jesus to sin by reaching out improperly for things seen with his eyes. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:4:5-42:4:7" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Lu 4:5-7</a>) And the apostle John tells us that “the desire of the eyes” is one of the things originating with this world, which is passing away.

<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Gestures by means of the eyes are very expressive of the individual’s feelings. They may show pity or lack of it (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:19:13-5:19:13" data-bid="23-1" class="b">De 19:13</a>); they may ‘wink’ or ‘blink’ in derision, or in scheming insincerity.

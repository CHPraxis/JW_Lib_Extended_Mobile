<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">A seal impression bearing the name Baʽalyishʽa was discovered in 1984 in the excavations at Tell el-ʽUmeiri in Jordan. This seal impression was dated paleographically to the latter part of the seventh century B.C.E. The inscription on it, written in ancient Ammonite characters, reads: “Belonging to Milkomʼor [or, Milkomʼur], servant of Baʽalyishʽa.” Baʽalyishʽa is possibly the Baalis of the Bible.</p>

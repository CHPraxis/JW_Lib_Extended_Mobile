MINNITH
(Minʹnith).
One of 20 Ammonite cities that Jephthah subdued after making his vow to Jehovah. (Jg 11:30-33) Centuries later “wheat of Minnith” is mentioned as an item of Tyre’s trade. (Eze 27:2, 17) The exact location of Minnith is not known. One of a number of possible identifications is Khirbet Hanizeh (Umm el Hanafish), about 6 km (3.5 mi) ENE of Heshbon.

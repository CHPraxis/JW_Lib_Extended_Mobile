<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><strong>1.</strong> A man of Damascus and the apparent heir of childless Abraham. Abraham referred to him as “a son of my household.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:15:2-1:15:3" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ge 15:2, 3</a>) Archaeological discoveries, such as the tablets from Nuzi, shed light on why Abraham considered Eliezer his heir. Often childless couples adopted a son who would then care for them in old age and arrange for their burial at death, thereupon inheriting the property. It was stipulated, however, that, in the event a son was born to them after the adoption, the real son would become the principal heir.</p>

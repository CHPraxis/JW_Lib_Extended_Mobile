ZEUS, SONS OF
According to Greek and Roman mythology, Castor and Pollux were the twin sons of Leda and the offspring of the god Zeus (Jupiter), thus being called Dioscuri, or “Sons of Zeus.” Among other things, they were regarded as protectors of mariners, able to save sailors imperiled at sea. It was believed that these deities manifested themselves during storms in the form of St. Elmo’s fire. The Alexandrian boat on which the prisoner Paul sailed from Malta to Puteoli when en route to Rome bore the figurehead “Sons of Zeus.” Perhaps the image or symbol and the name of Castor were on one side of the bow and the corresponding representation and name of Pollux on the other.​—Ac 28:11.

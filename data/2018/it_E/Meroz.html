<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">(Meʹroz).</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A place cursed by an angel for not coming “to the assistance of Jehovah.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:5:23-7:5:23" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Jg 5:23</a>) It may be that the inhabitants of Meroz did not aid Jehovah’s designated commander Barak in the actual fight against the Canaanites under Sisera. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:5:5-7:5:16" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Jg 5:5-16</a>) Or, if Meroz lay on defeated Sisera’s escape route, perhaps its inhabitants failed to detain him. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:4:17-7:4:17" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Jg 4:17</a>) The fact that the Bible account next relates Jael’s courageous act in killing Sisera lends some support to the latter view. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:5:24-7:5:27" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Jg 5:24-27</a>) The angel pronouncing the curse possibly was one who fought for Israel.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Meroz’ exact location is unknown, although some tentatively place it at Khirbet Marus, about 8 km (5 mi) S of Kedesh in Naphtali.</p>

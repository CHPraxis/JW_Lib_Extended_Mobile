<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A town, the domain of a king defeated by Joshua. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:12:7-6:12:8" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Jos 12:7, 8,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:12:20-6:12:20" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 20</a>) It is perhaps the full name of the town Shimron, or possibly it is a reference to the fact that the king of Shimron was one of those defeated at the waters of Merom. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:11:1-6:11:1" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Jos 11:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:11:5-6:11:5" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 5,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:11:7-6:11:8" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> 7, 8</a>) Some manuscripts separate the names as being two towns, Shimron and Meron, but no place called Meron is elsewhere alluded to.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">The Hebrew word <em>bethu·lahʹ</em> signifies a woman who has never been united to a man in marriage and has never had sexual intercourse. <span id="page1158" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="1158" data-before-text="1158"></span>(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:24:16-1:24:16" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ge 24:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:32:25-5:32:25" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> De 32:25;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:21:12-7:21:12" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> Jg 21:12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:1:2-11:1:2" data-bid="1-4" class="b"> 1Ki 1:2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/17:2:2-17:2:3" data-bid="1-5" class="b"> Es 2:2, 3,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/17:2:17-17:2:17" data-bid="1-6" class="b"> 17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/25:1:18-25:1:18" data-bid="1-7" class="b"> La 1:18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/25:2:21-25:2:21" data-bid="1-8" class="b"> 2:21</a>) The Greek term <em>par·theʹnos,</em> however, can apply to both single men and single women.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:25:1-40:25:12" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Mt 25:1-12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:1:27-42:1:27" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Lu 1:27;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:21:9-44:21:9" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> Ac 21:9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:7:25-46:7:25" data-bid="2-4" class="b"> 1Co 7:25,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:7:36-46:7:38" data-bid="2-5" class="b"> 36-38</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">According to the Law, a man who seduced an unengaged virgin had to give her father 50 silver shekels ($110), was to marry her (if her father permitted), and was not allowed to divorce her “all his days.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:22:16-2:22:17" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ex 22:16, 17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:22:28-5:22:29" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> De 22:28, 29</a>) But an engaged virgin, being viewed as already belonging to a husband, was to be stoned to death if she did not scream when sexually attacked. Her failure to scream would have denoted consent and thus would have constituted her an adulteress. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:22:23-5:22:24" data-bid="4-1" class="b">De 22:23, 24</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:1:18-40:1:19" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Mt 1:18, 19</a>.) The fact that an engaged virgin was regarded as being ‘owned’ by a husband also explains why <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/29:1:8-29:1:8" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Joel 1:8</a> could refer to “a virgin” as wailing over “the owner of her youth.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">As greater freedom in the Lord’s service is enjoyed by those retaining their virginity, the apostle Paul recommended singleness as the better course for Christians having self-control. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:7:25-46:7:35" data-bid="7-1" class="b">1Co 7:25-35</a>) However, regarding those lacking self-control, he observed: “If anyone thinks he is behaving improperly toward his virginity, if that is past the bloom of youth, and this is the way it should take place, let him do what he wants; he does not sin. Let them marry.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:7:36-46:7:36" data-bid="8-1" class="b">1Co 7:36</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The Greek word rendered “virginity” at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:7:36-46:7:38" data-bid="9-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 7:36-38</a> literally means “virgin.” For this reason the thought has been advanced that Paul was talking about a father’s or guardian’s duty toward a marriageable daughter. Thus <em>The Jerusalem Bible</em> reads: “If there is anyone who feels that it would not be fair to his daughter to let her grow too old for marriage, and that he should do something about it, he is free to do as he likes: he is not sinning if there is a marriage.” Another view is that this text pertains to a man’s deciding to marry the girl to whom he is engaged. The <em>American Translation</em> states: “If a man thinks he is not acting properly toward the girl to whom he is engaged, if his passions are too strong, and that is what ought to be done, let him do as he pleases; it is no sin; let them be married.”</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">The context, however, suggests that the reference is not to a virgin girl but to a person’s own virginity. One commentator observed: “I think the apostle is here continuing his former discourse, and advising unmarried persons, who are at their own disposal, what to do; the man’s virgin being meant of his virginity.” (<em>Matthew Henry’s Commentary on the Whole Bible,</em> 1976, Vol. III, p. 1036) Since the Greek word <em>par·theʹnos</em> can include single men, the rendering “virginity,” as found in the translations by J. B. Rotherham and J. N. Darby as well as in the <em>New World Translation,</em> is appropriate and seems to fit the context best.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><strong>Spiritual Virginity.</strong> Even as the high priest in Israel could take only a virgin as his wife (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:21:10-3:21:10" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Le 21:10,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:21:13-3:21:14" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> 13, 14</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:44:22-26:44:22" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Eze 44:22</a>), so the great High Priest, Jesus Christ, must have only a “virgin” as his spiritual “bride” in heaven. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:9-66:21:9" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Re 21:9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:7:26-58:7:26" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> Heb 7:26</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:5:25-49:5:30" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Eph 5:25-30</a>.) Hence, the apostle Paul was deeply concerned about the purity of the Corinthian congregation, desiring to present it “as a chaste virgin to the Christ.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:11:2-47:11:6" data-bid="14-1" class="b">2Co 11:2-6</a>) The bride of Christ is composed of 144,000 spirit-anointed persons who individually maintain their ‘virginity’ by remaining separate from the world and by keeping themselves morally and doctrinally pure.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:14:1-66:14:1" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Re 14:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:14:4-66:14:4" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> 4</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:5:9-46:5:13" data-bid="16-1" class="b">1Co 5:9-13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:6:15-46:6:20" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> 6:15-20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:4:4-59:4:4" data-bid="16-3" class="b"> Jas 4:4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/63:1:8-63:1:11" data-bid="16-4" class="b"> 2Jo 8-11</a>.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><strong>Messianic Prophecy.</strong> Although the Hebrew word <em>bethu·lahʹ</em> means “virgin,” another term (<em>ʽal·mahʹ</em>) appears at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:7:14-23:7:14" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Isaiah 7:14</a>: “Look! The maiden [<em>ha·ʽal·mahʹ</em>] herself will actually become pregnant, and she is giving birth to a son, and she will certainly call his name Immanuel.” The word <em>ʽal·mahʹ</em> means “maiden” and can apply to a nonvirgin or a virgin. It is applied to “the maiden” Rebekah before marriage when she was also called “a virgin” (<em>bethu·lahʹ</em>). (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:24:16-1:24:16" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Ge 24:16,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:24:43-1:24:43" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> 43</a>) Under divine inspiration, Matthew employed the Greek word <em>par·theʹnos</em> (virgin) when showing that <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:7:14-23:7:14" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Isaiah 7:14</a> found final fulfillment in connection with the virgin birth of Jesus, the Messiah. Both Matthew and Luke state clearly that Jesus’ mother Mary was then a virgin who became pregnant through the operation of God’s holy spirit.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:1:18-40:1:25" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Mt 1:18-25;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:1:26-42:1:35" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> Lu 1:26-35</a>.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb"><strong>Cities, Places, and Peoples.</strong> Often the term “virgin” is used in connection with cities, places, or peoples. Reference is made to the “virgin” or “virgin daughter” of “my people” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:14:17-24:14:17" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Jer 14:17</a>), as well as of Israel (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:31:4-24:31:4" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Jer 31:4,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:31:21-24:31:21" data-bid="22-2" class="b"> 21;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/30:5:2-30:5:2" data-bid="22-3" class="b"> Am 5:2</a>), Judah (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/25:1:15-25:1:15" data-bid="23-1" class="b">La 1:15</a>), Zion (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:19:21-12:19:21" data-bid="24-1" class="b">2Ki 19:21;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/25:2:13-25:2:13" data-bid="24-2" class="b"> La 2:13</a>), Egypt (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:46:11-24:46:11" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Jer 46:11</a>), Babylon (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:47:1-23:47:1" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Isa 47:1</a>), and Sidon (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:23:12-23:23:12" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Isa 23:12</a>). The sense of this figurative use appears to be that the various peoples or locations thus referred to either had not been seized and ravished by foreign conquerors or at one time enjoyed an unsubdued state like a virgin.</p>

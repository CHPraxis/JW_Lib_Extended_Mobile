AENON
(Aeʹnon).
A place having “a great quantity of water” available, where John the Baptizer performed immersions after the Passover of 30 C.E. (Joh 3:23) It was near the apparently better known place named Salim. The exact locations of these places are uncertain; however, Eusebius, bishop of Caesarea who lived in the third and fourth centuries C.E., indicates a location in the Jordan Valley about 8 Roman miles (12 km; 7.5 mi) S of Beth-shean. In this area is Tell Ridgha (Tel Shalem), tentatively identified with Salim. Nearby are several springs that might fit Eusebius’ description of the place called Aenon.

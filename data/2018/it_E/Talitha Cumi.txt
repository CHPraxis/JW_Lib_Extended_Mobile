TALITHA CUMI
(Talʹi·tha cuʹmi).
The Semitic expression used by Jesus Christ at the time he resurrected Jairus’ daughter. It means, “Maiden, I say to you, Get up!” (Mr 5:41) The transliterations of this expression vary in Greek manuscripts. While it is often referred to as Aramaic, at least the latter part of the phrase (“cumi”) could be either Hebrew or Aramaic, according to Vine’s Expository Dictionary of Old and New Testament Words (1981, Vol. 4, p. 109). Lexicographer Gesenius derives “talitha” from the Hebrew word for lamb (ta·lehʹ).​—A Hebrew and English Lexicon of the Old Testament, by Brown, Driver, and Briggs, 1980, p. 378.

EZRAHITE
(Ezʹra·hite) [Native].
A designation applied to Ethan (1Ki 4:31; Ps 89:Sup) and Heman (Ps 88:Sup), both of them famous for their wisdom. Ethan and Heman are identified at 1 Chronicles 2:3-6 as descendants of Judah through Zerah. Thus the designation “Ezrahite” apparently is another word for “Zerahite.” (Nu 26:20) The Targum of Jonathan interprets “Ezrahite” as “son of Zerah.”

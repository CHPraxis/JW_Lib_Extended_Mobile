HOUSES OF THE SOUL
This literally translated expression “houses of the soul” probably denotes “perfume receptacles.” These may have been suspended from a chain or necklace and worn by ‘the haughty daughters of Zion’ around their necks.​—Isa 3:16, 18, 20.
The Hebrew expression is bot·tehʹ han·neʹphesh. Neʹphesh (soul) may, in this case, signify “that which is breathed” or “smelled,” and bot·tehʹ (houses of) can mean “receptacles of.”

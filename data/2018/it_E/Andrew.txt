ANDREW
(Anʹdrew) [from a Gr. root meaning “man; male person”; probably, Manly].
A brother of Simon Peter and son of Jonah (John). (Mt 4:18; 16:17) While Andrew’s native city was Bethsaida, he and Simon were living together in Capernaum at the time Jesus called them to become “fishers of men.” (Mr 1:16, 17, 21, 29; Joh 1:44) Both cities were on the N shore of the Sea of Galilee, where the two brothers engaged in the fishing business in partnership with James and John.​—Mt 4:18; Mr 1:16; Lu 5:10.
Andrew was first a disciple of John the Baptizer. (Joh 1:35, 40) In the fall of 29 C.E. he was at Bethany on the E side of the Jordan River and heard John the Baptizer introduce Jesus as “the Lamb of God.” (Joh 1:29) He, along with another disciple (likely John), followed Jesus to his residence and was soon convinced he had found the Messiah. He then found and informed his brother Simon and led him to Jesus. (Joh 1:36-41) The two brothers returned to their fishing business, but between six months and a year later, after the arrest of John the Baptizer, they, along with James and John, were invited by Jesus to become “fishers of men.” They immediately abandoned their nets and began accompanying Jesus. (Mt 4:18-20; Mr 1:14, 16-20) In time these four became apostles, and it is notable that Andrew is always listed as among the first four in all the apostolic lists.​—Mt 10:2; Mr 3:18; Lu 6:14.
Andrew thereafter receives but brief mention. He and Philip discuss with Jesus the problem of feeding a crowd of about 5,000 men, and Andrew offers a suggestion that he himself considers of little practical value about some available food. (Joh 6:8, 9) At the time of the last Passover festival that they celebrated, Philip comes to Andrew for advice about a request of some Greeks to see Jesus, and the two then approach Jesus on the matter. (Joh 12:20-22) He is among the four on the Mount of Olives who ask Jesus for the sign that would mark the conclusion of the existing system of things. (Mr 13:3) The final mention of Andrew by name is shortly after Jesus’ ascension.​—Ac 1:13.

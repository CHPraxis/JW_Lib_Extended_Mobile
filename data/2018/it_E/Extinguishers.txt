EXTINGUISHERS
Mezam·meʹreth, the Hebrew word variously translated “snuffers” (AS), “knives” (JB), and “extinguishers” (NW), is derived from a root (za·marʹ) meaning “trim; prune.” Hence some believe that scissorlike utensils designed for trimming the lampwicks are meant. However, all that is definitely known about these utensils is that they were made of gold or copper and were used in connection with the services at the temple.​—1Ki 7:50; 2Ki 12:13; 25:14; 2Ch 4:22; Jer 52:18.

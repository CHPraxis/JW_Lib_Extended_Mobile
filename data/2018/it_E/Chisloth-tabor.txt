CHISLOTH-TABOR
(Chisʹloth-taʹbor) [Loins [that is, slopes] of Tabor].
A city marking Zebulun’s boundary and apparently a variant form of Chesulloth. (Jos 19:12, 18) It is usually identified with Iksal (Kislot Tavor), 3 km (2 mi) SE of Nazareth, at the foot of Mount Tabor, which location may account for its name.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">The Hebrew expression <em>mil·leʼʹ yadh,</em> translated “consecrate” in many versions, literally means “fill the hand” and is used with reference to putting full power in the hands of those who are to serve in a priestly office. At their installation as priests of Jehovah, Aaron and his sons had their hands filled with power to serve in that capacity.

Finally the things waved were made to smoke upon the altar on top of the burnt offering.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:29:19-2:29:25" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ex 29:19-25;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:8:22-3:8:28" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Le 8:22-28</a>; see <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200000285/">ANOINTED, ANOINTING</a>; <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200002179/">INSTALLATION</a>; <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200003553/">PRIEST</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Others, too, filled the hands of their priests with power. Idolatrous Micah empowered first a son and then an unfaithful Levite to be priests for his “house of gods.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:17:5-7:17:5" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Jg 17:5,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:17:12-7:17:12" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 12</a>) Later, King Jeroboam, in instituting calf worship in Israel, installed his own priests from the people in general; the Aaronic priests and the Levites remained loyal to Jehovah’s worship centered at Jerusalem and were, evidently for this reason, driven out of the ten-tribe kingdom.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:12:31-11:12:31" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1Ki 12:31;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:13:33-11:13:33" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 13:33;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:13:9-14:13:9" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> 2Ch 13:9</a>.</p>

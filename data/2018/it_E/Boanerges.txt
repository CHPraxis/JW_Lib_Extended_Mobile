BOANERGES
(Bo·a·nerʹges) [Sons of Thunder].
A Semitic expression found, with its translation, only at Mark 3:17. Jesus gave it as a surname to the sons of Zebedee, James and John, likely reflecting the fiery enthusiasm of these two apostles. (Lu 9:54) Unlike Simon’s new name Peter, Boanerges does not appear to have been commonly used.

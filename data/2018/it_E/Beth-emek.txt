BETH-EMEK
(Beth-eʹmek) [House of the Low Plain].
A town in the territory of the tribe of Asher. (Jos 19:24, 27) It is presently identified with Tell Mimas (Tel Bet HaʽEmeq), about 8 km (5 mi) NE of Acco. The original name appears to be reflected in that of the nearby Arab village of ʽAmqa now abandoned.

ZITHER
The Bible gives no description of the musical instrument designated by the Aramaic word qath·rohsʹ, but it was probably a type of stringed instrument. If this term is related to the Greek ki·thaʹra (a stringed instrument), from which a number of English words, including “zither,” are drawn, then “zither” is an approximate transliteration. The qath·rohsʹ was one of the instruments of Nebuchadnezzar’s orchestra.​—Da 3:5, 7, 10, 15.

City of Jerusalem (David/​Solomon)




ANCIENT Jerusalem was the place where Jehovah chose to put his name. (2Ch 6:6) It served as both the center of pure worship and the seat of government for Israel. Kings ruling from Jerusalem were said to sit ‘on Jehovah’s throne.’​—1Ch 29:23.
King David wrested the stronghold of Mount Zion from the Jebusites and made it his capital. Solomon enlarged the city and built it up to the peak of its grandeur, constructing a magnificent temple as well as an impressive complex of governmental buildings on Mount Moriah and its slopes. Jerusalem was a city closely associated with Jehovah’s name.
This helps us to appreciate why Jerusalem is given such prominence in Bible prophecy. It serves as a fitting symbol of the heavenly part of Jehovah’s organization and his Messianic Kingdom in the hands of Jesus Christ.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">The Hebrew noun <em>sa·raphʹ,</em> in its plural form, is translated “seraphs” in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:6:2-23:6:2" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Isaiah 6:2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:6:6-23:6:6" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 6</a> and literally means “fiery one,” or “burning one.” It is also used in conjunction with the general Hebrew term for serpent (<em>na·chashʹ</em>) and has been translated “poisonous,” perhaps referring to the burning and inflaming effect of the venom. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:8:15-5:8:15" data-bid="2-1" class="b">De 8:15</a>) It is first mentioned at the time of God’s inflicting punishment on the rebellious Israelites by sending “poisonous serpents [<em>han·necha·shimʹ has·sera·phimʹ</em>]” among them. After Moses’ intercession, Jehovah instructed him to make “a fiery snake” and place it on a signal pole. If those bitten would look at it, they would be healed and would live. Moses formed the snake of copper. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:21:6-4:21:9" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Nu 21:6-9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:10:9-46:10:9" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 1Co 10:9</a>) Jesus gave prophetic significance to this by stating: “Just as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so the Son of man must be lifted up, that everyone believing in him may have everlasting life.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:3:14-43:3:15" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Joh 3:14, 15</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">At <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:14:29-23:14:29" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Isaiah 14:29</a> and <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:30:6-23:30:6" data-bid="6-1" class="b">30:6</a> “a flying fiery snake” is mentioned in God’s judgment against Philistia and in the description of the wilderness area to the S of Judah. The expression “flying” is considered by some to refer to the rapid darting or lightninglike striking through the air done by venomous snakes when attacking.</p>

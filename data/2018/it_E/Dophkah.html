<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">(Dophʹkah) [possibly, Driven; Shoved].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The first stopping place for the Israelites after leaving the Wilderness of Sin on their way to the Promised Land. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:33:12-4:33:13" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Nu 33:12, 13</a>) The Bible does not indicate its exact geographic location. However, many scholars associate Dophkah with the Egyptian <em>Mafqat,</em> a district named for the turquoise mined since ancient times around Sarabit el-Khadim, about 34 km (21 mi) E of modern-day Abu Zanima on the Sinai Peninsula.</p>

TABERAH
(Tabʹe·rah) [Burning [that is, a conflagration; blaze]].
An Israelite encampment in the Wilderness of Sinai, the precise location of which is unknown. On account of Israel’s complaining there, God sent a fire that consumed some of the people at the extremity of the camp. But when Moses supplicated Jehovah, the blaze “sank down” or was extinguished. This incident gave rise to the name “Taberah.”​—Nu 11:1-3; De 9:22.

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">One of the mature members of the congregation at Corinth, the capital of the Roman province of Achaia in southern Greece. Paul personally baptized Stephanas’ household as the “firstfruits” of his ministry in that province. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:1:16-46:1:16" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1Co 1:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:16:15-46:16:15" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 16:15</a>) Some five years later, about 55 C.E., Stephanas, together with two other brothers from Corinth, visited Paul in Ephesus, and it may have been through them that Paul learned of the distressing conditions about which he wrote in his first canonical letter to the Corinthians. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:1:11-46:1:11" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1Co 1:11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:5:1-46:5:1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 5:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:11:18-46:11:18" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> 11:18</a>) Also, it may have been by their hands that this letter was delivered to Corinth.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:16:17-46:16:17" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1Co 16:17</a>.</p>

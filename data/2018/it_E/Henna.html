<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A shrub that bears clusters of small cream-colored, four-petal flowers at the tips of its branches; their strong fragrance is especially enjoyed by Middle Eastern peoples. Often a sprig of henna is put in bouquets, and women wear it in their hair and in their bosom. From ancient times henna has also been employed as a cosmetic.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">This shrub (<em>Lawsonia inermis</em>), which still grows wild in Palestine, attains a maximum height of about 4 m (13 ft). It is mentioned only in The <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/22:1:14-22:1:14" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Song of Solomon (1:14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/22:4:13-22:4:13" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 4:13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/22:7:11-22:7:11" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> 7:11</a>).</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Henna paste, which is made from pulverized leaves of the plant, is used as a cosmetic. When the paste is washed off, the stain, commonly an orange or reddish color, remains. Henna has been used to dye the nails of fingers and toes, fingertips, hands, feet, beards, hair, and even the manes and tails of horses, as well as skins and leather. The Hebrew root from which <em>koʹpher</em> is thought to be derived has been defined as “cover,” seemingly indicative of its use as a dye.​—Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:6:14-1:6:14" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ge 6:14</a>.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A yellow nonmetallic element occurring free or combined with other elements in sulfide and sulfate compounds. Its melting point is unusually low, 113° C. (235° F.). It readily burns with a pale blue flame, at the same time forming sulfur dioxide, which has a pungent odor.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The first historical reference to sulfur tells how destruction rained down on the wicked cities of Sodom and Gomorrah in the form of fire and sulfur. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:19:24-1:19:24" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ge 19:24;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:17:29-42:17:29" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Lu 17:29</a>) On the basis of geologic evidence, some suggest that this catastrophic execution from Jehovah was possibly in the form of a volcanic eruption in the southern region of the Dead Sea, accounting for the prevalence of sulfur in that area today.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">It is believed that a high-temperature incinerator or crematory for the ancient city of Jerusalem was developed by adding sulfur to the constantly burning fires in the Valley of Hinnom (Gehenna) just outside the walls.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Ever since the fiery judgment on Sodom and Gomorrah in 1919 B.C.E., the highly flammable nature of sulfur has been referred to in the Scriptures. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:30:33-23:30:33" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Isa 30:33;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:34:9-23:34:9" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 34:9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:9:17-66:9:18" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> Re 9:17, 18</a>) It is a symbol of total desolation.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:11:6-19:11:6" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ps 11:6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:38:22-26:38:22" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Eze 38:22;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:14:9-66:14:11" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> Re 14:9-11</a>) We are told that the Devil will be “hurled into the lake of fire and sulphur,” a fitting description of complete annihilation, “the second death.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:19:20-66:19:20" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Re 19:20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:20:10-66:20:10" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 20:10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:8-66:21:8" data-bid="5-3" class="b"> 21:8</a>.</p>

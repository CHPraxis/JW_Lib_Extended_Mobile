(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:8:1-13:8:2" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1Ch 8:1, 2</a>) Since he is not named among those listed in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:46:1-1:46:34" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Genesis chapter 46</a>, he was probably born after the family entered Egypt. Some suppose that Nohah was another name for Shephupham or was his descendant.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:26:39-4:26:39" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Nu 26:39</a>.</p>

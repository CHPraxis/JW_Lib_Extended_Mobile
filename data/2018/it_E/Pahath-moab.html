<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">(Paʹhath-moʹab) [Governor of Moab].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Founder of a family in Israel. If he was an official over Moab, as his name might imply, it was probably during the time when Moab was under Judah’s domination. His holding such a position remains uncertain, however, as nothing is said of him personally in the Scripture record.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Pahath-moab’s descendants noted in Ezra and Nehemiah are all postexilic. Some of them comprised the second most numerous family to return with Zerubbabel in 537 B.C.E. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/15:2:1-15:2:2" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ezr 2:1, 2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/15:2:6-15:2:6" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:7:11-16:7:11" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> Ne 7:11</a>) By the time of Ezra’s return in 468 B.C.E., with more descendants of Pahath-moab accompanying him, some of the first group (or their offspring) had taken foreign wives, but they responded to Ezra’s admonition to dismiss them. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/15:8:1-15:8:1" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ezr 8:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/15:8:4-15:8:4" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/15:10:30-15:10:30" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> 10:30,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/15:10:44-15:10:44" data-bid="2-4" class="b"> 44</a>) Another of this family, Hasshub, helped Nehemiah to repair Jerusalem’s wall, and a descendant or representative of theirs also attested by seal the agreement of faithfulness that was put forward shortly thereafter.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:3:11-16:3:11" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ne 3:11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:9:38-16:9:38" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 9:38;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:10:1-16:10:1" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> 10:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:10:14-16:10:14" data-bid="3-4" class="b"> 14</a>.</p>

HEʼ
[ה].
The fifth letter in the Hebrew alphabet. In speaking, heʼ has a guttural sound somewhere between the softer ʼaʹleph and the harsher chehth. It thus corresponds generally to the English “h” and is similar to the sound of “h” in the word “behind.” In the Hebrew, it appears at the beginning of each verse of Psalm 119:33-40. The letters heʼ [ה] and chehth [ח] are very similar in form.​—See HEBREW, II.

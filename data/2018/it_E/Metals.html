<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">More than 75Â percent of the more than a hundred elements known to man are metals. Gold, silver, copper, iron, and lead are all mentioned specifically in the Scriptures. The first Biblical references to metals are in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:2:11-1:2:11" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Genesis 2:11</a> and <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:4:22-1:4:22" data-bid="2-1" class="b">4:22</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">In physical properties metals are opaque, fusible, and ductile; they have a metallic luster and are usually good conductors of heat and electricity. Chemically and physically the metals have certain distinguishing characteristics. For specific information and the Scriptural occurrences, see the above-mentioned metals under their individual names; also the heading <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200003672/">REFINE, REFINER</a>.</p>

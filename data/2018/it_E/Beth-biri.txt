BETH-BIRI
(Beth-birʹi).
A town in the Negeb region of Judah but assigned to the sons of Simeon. (1Ch 4:24, 31) In the parallel list of towns at Joshua 19:6 it appears as Beth-lebaoth, and some suggest that Beth-biri may be a postexilic name for the same place, used by Ezra as the writer of the Chronicles. Evidence of the name may remain in that of Jebel el-Biri, a mountain about 40 km (25 mi) SW of Beer-sheba. On this basis, some propose that Beth-biri was on or near this mountain.​—See BETH-LEBAOTH.

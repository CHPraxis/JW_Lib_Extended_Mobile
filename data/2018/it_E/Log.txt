LOG
The smallest liquid measure mentioned in the Bible. Talmudic evidence indicates the log to be one twelfth of a hin, or 0.014 bath. On the basis of archaeological findings, the bath is estimated to be 22 L (5.81 gal). If correct, this would give the log measure a capacity of about 0.31 L (0.66 pt). One log measure of oil was part of the prescribed offering by a cleansed leper.​—Le 14:2, 10, 12, 15, 21, 24.

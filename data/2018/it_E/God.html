<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Anything that is worshiped can be termed a god, inasmuch as the worshiper attributes to it might greater than his own and venerates it. A person can even let his belly be a god.

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><strong>Hebrew Terms.</strong> Among the Hebrew words that are translated “God” is <em>ʼEl,</em> probably meaning “Mighty One; Strong One.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:14:18-1:14:18" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ge 14:18</a>) It is used with reference to Jehovah, to other gods, and to men. It is also used extensively in the makeup of proper names, such as Elisha (meaning “God Is Salvation”) and Michael (“Who Is Like God?”). In some places <em>ʼEl</em> appears with the definite article (<em>ha·ʼElʹ,</em> literally, “the God”) with reference to Jehovah, thereby distinguishing him from other gods.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:46:3-1:46:3" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ge 46:3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:22:31-10:22:31" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 2Sa 22:31</a>; see <em>NW</em> appendix, p. 1567.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">At <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:9:6-23:9:6" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Isaiah 9:6</a> Jesus Christ is prophetically called <em>ʼEl Gib·bohrʹ,</em> “Mighty God” (not <em>ʼEl Shad·daiʹ</em> [God Almighty], which is applied to Jehovah at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:17:1-1:17:1" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Genesis 17:1</a>).</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The plural form, <em>ʼe·limʹ,</em> is used when referring to other gods, such as at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:15:11-2:15:11" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Exodus 15:11</a> (“gods”). It is also used as the plural of majesty and excellence, as in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:89:6-19:89:6" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Psalm 89:6</a>: “Who can resemble Jehovah among the sons of God [<em>bi·venehʹ ʼE·limʹ</em>]?” That the plural form is used to denote a single individual here and in a number of other places is supported by the translation of <em>ʼE·limʹ</em> by the singular form <em>The·osʹ</em> in the Greek <em>Septuagint;</em> likewise by <em>Deus</em> in the Latin <em>Vulgate.</em></p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">The Hebrew word <em>ʼelo·himʹ</em> (gods) appears to be from a root meaning “be strong.” <em>ʼElo·himʹ</em> is the plural of <em>ʼelohʹah</em> (god). Sometimes this plural refers to a number of gods (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:31:30-1:31:30" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ge 31:30,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:31:32-1:31:32" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> 32;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:35:2-1:35:2" data-bid="10-3" class="b"> 35:2</a>), but more often it is used as a plural of majesty, dignity, or excellence. <em>ʼElo·himʹ</em> is used in the Scriptures with reference to Jehovah himself, to angels, to idol gods (singular and plural), and to men.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">When applying to Jehovah, <em>ʼElo·himʹ</em> is used as a plural of majesty, dignity, or excellence. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:1-1:1:1" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Ge 1:1</a>) Regarding this, Aaron Ember wrote: “That the language of the O[ld] T[estament] has entirely given up the idea of plurality in . . . [<em>ʼElo·himʹ</em>] (as applied to the God of Israel) is especially shown by the fact that it is almost invariably construed with a singular verbal predicate, and takes a singular adjectival attribute. . . . [<em>ʼElo·himʹ</em>] must rather be explained as an <em>intensive plural,</em> denoting <em>greatness</em> and <em>majesty,</em> being equal to The Great God.”​—<em>The American Journal of Semitic Languages and Literatures,</em> Vol. XXI, 1905, p. 208.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">The title <em>ʼElo·himʹ</em> draws attention to Jehovah’s strength as the Creator. It appears 35 times by itself in the account of creation, and every time the verb describing what he said and did is in the singular number. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:1-1:2:4" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Ge 1:1–2:4</a>) In him resides the sum and substance of infinite forces.</p>

Hence, at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:8:5-19:8:5" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Psalm 8:5</a> <em>ʼelo·himʹ</em> is rendered “angels” (<em>LXX</em>); “godlike ones” (<em>NW</em>).</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">The word <em>ʼelo·himʹ</em> is also used when referring to idol gods. Sometimes this plural form means simply “gods.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:12:12-2:12:12" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Ex 12:12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:20:23-2:20:23" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> 20:23</a>) At other times it is the plural of excellence and only one god (or goddess) is referred to. However, these gods were clearly not trinities.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:5:7-9:5:7" data-bid="19-1" class="b">1Sa 5:7b</a> (Dagon); <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:11:5-11:11:5" data-bid="20-1" class="b">1Ki 11:5</a> (“goddess” Ashtoreth); <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:1:2-27:1:2" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Da 1:2b</a> (Marduk).</p>

The 1956 edition of <em>The Encyclopedia Americana</em> (Vol. XII, p. 743) commented under the heading “God”: “In the Christian, Mohammedan, and Jewish sense, the Supreme Being, the First Cause, and in a general sense, as considered nowadays throughout the civilized world, a spiritual being, self-existent, eternal and absolutely free and all-powerful, distinct from the matter which he has created in many forms, and which he conserves and controls. There does not seem to have been a period of history where mankind was without belief in a supernatural author and governor of the universe.”</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb"><strong><em>Proofs of the existence of “the living God.”</em></strong> The fact of the existence of God is proved by the order, power, and complexity of creation, macroscopic and microscopic, and through his dealings with his people throughout history.

One can learn from a book only if intelligent thought and preparation have been put into the book by its author.</p>

<p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb">God gives us an idea of the effect of his presence in the book of Revelation. The apostle John had a vision that approximated seeing God, in the sense that it revealed the effect of beholding him on his throne. God was not like a man in appearance, for he has not revealed any figure of his to man, as John himself said later: “No man has seen God at any time.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:1:18-43:1:18" data-bid="89-1" class="b">Joh 1:18</a>) Rather, God was shown to be like highly polished gems, precious, glowing, beautiful, that attract the eye and win delighted admiration. He was “in appearance, like a jasper stone and a precious red-colored stone, and round about the throne there [was] a rainbow like an emerald in appearance.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:4:3-66:4:3" data-bid="90-1" class="b">Re 4:3</a>) Thus, he is lovely in appearance and pleasant to look at, causing one to lose oneself in wonderment. About his throne there is further glory and an atmosphere of calmness, serenity; the appearance of a perfect rainbow of emerald indicates that, reminding one of the enjoyable quieting calm that follows a storm.​—Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:9:12-1:9:16" data-bid="91-1" class="b">Ge 9:12-16</a>.</p>
<p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sb">How different the true God is, therefore, from the gods of the nations, who are often depicted as being grotesque, angry, fierce, implacable, merciless, whimsical as to their favors and disfavors, horrifying and fiendish, and ready to torture earthly creatures in some kind of inferno.</p>

<p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="sb">Among other mighty ones called “gods” in the Bible is Jesus Christ, who is “the only-begotten god.” But he himself plainly said: “It is Jehovah your God you must worship, and it is to him alone you must render sacred service.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:1:18-43:1:18" data-bid="96-1" class="b">Joh 1:18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:4:8-42:4:8" data-bid="96-2" class="b"> Lu 4:8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:10:20-5:10:20" data-bid="96-3" class="b"> De 10:20</a>) The angels are “godlike ones,” but one of them stopped John from worshiping him, saying: “Be careful!

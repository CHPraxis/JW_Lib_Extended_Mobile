FIG-MULBERRY TREE
[Gr., sy·ko·mo·reʹa].
When short-statured Zacchaeus wanted to get a better look at Christ Jesus he “climbed a fig-mulberry tree.” (Lu 19:4) The Greek name indicates a fig tree (Gr., sy·keʹ) with leaves like those of the mulberry (Gr., mo·reʹa). The two trees are of the same family, and the fig-mulberry mentioned in Luke 19:4 appears to be the same as “the sycamore” (Ficus sycomorus) of the Hebrew Scriptures.​—1Ki 10:27; see SYCAMORE.

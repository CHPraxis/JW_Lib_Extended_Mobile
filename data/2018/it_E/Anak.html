<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">(Aʹnak) [probably, Long-Necked [that is, of tall stature]].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The name applied to a tribe of unusually tall men and perhaps to their progenitor. At <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:13:22-4:13:22" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Numbers 13:22</a> and <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:13:28-4:13:28" data-bid="2-1" class="b">28</a> the article is used with the name in Hebrew (<em>ha·ʽAnaqʹ</em>). If it is the personal name of the son of “Arba . . . the father of Anak” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:15:13-6:15:13" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Jos 15:13</a>), the name thereafter was also applied to his progeny. (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:15:14-6:15:14" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Jos 15:14</a> with <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:14:15-6:14:15" data-bid="5-1" class="b">14:15</a>, where Arba is called “the great man among the Anakim.”)​—See <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200000261/">ANAKIM</a>.</p>

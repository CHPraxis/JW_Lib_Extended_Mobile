<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">The Greek word (<em>haiʹre·sis,</em> from which comes the English word “heresy”) thus translated means “choice” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:22:18-3:22:18" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Le 22:18</a>, <em>LXX</em>) or “that which is chosen,” hence “a body of men separating themselves from others and following their own tenets [<em>a sect</em> or <em>party</em>].” (Thayer’s <em>Greek-English Lexicon of the New Testament,</em> 1889, p. 16) This term is applied to the adherents of the two prominent branches of Judaism, the Pharisees and Sadducees. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:5:17-44:5:17" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ac 5:17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:15:5-44:15:5" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 15:5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:26:5-44:26:5" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> 26:5</a>) Non-Christians also called Christianity a “sect” or “the sect of the Nazarenes,” possibly viewing it as a break-off from Judaism.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:24:5-44:24:5" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ac 24:5,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:24:14-44:24:14" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:28:22-44:28:22" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> 28:22</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The founder of Christianity, Jesus Christ, prayed that unity might prevail among his followers (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:21-43:17:21" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Joh 17:21</a>), and the apostles were vitally interested in preserving the oneness of the Christian congregation. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:1:10-46:1:10" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1Co 1:10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/65:1:17-65:1:19" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Jude 17-19</a>) Disunity in belief could give rise to fierce disputing, dissension, and even enmity. (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:23:7-44:23:10" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ac 23:7-10</a>.) So sects were to be avoided, being among the works of the flesh. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:5:19-48:5:21" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ga 5:19-21</a>) Christians were warned against becoming promoters of sects or being led astray by false teachers. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:20:28-44:20:28" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Ac 20:28;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:2:17-55:2:18" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 2Ti 2:17, 18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:2:1-61:2:1" data-bid="8-3" class="b"> 2Pe 2:1</a>) In his letter to Titus, the apostle Paul directed that, after being admonished twice, a man who continued promoting a sect be rejected, evidently meaning that he be expelled from the congregation. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/56:3:10-56:3:10" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Tit 3:10</a>) Those who refused to become involved in creating divisions within the congregation or in supporting a particular faction would distinguish themselves by their faithful course and give evidence of having God’s approval. This is apparently what Paul meant when telling the Corinthians: “There must also be sects among you, that the persons approved may also become manifest among you.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:11:19-46:11:19" data-bid="10-1" class="b">1Co 11:19</a>.</p>

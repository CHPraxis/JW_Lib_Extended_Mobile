EUNICE
(Euʹnice) [from a root meaning “conquer”].
A believing Jewess, the daughter of Lois. She was the wife of an unbelieving Greek and the mother of Timothy. (Ac 16:1) It is very likely that the apostle Paul met Eunice at Lystra in Asia Minor on his first missionary tour and that then, as a result of his preaching, she and her mother Lois became Christians. (Ac 14:4-18) The faith of Eunice was “without any hypocrisy.” (2Ti 1:5) Although married to a pagan husband, she was exemplary in teaching her son Timothy “the holy writings” from his “infancy,” and when she became a Christian, she doubtless instructed him accordingly. (2Ti 3:15) Since Eunice’s husband was a Greek, Timothy’s parents had not had him circumcised.​—Ac 16:3.

LEMUEL
(Lemʹu·el) [Belonging to God].
An unidentified king of ancient times whose words are recorded in Proverbs chapter 31. His identity has been the subject of considerable discussion, some commentators suggesting that Lemuel was another name for Solomon. Others identify Lemuel with Hezekiah. The words of King Lemuel constitute “the weighty message that his mother gave to him in correction.” (Pr 31:1) However, the time and circumstances of the king’s reception of such information from his mother are unknown. This “weighty message” advises against involvement with a bad woman, warns of how intoxicating liquor can pervert judgment, highlights the need to judge righteously, and then describes a good wife.

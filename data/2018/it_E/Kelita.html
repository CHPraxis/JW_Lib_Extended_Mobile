<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">(Ke·liʹta) [possibly from a root meaning “too short” [that is, dwarfed]].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><strong>1.</strong> One of the Levites of Ezra’s day who recognized their guilt in taking foreign wives and therefore sent them away. He is also called Kelaiah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/15:10:23-15:10:23" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ezr 10:23,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/15:10:44-15:10:44" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 44</a>) Possibly the same as Nos. 2 and 3.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><strong>2.</strong> A Levite who assisted Ezra in “explaining the law to the people” in 455 B.C.E.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:8:7-16:8:8" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ne 8:7, 8</a>; see No. 1.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><strong>3.</strong> A Levite whose descendant, if not he himself, attested by seal the “trustworthy arrangement” of Nehemiah’s time.

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">It appears that the name Shiloah designated a conduit or canal at Jerusalem. One ancient canal ran from the mouth of the cave of the Gihon Spring down the Kidron Valley and around the end of the SE hill to a pool at the junction of the Hinnom and Tyropoeon valleys. The canal’s gradient of about 4 or 5 mm per meter (less than 0.2 in. per yard) produced a slow gentle flow, a feature that would fit “the waters of the Shiloah that are going gently.” The reference to these “waters of the Shiloah” at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:8:6-23:8:6" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Isaiah 8:6</a> is figurative and represents the source of real salvation and security.</p>

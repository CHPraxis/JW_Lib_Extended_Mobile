<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Evidently one of the geographic extremities of Moab that, according to <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:15:1-23:15:1" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Isaiah 15:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:15:8-23:15:8" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 8</a>, was due to ‘howl’ over that nation’s despoiling. The exact location of the ancient site is uncertain. However, the name Eglaim and a similar name, Agallim, mentioned by Eusebius (<em>Onomasticon,</em> 36, 19-21) as about 12 km (7.5 mi) S of Rabbath-Moab, may be preserved at Rujm el-Jilimeh in that area or at Khirbet Jeljul, a location dating from Nabataean-Roman times, 7 km (4 mi) farther south. Yohanan Aharoni suggests identifying it with Mazraʽ, an oasis NE of the Lisan Peninsula.</p>

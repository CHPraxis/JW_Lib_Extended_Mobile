<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">[Heb., <em>teʼash·shurʹ</em>].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">An evergreen tree of the cone-bearing family. Cypress is included along with other trees as forming part of the “glory of Lebanon,” and this is indicative of the place where it grew and also suggests a tree of desirable qualities or impressive appearance. The “box tree” referred to in the <em>King James Version</em> is not a likely translation since, according to some scholars, the box tree does not grow in Palestine, and in Syria it is only a small shrub. (<em>Unger’s Bible Dictionary,</em> 1965, p. 1134; <em>The Interpreter’s Dictionary of the Bible,</em> edited by G. Buttrick, 1962, Vol. 2, p. 292) The cypress is considered by many to be the tree probably referred to by this Hebrew word at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:41:19-23:41:19" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Isaiah 41:19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:60:13-23:60:13" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 60:13</a>.​—See Moffatt’s translation; <em>A Dictionary of Life in Bible Times,</em> by W. Corswant, Suffolk, 1960, p. 55; <em>The</em> <span id="page564" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="564" data-before-text="564"></span><em>Interpreter’s Dictionary of the Bible,</em> Vol. 1, p. 459; Vol. 2, p. 292; <em>Lexicon in Veteris Testamenti Libros,</em> by L. Koehler and W. Baumgartner, Leiden, 1958, p. 1017.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The cypress (<em>Cupressus sempervirens</em>) has dark-green foliage and branches that extend upward somewhat like those of the Lombardy poplar. It has an average height of 9 to 15 m (30 to 50 ft) but at times may grow as high as 24 m (80 ft). It is commonly cultivated throughout Palestine; some specimens have been found growing wild in Gilead, Edom, and on the slopes of Mount Lebanon. The wood has a rich reddish hue, is fragrant, and is of great durability. It was possibly employed by the Phoenicians, Cretans, and Greeks in shipbuilding (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:27:6-26:27:6" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Eze 27:6</a>), and it is suggested by some that the “resinous tree” from which Noah obtained wood for the ark was the cypress tree.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:6:14-1:6:14" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ge 6:14</a>; see <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200003706/">RESINOUS TREE</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">At <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:41:19-23:41:19" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Isaiah 41:19</a> Jehovah promises to cause trees growing normally in fertile lands to thrive in desert areas as well, and in a prophecy concerning Zion’s future exaltation and prosperity, it is foretold that the cypress, along with the ash and the juniper, will be used to beautify the place of God’s sanctuary.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:60:13-23:60:13" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Isa 60:13</a>.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">At <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:27:6-26:27:6" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ezekiel 27:6</a>, the expression “in cypress wood” is in agreement with the Targums. However, the Hebrew is <em>bath-ʼashu·rimʹ</em> and means “the daughter of the Ashurites.” A number of scholars have concluded that these two Hebrew words should read as one word, <em>bith·ʼash·shu·rimʹ,</em> meaning “in cypress wood.”</p>

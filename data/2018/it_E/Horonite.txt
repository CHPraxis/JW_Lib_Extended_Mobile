HORONITE
(Horʹo·nite) [Of (Belonging to) Beth-horon or Horonaim].
A designation applied to Sanballat, one of the men opposing the work of Nehemiah. (Ne 2:10, 19) Some scholars think that Sanballat may have been from the Moabite city of Horonaim (Isa 15:5; Jer 48:3) and, in support of this, call attention to his being mentioned with Tobiah the Ammonite and Geshem the Arabian. But the view generally favored is that “Horonite” probably means a native, or inhabitant, of Beth-horon. Both Upper and Lower Beth-horon were located in territory originally assigned to Ephraim.​—Jos 16:1, 3, 5.

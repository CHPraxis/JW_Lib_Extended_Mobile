ARBA
(Arʹba) [Four].
He is called “the father” or “the great man” of the Anakim and appears to have been the founder of Kiriath-arba, later called Hebron. (Jos 14:15; 15:13; 21:11) Some consider Anak to be a name applying to the giant race descended from Arba rather than to be the personal name of Arba’s son and thus view Arba as the actual progenitor of the Anakim.​—See ANAK; ANAKIM.

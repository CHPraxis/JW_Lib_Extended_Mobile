MOST HIGH
Topmost as to place, or position. The Hebrew word ʽel·yohnʹ, used with reference to Jehovah as “Most High,” is also applied to other persons or things: The Messianic King, the Greater David, as above the other earthly kings (Ps 89:20, 27), the place above the nations promised to Israel (De 26:18, 19), the topmost basket (Ge 40:17), the upper gate (2Ki 15:35), the upper pool (2Ki 18:17), the upper courtyard (Jer 36:10), the uppermost story (Eze 41:7), the uppermost dining rooms (Eze 42:5), Upper Beth-horon (Jos 16:5), and the upper source of the waters of Gihon (2Ch 32:30). These uses illustrate that ʽel·yohnʹ denotes position rather than power.
When applied to Jehovah, “Most High” emphasizes his supreme position above all others. (Ps 83:18) The title first appears at Genesis 14:18-20 with ʼEl (God), where Melchizedek is called “priest of the Most High God” and, in that capacity, blesses Abraham as well as the Most High God. “Most High” is used in combination with the divine name Jehovah (Ge 14:22; Ps 7:17) and with the plural of excellence ʼElo·himʹ (God) (Ps 78:56), and it also appears alone.​—De 32:8; Ps 9:2; Isa 14:14.
The plural Aramaic form ʽel·yoh·ninʹ occurs at Daniel 7:18, 22, 25, 27, where it may be translated “Supreme One” (NW), the plural being the plural of excellence, majesty. The Aramaic form in the singular number, ʽil·laiʹ (Most High), is used at Daniel 7:25.
The Greek word hyʹpsi·stos (Most High), as applying to Jehovah, is employed mainly by Luke, in his Gospel (twice in Gabriel’s announcement to Mary about the birth of Jesus) and in the Acts. (Lu 1:32, 35, 76; 6:35; 8:28; Ac 7:48; 16:17) The other occurrences are at Mark 5:7 and Hebrews 7:1.

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><strong>1.</strong> A “Horite” whose seven “sons” were sheiks in the land of Seir prior to its being occupied by Esau (Edom). (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:36:20-1:36:21" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ge 36:20, 21,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:36:29-1:36:30" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 29, 30;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:1:38-13:1:38" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> 1Ch 1:38</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:14:4-1:14:6" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ge 14:4-6</a>.) Seir may have lived in the mountainous region S of the Dead Sea, and this area was perhaps named after him. Whether the seven “sons” of Seir were immediate offspring or included later descendants is uncertain.​—See <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200000257/">ANAH</a>; <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200001195/">DISHON</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><strong>2.</strong> The mountainous region between the Dead Sea and the Gulf of ʽAqaba.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:14:6-1:14:6" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ge 14:6</a>) Later, Abraham’s grandson Esau established interests in Seir, while his twin brother Jacob resided at Paddan-aram. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:32:3-1:32:3" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ge 32:3</a>) But it seems that Esau did not complete the move to Seir until sometime after Jacob returned to Canaan. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:36:6-1:36:9" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ge 36:6-9</a>) Finally Esau’s descendants, the Edomites, dispossessed the Horites (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:2:4-5:2:5" data-bid="7-1" class="b">De 2:4, 5,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:2:12-5:2:12" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:24:4-6:24:4" data-bid="7-3" class="b"> Jos 24:4</a>), and the land came to be called Edom. However, the older name Seir was also applied to the descendants of Esau and to the area where they lived.

It appears that during the reign of King Hezekiah men of the tribe of Simeon went to Mount Seir, and after they annihilated the remnant of the Amalekites, Simeonites began residing there.

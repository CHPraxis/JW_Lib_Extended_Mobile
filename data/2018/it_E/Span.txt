SPAN
A linear measure approximately corresponding to the distance between the end of the thumb and the end of the little finger when the hand is spread out. (Ex 28:16; 39:9; 1Sa 17:4; Eze 43:13) Two spans equal one cubit; and three handbreadths, one span. There is evidence that the cubit commonly used by the Israelites was 44.5 cm (17.5 in.) in length. (See CUBIT.) Accordingly, the span would be 22.2 cm (8.75 in.) in length.
When highlighting Jehovah’s greatness, the prophet Isaiah asked: “Who has . . . taken the proportions of the heavens themselves with a mere span?”​—Isa 40:12.
“Span” also translates the Hebrew term tseʹmedh and refers to a “pair” or “couple” of animals yoked together.​—See ACRE.

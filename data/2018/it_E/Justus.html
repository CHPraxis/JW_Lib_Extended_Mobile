<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><strong>1.</strong> The surname of Joseph Barsabbas. Justus and Matthias were the two candidates suggested as possible replacements for Judas Iscariot as an apostle. The lot fell to Matthias. Even though Justus was not chosen, his being considered for the office shows he was a mature disciple of Jesus Christ.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:1:23-44:1:26" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ac 1:23-26</a>.</p>

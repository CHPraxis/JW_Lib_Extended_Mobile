DABERATH
(Dabʹe·rath) [Pasture].
A city mentioned in the boundary list of Zebulun (Jos 19:10, 12) but regarded as belonging to the neighboring tribe of Issachar when later apportioned with its pasture ground to Levites of the family of Gershon (Gershom). (Jos 21:27, 28; 1Ch 6:71, 72) Daberath is not included in the list of sites assigned to Issachar, but many geographers think it is likely represented by Rabbith at Joshua 19:20, a view that finds support in the text of Vatican Manuscript No. 1209.​—See RABBITH.
Daberath is identified today with ruins at Khirbet Dabura (Horvat Devora), near the village of Dabburiya on the NW edge of Mount Tabor.

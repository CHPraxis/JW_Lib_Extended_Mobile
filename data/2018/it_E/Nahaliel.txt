NAHALIEL
(Na·halʹi·el) [Torrent (Torrent Valley) of God].
A place where the Israelites encamped not long before their fight with Amorite King Sihon. (Nu 21:19-24) Eusebius’ Onomasticon locates it near the Arnon. Nahaliel is therefore commonly linked with one of two wadis, the Wala (a tributary of the Arnon) and the Zarqa Maʽin about 19 km (12 mi) N of the Arnon. A location on either of these wadis would fit the suggested identifications for Mattanah and Bamoth, the two Israelite encampments between which Nahaliel apparently lay.

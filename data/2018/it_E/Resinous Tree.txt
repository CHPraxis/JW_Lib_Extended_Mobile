RESINOUS TREE
[Heb., goʹpher].
A tree whose wood Noah used in the construction of the ark but which cannot be identified with any degree of certainty. (Ge 6:14) The King James Version simply transliterates the Hebrew name. On the basis of the similarity between the Hebrew name and the Hebrew term for “tar” (“pitch,” KJ; Heb., koʹpher) some relate it to some kind of resinous tree. Scholars generally favor the cypress, which is a very durable tree, extremely resistant to decay.​—See CYPRESS.

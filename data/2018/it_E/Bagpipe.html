<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Although the Aramaic word <em>sum·pon·yahʹ,</em> appearing in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:3:5-27:3:5" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Daniel 3:5,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:3:10-27:3:10" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 10,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:3:15-27:3:15" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> 15</a>, has been translated “dulcimer” (a stringed instrument) (<em>KJ, Kx</em>) and “symphony” (<em>Dy, Yg</em>), modern Bible translations generally render the expression as “bagpipe.” Koehler and Baumgartner’s <em>Lexicon in Veteris Testamenti Libros</em> gives the meaning “bagpipe.”​—Leiden, 1958, p. 1103.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><em>Sum·pon·yahʹ</em> may have resembled present-day simple Oriental bagpipes. The required airtight bag is made from a goatskin, without the feet, tail, or head, but many times with the hair still covering it. A tube to fill the bag with air is inserted into this bag and so are flutelike pipes that are made from reeds and the tips of cows’ horns.</p>

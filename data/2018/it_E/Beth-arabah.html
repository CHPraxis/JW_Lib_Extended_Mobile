<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">(Beth-arʹa·bah) [House of the Desert Plain].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">One of the six cities within Judah’s territory described as “in the wilderness.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:15:61-6:15:61" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Jos 15:61</a>) It is used in describing the mutual boundaries of the tribes of Benjamin and Judah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:15:6-6:15:6" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Jos 15:6</a>) Though listed as within the tribal assignment of Judah, it is thereafter spoken of as pertaining to Benjamin, perhaps indicating the site as an enclave city of the Benjamites. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:18:21-6:18:22" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Jos 18:21, 22</a>) Remaining evidence of the name may be seen in ʽAin el-Gharabah, a spring on the N side of the Wadi el Qilt about 6 km (3.5 mi) ESE of Jericho. This location would place it in the desert region at the N end of the Dead Sea.</p>

HAZAR-SHUAL
(Haʹzar-shuʹal) [Courtyard (Settlement) of the Fox].
An enclave city of Simeon in the S of Judah. (Jos 15:21, 28; 19:1-3; 1Ch 4:28) It was reoccupied after the Babylonian exile. (Ne 11:25-27) The location is uncertain; some scholars suggest an identification with Khirbet el-Watan, about 3 km (2 mi) ESE of Beer-sheba.

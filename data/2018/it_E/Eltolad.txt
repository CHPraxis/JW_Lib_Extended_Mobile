ELTOLAD
(El·toʹlad).
A city located in the southern part of the territory of the tribe of Judah, toward the border of Edom (Jos 15:21, 30), also called Tolad in 1 Chronicles 4:29. Eltolad was one of the Judean cities allotted to the Simeonites as their inheritance. (Jos 19:1, 4) As 1 Chronicles 4:24-31 shows, these were the Simeonites’ cities down till David reigned.

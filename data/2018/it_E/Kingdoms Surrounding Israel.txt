Kingdoms Surrounding Israel




DWELLING in its God-given land, the nation of Israel found itself surrounded by nations that worshiped false gods. The Israelites had come out of Egypt, where animals were deified. To the east and southeast of them now lay Ammon, Moab, and Edom​—distant relatives of the Israelites but idol worshipers. The polytheistic Philistines occupied the coastal plain to the west. North of Israel along the coast were the Phoenicians, whose religious practices included sodomy, bestiality, and child sacrifice. And the religion of the Syrians featured nude representations of goddesses whose gestures emphasized their sexuality. To continue to be acceptable to Jehovah, Israel had to keep separate from the nations around them.
As a safeguard to Israel, Jehovah gave them the Mosaic Law, which constituted a ‘wall of separation’ to keep them apart from the surrounding nations. (Eph 2:14) They were not to form alliances with such nations, to intermarry with them, or to imitate their religious practices. (2Ch 16:7; 2Ki 17:13-15) To the extent that Israel obeyed these laws, they remained a holy people.
Yet, individuals from surrounding nations were not barred from worshiping the true God. They could abandon their idolatrous ways and become worshipers of Jehovah. “God is not partial.” (Ac 10:34) While he was keeping Israel separate, Jehovah was working out his purpose for the eventual blessing of people of all nations.​—Ge 22:18.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">(Sabʹtah).</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A son of Cush and brother of Nimrod; progenitor of one of the 70 post-Flood families. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:10:7-1:10:8" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ge 10:7, 8,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:10:32-1:10:32" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 32;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:1:9-13:1:10" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> 1Ch 1:9, 10</a>) Sabtah’s descendants apparently settled in southern Arabia, perhaps in one of the places later bearing a name similar to his. Sabota, the ancient capital of Hadhramaut, has been suggested, and Ptolemy mentions a town called Saptha near the Persian Gulf, but any connection of these places with Sabtah remains uncertain.</p>

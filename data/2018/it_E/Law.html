<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">“1. The principles and regulations emanating from a government and applicable to a people, whether in the form of legislation or of custom and policies recognized and enforced by judicial decision. 2. Any written or positive rule, or collection of rules, prescribed under the authority of the state or nation.” (<em>The American College Dictionary,</em> edited by C. L. Barnhart, 1966) “A divine commandment or a revelation of the will of God . . . the whole body of God’s commandments or revelations: the will of God . . . : a rule of right living or good conduct esp[ecially] when conceived as having the sanction of God’s will, of conscience or the moral nature, or of natural justice.”​—<em>Webster’s Third New International Dictionary,</em> 1981.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The word “law,” in the Hebrew Scriptures, is translated primarily from the Hebrew word <em>toh·rahʹ,</em> related to the verb <em>ya·rahʹ,</em> meaning “direct, teach, instruct.” In some cases it is translated from the Aramaic term <em>dath</em>. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:6:5-27:6:5" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Da 6:5,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:6:8-27:6:8" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 8,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:6:15-27:6:15" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> 15</a>) Other words translated in the <em>King James Version</em> as “law” are <em>mish·patʹ</em> (judicial decision, judgment), and <em>mits·wahʹ</em> (commandment). In the Greek Scriptures the word <em>noʹmos,</em> from the verb <em>neʹmo</em> (deal out, distribute), is translated “law.”</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:11-1:1:12" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Ge 1:11, 12,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:21-1:1:21" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> 21,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:24-1:1:25" data-bid="18-3" class="b"> 24, 25</a>) Man also brought forth sons “in his likeness, in his image.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:5:3-1:5:3" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Ge 5:3</a>) At <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:139:13-19:139:16" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Psalm 139:13-16</a> the embryonic growth of a child in the womb is spoken of, its parts being written down “in [Jehovah’s] book” before any of them actually existed. <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:26:7-18:26:7" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Job 26:7</a> describes Jehovah as “hanging the earth upon nothing.” Scientists today attribute the earth’s position in space primarily to the interaction of the law of gravity and the law of centrifugal force.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><strong>Law to Adam.</strong> In the garden of Eden, Adam and Eve were commanded by God concerning their duties (1) to fill the earth, (2) to subdue it, and (3) to have in subjection all other living creatures of earth, sea, and air. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:28-1:1:28" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Ge 1:28</a>) They were given laws as to their diet, granting them the seed-bearing vegetation and fruit as food.

<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><strong>Laws to Noah; Patriarchal Law.</strong> Noah was given commandments relative to the building of the ark and the saving of his family. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:6:22-1:6:22" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Ge 6:22</a>) After the Flood he was given laws that allowed the adding of flesh to man’s diet; declared the sacredness of life and therefore of blood, in which is the life; prohibited the eating of blood; condemned murder; and instituted capital punishment for this crime.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:9:3-1:9:6" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Ge 9:3-6</a>.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">The patriarch was a family head and ruler. Jehovah is designated as the great Family Head, or Patriarch, “the Father, to whom every family in heaven and on earth owes its name.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:3:14-49:3:15" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Eph 3:14, 15</a>) Noah, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are outstanding examples of patriarchs. These were especially dealt with by Jehovah. Abraham was given the command to circumcise all the males of his household as a sign of God’s covenant with him. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:17:11-1:17:12" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Ge 17:11, 12</a>) He observed Jehovah’s “commands,” “statutes,” and “laws.” He knew Jehovah’s way to do righteousness and judgment and he laid these commands on his household.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:26:4-1:26:5" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Ge 26:4, 5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:18:19-1:18:19" data-bid="31-2" class="b"> 18:19</a>.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">The laws that governed the patriarchs were also generally understood and partially reflected in the laws of the nations at that time, all of which nations sprang from the three sons of Noah, the patriarch. For example, the Pharaoh of Egypt knew that it was wrong to take another man’s wife (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:12:14-1:12:20" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Ge 12:14-20</a>), as did the kings of the Philistines in the cases of Sarah and Rebekah.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:20:2-1:20:6" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Ge 20:2-6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:26:7-1:26:11" data-bid="33-2" class="b"> 26:7-11</a>.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">In the days of Moses, the Israelites were in slavery to Egypt. They had voluntarily gone into Egypt during Jacob’s lifetime but were enslaved after Jacob’s son, the prime minister Joseph, had died. So, in effect, they were sold into slavery for nothing. Jehovah, in harmony with the patriarchal law of redemption and of the priority of the firstborn son, told Pharaoh, by the mouth of Moses and Aaron: “Israel is my son, my firstborn. And I say to you: Send my son away that he may serve me. But should you refuse to send him away, here I am killing your son, your firstborn.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:4:22-2:4:23" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Ex 4:22, 23</a>) No redemption price was necessary for this release, nor was any given to Egypt. And when the Israelites left their slave masters, the Egyptians, “Jehovah gave the people favor in the eyes of the Egyptians, so that these granted them what was asked; and they stripped the Egyptians.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:3:21-2:3:21" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Ex 3:21;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:12:36-2:12:36" data-bid="35-2" class="b"> 12:36</a>) They had entered the land with the approval of the Pharaoh, not as captives of war to be enslaved, but as free people. The enslavement had been unjust, so evidently Jehovah was seeing to it that they were now given wages for their labor.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">The family was held responsible for violations of law by individual members. The patriarchal head was the responsible representative; he was blamed for wrongs of his family and was required to punish individual wrongdoers in the family.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:31:30-1:31:32" data-bid="36-1" class="b">Ge 31:30-32</a>.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb"><strong><em>Marriage and birthright.</em></strong> Parents governed the arrangement of marriage for their sons and daughters. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:24:1-1:24:4" data-bid="37-1" class="b">Ge 24:1-4</a>) The paying of a bride-price was common. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:34:11-1:34:12" data-bid="38-1" class="b">Ge 34:11, 12</a>) Among the worshipers of Jehovah, intermarriage with idolaters was disobedience and was against the interests of the family.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:26:34-1:26:35" data-bid="39-1" class="b">Ge 26:34, 35;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:27:46-1:27:46" data-bid="39-2" class="b"> 27:46;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:28:1-1:28:1" data-bid="39-3" class="b"> 28:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:28:6-1:28:9" data-bid="39-4" class="b"> 6-9</a>.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">The birthright was reserved for the firstborn, belonging to him by inheritance. This included receiving a double portion of the estate. However, it could be transferred by the family head, the father. <span id="page213" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="213" data-before-text="213"></span>(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:48:22-1:48:22" data-bid="40-1" class="b">Ge 48:22;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:5:1-13:5:1" data-bid="40-2" class="b"> 1Ch 5:1</a>) The oldest son normally became the patriarchal head when the father died. Sons, after marriage, could establish households separate from the father’s headship and could themselves become family heads.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb"><strong><em>Morals.</em></strong> Fornication was disgraceful and punishable, especially in cases of engaged persons or married persons (adultery).

His brother then had the responsibility to take the widow as his wife, and the firstborn of their union would inherit the dead man’s estate and carry on his name.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:25:5-5:25:6" data-bid="42-1" class="b">De 25:5, 6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:38:6-1:38:26" data-bid="42-2" class="b"> Ge 38:6-26</a>.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb"><strong><em>Property.</em></strong> Generally there seems to have been no holding of individual property, aside from a few personal belongings; all herds, household goods, and equipment were held in common by the family.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:31:14-1:31:16" data-bid="43-1" class="b">Ge 31:14-16</a>.</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">On the basis of related historical evidence, some scholars believe that, in transferring land, the buyer was shown the land from a vantage point, the exact boundaries being designated. When the buyer said, “I see,” he indicated legal acceptance. When Jehovah gave Abraham the promise of receiving the land of Canaan, Abraham was first told to look in all four directions. Abraham did not say, “I see,” perhaps because God said that he would give the Promised Land to Abraham’s <em>seed,</em> later on. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:13:14-1:13:15" data-bid="44-1" class="b">Ge 13:14, 15</a>) Moses, as the legal representative of Israel, was told to “see” the land, which, if the view just discussed is correct, would indicate legal transfer of the land to Israel, for them to take it under Joshua’s leadership.

<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb"><strong><em>Custody.</em></strong> Legal responsibility came when an individual promised to keep or ‘guard’ a person, animal, or thing. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:30:31-1:30:31" data-bid="49-1" class="b">Ge 30:31</a>) Reuben, as the firstborn of Jacob, was responsible in the case of Joseph’s disappearance.

He had to restore animals stolen, but not those that died of themselves or that were lost through events beyond his control, such as a raid by armed sheep rustlers. If an animal was killed by a wild beast, evidence of the torn animal had to be produced to clear the custodian of responsibility.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:37:12-1:37:30" data-bid="51-1" class="b">Ge 37:12-30,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:37:32-1:37:33" data-bid="51-2" class="b"> 32, 33;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:22:10-2:22:13" data-bid="51-3" class="b"> Ex 22:10-13</a>.</p>

<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb"><strong>Law of God to Israel​—The Law of Moses.</strong> Jehovah gave Israel the Law through Moses as mediator, in the Wilderness of Sinai, 1513 B.C.E. At the inauguration of the Law at Mount Horeb there was an awe-inspiring demonstration of Jehovah’s power.

<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">The first five books of the Bible (Genesis through Deuteronomy) are often referred to as the Law. Sometimes this term is used with reference to the entire inspired Hebrew Scriptures. Generally, however, the Jews considered the entire Hebrew Scriptures to be composed of three sections, “the law of Moses,” “the Prophets,” and “Psalms.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:24:44-42:24:44" data-bid="56-1" class="b">Lu 24:44</a>) Commands that came through the prophets were binding upon Israel.</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">Jehovah was identified in the Law as absolute Sovereign and also as King in a special way. Since Jehovah was both God and King of Israel, disobedience to the Law was both a religious offense and lèse-majesté, an offense against the Head of State, which in this case was against the King Jehovah. David, Solomon, and their successors on the throne of Judah were said to sit on “Jehovah’s throne.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:29:23-13:29:23" data-bid="57-1" class="b">1Ch 29:23</a>) Human kings and rulers in Israel were bound by the Law, and when they became despotic they were law violators accountable to God. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:15:22-9:15:23" data-bid="58-1" class="b">1Sa 15:22, 23</a>) Kingship and priesthood were separate, this separation constituting a balance of power and a safeguard against tyranny. It kept the Israelites ever mindful that Jehovah was their God and real King. Each individual’s relationship to God and to his fellowman was defined by the Law, and each individual could approach God through the priestly arrangement.</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">The Law gave the Israelites the opportunity to become “a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:19:5-2:19:6" data-bid="59-1" class="b">Ex 19:5, 6</a>) The Law’s demands of exclusive devotion to Jehovah, its absolute prohibition of any form of interfaith, and its regulations concerning religious cleanness and diet constituted a “wall” to keep the nation outstandingly separate from other nations.

Additional effects, which could be considered incidental to the religious separation that the Law covenant accomplished, were the health benefits and the protection from diseases common to the nations around the Israelites. The laws of moral cleanness, physical sanitation, and diet undoubtedly had a salutary effect when they were obeyed.</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">But the real purpose of the Law was, as stated by the apostle Paul, “to make transgressions manifest, until the seed should arrive.” It was a “tutor leading to Christ.” It pointed to Christ as the objective aimed at (“Christ is the end of the Law”). It revealed that all humans, including the Jews, are under sin and that life cannot be obtained by “works of law.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:3:19-48:3:24" data-bid="62-1" class="b">Ga 3:19-24;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:3:20-45:3:20" data-bid="62-2" class="b"> Ro 3:20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:10:4-45:10:4" data-bid="62-3" class="b"> 10:4</a>) It was “spiritual,” from God, and “holy.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:7:12-45:7:12" data-bid="63-1" class="b">Ro 7:12,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:7:14-45:7:14" data-bid="63-2" class="b"> 14</a>) At <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:2:15-49:2:15" data-bid="64-1" class="b">Ephesians 2:15</a> it is called “the Law of commandments consisting in decrees.” It was a standard of perfection, marking the one who could keep it as perfect, worthy of life.

<p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">The Law also served as “a shadow of the good things to come,” and things connected with it were “typical representations,” causing Jesus and the apostles to call upon it often to explain heavenly things and matters concerning Christian doctrine and conduct. Therefore, it provides an essential and necessary field of study for the Christian.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:10:1-58:10:1" data-bid="68-1" class="b">Heb 10:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:9:23-58:9:23" data-bid="68-2" class="b"> 9:23</a>.</p>
<p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb">Jesus said that the whole Law hung upon the two commandments, to love God and to love one’s neighbor. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:22:35-40:22:40" data-bid="69-1" class="b">Mt 22:35-40</a>) It is interesting that in the book of Deuteronomy (where the Law was modified somewhat to govern Israel’s new circumstances upon settling in the Promised Land) the Hebrew words for “love,” “loved,” and so forth, appear more than 20 times.</p>
<p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb">The Ten Words (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:34:28-2:34:28" data-bid="70-1" class="b">Ex 34:28</a>), or the Ten Commandments, were the basic part of the Law but were combined with about 600 other laws, all of which were of equal force and binding power upon the Israelites. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:2:10-59:2:10" data-bid="71-1" class="b">Jas 2:10</a>) The first four of the Ten Commandments defined man’s relationship to God; the fifth, to God and to parents; and the last five, to one’s fellowman. These last five were named in apparent order of severity of harm done to one’s fellowman: murder, adultery, stealing, bearing false witness, and covetousness or selfish desire. The tenth commandment makes the Law unique in comparison with the laws of all other nations in that it prohibits selfish desire, a command in reality enforceable only by God. It actually got at the cause of violation of all the other commandments.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:20:2-2:20:17" data-bid="72-1" class="b">Ex 20:2-17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:5:6-5:5:21" data-bid="72-2" class="b"> De 5:6-21</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:5:5-49:5:5" data-bid="73-1" class="b">Eph 5:5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:3:5-51:3:5" data-bid="73-2" class="b"> Col 3:5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:1:14-59:1:15" data-bid="73-3" class="b"> Jas 1:14, 15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:2:15-62:2:17" data-bid="73-4" class="b"> 1Jo 2:15-17</a>.</p>
<p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sb">The Law contained many principles and guiding statutes. The judges were given latitude to investigate and consider motives and attitude of violators, along with the circumstances surrounding the violation. A deliberate, disrespectful, or unrepentant violator received the full penalty. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:15:30-4:15:31" data-bid="74-1" class="b">Nu 15:30, 31</a>) In other cases a lighter judgment might be determined.

Paul describes the conflict, saying that fallen flesh infected with sin is enslaved to “sin’s law.” “The minding of the flesh means death,” but “God, by sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and concerning sin, condemned sin in the flesh.” With the help of God’s spirit the Christian can win the fight​—by exercising faith in Christ, putting to death the practices of the body, and living according to the spirit’s direction—​and can gain life.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:7:21-45:8:13" data-bid="95-1" class="b">Ro 7:21–8:13</a>.</p>

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Apparently the name of a site with a great cistern where Saul inquired as to the whereabouts of David and Samuel. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:19:21-9:19:22" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1Sa 19:21, 22</a>) Secu was near Ramah, but its exact location is now unknown. Instead of the proper name “Secu,” some scholars, following certain Greek and Latin manuscripts, prefer such expressions as “the threshing-floor on the bare hill [height].”​—<em>JB, AT.</em></p>

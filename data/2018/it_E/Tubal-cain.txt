TUBAL-CAIN
(Tuʹbal-cain).
Son of Lamech by his second wife Zillah; therefore, a descendant of Cain and half brother of Jabal and Jubal. He had a sister named Naamah. (Ge 4:17-22) Tubal-cain was “the forger of every sort of tool of copper and iron,” which can be taken to mean that either he invented such tools or he founded or was prominent in the occupation.

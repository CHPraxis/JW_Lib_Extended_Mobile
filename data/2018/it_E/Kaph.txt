KAPH
[כ; final, ך].
The 11th letter of the Hebrew alphabet. In sound kaph corresponds to kh when not having the point (daghesh lene) in it; but with this point in it (כּ), it becomes hard like the English “k.” In the Hebrew, it is the initial letter in each of the eight verses of Psalm 119:81-88. The letters kaph [כ] and behth [ב] are similar in appearance.

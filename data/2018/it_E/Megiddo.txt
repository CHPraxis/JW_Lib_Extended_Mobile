Megiddo




STRATEGICALLY located and dominating major trade and military routes, Megiddo was a focus of international interest in Bible times. The valley plain at its feet became the site of many decisive battles. Therefore, the book of Revelation fittingly names the coming “war of the great day of God the Almighty” Har–Magedon (from Heb., meaning “Mountain of Megiddo”). However, it is not at literal Megiddo that this war will be fought. It will involve “the kings of the entire inhabited earth.” (Re 16:14, 16) This time no human ruler will be victor. It will be the Kingdom of God that will prove triumphant over all of them, vindicating Jehovah God, the Almighty, as Universal Sovereign.

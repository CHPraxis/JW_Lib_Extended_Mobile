JUDGMENT SEAT
Usually a raised outdoor platform, approached by steps, from which seated officials could address the crowds and announce their decisions. (Mt 27:19; Joh 19:13; Ac 12:21; 25:6, 10, 17) What is thought by some to have been the judgment seat (called the Bema) at Corinth, where Paul appeared before Gallio, was built of white and blue marble. (Ac 18:1, 12, 16, 17) Alongside it were two waiting rooms with mosaic floors and marble benches.
Jehovah God has committed all judging to his Son (Joh 5:22, 27), and therefore all must appear before ‘the judgment seat of Christ.’ (2Co 5:10) This is also rightly called “the judgment seat of God” in that Jehovah is the Originator of the arrangement and judges by means of his Son.​—Ro 14:10.

NAIOTH
(Naiʹoth).
Seemingly a place where certain prophets resided in the time of Samuel. (1Sa 19:18–20:1) It may refer to a certain locality or quarter of the town of Ramah, in the hill country of Ephraim. (See RAMAH No. 5.) Textual critic S. R. Driver corroborates this view, observing: “Probably it is the name of some locality in Ramah, the signification of which is lost to us.”​—Notes on the Hebrew Text and the Topography of the Books of Samuel, Oxford, 1966, p. 159.

JEHOVAH HIMSELF IS THERE
This expression translates Yehwahʹ Shamʹmah, applied to the city seen by the prophet Ezekiel in his vision recorded in chapters 40 through 48. (Eze 48:35) The visionary city is depicted as foursquare (4,500 long cubits to a side [2,331 m; 7,650 ft]) and as having 12 gates, each bearing the name of one of the tribes of Israel. (Eze 48:15, 16, 31-34) The visionary city of Ezekiel’s prophecy is to belong to “all the house of Israel.” (Eze 45:6) The name Jehovah-Shammah, or “Jehovah Himself Is There,” would signify a representational presence of God like that expressed in other texts, such as Psalm 46:5; 132:13, 14; Isaiah 24:23; Joel 3:21; and Zechariah 2:10, 11, where Jehovah, whom ‘the heaven of the heavens cannot contain,’ is spoken of as though residing in an earthly city or place.​—1Ki 8:27; see also CHIEFTAIN.

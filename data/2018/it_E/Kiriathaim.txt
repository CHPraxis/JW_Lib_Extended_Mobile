KIRIATHAIM
(Kir·i·a·thaʹim) [Double Town].
1. A city E of the Jordan, built or rebuilt by the Reubenites. (Nu 32:37; Jos 13:15, 19) At a later period the city came under Moabite control. It is mentioned in the prophecies of Jeremiah (48:1) and Ezekiel (25:9) as a city of Moab that would experience calamity. Earlier, Moabite King Mesha in the ninth century B.C.E. boasted about building Qaryaten (apparently Kiriathaim).
Scholars usually situate it in the area near Quraiyat, about 10 km (6 mi) WNW of Dibon. The remains found there, however, do not date prior to the first century B.C.E., so the exact location is uncertain.
2. A site in Naphtali given to the Levitical Gershonites (1Ch 6:71, 76) and called Kartan in Joshua 21:32.​—See KARTAN.

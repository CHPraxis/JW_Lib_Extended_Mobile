<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">(Ze·ruʹiah) [possibly from a root meaning “balsam”].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">King David’s sister or half sister and the mother of Joab, Abishai, and Asahel. Zeruiah’s sister Abigail is said to be “the daughter of Nahash,” though that is not directly stated of Zeruiah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:17:25-10:17:25" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2Sa 17:25</a>) Zeruiah and Abigail are also said to be “sisters” of the sons of Jesse. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:2:16-13:2:16" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1Ch 2:16</a>) It is possible, therefore, that they were daughters of Jesse’s wife by a previous marriage to Nahash, therefore only half sisters of David. (See <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200000037/">ABIGAIL</a> No. 2; <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200003167/">NAHASH</a> No. 2.) Apparently Zeruiah was considerably older than David, for her sons seem to have been about the same age as David. Zeruiah’s name is usually associated with her three sons, who were all valiant fighters for David. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:2:13-10:2:13" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2Sa 2:13,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:2:18-10:2:18" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:16:9-10:16:9" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> 16:9</a>) The only reference made to the boys’ father is that he was buried at Bethlehem.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:2:32-10:2:32" data-bid="4-1" class="b">2Sa 2:32</a>.</p>

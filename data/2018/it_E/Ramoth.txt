RAMOTH
(Raʹmoth) [probably, Lofty Places; from a root meaning “rise”].
1. A Levite city in the territory of Issachar. (1Ch 6:71-73) It is apparently the same as Remeth and Jarmuth (No. 2). (Jos 19:17, 21; 21:27-29) Ramoth is tentatively identified with Kokab el-Hawa (Kokhav ha-Yarden), on a tableland about 10 km (6 mi) N of Beth-shean.
2. “Ramoth of the south” at 1 Samuel 30:27 apparently refers to the “Baalath-beer, Ramah of the south” mentioned at Joshua 19:8. Its location was evidently in the Negeb.​—See RAMAH No. 2.
3. A city in Gilead, east of the Jordan River. (Jos 20:8) In time it came to be called Ramoth-gilead.​—See RAMOTH-GILEAD.

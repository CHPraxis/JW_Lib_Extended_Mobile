BETH-REHOB
(Beth-reʹhob) [House of the Public Square (Broad Place)].
Evidently the name of a small Aramaean kingdom, perhaps applied primarily to its principal city. In the account of the attack on Laish by 600 Danites, Laish is described as “in the low plain that belonged to Beth-rehob.” (Jg 18:7, 28) Later, in David’s time, the Ammonites hired Syrian mercenaries from Beth-rehob in a vain attempt to defend themselves against the Israelite forces. (2Sa 10:6) It was also called simply “Rehob” (2Sa 10:8) and is, therefore, thought to be the same place mentioned among the points reached by the 12 Israelite spies in their preliminary investigation of the land of Canaan.​—Nu 13:21.
Beth-rehob’s association with “the low plain” in which Laish (later Dan) was situated and the statement at Numbers 13:21, that Rehob was in the direction of “the entering in of Hamath,” likely point to a location in the southern part of the Beqaʽ Valley, which lies between the Lebanon and the Anti-Lebanon mountains. The exact location is uncertain.

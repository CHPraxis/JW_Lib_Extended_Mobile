MILE
A measure of distance. (Mt 5:41) In the Scriptures miʹli·on, the measure in question, is probably the Roman mile (1,479.5 m; 4,854 ft). At Luke 24:13; John 6:19; 11:18 the word miʹli·on does not appear in the Greek text, but the distance figures are given in terms of stadia (1 Roman stadium = 1⁄8 Roman mi; 185 m; 606.75 ft). In the New World Translation the figures for the stadia at Luke 24:13; John 6:19; 11:18 have been converted to statute miles. For example, “sixty stadia” is given as “about seven miles” (11 km).​—Lu 24:13.

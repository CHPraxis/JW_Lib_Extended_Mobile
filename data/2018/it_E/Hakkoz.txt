HAKKOZ
(Hakʹkoz) [The Thorn].
An Aaronic priest and head of the paternal house that in David’s time was constituted the 7th of the 24 priestly divisions.​—1Ch 24:3-7, 10.
After returning from Babylon in 537 B.C.E., “sons of Hakkoz” were among those who were disqualified from the priesthood because of being unable to establish their genealogy. They were among those forbidden to eat from “the most holy things until a priest stood up with Urim and Thummim.” (Ezr 2:61-63; Ne 7:63-65) A descendant of Hakkoz is specifically referred to as sharing in rebuilding the walls of Jerusalem.​—Ne 3:21.

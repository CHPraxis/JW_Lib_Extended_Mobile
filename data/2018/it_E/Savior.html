<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">One who preserves or delivers from danger or destruction. Jehovah is identified as the principal Savior, the only Source of deliverance. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:43:11-23:43:11" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Isa 43:11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:45:21-23:45:21" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 45:21</a>) He was the Savior and Deliverer of Israel, time and again. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:106:8-19:106:8" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ps 106:8,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:106:10-19:106:10" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 10,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:106:21-19:106:21" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> 21;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:43:3-23:43:3" data-bid="2-4" class="b"> Isa 43:3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:45:15-23:45:15" data-bid="2-5" class="b"> 45:15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:14:8-24:14:8" data-bid="2-6" class="b"> Jer 14:8</a>) He saved not only the nation but also individuals who served him. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:22:1-10:22:3" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2Sa 22:1-3</a>) Often his salvation was through men raised up by him as saviors. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:9:27-16:9:27" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ne 9:27</a>) During the period of the Judges, these special saviors were divinely selected and empowered to deliver Israel from foreign oppression. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:2:16-7:2:16" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Jg 2:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:3:9-7:3:9" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 3:9,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:3:15-7:3:15" data-bid="5-3" class="b"> 15</a>) While the judge lived, he served to keep Israel in the right way, and this brought them relief from their enemies. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:2:18-7:2:18" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Jg 2:18</a>) When Jesus was on earth, Jehovah was his Savior, supporting and strengthening him to maintain integrity through his strenuous trials.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:5:7-58:5:7" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Heb 5:7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:28:8-19:28:8" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> Ps 28:8</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Along with his role as Savior, Jehovah is also the “Repurchaser.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:49:26-23:49:26" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Isa 49:26;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:60:16-23:60:16" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 60:16</a>) In the past he redeemed his people Israel from captivity. In delivering Christians from sin’s bondage, he does the repurchasing through his Son Jesus Christ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:4:14-62:4:14" data-bid="9-1" class="b">1Jo 4:14</a>), Jehovah’s provision for salvation, who is therefore exalted as “Chief Agent and Savior.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:5:31-44:5:31" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ac 5:31</a>) Accordingly, Jesus Christ can rightly be called “our Savior,” even though he performs the salvation as the agent of Jehovah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/56:1:4-56:1:4" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Tit 1:4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:1:11-61:1:11" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 2Pe 1:11</a>) The name Jesus, given to God’s Son by angelic direction, means “Jehovah Is Salvation,” for, said the angel, “he will save his people from their sins.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:1:21-40:1:21" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Mt 1:21;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:1:31-42:1:31" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> Lu 1:31</a>) This name points out that Jehovah is the Source of salvation, accomplished <em>through</em> Jesus. For this reason we find the Father and the Son spoken of together in connection with salvation.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/56:2:11-56:2:13" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Tit 2:11-13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/56:3:4-56:3:6" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 3:4-6</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Salvation is provided by Jehovah through Jesus Christ for “all sorts of men.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:4:10-54:4:10" data-bid="14-1" class="b">1Ti 4:10</a>) He saves them from sin and death (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:8:2-45:8:2" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Ro 8:2</a>), from Babylon the Great (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:18:2-66:18:2" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Re 18:2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:18:4-66:18:4" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> 4</a>), from this world under Satan’s control (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:16-43:17:16" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Joh 17:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:1:13-51:1:13" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> Col 1:13</a>), and from destruction and everlasting death (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:7:14-66:7:17" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Re 7:14-17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:3-66:21:4" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> 21:3, 4</a>). “A great crowd” is shown at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:7:9-66:7:10" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Revelation 7:9, 10</a> attributing salvation to God and to the Lamb.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The ransom sacrifice is the basis for salvation, and as King and everlasting High Priest, Christ Jesus has the authority and power “to save completely those who are approaching God through him.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:7:23-58:7:25" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Heb 7:23-25;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:19:16-66:19:16" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> Re 19:16</a>) He is “a savior of this body,” the congregation of his anointed followers, and also of all who exercise faith in him.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:5:23-49:5:23" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Eph 5:23;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:4:14-62:4:14" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> 1Jo 4:14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:3:16-43:3:17" data-bid="21-3" class="b"> Joh 3:16, 17</a>.</p>

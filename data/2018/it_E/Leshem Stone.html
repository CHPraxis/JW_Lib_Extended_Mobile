<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">An unidentified precious stone that was placed first in the third row of gems on the high priest’s “breastpiece of judgment.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:28:15-2:28:15" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ex 28:15,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:28:19-2:28:19" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:39:12-2:39:12" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> 39:12</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Various stones, such as amber, hyacinth, opal, and tourmaline, have been suggested as being identical with <em>“leshem</em> stone,” but none of these identifications can be substantiated. The <em>New World Translation</em> therefore leaves the Hebrew word untranslated as <em>leshem</em> stone.</p>

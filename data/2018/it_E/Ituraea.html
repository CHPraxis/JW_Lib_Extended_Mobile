<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A small territory of varying and undefined boundaries located NE of the Sea of Galilee.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The name Ituraea is thought to derive from Ishmael’s son Jetur, whose descendants residing E of the Jordan were defeated by the Israelites.

To remain in the country, the inhabitants of Ituraea had to submit to circumcision and obey Jewish law. (<em>Jewish Antiquities,</em> XIII, 318 [xi, 3]) Later, Ituraea was one of the territories comprising the tetrarchy of Philip, inherited from his father Herod the Great.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:3:1-42:3:1" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Lu 3:1</a>.</p>

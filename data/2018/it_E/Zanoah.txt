ZANOAH
(Za·noʹah) [possibly from a root meaning “stink”].
1. A Judean city in the Shephelah. (Jos 15:20, 33, 34, 36) It was among the cities reinhabited after the Babylonian exile. (Ne 11:25, 30) The residents of this Zanoah may have been the ones who did repair work on Jerusalem’s southern wall and its Valley Gate. (Ne 3:13) It is identified with Khirbet Zanuʽ (Horvat Zanoah), about 5 km (3 mi) SE of Beth-shemesh.
2. A city in the mountainous region of Judah. (Jos 15:20, 48, 56, 57) This is apparently the Zanoah referred to at 1 Chronicles 4:18 as being ‘fathered’ by Jekuthiel. (See JEKUTHIEL.) It is tentatively identified with Khirbet Beit Amra, about 10 km (6 mi) SSW of Hebron.

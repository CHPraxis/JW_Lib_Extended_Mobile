<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A resting-place attested to in ancient writings, situated on the Appian Way, the well-known highway that ran from Rome to Brundisium by way of Capua. The place perhaps got its name from three inns where travelers could stop to rest and refresh themselves. The site of Three Taverns is 49 km (30 mi) SE of Rome. The Marketplace of Appius was about 15 km (9.5 mi) farther down the Appian Way. A few Roman ruins are all that remain today at the site. Having heard about Paul’s coming, part of the delegation of the Christians from Rome waited at Three Taverns while the rest traveled as far as the Marketplace of Appius.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:28:13-44:28:15" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ac 28:13-15</a>.</p>

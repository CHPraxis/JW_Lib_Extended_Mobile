(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:9:6-43:9:7" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Joh 9:6, 7,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:9:11-43:9:11" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 11</a>; PICTURE, Vol. 2, p. 950) Recent excavations have revealed a first-century pool fed by water from the spring of Gihon, located about 100 m (330 ft) SE of Birket Silwan (also <span id="page944" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="944" data-before-text="944"></span>called the Pool of Siloam), that archaeologists believe to be this pool. It is trapezoidal in shape, with steps on at least three sides. One side is 70 m (225 ft) long, but the pool is not yet excavated in its entirety.</p>

<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">In the days of Jesus’ earthly ministry, evidently it was common knowledge that “the tower in Siloam” had collapsed, killing 18 persons. It has been suggested that this tower was situated on the Ophel Ridge, but its actual location in Jerusalem is unknown.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:13:4-42:13:4" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Lu 13:4</a>.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">(Leʹhi) [Jawbone].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The scene of one or, possibly, two Israelite victories over the Philistines. Its exact location is unknown today. Some identify it with Khirbet es-Suyag, which perhaps derives its name from the Greek word <em>si·a·gonʹ</em> (jawbone), less than 3 km (2 mi) E of Beth-shemesh.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">At Lehi, Samson struck down a thousand Philistines with the moist jawbone of an ass. Subsequently he called the site Ramath-lehi (meaning “Lofty Place of the Jawbone”), probably to memorialize the victory Jehovah had given him there. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:15:9-7:15:19" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Jg 15:9-19</a>) Originally, though, Lehi may have got its name from the shape of its crags.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Later, according to the rendering of numerous translators, Shammah struck down many Philistines assembled at Lehi. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:23:11-10:23:12" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2Sa 23:11, 12</a>; <em>AT, JB, NW, RS</em>) However, the Hebrew term <em>la·chai·yahʹ</em> literally means “into the tent village,” and, by a slight change in vowel pointing, is rendered “to Lehi.”</p>

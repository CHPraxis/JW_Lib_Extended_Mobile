<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">The original-language terms (Heb., <em>neʹphesh</em> [נֶפֶשׁ]; Gr., <em>psy·kheʹ</em> [ψυχή]) as used in the Scriptures show “soul” to be a person, an animal, or the life that a person or an animal enjoys.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The connotations that the English “soul” commonly carries in the minds of most persons are not in agreement with the meaning of the Hebrew and Greek words as used by the inspired Bible writers. This fact has steadily gained wider acknowledgment. Back in 1897, in the <em>Journal of Biblical Literature</em> (Vol. XVI, p. 30), Professor C. A. Briggs, as a result of detailed analysis of the use of <em>neʹphesh,</em> observed: “Soul in English usage at the present time conveys usually a very different meaning from נפש [<em>neʹphesh</em>] in Hebrew, and it is easy for the incautious reader to misinterpret.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">More recently, when The Jewish Publication Society of America issued a new translation of the Torah, or first five books of the Bible, the editor-in-chief, H. M. Orlinsky of Hebrew Union College, stated that the word “soul” had been virtually eliminated from this translation because, “the Hebrew word in question here is ‘Nefesh.’” He added: “Other translators have interpreted it to mean ‘soul,’ which is completely inaccurate. The Bible does not say we have a soul. ‘Nefesh’ is the person himself, his need for food, the very blood in his veins, his being.”​—<em>The New York Times,</em> October 12, 1962.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn"><strong><em>What is the origin of the teaching that the human soul is invisible and immortal?</em></strong></p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">The difficulty lies in the fact that the meanings popularly attached to the English word “soul” stem primarily, not from the Hebrew or Christian Greek Scriptures, but from ancient Greek philosophy, actually pagan religious thought. Greek philosopher Plato, for example, quotes Socrates as saying: “The soul, . . . if it departs pure, dragging with it nothing of the body, . . . goes away into that which is like itself, into the invisible, divine, immortal, and wise, and when it arrives there it is happy, freed from error and folly and fear . . . and all the other human ills, and . . . lives in truth through all after time with the gods.”​—<em>Phaedo,</em> 80, D, E; 81, A.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">In direct contrast with the Greek teaching of the <em>psy·kheʹ</em> (soul) as being immaterial, intangible, invisible, and immortal, the Scriptures show that both <em>psy·kheʹ</em> and <em>neʹphesh,</em> as used with reference to earthly creatures, refer to that which is material, tangible, visible, and mortal.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">The <em>New Catholic Encyclopedia</em> says: <em>“Nepes</em> [<em>neʹphesh</em>] is a term of far greater extension than our ‘soul,’ signifying life (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:21:23-2:21:23" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ex 21.23;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:19:21-5:19:21" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Dt 19.21</a>) and its various vital manifestations: breathing (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:35:18-1:35:18" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Gn 35.18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:41:21-18:41:21" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Jb 41.13[21</a>]), blood [<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:9:4-1:9:4" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Gn 9.4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:12:23-5:12:23" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Dt 12.23; </a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:141:8-19:141:8" data-bid="3-3" class="b">Ps 140(141).8</a>], desire (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:3:21-10:3:21" data-bid="4-1" class="b">2 Sm 3.21;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:23:2-20:23:2" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Prv 23.2</a>). The soul in the O[ld] T[estament] means not a part of man, but the whole man​—man as a living being.

<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">The Roman Catholic translation, <em>The New American Bible,</em> in its “Glossary of Biblical Theology Terms” (pp. 27, 28), says: “In the New Testament, to ‘save one’s soul’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:8:35-41:8:35" data-bid="6-1" class="b"><em>Mk 8:35</em></a>) does not mean to save some ‘spiritual’ part of man, as opposed to his ‘body’ (in the Platonic sense) but the whole person with emphasis on the fact that the person is living, desiring, loving and willing, etc., in addition to being concrete and physical.”​—Edition published by P. J. Kenedy &amp; Sons, New York, 1970.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb"><em>Neʹphesh</em> evidently comes from a root meaning “breathe” and in a literal sense <em>neʹphesh</em> could be rendered as “a breather.” Koehler and Baumgartner’s <em>Lexicon in Veteris Testamenti Libros</em> (Leiden, 1958, p. 627) defines it as: “the breathing substance, making man a[nd] animal living beings <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:20-1:1:20" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Gn 1, 20</a>, the soul (strictly distinct from the greek notion of soul) the seat of which is the blood <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:9:4-1:9:4" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Gn 9, 4f</a> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:17:11-3:17:11" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Lv 17, 11</a> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:12:23-5:12:23" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Dt 12, 23:</a> (249 X) . . . soul = living being, individual, person.”</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">As for the Greek word <em>psy·kheʹ,</em> Greek-English lexicons give such definitions as <em>“life,”</em> and “the <em>conscious self</em> or <em>personality</em> as centre of emotions, desires, and affections,” “a living being,” and they show that even in non-Biblical Greek works the term was used “of animals.” Of course, such sources, treating as they do primarily of classical Greek writings, include all the meanings that the pagan Greek philosophers gave to the word, including that of <em>“departed spirit,”</em> “the immaterial and immortal <em>soul,”</em> “the <em>spirit</em> of the universe,” and “the immaterial principle of movement and life.” Evidently because some of the pagan philosophers taught that the soul emerged from the body at death, the term <em>psy·kheʹ</em> was also applied to the <em>“butterfly</em> or <em>moth,”</em> which creatures go <span id="page1005" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="1005" data-before-text="1005"></span>through a metamorphosis, changing from caterpillar to winged creature.​—Liddell and Scott’s <em>Greek-English Lexicon,</em> revised by H. Jones, 1968, pp. 2026, 2027; Donnegan’s <em>New Greek and English Lexicon,</em> 1836, p. 1404.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">The ancient Greek writers applied <em>psy·kheʹ</em> in various ways and were not consistent, their personal and religious philosophies influencing their use of the term. Of Plato, to whose philosophy the common ideas about the English “soul” may be attributed (as is generally acknowledged), it is stated: “While he sometimes speaks of one of [the alleged] three parts of the soul, the ‘intelligible,’ as necessarily immortal, while the other two parts are mortal, he also speaks as if there were two souls in one body, one immortal and divine, the other mortal.”​—<em>The Evangelical Quarterly,</em> London, 1931, Vol. III, p. 121, “Thoughts on the Tripartite Theory of Human Nature,” by A. McCaig.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">In view of such inconsistency in non-Biblical writings, it is essential to let the Scriptures speak for themselves, showing what the inspired writers meant by their use of the term <em>psy·kheʹ,</em> as well as by <em>neʹphesh. Neʹphesh</em> occurs 754 times in the Masoretic text of the Hebrew Scriptures, while <em>psy·kheʹ</em> appears by itself 102 times in the Westcott and Hort text of the Christian Greek Scriptures, giving a total of 856 occurrences. (See <em>NW</em> appendix, p. 1573.) This frequency of occurrence makes possible a clear concept of the sense that these terms conveyed to the minds of the inspired Bible writers and the sense their writings should convey to our mind. An examination shows that, while the sense of these terms is broad, with different shades of meaning, among the Bible writers there was no inconsistency, confusion, or disharmony as to man’s nature, as existed among the Grecian philosophers of the so-called Classical Period.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb"><strong>Earth’s First Souls.</strong> The initial occurrences of <em>neʹphesh</em> are found at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:20-1:1:23" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Genesis 1:20-23</a>. On the fifth creative “day” God said: “‘Let the waters swarm forth a swarm of living souls [<em>neʹphesh</em>] and let flying creatures fly over the earth . . .’ And God proceeded to create the great sea monsters and every living soul [<em>neʹphesh</em>] that moves about, which the waters swarmed forth according to their kinds, and every winged flying creature according to its kind.” Similarly on the sixth creative “day” <em>neʹphesh</em> is applied to the “domestic animal and moving animal and wild beast of the earth” as “living souls.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:24-1:1:24" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Ge 1:24</a>.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">After man’s creation, God’s instruction to him again used the term <em>neʹphesh</em> with regard to the animal creation, “everything moving upon the earth in which there is life as a soul [literally, in which there is living soul (<em>neʹphesh</em>)].” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:30-1:1:30" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Ge 1:30</a>) Other examples of animals being so designated are found at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:2:19-1:2:19" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Genesis 2:19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:9:10-1:9:16" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> 9:10-16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:11:10-3:11:10" data-bid="14-3" class="b"> Leviticus 11:10,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:11:46-3:11:46" data-bid="14-4" class="b"> 46;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:24:18-3:24:18" data-bid="14-5" class="b"> 24:18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:31:28-4:31:28" data-bid="14-6" class="b"> Numbers 31:28;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:47:9-26:47:9" data-bid="14-7" class="b"> Ezekiel 47:9</a>. Notably, the Christian Greek Scriptures coincide in applying the Greek <em>psy·kheʹ</em> to animals, as at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:8:9-66:8:9" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Revelation 8:9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:16:3-66:16:3" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> 16:3</a>, where it is used of creatures in the sea.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">Thus, the Scriptures clearly show that <em>neʹphesh</em> and <em>psy·kheʹ</em> are used to designate the animal creation lower than man. The same terms apply to man.</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb"><strong>The Human Soul.</strong> Precisely the same Hebrew phrase used of the animal creation, namely, <em>neʹphesh chai·yahʹ</em> (living soul), is applied to Adam, when, after God formed man out of dust from the ground and blew into his nostrils the breath of life, “the man came to be a living soul.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:2:7-1:2:7" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Ge 2:7</a>) Man was distinct from the animal creation, but that distinction was not because he was a <em>neʹphesh</em> (soul) and they were not. Rather, the record shows that it was because man alone was created “in God’s image.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:26-1:1:27" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Ge 1:26, 27</a>) He was created with moral qualities like those of God, with power and wisdom far superior to the animals; hence he could have in subjection all the lower forms of creature life. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:26-1:1:26" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Ge 1:26,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:28-1:1:28" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> 28</a>) Man’s organism was more complex, as well as more versatile, than that of the animals. (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:15:39-46:15:39" data-bid="19-1" class="b">1Co 15:39</a>.) Likewise, Adam had, but lost, the prospect of eternal life; this is never stated with regard to the creatures lower than man.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:2:15-1:2:17" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Ge 2:15-17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:3:22-1:3:24" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> 3:22-24</a>.</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">It is true that the account says that ‘God proceeded to blow into the man’s nostrils the breath [form of <em>nesha·mahʹ</em>] of life,’ whereas this is not stated in the account of the animal creation. Clearly, however, the account of the creation of man is much more detailed than that of the creation of animals. Moreover, <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:7:21-1:7:23" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Genesis 7:21-23</a>, in describing the Flood’s destruction of “all flesh” outside the ark, lists the animal creatures along with mankind and says: “Everything in which the breath [form of <em>nesha·mahʹ</em>] of the force of life was active in its nostrils, namely, all that were on the dry ground, died.” Obviously, the breath of life of the animal creatures also originally came from the Creator, Jehovah God.</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">So, too, the “spirit” (Heb., <em>ruʹach;</em> Gr., <em>pneuʹma</em>), or life-force, of man is not distinct from the life-force in animals, as is shown by <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:3:19-21:3:21" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 3:19-21</a>, which states that “they all have but one spirit [<em>weruʹach</em>].”</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb"><strong>Soul​—A Living Creature.</strong> As stated, man “came to be a living soul”; hence man <em>was</em> a soul, <span id="page1006" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="1006" data-before-text="1006"></span>he did not <em>have</em> a soul as something immaterial, invisible, and intangible residing inside him. The apostle Paul shows that the Christian teaching did not differ from the earlier Hebrew teaching, for he quotes <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:2:7-1:2:7" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Genesis 2:7</a> in saying: “It is even so written: ‘The first man Adam became a living soul [<em>psy·khenʹ zoʹsan</em>].’ . . . The first man is out of the earth and made of dust.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:15:45-46:15:47" data-bid="24-1" class="b">1Co 15:45-47</a>.</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">The Genesis account shows that a living soul results from the combination of the earthly body with the breath of life. The expression “breath of the force of life [literally, breath of the spirit, or active force (<em>ruʹach</em>), of life]” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:7:22-1:7:22" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Ge 7:22</a>) indicates that it is by breathing air (with its oxygen) that the life-force, or “spirit,” in all creatures, man and animals, is sustained. This life-force is found in every cell of the creature’s body, as is discussed under <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200002739/">LIFE</a>; <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200004211/">SPIRIT</a>.</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">Since the term <em>neʹphesh</em> refers to the creature itself, we should expect to find the normal physical functions or characteristics of fleshly creatures attributed to it. This is exactly the case. <em>Neʹphesh</em> (soul) is spoken of as eating flesh, fat, blood, or similar material things (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:7:18-3:7:18" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Le 7:18,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:7:20-3:7:20" data-bid="26-2" class="b"> 20,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:7:25-3:7:25" data-bid="26-3" class="b"> 25,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:7:27-3:7:27" data-bid="26-4" class="b"> 27;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:17:10-3:17:10" data-bid="26-5" class="b"> 17:10,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:17:12-3:17:12" data-bid="26-6" class="b"> 12,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:17:15-3:17:15" data-bid="26-7" class="b"> 15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:23:24-5:23:24" data-bid="26-8" class="b"> De 23:24</a>); being hungry for or craving food and drink (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:12:15-5:12:15" data-bid="27-1" class="b">De 12:15,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:12:20-5:12:21" data-bid="27-2" class="b"> 20, 21;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:107:9-19:107:9" data-bid="27-3" class="b"> Ps 107:9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:19:15-20:19:15" data-bid="27-4" class="b"> Pr 19:15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:27:7-20:27:7" data-bid="27-5" class="b"> 27:7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:29:8-23:29:8" data-bid="27-6" class="b"> Isa 29:8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:32:6-23:32:6" data-bid="27-7" class="b"> 32:6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/33:7:1-33:7:1" data-bid="27-8" class="b"> Mic 7:1</a>); being made fat (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:11:25-20:11:25" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Pr 11:25</a>); fasting (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:35:13-19:35:13" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Ps 35:13</a>); touching unclean things, such as a dead body (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:5:2-3:5:2" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Le 5:2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:7:21-3:7:21" data-bid="30-2" class="b"> 7:21;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:17:15-3:17:15" data-bid="30-3" class="b"> 17:15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:22:6-3:22:6" data-bid="30-4" class="b"> 22:6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:19:13-4:19:13" data-bid="30-5" class="b"> Nu 19:13</a>); being ‘seized as a pledge’ or being ‘kidnapped’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:24:6-5:24:7" data-bid="31-1" class="b">De 24:6, 7</a>); doing work (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:23:30-3:23:30" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Le 23:30</a>); being refreshed by cold water when tired (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:25:25-20:25:25" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Pr 25:25</a>); being purchased (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:22:11-3:22:11" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Le 22:11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:27:13-26:27:13" data-bid="34-2" class="b"> Eze 27:13</a>); being given as a vow offering (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:27:2-3:27:2" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Le 27:2</a>); being put in irons (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:105:18-19:105:18" data-bid="36-1" class="b">Ps 105:18</a>); being sleepless (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:119:28-19:119:28" data-bid="37-1" class="b">Ps 119:28</a>); and struggling for breath (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:15:9-24:15:9" data-bid="38-1" class="b">Jer 15:9</a>).</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">It may be noted that in many texts reference is made to “my soul,” “his [or her] soul,” “your soul,” and so forth. This is because <em>neʹphesh</em> and <em>psy·kheʹ</em> can mean <em>one’s own self as a soul.</em> The sense of the term can therefore often be expressed in English by use of personal pronouns. Thus <em>Lexicon in Veteris Testamenti Libros</em> (p. 627) shows that “my <em>neʹphesh”</em> means “I” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:27:4-1:27:4" data-bid="39-1" class="b">Ge 27:4,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:27:25-1:27:25" data-bid="39-2" class="b"> 25;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:1:14-23:1:14" data-bid="39-3" class="b"> Isa 1:14</a>); “your [singular] <em>neʹphesh”</em> means “thou” or “you” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:27:19-1:27:19" data-bid="40-1" class="b">Ge 27:19,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:27:31-1:27:31" data-bid="40-2" class="b"> 31;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:43:4-23:43:4" data-bid="40-3" class="b"> Isa 43:4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:51:23-23:51:23" data-bid="40-4" class="b"> 51:23</a>); “his <em>neʹphesh”</em> means “he, himself” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:30:2-4:30:2" data-bid="41-1" class="b">Nu 30:2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:53:10-23:53:10" data-bid="41-2" class="b"> Isa 53:10</a>); “her <em>neʹphesh”</em> means “she, herself” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:30:5-4:30:12" data-bid="42-1" class="b">Nu 30:5-12</a>), and so forth.</p>

<p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="sb"><strong>Serving With One’s Whole Soul.</strong> The “soul” basically means the entire person, as has been shown. Yet certain texts exhort us to seek for, love, and serve God with ‘all our heart <em>and</em> all our soul’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:4:29-5:4:29" data-bid="75-1" class="b">De 4:29;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:11:13-5:11:13" data-bid="75-2" class="b"> 11:13,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:11:18-5:11:18" data-bid="75-3" class="b"> 18</a>), while <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:6:5-5:6:5" data-bid="76-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 6:5</a> says: “You must love Jehovah your God with all your heart and all your soul and all your vital force.” Jesus said it was necessary to serve with one’s whole soul and strength and, additionally, “with your whole mind.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:12:30-41:12:30" data-bid="77-1" class="b">Mr 12:30;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:10:27-42:10:27" data-bid="77-2" class="b"> Lu 10:27</a>) The question arises as to why these other things are mentioned with the soul, since it embraces them all. To illustrate the probable meaning: A person might sell himself (his soul) into slavery to another, thereby becoming the possession of his owner and master. Yet he might not serve his master wholeheartedly, with full motivation and desire to please him, and thus he might not use his full strength or his full mental capacity to advance his master’s interests. (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:6:5-49:6:5" data-bid="78-1" class="b">Eph 6:5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:3:22-51:3:22" data-bid="78-2" class="b"> Col 3:22</a>.) Hence these other facets are evidently mentioned to focus attention on them so that we do not fail to remember and consider them in our service to God, to whom we belong, and to his Son, whose life was the ransom price that bought us. “Whole-souled” service to God involves the entire person, no bodily part, function, capacity, or desire being left out.​—Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:5:28-40:5:30" data-bid="79-1" class="b">Mt 5:28-30;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:21:34-42:21:36" data-bid="79-2" class="b"> Lu 21:34-36;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:6:6-49:6:9" data-bid="79-3" class="b"> Eph 6:6-9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:3:19-50:3:19" data-bid="79-4" class="b"> Php 3:19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:3:23-51:3:24" data-bid="79-5" class="b"> Col 3:23, 24</a>.</p>
<p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="sb"><strong>Soul and Spirit Are Distinct.</strong> The “spirit” (Heb., <em>ruʹach;</em> Gr., <em>pneuʹma</em>) should not be confused with the “soul” (Heb., <em>neʹphesh;</em> Gr., <em>psy·kheʹ</em>), for they refer to different things. Thus, <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:4:12-58:4:12" data-bid="80-1" class="b">Hebrews 4:12</a> speaks of the Word of God as ‘piercing even to the dividing of soul and spirit, and of joints and their marrow.’ (Compare also <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:1:27-50:1:27" data-bid="81-1" class="b">Php 1:27;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/52:5:23-52:5:23" data-bid="81-2" class="b"> 1Th 5:23</a>.) As has been shown, the soul (<em>neʹphesh; psy·kheʹ</em>) is the creature itself. The spirit (<em>ruʹach; pneuʹma</em>) generally refers to the life-force of the living creature or soul, though the original-language terms may also have other meanings.</p>
<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="sb">Illustrating further the distinction between the Greek <em>psy·kheʹ</em> and <em>pneuʹma</em> is the apostle Paul’s discussion, in his first letter to the Corinthians, of the resurrection of Christians to spirit life. Here he contrasts “that which is physical [<em>psy·khi·konʹ,</em> literally, soulical]” with “that which is spiritual [<em>pneu·ma·ti·konʹ</em>].” Thus, he shows that Christians until the time of their death have a “soulical” body, even as did the first man Adam; whereas, in their resurrection such anointed Christians receive a spiritual body like that of the glorified Jesus Christ. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:15:42-46:15:49" data-bid="82-1" class="b">1Co 15:42-49</a>) Jude makes a somewhat similar comparison in speaking of “animalistic men [<em>psy·khi·koiʹ,</em> literally, soulical (men)], not having spirituality [literally, not having spirit (<em>pneuʹma</em>)].”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/65:1:19-65:1:19" data-bid="83-1" class="b">Jude 19</a>.</p>
<p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="sb"><strong>God as Having Soul.</strong> In view of the foregoing, it appears that the scriptures in which God speaks of “my soul” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:26:11-3:26:11" data-bid="84-1" class="b">Le 26:11,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:26:30-3:26:30" data-bid="84-2" class="b"> 30;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:24:4-19:24:4" data-bid="84-3" class="b"> Ps 24:4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:42:1-23:42:1" data-bid="84-4" class="b"> Isa 42:1</a>) are yet another instance of an anthropomorphic usage, that is, the attributing of physical and human characteristics to God to facilitate understanding, as when God is spoken of as having eyes, hands, and so forth. By speaking of ‘my <em>neʹphesh,</em>’ Jehovah clearly means “myself” or “my person.” “God is a Spirit [<em>Pneuʹma</em>].”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:4:24-43:4:24" data-bid="85-1" class="b">Joh 4:24</a>; see <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200002391/">JEHOVAH</a> (Descriptions of his presence).</p>

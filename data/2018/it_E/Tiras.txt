TIRAS
(Tiʹras).
One of the seven sons of Japheth. (Ge 10:2; 1Ch 1:5) The people who descended from Japheth’s sons were later “spread about in their lands, each according to its tongue.”​—Ge 10:5.
Generally, scholars of the present day consider Tiras to be identified with the Tyr·se·noiʹ of classical Greek writers, also called Tyr·rhe·noiʹ. The Tyr·se·noiʹ were a seafaring people of the islands and coastlands of the Aegean Sea.

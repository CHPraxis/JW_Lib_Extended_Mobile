GENNESARET
(Gen·nesʹa·ret).
1. A small, somewhat triangular plain bordering on the NW shore of the Sea of Galilee and measuring about 5 by 2.5 km (3 by 1.5 mi). In this region, Jesus Christ performed works of miraculous healing. (Mt 14:34-36; Mr 6:53-56; PICTURE, Vol. 2, p. 739) According to the Jewish historian Josephus, this plain was a beautiful, fruitful, and well-watered region, where walnut, palm, and olive trees thrived, and where figs and grapes were available for ten months out of the year.​—The Jewish War, III, 516-521 (x, 8).
2. “The lake of Gennesaret” was another name for the Sea of Galilee. (Lu 5:1) Some scholars believe that Gennesaret is probably the Greek form for the early Hebrew name Chinnereth.​—Nu 34:11; see GALILEE, SEA OF.

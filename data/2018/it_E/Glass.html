<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A mixture of special sand (silica) with traces of other elements such as boron, phosphorus, and lead. These ingredients are melted together at a temperature of about 1650° C. (3000° F.). The newly formed glass, when cooled, is noncrystalline, smooth, extremely hard, and quite brittle.

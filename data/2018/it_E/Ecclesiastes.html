<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">The Hebrew name <em>Qo·heʹleth</em> (meaning “Congregator; Assembler; Convener; Convoker”) fittingly describes the role of the king in the theocratic government that Israel enjoyed. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:1:1-21:1:1" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ec 1:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:1:12-21:1:12" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 12</a>) It was the responsibility of the ruler to hold the dedicated people of God together in faithfulness to their true King and God. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:8:1-11:8:5" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1Ki 8:1-5,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:8:41-11:8:43" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 41-43,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:8:66-11:8:66" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> 66</a>) For that reason, whether a king was good or bad for the nation was determined by whether he led the nation in the worship of Jehovah or not. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:16:1-12:16:4" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2Ki 16:1-4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:18:1-12:18:6" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 18:1-6</a>) The congregator, who was Solomon, had already done much congregating of Israel and their companions, the temporary residents, to the temple. In this book he sought to congregate God’s people away from the vain and fruitless works of this world to the works worthy of the God to whom they as a nation were dedicated. The name used in our English Bibles is taken from the translation of <em>Qo·heʹleth</em> in the Greek <em>Septuagint,</em> namely, <em>Ek·kle·si·a·stesʹ</em> (Ecclesiastes), meaning “a member of an ecclesia (congregation; assembly).”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><strong>Writer.</strong> There was only one “son of David,” namely, Solomon, who was “king over <em>Israel</em> in Jerusalem” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:1:1-21:1:1" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ec 1:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:1:12-21:1:12" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 12</a>), for kings after Solomon did not reign over all Israel. Solomon was the king so well known for his surpassing wisdom. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:1:16-21:1:16" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ec 1:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:4:29-11:4:34" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 1Ki 4:29-34</a>) He was a builder. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:2:4-21:2:6" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ec 2:4-6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:6:1-11:6:1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 1Ki 6:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:7:1-11:7:8" data-bid="6-3" class="b"> 7:1-8</a>) He was a composer of proverbs. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:12:9-21:12:9" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ec 12:9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:4:32-11:4:32" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 1Ki 4:32</a>) Solomon was renowned for his wealth. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:2:4-21:2:9" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Ec 2:4-9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:9:17-11:9:19" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 1Ki 9:17-19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:10:4-11:10:10" data-bid="8-3" class="b"> 10:4-10,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:10:14-11:10:29" data-bid="8-4" class="b"> 14-29</a>) Since the book mentions the building program of Solomon, it must have been written after that time but before he “began to do what was bad in the eyes of Jehovah.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:11:6-11:11:6" data-bid="9-1" class="b">1Ki 11:6</a>) The book was therefore written before 1000 B.C.E., in Jerusalem. That Solomon would be one of the best qualified men to write the book is supported by the fact that he was not only the richest but probably one of the best informed kings of his day; his sailors and tradesmen as well as visiting dignitaries would bring news and knowledge of people of other lands.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:9:26-11:9:28" data-bid="10-1" class="b">1Ki 9:26-28;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:10:23-11:10:25" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> 10:23-25,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:10:28-11:10:29" data-bid="10-3" class="b"> 28, 29</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><strong>Authenticity.</strong> <em>Qo·heʹleth,</em> or Ecclesiastes, is accepted as canonical by both the Jewish and the Christian churches. It is in agreement with other portions of the Bible that treat the same subjects. For example, it agrees with Genesis on man’s being made up of a body composed of the dust of the ground and having the spirit or life-force from God and the breath that sustains it. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:3:20-21:3:21" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Ec 3:20, 21;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:12:7-21:12:7" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 12:7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:2:7-1:2:7" data-bid="11-3" class="b"> Ge 2:7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:7:22-1:7:22" data-bid="11-4" class="b"> 7:22;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:42:5-23:42:5" data-bid="11-5" class="b"> Isa 42:5</a>) It affirms the Bible teaching that man was created upright but willfully chose to disobey God. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:7:29-21:7:29" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Ec 7:29;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:31-1:1:31" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> Ge 1:31;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:3:17-1:3:17" data-bid="12-3" class="b"> 3:17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:32:4-5:32:5" data-bid="12-4" class="b"> De 32:4, 5</a>) It acknowledges God as the Creator. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:12:1-21:12:1" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Ec 12:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:1-1:1:1" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> Ge 1:1</a>) It concurs with the rest of the Bible as to the state of the dead. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:9:5-21:9:5" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Ec 9:5,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:9:10-21:9:10" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> 10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:3:19-1:3:19" data-bid="14-3" class="b"> Ge 3:19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:6:5-19:6:5" data-bid="14-4" class="b"> Ps 6:5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:115:17-19:115:17" data-bid="14-5" class="b"> 115:17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:11:11-43:11:14" data-bid="14-6" class="b"> Joh 11:11-14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:6:23-45:6:23" data-bid="14-7" class="b"> Ro 6:23</a>) It strongly advocates the worship and the fear of God. It uses the expression <em>ha·ʼElo·himʹ,</em> “the true <span id="page675" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="675" data-before-text="675"></span>God,” 32 times. The equivalent for the name Jehovah is found in the Syriac <em>Peshitta</em> and Jewish Targum of the book at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:2:24-21:2:24" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 2:24</a>. While some claim that the book contradicts itself, this is only because they do not see that the book many times sets forth the common view as opposed to the view that reflects divine wisdom. (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:1:18-21:1:18" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Ec 1:18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:7:11-21:7:12" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> 7:11, 12</a>.) So one must read with a view to getting the sense and must keep in mind the theme of the book.</p>

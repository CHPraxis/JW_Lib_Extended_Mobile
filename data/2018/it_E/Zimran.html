Zimran and his five full brothers were given gifts and sent into “the land of the East.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:25:1-1:25:2" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ge 25:1, 2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:25:6-1:25:6" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:1:32-13:1:32" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> 1Ch 1:32</a>) The conjecture of some is that Zimran’s descendants were associated either with Zabram, a town situated W of Mecca on the Arabian shore of the Red Sea, or with Zimri, mentioned in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:25:25-24:25:25" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Jeremiah 25:25</a>.</p>

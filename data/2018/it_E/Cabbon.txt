CABBON
(Cabʹbon).
One of the cities of Judah in the Shephelah. (Jos 15:40) The Greek Septuagint reads “Chabra” instead of Cabbon, and this has led some to relate the town to Khirbet Hibra 5 km (3 mi) ESE of Lachish. On the basis of the Hebrew name, however, others suggest an identification with Al Qubeiba (Horvat Kefar Lakhish), 5 km (3 mi) SW of Beit Jibrin (Bet Guvrin).

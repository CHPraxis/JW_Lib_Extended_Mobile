BELTESHAZZAR
(Bel·te·shazʹzar) [from Akkadian, meaning “Protect the Life of the King”].
The Babylonian name given to Daniel after he was taken into exile in 617 B.C.E.​—not to be confused with Belshazzar. (Da 1:7) The name is evidently a shortened form of an invocation to Bel and hence was selected, as Nebuchadnezzar said, “according to the name of my god.” (Da 4:8; 5:12) The purpose was evidently to effect Daniel’s naturalization and alienate him from the worship of Jehovah. However, the Babylonians continued to speak of him also by his name Daniel.​—Da 4:18, 19; 5:12, 13; see DANIEL No. 2.

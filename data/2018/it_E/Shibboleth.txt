SHIBBOLETH
(Shibʹbo·leth).
The password used by the men of Gilead to identify Ephraimites who tried to flee across the Jordan. It means “ear of grain” or “flowing stream.” Escaping Ephraimites, during their conflict with Jephthah, gave themselves away to the Gileadite sentries at the fords of the Jordan by mispronouncing the initial “sh” sound of this password. They would say “Sibboleth.” (Jg 12:4-6) Thus, it is evident that some variation of pronunciation existed among the tribes, even as in later times the Galileans had a manner of speech distinct from the Judeans.​—Compare Mt 26:73; Lu 22:59.

PATHRUSIM
(Path·ruʹsim) [Of (Belonging to) Pathros].
Listed fifth among the offspring of Mizraim the son of Ham. (Ge 10:6, 13, 14; 1Ch 1:11, 12) The name is apparently the plural form of Pathros. (Eze 29:14) This would indicate that the tribe of Pathrusim settled or became predominant in Upper Egypt.

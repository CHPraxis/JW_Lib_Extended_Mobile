AMRAM
(Amʹram) [People High (Exalted)].
1. A grandson of Levi through Kohath. (Ex 6:16, 18, 20; Nu 3:19; 26:58; 1Ch 6:18) It is stated that he married “his father’s sister” Jochebed, an act then allowable but later prohibited in the Mosaic Law. (Le 18:12) Some translations, however, endeavor to show her to be his cousin. (See JOCHEBED.) His children were Aaron, Miriam, and Moses.​—Ex 6:20; Nu 26:59; 1Ch 6:2, 3; 23:12, 13.
2. One of “the sons of Bani,” who, along with other returned exiles, responded to the call to put away foreign wives in 468 B.C.E.​—Ezr 10:34, 44.
3. Name given to a Seirite, a son of Dishon, in the King James Version rendering of 1 Chronicles 1:41.​—See HEMDAN.

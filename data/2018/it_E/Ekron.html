<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">(Ekʹron).</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A leading Philistine city, apparently the northernmost seat of one of their five axis lords. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:13:3-6:13:3" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Jos 13:3</a>) Its exact position is uncertain, but it is generally identified with Khirbet el-Muqannaʽ (Tel Miqne), about 18 km (11 mi) E of Ashdod. Recent excavation there has unearthed the largest city of its period and gives it current preference as the site of Ekron.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Ekron’s history is one of constantly changing domination. Joshua’s conquest did not include <span id="page701" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="701" data-before-text="701"></span>Ekron. It was not until later that the Judeans captured it. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:13:2-6:13:3" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Jos 13:2, 3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:1:18-7:1:18" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Jg 1:18</a>) In the initial division of the Promised Land, Ekron was on the border between Judah and Dan but within the tribe of Judah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:15:1-6:15:1" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Jos 15:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:15:11-6:15:11" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 11,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:15:45-6:15:46" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> 45, 46;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:19:40-6:19:43" data-bid="3-4" class="b"> 19:40-43</a>) By the time the Philistines captured the ark of the covenant, Ekron was back in their possession. The presence of the Ark caused “a death-dealing confusion” to break out in this city, and it was from Ekron that the Ark was finally sent back to the Jews. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:5:10-9:5:12" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1Sa 5:10-12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:6:16-9:6:17" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 6:16, 17</a>) After another period under Israelite control, the Philistines apparently again had Ekron at the time David slew Goliath. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:7:14-9:7:14" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1Sa 7:14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:17:52-9:17:52" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 17:52</a>) It was in the early tenth century B.C.E. that Pharaoh Shishak of Egypt claimed to have taken Ekron. Some two centuries later, according to Sennacherib’s annals, Ekron’s King Padi was loyal to the Assyrians.</p>

ZAPHENATH-PANEAH
(Zaphʹe·nath-pa·neʹah).
The name that Pharaoh gave to Joseph when elevating him in authority to a position next to himself. (Ge 41:45) To those who spoke Hebrew, the pronunciation of the name evidently meant “Revealer of Hidden Things,” but to the Egyptians it perhaps meant “The God Said: He Will Live!”

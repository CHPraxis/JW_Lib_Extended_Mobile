ECCLESIASTES
The Hebrew name Qo·heʹleth (meaning “Congregator; Assembler; Convener; Convoker”) fittingly describes the role of the king in the theocratic government that Israel enjoyed. (Ec 1:1, 12) It was the responsibility of the ruler to hold the dedicated people of God together in faithfulness to their true King and God. (1Ki 8:1-5, 41-43, 66) For that reason, whether a king was good or bad for the nation was determined by whether he led the nation in the worship of Jehovah or not. (2Ki 16:1-4; 18:1-6) The congregator, who was Solomon, had already done much congregating of Israel and their companions, the temporary residents, to the temple. In this book he sought to congregate God’s people away from the vain and fruitless works of this world to the works worthy of the God to whom they as a nation were dedicated. The name used in our English Bibles is taken from the translation of Qo·heʹleth in the Greek Septuagint, namely, Ek·kle·si·a·stesʹ (Ecclesiastes), meaning “a member of an ecclesia (congregation; assembly).”
Writer. There was only one “son of David,” namely, Solomon, who was “king over Israel in Jerusalem” (Ec 1:1, 12), for kings after Solomon did not reign over all Israel. Solomon was the king so well known for his surpassing wisdom. (Ec 1:16; 1Ki 4:29-34) He was a builder. (Ec 2:4-6; 1Ki 6:1; 7:1-8) He was a composer of proverbs. (Ec 12:9; 1Ki 4:32) Solomon was renowned for his wealth. (Ec 2:4-9; 1Ki 9:17-19; 10:4-10, 14-29) Since the book mentions the building program of Solomon, it must have been written after that time but before he “began to do what was bad in the eyes of Jehovah.” (1Ki 11:6) The book was therefore written before 1000 B.C.E., in Jerusalem. That Solomon would be one of the best qualified men to write the book is supported by the fact that he was not only the richest but probably one of the best informed kings of his day; his sailors and tradesmen as well as visiting dignitaries would bring news and knowledge of people of other lands.​—1Ki 9:26-28; 10:23-25, 28, 29.
Authenticity. Qo·heʹleth, or Ecclesiastes, is accepted as canonical by both the Jewish and the Christian churches. It is in agreement with other portions of the Bible that treat the same subjects. For example, it agrees with Genesis on man’s being made up of a body composed of the dust of the ground and having the spirit or life-force from God and the breath that sustains it. (Ec 3:20, 21; 12:7; Ge 2:7; 7:22; Isa 42:5) It affirms the Bible teaching that man was created upright but willfully chose to disobey God. (Ec 7:29; Ge 1:31; 3:17; De 32:4, 5) It acknowledges God as the Creator. (Ec 12:1; Ge 1:1) It concurs with the rest of the Bible as to the state of the dead. (Ec 9:5, 10; Ge 3:19; Ps 6:5; 115:17; Joh 11:11-14; Ro 6:23) It strongly advocates the worship and the fear of God. It uses the expression ha·ʼElo·himʹ, “the true God,” 32 times. The equivalent for the name Jehovah is found in the Syriac Peshitta and Jewish Targum of the book at Ecclesiastes 2:24. While some claim that the book contradicts itself, this is only because they do not see that the book many times sets forth the common view as opposed to the view that reflects divine wisdom. (Compare Ec 1:18; 7:11, 12.) So one must read with a view to getting the sense and must keep in mind the theme of the book.

HIGHLIGHTS OF ECCLESIASTES
A vivid description of works that are vain and those that are worth while
Written by Solomon in the latter part of his kingship, after he had engaged in the numerous pursuits that he describes
A life devoted to vain pursuits is empty
To a natural man all is vanity; one generation is replaced by another, and even natural cycles are repetitious and wearisome (1:1-11)
Increased human wisdom can result in increased pain; what is crooked in this system cannot be made straight (1:12-18)
Devoting oneself to pleasure-seeking through materialism is like striving after the wind (2:1-11, 26)
Wisdom is better than folly, but both the wise and the stupid ones die and are forgotten (2:12-16)
Working hard all one’s life only to leave everything to a man who may not appreciate it​—this is calamitous (2:17-23)
Events in earthly life often occur in cycles, many of which are beyond human control (3:1-9)
In the present system, all (both man and beast) eventually die (3:18-22)
Many acts of oppression take place, with no hope from a human standpoint (4:1-3)
Hard work and proficiency because of rivalry or simply to accumulate wealth is vanity, and the lazy person is stupid (4:4-8)
The life of a ruler can also be vain (4:13-16)
Accumulating riches will not bring contentment, but it may rob the owner of his sleep; and when he dies he will leave them all behind (5:9-17)
Though a person has many possessions, circumstances​—perhaps illness or an unfulfilled longing—​may prevent him from finding contentment (6:1-12)
In the present system, the same eventuality awaits both righteous and wicked​—all die; so, some give free rein to badness (9:2, 3)
Wisdom is not always appreciated when it comes from a needy man (9:13-18)
Indulging in foolishness gives one a bad reputation; when such incompetent ones are in positions of authority, it is hazardous for them and hard on others (10:1-19)
Youth and the prime of life are vanity; the duration of youthful vigor is so uncertain (11:10)
If a person has not been guided in life by constant remembrance of the Creator, everything is vanity! (12:8)
Things that are worth while and that give meaning to one’s life
Enjoy the fruits of your work, recognizing these as a gift from God (2:24, 25; 5:18-20)
The works of God are all pretty; before mankind he has set the prospect of life to time indefinite (3:10-13)
The general pattern of human life that exists according to God’s permission or purpose cannot be changed by man; so wait on God to act as Judge in his appointed time (3:14-17; 5:8)
A person who works with a partner is better off than a loner (4:9-12)
Proper fear of God should move us to listen carefully to what he requires of us and to fulfill any vow we make to him (5:1-7)
Appreciate the importance of a good name and the brevity of our present life in which to acquire it, the benefit of patience, the superior value of wisdom, and the need to submit humbly to what God permits (7:1-15)
Avoid going to extremes but be guided by fear of God; do not get overly concerned about what other people say; shun the snare of a prostitute (7:16-29)
Be law abiding; even though men dominate others to their injury and human justice is lax, do not let it spoil your enjoyment of life; remember, it will turn out well with those who fear the true God; do not expect to fathom all the reasons for what God does and permits to occur (8:1-17; 10:20)
The righteous ones and the wise ones are in the hand of the true God​—they will not lose their reward; but in death a person knows nothing and can do nothing, so use your life now in a manner that God will approve; enjoy it in wholesome ways while you have it (9:1, 4-12)
Seize appropriate opportunities to be generous, to accomplish good; do not let uncertainties of life stifle your activity (11:1-8)
Young man, enjoy your youth, but do not forget that you are accountable to God for your actions; remember your Grand Creator while you are young, before the weakness and decrepitude of old age come, before life ends (11:9; 12:1-7)
The most beneficial writings are those that reflect the wisdom of the “one shepherd,” Jehovah God (12:9-12)
Fear the true God and keep his commandments; he sees everything that we do, and he will bring our works into judgment (12:13, 14)

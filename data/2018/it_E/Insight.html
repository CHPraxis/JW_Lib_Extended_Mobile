<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Essentially, insight is the ability to see into a situation. To act with insight is to act with prudence, discretion. According to Wilson’s <em>Old Testament Word Studies,</em> the Hebrew verb <em>sa·khalʹ</em> means “to look at; to be prudent, circumspect; to act prudently, to be intelligent.” (1978, p. 461) Thus, <em>sa·khalʹ</em> is rendered ‘have insight’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:14:2-19:14:2" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ps 14:2</a>), ‘act with discretion’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:10:19-20:10:19" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Pr 10:19</a>), “act prudently” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:18:5-9:18:5" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1Sa 18:5</a>), ‘have success’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:17:8-20:17:8" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Pr 17:8</a>), ‘cause to show insight’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:16:23-20:16:23" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Pr 16:23</a>). The noun <em>seʹkhel</em> is translated “insight” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:111:10-19:111:10" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ps 111:10</a>) and “discretion.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:25:3-9:25:3" data-bid="7-1" class="b">1Sa 25:3</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Insight is closely related to understanding, but there is a fine distinction between the two terms. Says the <em>Theological Wordbook of the Old Testament:</em> “While <em>bin</em> [understanding] indicates ‘distinguishing between,’ [<em>sa·khalʹ</em>] relates to an intelligent knowledge of the reason. There is the process of thinking through a complex arrangement of thoughts resulting in a wise dealing and use of good practical common sense. Another end result is the emphasis upon being successful.”​—Edited by R. L. Harris, 1980, Vol. 2, p. 877; see <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200004510/">UNDERSTANDING</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">In the Greek Scriptures, the verb <em>sy·niʹe·mi</em> is translated ‘has insight’ at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:3:11-45:3:11" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Romans 3:11</a>, where the apostle Paul quotes from <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:14:2-19:14:2" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Psalm 14:2</a>. <em>Sy·niʹe·mi</em> is also rendered “get the sense of” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:13:13-40:13:15" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Mt 13:13-15</a>), ‘grasp’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:16:12-40:16:12" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Mt 16:12</a>), “understand” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:28:26-44:28:26" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Ac 28:26</a>), and ‘perceive’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:5:17-49:5:17" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Eph 5:17</a>).</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Jehovah God gives insight to his servants by providing them with counsel and advice that they can use to direct their steps and control their actions. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:32:8-19:32:8" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Ps 32:8</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:9:22-27:9:22" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Da 9:22</a>.) He provides such wise guidance by means of his Word. To gain insight, though, a person must do more than read the Bible. He must appreciate it so as to be motivated to do all that God directs. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:1:7-6:1:8" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Jos 1:7, 8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:2:3-11:2:3" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> 1Ki 2:3</a>) Needed also is the help of God’s spirit. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:9:20-16:9:20" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Ne 9:20</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:28:12-13:28:12" data-bid="18-1" class="b">1Ch 28:12,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:28:19-13:28:19" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> 19</a>.) Once acquired, insight must be safeguarded. One can lose it by turning from God’s ways.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:36:1-19:36:3" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Ps 36:1-3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:21:16-20:21:16" data-bid="19-2" class="b"> Pr 21:16</a>.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Insight can be displayed in various ways, resulting in blessings both to the one who has it and to others. The psalmist pronounces happy the one “acting with consideration [with insight] toward the lowly one.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:41:1-19:41:1" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Ps 41:1</a>) A wife who is “discreet” (showing insight) is described as a blessing from Jehovah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:19:14-20:19:14" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Pr 19:14</a>) Insight, looking beyond the obvious, enables one to guard his mouth (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:10:19-20:10:19" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Pr 10:19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:16:23-20:16:23" data-bid="22-2" class="b"> 16:23</a>) and to know when to keep silent. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/30:5:13-30:5:13" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Am 5:13</a>) It also helps one to avoid anger and overlook transgression. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:19:11-20:19:11" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Pr 19:11</a>) One who has insight accepts correction. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:2:10-19:2:10" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Ps 2:10</a>) According to <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:21:11-20:21:11" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Proverbs 21:11</a>, when a wise person obtains insight​—that is, when he carefully considers available information and as a result acquires a clearer picture of a matter—​he “gets knowledge,” that is, he knows what to do regarding the matter, what conclusions to draw, what counsel to give.</p>

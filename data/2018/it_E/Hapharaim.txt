HAPHARAIM
(Haphʹa·raʹim) [Place of Diggings].
A site on the territorial boundary of the tribe of Issachar. (Jos 19:17-19) It cannot be identified with certainty. However, most scholars tentatively locate it at et-Taiyiba, about 12 km (7.5 mi) NW of Beth-shean. Hapharaim also appears in a list of the Palestinian cities conquered by Egypt’s King Shishak.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">(Jeshʹa·nah) [Old [Town]].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A place mentioned along with Mizpah as indicating the location of the stone that Samuel set up and called “Ebenezer.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:7:12-9:7:12" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1Sa 7:12</a>) Jeshanah was one of the cities captured by Judean King Abijah (980-978 B.C.E.) from Jeroboam the king of Israel. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:13:19-14:13:19" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2Ch 13:19</a>) It is considered to be identical with the Isana referred to by Josephus as the site of Herod the Great’s victory over General Pappus. (<em>Jewish Antiquities,</em> XIV, 458 [xv, 12]) The name Isana seems to be preserved in Burj el-Isaneh, about 8 km (5 mi) NNE of Bethel. This place has therefore been suggested as a possible identification for ancient Jeshanah.</p>

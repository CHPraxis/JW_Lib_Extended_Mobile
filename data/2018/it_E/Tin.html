<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A faintly bluish white metal that is very malleable. Of the six products of the ancient metallurgist’s furnace, tin had the lowest melting point of all, only 232° C. (449° F.). (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:22:18-26:22:18" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Eze 22:18,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:22:20-26:22:20" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 20</a>) The original Hebrew word <em>bedhilʹ</em> means “that which is separated or divided,” that is, from precious metals by smelting; it is also translated “waste products.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:1:25-23:1:25" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Isa 1:25</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">There were no tin mines in Palestine. The first reference to tin, soon after the Exodus, includes it among the valuable spoils of war taken from the Midianites. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:31:2-4:31:2" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Nu 31:2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:31:22-4:31:22" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 22</a>) The Tyrians obtained tin from Tarshish. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:27:12-26:27:12" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Eze 27:12</a>) Much of the heavy dark oxide of tin called cassiterite came from river sands in Spain and England. Tin, it appears, was used to make plummets, for at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/38:4:10-38:4:10" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Zechariah 4:10</a> (which speaks of “the plummet”) the Masoretic text reads, “the stone [or, weight], the tin.” In <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/30:7:7-30:7:8" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Amos 7:7, 8</a> the Hebrew word translated “plummet” may mean tin or lead. Tin’s greatest usefulness, however, was as a hardening agent; copper alloyed with 2 to 18 percent tin has been found in ancient specimens of bronze.</p>

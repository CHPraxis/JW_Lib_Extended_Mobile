<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">One of Paul’s aides, a “beloved brother and faithful minister and fellow slave in the Lord” from the District of Asia. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:4:7-51:4:7" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Col 4:7</a>) Tychicus was a member of Paul’s party returning from Greece through Macedonia into Asia Minor; but whether or not Tychicus went all the way to Jerusalem is not stated. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:20:2-44:20:4" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ac 20:2-4</a>) Tychicus is one of several persons suggested as “the brother” who, while in Greece, helped Titus to arrange the collection for the brothers in Judea.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:6:21-49:6:22" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Eph 6:21, 22;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:4:7-51:4:9" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Col 4:7-9</a>) Following Paul’s release from prison, he contemplated sending either Artemas or Tychicus to Crete. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/56:3:12-56:3:12" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Tit 3:12</a>) When the apostle was back in a Roman prison for the second time, he dispatched Tychicus to Ephesus.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:4:12-55:4:12" data-bid="6-1" class="b">2Ti 4:12</a>.</p>

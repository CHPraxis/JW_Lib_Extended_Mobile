TSADHEH
[צ; final, ץ] (tsa·dhehʹ).
The 18th letter of the Hebrew alphabet. It is one of the five Hebrew letters that have a different form when used as the final letter of a word. It has a strong hissing sound similar to the sound of “ts” in English. In the Hebrew, it appears as the initial letter in each of the eight verses in Psalm 119:137-144.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">(Beth-nimʹrah) [House of the Leopard].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A town assigned to the tribe of Gad on the E side of the Jordan, also called simply Nimrah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:32:3-4:32:3" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Nu 32:3,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:32:34-4:32:34" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 34,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:32:36-4:32:36" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> 36</a>) It is described as in “the low plain” and as previously forming part of the realm of King Sihon. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:13:27-6:13:27" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Jos 13:27</a>) The ancient name seems to be preserved in modern Tell Nimrin, situated on the S side of the Wadi Nimrin, but the original site is evidently at Tell Bleibil, about 2.5 km (1.5 mi) to the NE, on the N side of the wadi, where investigations show evidence of occupation during the Israelite period followed by abandonment. It thus lay about 19 km (12 mi) ENE of Jericho.</p>

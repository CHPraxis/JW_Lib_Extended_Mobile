JOZACAR
(Joʹza·car) [Jehovah Has Remembered].
A servant of King Jehoash of Judah. He and his companion Jehozabad killed their ruler in reprisal for the death of Zechariah and perhaps other sons of High Priest Jehoiada. However, Jehoash’s son and successor Amaziah, in turn, avenged his father’s death by striking down Jozacar and his accomplice. Jozacar was the son of Shimeath, an Ammonitess. He is also called Zabad.​—2Ki 12:20, 21; 2Ch 24:20-22, 25-27; 25:1, 3.

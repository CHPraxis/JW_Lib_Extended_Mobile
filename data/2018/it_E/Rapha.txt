RAPHA
(Raʹpha) [from a root meaning “heal”].
A son of Benjamin, called his fifth at 1 Chronicles 8:1, 2. His name is absent from the list of those who went into Egypt (Ge 46:21) and from the listing of Benjamin’s tribal families. (Nu 26:38-40) This may indicate that, regardless of where Rapha was born, he died soon with no descendants, or else they were absorbed into a different family.

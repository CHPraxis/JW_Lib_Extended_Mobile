ILLYRICUM
(Il·lyrʹi·cum).
A Roman province with varying boundaries, located in the NW part of the Balkan Peninsula along the coast of the Adriatic Sea.
In the period following Tiberius’ defeat of the Pannonians and Dalmatians in 9 C.E., the Roman province of Illyricum came to have two parts, which in time became two provinces. The southern province was eventually designated by the name Dalmatia.
At Romans 15:19 the apostle Paul speaks of preaching in a circuit “as far as Illyricum.” Whether the original Greek is to be understood to mean that Paul actually preached in or merely up to Illyricum cannot be established with certainty.

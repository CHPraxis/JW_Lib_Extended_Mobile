<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A name appearing in the genealogy of Judah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:2:50-13:2:51" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1Ch 2:50, 51</a>) The name appears to be more geographic than personal, causing some scholars to regard it as relating to a town in Judah. Beth-gader may possibly be linked with Geder, a town whose king was among those conquered by Joshua in the region W of the Jordan.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:12:13-6:12:13" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Jos 12:13</a>.</p>

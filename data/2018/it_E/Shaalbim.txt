SHAALBIM
(Sha·alʹbim).
A city whose Amorite inhabitants were subjected to forced labor by the house of Joseph. (Jg 1:35) Later, Shaalbim was included in one of the districts annually providing Solomon’s household with food. (1Ki 4:7-9) It is generally understood to be the same as Shaalabbin, a border city of Dan. (Jos 19:40-42) There is only the difference of the final consonant in the Hebrew spelling of the two names. Shaalbon may be an alternate name for Shaalbim.​—2Sa 23:32; 1Ch 11:33.
Shaalbim is identified with the abandoned village of Selbit (Tel Shaʽalvim), which appears to preserve the Biblical name. It is situated about 25 km (16 mi) WNW of Jerusalem and relatively near the suggested sites of other places mentioned with Shaalbim in the Scriptures.

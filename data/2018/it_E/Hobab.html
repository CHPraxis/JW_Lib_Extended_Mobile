<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">(Hoʹbab) [possibly, Cherished].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Moses’ brother-in-law; son of Reuel (Jethro) and a Midianite, of the tribe of Kenites. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:10:29-4:10:29" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Nu 10:29;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:3:1-2:3:1" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Ex 3:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:1:16-7:1:16" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> Jg 1:16</a>) When the time came for the Israelites to move from the region of Mount Sinai toward the Promised Land, Moses requested that Hobab accompany them to serve as “eyes,” or as a scout, for the nation because of his familiarity with the area. Although Hobab declined at first, apparently he did accompany the Israelites, for his descendants, the Kenites, took up dwelling in the Wilderness of Judah to the S of Arad and are mentioned as still living in that area in the time of Saul and David.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:10:29-4:10:32" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Nu 10:29-32;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:1:16-7:1:16" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Jg 1:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:15:6-9:15:6" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> 1Sa 15:6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:27:10-9:27:10" data-bid="2-4" class="b"> 27:10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:30:26-9:30:26" data-bid="2-5" class="b"> 30:26,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:30:29-9:30:29" data-bid="2-6" class="b"> 29</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The Masoretic text of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:4:11-7:4:11" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Judges 4:11</a>, however, identifies Hobab as the father-in-law of Moses. (<em>NW, Yg, Ro, Da, JP, Mo, AT</em>) So the one name, Hobab, may designate two separate individuals, namely, Moses’ father-in-law as well as his brother-in-law. That this is not out of the question is seen by the fact that more than one name is assigned to Moses’ father-in-law.​—Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:2:16-2:2:22" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ex 2:16-22;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:3:1-2:3:1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 3:1</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">On the other hand, if Hobab was indeed only the name of the son of Reuel and hence was the name of only the brother-in-law of Moses, then the reference to Hobab as being Moses’ father-in-law must mean that Hobab was viewed as the representative of his father Reuel, who was, in that case, likely then dead.​—See <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200002454/">JETHRO</a>; <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200002591/">KENITE</a>.</p>

BETH-CAR
[House of the Ram].
A point mentioned in the account of Israel’s defeat of the Philistines at Mizpah. The Israelites pursued the fleeing Philistines “as far as south of Beth-car.” (1Sa 7:11) Many relate Beth-car to Beth-haccherem (Jer 6:1; Ne 3:14), identified by some with ʽAin Karim (ʽEn Kerem), about 7.5 km (4.5 mi) WSW of the Temple Mount in Jerusalem. Such route, if followed, would have led the Philistines from Mizpah through the deep Wadi beit Hanina down to the Valley of Sorek, and through it to the Plains of Philistia.​—See BETH-HACCHEREM.

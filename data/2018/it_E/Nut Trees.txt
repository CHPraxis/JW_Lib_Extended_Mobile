NUT TREES
[Heb., ʼeghohzʹ].
The Shulammite maiden in The Song of Solomon (6:11) speaks of going down “to the garden of nut trees.” The nut trees here referred to may well have been walnut trees (Juglans regia). This tree is native to southeastern Europe and western Asia and is presently cultivated in Galilee and on the slopes of Lebanon and Mount Hermon. The Jewish historian Josephus speaks of it as growing in abundance in the area of the Sea of Galilee in the first century C.E. (The Jewish War, III, 516, 517 [x, 8]) The walnut is a handsome tree, growing up to 9 m (30 ft) high, with fragrant leaves that provide excellent shade. The wood is close-grained and prized for its beauty by cabinetmakers. The fruit of the tree is encased in a husk containing tannic acid and, when boiled, produces a rich-brown dye. The nutmeats are highly valued for their rich taste and are pressed to produce an oil nearly equal to olive oil in quality.

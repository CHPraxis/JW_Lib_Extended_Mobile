ARCHIPPUS
(Ar·chipʹpus) [Ruler of the Horse].
In his letter to the Colossian Christians, Paul exhorts Archippus to faithfulness in the ministry, and in his letter to Philemon he affectionately refers to him as a “fellow soldier.” (Col 4:17; Phm 2) Both letters, written near the end of Paul’s first imprisonment in Rome (c. 60-61 C.E.), indicate that Archippus was then living in or near Colossae in Asia Minor.

MAACATHITE
(Ma·acʹa·thite) [Of (Belonging to) Maacath [the town]].
Inhabitant of the Aramaean kingdom of Maacah (De 3:14; Jos 12:5; 13:13), one of these being Eshtemoa. (1Ch 4:19) It is suggested that Abel-beth-maacah (meaning “Watercourse of the House of Maacah”), a town in N Palestine, may have been so named because of its proximity to the region occupied by the Maacathites.​—1Ki 15:20.

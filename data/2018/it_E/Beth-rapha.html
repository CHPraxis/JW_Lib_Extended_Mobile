<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">(Beth-raʹpha) [House of Rapha].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The name appears at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:4:12-13:4:12" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Chronicles 4:12</a> where Eshton is said to have become “father to Beth-rapha.” The use of “Beth” (meaning “House”) in the name has led many commentators to view it as applying to a family “house” or to a place. Keil and Delitzsch’s <em>Commentary on the Old Testament</em> (1973, Vol. III, 1 Chronicles, p. 88) observes: “Eshton begat the house (the family) of Rapha, of whom also nothing further is said; for they can be connected neither with the Benjamite Rapha (viii. 2) nor with the children of Rapha (xx. 4, 6, 8).”</p>

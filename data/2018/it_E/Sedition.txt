SEDITION
The Greek word staʹsis, which basically means “standing” (Heb 9:8), came to have the meaning “a standing [off]” or “sedition.” (Mr 15:7; Lu 23:19, 25, Int) It can also be rendered “dissension” (Ac 15:2), and sometimes it embraces the idea of violence.​—Ac 23:7, 10.
It was a capital offense under Roman law to engage in sedition or to promote or take part in a riot. Thus the city recorder was alerting the riotous mob in Ephesus of their peril when he said: “We are really in danger of being charged with sedition over today’s affair, no single cause existing that will permit us to render a reason for this disorderly mob.” (Ac 19:40) And Tertullus’ accusation before Roman Governor Felix that Paul was “stirring up seditions among all the Jews” was a very serious one. If found guilty, Paul would have been punished with death.​—Ac 24:5.

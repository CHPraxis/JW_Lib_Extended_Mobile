BEN
[Son].
1. A Levite musician of David’s day who accompanied the ark of the covenant to Jerusalem.​—1Ch 15:15, 18.
2. The Hebrew prefix ben often occurs in names such as Benjamin (meaning “Son of the Right Hand”) or Ben-ammi (meaning “Son of My People [that is, relatives]”). It is equivalent to bar in Aramaic names such as Barnabas (meaning “Son of Comfort”). (Ac 4:36) It is frequently used also to define relationships other than parental, such as race, “sons of [benehʹ] Israel,” “sons of the Cushites” (2Ch 35:17; Am 9:7); location, “sons of the jurisdictional district” (Ezr 2:1); or condition, “sons of youth,” “sons of unrighteousness” (Ps 127:4; Ho 10:9).

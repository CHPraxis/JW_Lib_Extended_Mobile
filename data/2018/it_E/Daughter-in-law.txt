DAUGHTER-IN-LAW
The wife of one’s son. The same Hebrew (kal·lahʹ) and Greek (nymʹphe) words translated “daughter-in-law” are also rendered “bride” in certain instances.​—Ca 4:8-12; Isa 61:10; Jer 7:34; Joh 3:29; Re 18:23; 21:2, 9; 22:17.
Since the father himself in patriarchal times usually arranged for the marriage of his son, his daughter-in-law was largely his own choice. (Ge 24) She was welcomed into his household, and when it moved she moved with it. (Ge 11:31) The Mosaic Law prohibited a man from having relations with his daughter-in-law under the penalty of death.​—Le 18:15; 20:12; Eze 22:11.
Dispositions of daughters-in-law and their attitudes toward in-laws varied a great deal. Ruth, for example, proved a most loyal and devoted companion to her mother-in-law Naomi, more so than Orpah, saying, “Your people will be my people, and your God my God. Where you die I shall die.” (Ru 1:6-17, 22; 4:14, 15) Esau’s Hittite wives were most disconcerting to their in-laws Isaac and Rebekah. (Ge 26:34; 27:46) Christ Jesus foretold that the Kingdom message would separate daughters-in-law from mothers-in-law.​—Lu 12:53.

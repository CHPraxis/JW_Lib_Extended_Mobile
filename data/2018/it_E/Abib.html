<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The name Abib is understood to mean “Green Ears,” the ears of grain being ripe but still soft. (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:2:14-3:2:14" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Le 2:14</a>.) It was during this month that the barley harvest took place, followed some weeks later by the wheat harvest. The latter, or spring, rains also began and these helped to bring the Jordan River to flood stage. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:3:15-6:3:15" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Jos 3:15</a>) It was designated by Jehovah as the initial month of the sacred year at the time of the Exodus from Egypt.

ARIMATHEA
(Ar·i·ma·theʹa) [from Heb., meaning “Height”].
“A city of the Judeans” in the time of Jesus, and the native city of Joseph, the secret disciple who obtained Jesus’ corpse for burial. (Lu 23:50-53; Mt 27:57-60; Mr 15:43-46; Joh 19:38-42) The location of Arimathea is generally considered to be at the site of modern Rentis (Rantis), about 35 km (22 mi) NW of Jerusalem and about 26 km (16 mi) E of Joppa (modern Tel Aviv-Yafo).

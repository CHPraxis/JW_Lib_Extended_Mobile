MEPHAATH
(Mephʹa·ath).
A city originally assigned to the Reubenites but subsequently granted to the Merarite Levites. (Jos 13:15, 18; 21:34, 36, 37; 1Ch 6:77-79) In Jeremiah’s day, about eight centuries later, Mephaath was under Moabite control. (Jer 48:21, 24) It is possibly identified with Tell Jawa, about 11 km (7 mi) S of ʽAmman (Rabbah). Nearby Khirbet Nefaʽa (or, Qureiyat Nafiʽ) may preserve the ancient name.

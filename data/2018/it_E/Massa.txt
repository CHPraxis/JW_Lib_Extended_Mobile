MASSA
(Masʹsa).
A descendant of Abraham through Ishmael. (Ge 25:12-14; 1Ch 1:29, 30) Massa’s offspring probably settled somewhere in N Arabia. In the annals of Tiglath-pileser III, Masʼa (Biblical Massa?) is mentioned along with Tema and other locations in N Arabia. (Ancient Near Eastern Texts, edited by J. Pritchard, 1974, p. 283) Massa has been linked with the Ma·sa·noi located by Greek geographer Ptolemy (second century C.E.) as NE of “Dumah” (the Dumat al-Ghandal area in N Arabia?).
The Hebrew word mas·saʼʹ is also found at Proverbs 30:1 (with the definite article ha) and at Proverbs 31:1 (without an article). This has given rise to the renderings ‘Agur son of Jakeh, of Massa’ and ‘Lemuel king of Massa.’ (Compare AT, JB, Ro, RS or their alternate readings.) However, Agur and Lemuel evidently were Israelites, and therefore, mas·saʼʹ is appropriately translated “oracle” (AS), “declaration” (Yg), and “weighty message” (NW; compare Pr 30:5, 9; 31:30 with Ps 12:6; Ro 3:1, 2).

NAARAH
(Naʹa·rah).
1. [Girl; Young Woman]. A wife of the Judean Ashhur by whom he had four sons.​—1Ch 4:1, 5, 6.
2. [from a root meaning “shake off”]. A city on the boundary of Ephraim (Jos 16:5, 7) thought to be the same as Naaran. (1Ch 7:28) Naarah is generally considered to correspond to the No·o·rathʹ of Eusebius’ Onomasticon (136, 24). Josephus seemingly calls this site Neara. He relates that half of its waters were diverted to irrigate the palms near Archelaus’ palace at Jericho. (Jewish Antiquities, XVII, 340 [xiii, 1]) It has tentatively been identified with Tell el-Jisr, about 3 km (2 mi) NW of Jericho.

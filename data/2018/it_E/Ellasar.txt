ELLASAR
(El·laʹsar).
A kingdom or city over which Arioch reigned in the time of Abraham and Lot. (Ge 14:1) King Arioch of Ellasar joined forces with Kings Amraphel of Shinar, Chedorlaomer of Elam, and Tidal of Goiim in warring against the kings of the rebelling city-states (Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, Zeboiim, and Bela, or Zoar) at the Low Plain of Siddim, or the Salt Sea. The rebels were defeated, and Lot, then dwelling at Sodom, was taken captive and carried off toward the N. However, Abram (Abraham), with Mamre, Aner, and Eshcol as his confederates, overtook the four kings’ combined forces at Dan. There he put them to flight, rescuing Lot and the people and recovering the goods.​—Ge 14:1-16, 24.
Positive identification of ancient Ellasar with a known present-day site still poses a problem for researchers.

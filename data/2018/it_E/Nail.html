<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Ancient nails were quite similar to the larger modern ones, although some kinds had four-sided shanks and a longer taper to the point than those in use today. Apparently, earliest nails were made of bronze, though larger nails of later times were made of iron. David prepared “iron in great quantity for nails for the doors of the gates” of the prospective temple. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:22:3-13:22:3" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1Ch 22:3</a>) Ornamental nails have been discovered that were made of bronze overlaid with gold foil, and these are said to date back to about 1300-1200 B.C.E. Concerning nails used in the construction of Solomon’s temple it is said: “The weight for the nails was fifty gold shekels [0.6 kg; 1.5 lb t].”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:3:8-14:3:9" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2Ch 3:8, 9</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">In 1968, in an excavated tomb located just NE of Jerusalem, the remains were found of a Jew who was executed in the first century by being attached to a torture stake. As shown by subsequent studies, an iron nail 11.5 cm (4.5 in.) long was still piercing the right heel bone. This nail may be similar to the nails employed by the Roman soldiers to impale Jesus Christ. Thomas did not believe that Christ was resurrected until after he saw “the print of the nails” in Jesus’ flesh.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:20:24-43:20:29" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Joh 20:24-29</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><strong>Figurative Use.</strong> Jesus’ death on the torture stake resulted in the termination of the Mosaic Law covenant. Referring to its cancellation, Paul pointed out that God took the Law out of the way “by nailing it to the torture stake.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:2:13-51:2:14" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Col 2:13, 14</a>) Solomon likened “those indulging in collections of sentences” to “nails driven in,” possibly because they and their good words from Jehovah have a stabilizing and supporting effect upon a hearer.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:12:11-21:12:11" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ec 12:11</a>.</p>

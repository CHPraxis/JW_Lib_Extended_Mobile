<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">The Greek word <em>staʹsis,</em> which basically means “standing” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:9:8-58:9:8" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Heb 9:8</a>), came to have the meaning “a standing [off]” or “sedition.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:15:7-41:15:7" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Mr 15:7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:23:19-42:23:19" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Lu 23:19,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:23:25-42:23:25" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> 25</a>, <em>Int</em>) It can also be rendered “dissension” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:15:2-44:15:2" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ac 15:2</a>), and sometimes it embraces the idea of violence.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:23:7-44:23:7" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ac 23:7,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:23:10-44:23:10" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 10</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">It was a capital offense under Roman law to engage in sedition or to promote or take part in a riot. Thus the city recorder was alerting the riotous mob in Ephesus of their peril when he said: “We are really in danger of being charged with sedition over today’s affair, no single cause existing that will permit us to render a reason for this disorderly mob.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:19:40-44:19:40" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ac 19:40</a>) And Tertullus’ accusation before Roman Governor Felix that Paul was “stirring up seditions among all the Jews” was a very serious one. If found guilty, Paul would have been punished with death.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:24:5-44:24:5" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ac 24:5</a>.</p>

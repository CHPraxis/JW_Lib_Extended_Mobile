LIME
A substance, white when pure, that is prepared by burning forms of calcium carbonate such as limestone, shells, or bones. (Am 2:1) Abundant in the mountainous region of Palestine, limestone was converted into lime (calcium oxide) by burning fragments of limestone in conical or cylindrical limekilns. In ancient times lime (Heb., sidh) was a principal ingredient in mortar and was used for plastering walls and for whitewashing walls, graves, and so forth. (De 27:4; Eze 13:10; Mt 23:27; Ac 23:3) The Bible also uses the burnings of lime figuratively to represent destruction.​—Isa 33:12; see KILN.

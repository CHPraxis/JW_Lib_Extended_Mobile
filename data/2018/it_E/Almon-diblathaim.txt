ALMON-DIBLATHAIM
(Alʹmon-dib·la·thaʹim).
A place between Dibon-gad and the mountains of Abarim where the Israelites encamped in the 40th year after their going out from Egypt (1473 B.C.E.). It was one of the last encampments during their wanderings. (Nu 33:46, 47) The site is not certain, but some scholars identify it with Khirbet Deleilat esh-Sherqiyeh, about 16 km (10 mi) NNE of Dibon (Dhiban). Possibly identical with Beth-diblathaim.​—Jer 48:22.

KADMONITES
(Kadʹmon·ites) [from a root meaning “east”].
A people listed among other nations whose lands Jehovah promised to Abram’s seed. (Ge 15:18-21) They were evidently a pastoral or nomadic tribe, like the Kenites and Kenizzites with whom they are mentioned. (Ge 15:19) The exact location of their territory is uncertain, although it is suggested that they inhabited the Syrian desert between Palestine-Syria and the Euphrates River.
The Hebrew name of this people (qadh·moh·niʹ) has the same form as the adjective qadh·moh·niʹ (eastern, Eze 47:18); thus some suggest that it may merely mean “Easterners.” (Jg 8:10) However, the fact that this Hebrew term is used as a name at Genesis 15:19 shows that it can refer to a specific tribe.

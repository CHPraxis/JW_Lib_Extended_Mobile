<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">The Hebrew term for wilderness (<em>midh·barʹ</em>) in general refers to a sparsely settled, uncultivated land. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:2:2-24:2:2" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Jer 2:2</a>) It might include pasture grounds (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:65:12-19:65:12" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ps 65:12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:23:10-24:23:10" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Jer 23:10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:3:1-2:3:1" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> Ex 3:1</a>), cisterns (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:26:10-14:26:10" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2Ch 26:10</a>), houses, and even some cities (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:2:34-11:2:34" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1Ki 2:34;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:15:61-6:15:62" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Jos 15:61, 62;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:42:11-23:42:11" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> Isa 42:11</a>). While often designating simply steppelands with brush and grass, <em>midh·barʹ</em> may also apply to waterless regions that could be termed true deserts. Other Hebrew terms used to designate such areas more specifically are often found in poetic parallel with <em>midh·barʹ.</em>​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:78:40-19:78:40" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ps 78:40;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:50:12-24:50:12" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Jer 50:12</a>.</p>

<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Even those regions meriting the description “desert” in the Bible were rarely of the sandy type, as certain portions of the Sahara Desert are with their rolling sand dunes.

Much of the rift valley through which the Jordan River runs (today called the Ghor) is basically desert land.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">While many of the wilderness regions mentioned in the Bible are today completely barren wastelands, there is evidence that some were not always so. Denis Baly, in <em>The Geography of the Bible</em> (1957, p. 91), says that “the nature of the vegetation pattern must have undergone very great changes since Biblical times.” The original well-balanced conditions on which soil, climate, and vegetation formed a stable environment, with little soil erosion, were thrown out of balance by destruction of forests that were never replanted. With shade gone, and roots no longer holding the soil, the burning summer heat and slashing winter rains destroyed it. The earth was baked by the sun, swept by the wind, flaked by extreme temperature variations, and washed away by the rains. Archaeological investigation shows that many areas now completely barren once “included pasture lands, plains, and oases where springs and occasional rains plus careful water conservation made possible the building of villages and the maintaining of important caravan routes.” (<em>The Interpreter’s Dictionary of the Bible,</em> edited by G. Buttrick, 1962, Vol. 1, p. 828) Even today many of such wilderness areas are covered with a heavy green turf in the spring, though by the end of summer they have been burned bare by heat and drought.</p>

<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">With the exception of scattered oases, the Sinai Peninsula is largely a region of sand, hard gravel, and rock. Meager vegetation grows in the wadis.

However, without God’s care, the Israelites, possibly numbering three million, could never have survived in this barren region. As Moses told them on the Plains of Moab: “Watch out for yourself that you may not forget Jehovah your God . . . who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slaves; who caused you to walk through the great and fear-inspiring wilderness, with poisonous serpents and scorpions and with thirsty ground that has no water; who brought forth water for you out of the flinty rock; who fed you with manna in the wilderness, which your fathers had not known, in order to humble you and in order to put you to the test so as to do you good in your afterdays.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:8:11-5:8:16" data-bid="38-1" class="b">De 8:11-16</a>.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb"><strong>Wilderness in the Greek Scriptures.</strong> Here the Greek term <em>eʹre·mos</em> corresponds generally to the Hebrew <em>midh·barʹ.</em> (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:15:4-42:15:4" data-bid="39-1" class="b">Lu 15:4</a>) It describes the wilderness setting of John the Baptizer’s preaching (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:3:1-40:3:1" data-bid="40-1" class="b">Mt 3:1</a>) and the lonely places into which a certain demonized man was driven.

GIBBAR
(Gibʹbar) [Superior; Mighty; Overwhelming].
Possibly the name of a family head, 95 of whose “sons” (descendants) returned with Zerubbabel from Babylonian exile in 537 B.C.E. (Ezr 2:1, 2, 20) However, in the parallel passage of Nehemiah 7:25, Gibeon is listed instead of Gibbar. Hence “the sons of Gibbar [Gibeon], ninety-five,” may have reference to the descendants of the former inhabitants of Gibeon, inasmuch as other place-names appear in Ezra 2:21-34, for example, “the sons of Bethlehem.”

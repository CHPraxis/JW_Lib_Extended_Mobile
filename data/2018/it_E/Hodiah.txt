HODIAH
(Ho·diʹah) [Dignity Is Jah].
1. A man who married the sister of a certain Naham. The name appears in the genealogy of Judah.​—1Ch 4:1, 19.
2. A Levite who assisted Ezra in explaining the law of Jehovah to the congregation of Israel assembled before the Water Gate at the public square of Jerusalem, and evidently also one of those who called upon the sons of Israel to bless Jehovah and His glorious name and then reviewed God’s dealings with His people.

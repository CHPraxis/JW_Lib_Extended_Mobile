<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><strong>3.</strong> Third-named son of King Jehoiachin (Jeconiah) born during the Babylonian exile. Pedaiah became father to postexilic Governor Zerubbabel and was therefore a vital link in the line leading to Jesus. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:3:17-13:3:19" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1Ch 3:17-19</a>) Because of some unrecorded circumstance, Zerubbabel is also called the son of Pedaiah’s brother Shealtiel. Shealtiel may have adopted Zerubbabel if Pedaiah died when the boy was young; or, if Shealtiel died before fathering a son, Pedaiah may have performed brother-in-law marriage, fathering Zerubbabel in the name of his brother Shealtiel.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/15:5:2-15:5:2" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ezr 5:2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:1:12-40:1:12" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Mt 1:12</a>.</p>

GOLAN
(Goʹlan).
A city of Bashan in the territory of Manasseh, selected as a city of refuge. (De 4:41-43; Jos 20:2, 8) The Gershonite Levites were given the city for their dwelling. (Jos 21:27; 1Ch 6:71) Most scholars identify it with Sahm el Joulane, about 28 km (17 mi) E of the Sea of Galilee. A district to which it gave its name, today called The Golan but formerly Gaulanitis, is somewhat closer to the Sea of Galilee.

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Possibly an astral deity, as suggested by the fact that “Sakkuth” is put in a parallelism with the phrase “the star of your god.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/30:5:26-30:5:26" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Am 5:26</a>) This name was purposely vocalized in the Hebrew Masoretic text to correspond to <em>shiq·qutsʹ,</em> meaning “disgusting thing.” Perhaps Sakkuth is to be identified with “Sakkut,” this being the Babylonian designation for Saturn (a star-god). However, in the Greek <em>Septuagint</em> the expression “Sakkuth your king” reads “the tent of Moloch,” and Stephen, who probably quoted the <em>Septuagint,</em> also used the words “the tent of Moloch.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:7:43-44:7:43" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ac 7:43</a>) This suggests that “Sakkuth” may have been a portable shrine, a tent or booth, in which the idol image of Moloch was housed.​—See <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200000448/">ASTROLOGERS</a> (Molech and Astrology in Israel).</p>

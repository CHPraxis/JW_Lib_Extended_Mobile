MEARAH
(Me·arʹah) [Cave].
A Sidonian city or district that remained to be conquered after Israel’s campaign under Joshua’s leadership ended. (Jos 13:2, 4) Two locations have tentatively been suggested. One is the village of Mghairiye, about 10 km (6 mi) NE of Sidon. The other is Mughar Jezzin (Arabic for “Caves of Jezzin”), a district of caves atop the Lebanon Range and E of Sidon.

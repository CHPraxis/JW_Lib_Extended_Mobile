PIM
The price that the Philistines charged the Israelites for sharpening various metal implements. (1Sa 13:20, 21) The pim apparently was a weight. Several stone weights found in Palestinian excavations bear the consonants of “pim” in ancient Hebrew characters; these vary from 7.18 to 8.13 g (0.231 to 0.261 oz t). On this basis the pim would be approximately two thirds of a shekel.

PAROSH
(Paʹrosh) [Flea].
Founder of a family in Israel. There were 2,172 of his descendants who returned to Jerusalem with Zerubbabel in 537 B.C.E. (Ezr 2:1-3; Ne 7:8) By the time that Ezra arrived in 468 B.C.E., with 150 “sons of Parosh” led by Zechariah, some of their family already in Jerusalem had taken foreign wives, whom they later sent away. (Ezr 8:1, 3; 10:25, 44) Pedaiah, one of the family, repaired a section of Jerusalem’s wall. (Ne 3:25) The head of the Parosh family attested to the later covenant agreeing to keep the Law of Jehovah.​—Ne 9:38; 10:1, 14.

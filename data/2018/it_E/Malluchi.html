<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A priestly family whose representative served in the days of High Priest Joiakim, and in the days of Ezra and Governor Nehemiah.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:12:12-16:12:12" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ne 12:12,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:12:14-16:12:14" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 14,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:12:26-16:12:26" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> 26</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The name Malluchi is in the Masoretic text with the kere, or marginal notation, that it should be read as “Melicu,” which latter form is found in the <em>King James Version.</em> The Greek <em>Septuagint</em> reads “Malluch,” which some scholars think was the original form. These scholars suggest (but there is no way of proving it) that the adding of <em>i</em> (<em>yohdh</em> [י] in Hebrew) at the end of the name came about when the first letter of the following word was unintentionally repeated in manuscript copying.</p>

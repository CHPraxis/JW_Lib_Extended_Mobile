MIBHAR
(Mibʹhar) [from a root that means “choose”].
Son of Hagri; one of the mighty men of David’s military forces. (1Ch 11:26, 38) Some have suggested that there is a discrepancy in the text at 1 Chronicles 11:38 because Bani the Gadite, not Mibhar, is mentioned in a parallel list at 2 Samuel 23:36. They hold that Mibhar is an alteration of the Hebrew for “from Zobah” and that the final words of 1 Chronicles 11:38 resulted because of reading ben-hagh·riʹ (son of Hagri) for ba·niʹ hag·ga·dhiʹ (Bani the Gadite). This remains conjectural.

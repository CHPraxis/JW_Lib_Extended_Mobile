The Egyptian ‘scribe kit’ was a long, narrow case made out of wood and had a compartment or slots for reed pens. On the outer face, near the top, it had at least one recess for a small cake of dried ink. The scribe could prepare to write by applying the moistened end of his pen to the ink. Inscriptions show that Syrian scribes used a similar ‘scribal kit.’</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A bringing back to a former condition. Outstandingly, in the Scriptures, in connection with the return of Christ, mention is made of “times of restoration [form of Gr., <em>a·po·ka·taʹsta·sis</em>] of all things of which God spoke through the mouth of his holy prophets.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:3:20-44:3:21" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ac 3:20, 21</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The <em>King James Version</em> here renders <em>a·po·ka·taʹsta·sis</em> as “restitution.” The Greek word itself comes from <em>a·poʹ,</em> meaning “back” or “again,” and <em>ka·thiʹste·mi,</em> literally meaning “set down.” The corresponding verb form is translated ‘restore’ in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:1:6-44:1:6" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Acts 1:6</a>. The <em>Theological Dictionary of the New Testament,</em> edited by G. Kittel, states that the basic meaning of the term is “restitution to an earlier state” or “restoration.” (Translated by G. Bromiley, 1964, Vol. I, p. 389) It was used by Jewish historian Josephus in referring to the return of the Jews from exile. In papyrus writings it is used of the repair of certain buildings, the restoration of estates to rightful owners, and a balancing of accounts.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The text itself does not specify what the things to be restored are, hence the “all things” must be ascertained by the study of God’s message spoken through his prophets.</p>

ZILPAH
(Zilʹpah).
Leah’s maidservant and one of Jacob’s secondary wives. Zilpah had been a servant of Leah’s father Laban until Leah and Jacob were married in 1774 B.C.E., when she was given to Leah. (Ge 29:24) After Leah had had four sons and thought she was through childbearing, she gave Zilpah to Jacob as a secondary wife. Zilpah then bore Gad and Asher, who, in turn, had many sons. (Ge 30:9-13; 35:26; 37:2; 46:16-18) Zilpah remained with Jacob’s household through their many travels.​—Ge 32:22; 33:1, 2.

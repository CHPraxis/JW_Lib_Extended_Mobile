<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Mourning among Oriental peoples was customarily accompanied by much outward display of grief, and this is reflected in the Biblical accounts of periods of mourning. One entire book of the Bible, Lamentations, is an expression of mourning over the fate of Jerusalem.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><strong>Causes of Mourning.</strong> Persons mourned to express repentance (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:9:1-16:9:2" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ne 9:1, 2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/32:3:5-32:3:9" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Jon 3:5-9</a>), or because of the imminence of calamity (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/17:4:3-17:4:3" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Es 4:3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:6:26-24:6:26" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Jer 6:26;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/30:5:16-30:5:17" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> Am 5:16, 17</a>) or a disastrous condition already prevailing (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/29:1:5-29:1:14" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Joe 1:5-14</a>). The most common cause of mourning, undoubtedly, was death. The death of a member of the immediate family set in motion a period of mourning (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:23:2-1:23:2" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ge 23:2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:27:41-1:27:41" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 27:41;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:37:33-1:37:35" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> 37:33-35</a>), while the death of a parent or of an only son are set out as occasions of the deepest grief.

<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><strong>Ways of Expressing Sorrow.</strong> Mourning was given expression vocally and by weeping, as well as by disfigurement of the physical appearance and by fasting or otherwise abstaining from normal practices.

<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Plaintive elegies at times were composed as songs of mourning. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:1:17-10:1:27" data-bid="17-1" class="b">2Sa 1:17-27;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:3:33-10:3:34" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> 3:33, 34;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:35:25-14:35:25" data-bid="17-3" class="b"> 2Ch 35:25</a>) A particular type of song was the <em>shig·ga·yohnʹ,</em> a Hebrew term that occurs in the <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:7:0-19:7:0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">superscription of Psalm 7</a>; a related term appears in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/35:3:1-35:3:1" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Habakkuk 3:1</a>. This was a dirgelike composition and apparently indicates a highly emotional song with rapid changes of rhythm. It will be noted in both of these references (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:7:0-19:7:17" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Ps 7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/35:3:2-35:3:19" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> Hab 3:2-19</a>) that the elements of danger, strong outbursts of appeal or <span id="page447" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="447" data-before-text="447"></span>emotion, and subsequent rejoicing in Jehovah are present.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Occasionally, professional mourners were employed at funerals, and musicians played mournful tunes (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:9:17-24:9:18" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Jer 9:17, 18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:9:23-40:9:23" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> Mt 9:23</a>); these were imitated by little children playing in the marketplaces in the time of Jesus’ earthly ministry. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:11:16-40:11:17" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Mt 11:16, 17</a>) The pipe or flute was the preferred instrument for lamentation.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:48:36-24:48:36" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Jer 48:36;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:9:23-40:9:23" data-bid="23-2" class="b"> Mt 9:23</a>; see Josephus’ <em>Jewish War,</em> III, 437 (ix, 5).</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">After a burial the women customarily visited the grave, to weep and mourn. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:11:31-43:11:31" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Joh 11:31</a>) A funeral meal seems to have been served sometime during the mourning period and, in some instances, appears to have been made into a special feast.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/28:9:4-28:9:4" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Ho 9:4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:16:5-24:16:5" data-bid="25-2" class="b"> Jer 16:5,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:16:7-24:16:7" data-bid="25-3" class="b"> 7</a>.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><strong>Prohibitions Involving Mourning.</strong> On occasion God’s people as a body, or as individuals, were instructed not to mourn over the death of certain ones, such as condemned wrongdoers. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:10:1-3:10:2" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Le 10:1, 2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:10:6-3:10:6" data-bid="26-2" class="b"> 6</a>) The prophet Ezekiel was commanded to adopt none of the signs of mourning for his deceased wife, thereby serving as a portent for the Israelites with him in Babylon that they would be so stunned that they would not mourn the divine execution of judgment on Jerusalem for its unfaithfulness. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:24:15-26:24:24" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Eze 24:15-24</a>) Jeremiah received somewhat similar instructions.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:16:5-24:16:13" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Jer 16:5-13</a>.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Certain mourning practices were forbidden under the Mosaic Law, including the inflicting of cuts in the flesh or causing of “baldness on your foreheads” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:19:28-3:19:28" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Le 19:28;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:14:1-5:14:1" data-bid="29-2" class="b"> De 14:1</a>) and the misuse of tithes in connection with the dead. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:26:12-5:26:14" data-bid="30-1" class="b">De 26:12-14</a>) For certain members of their immediate families the priests could mourn openly, but the high priest was restricted from doing so.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:21:1-3:21:6" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Le 21:1-6,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:21:10-3:21:12" data-bid="31-2" class="b"> 10-12</a>.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb"><strong>A Time to Mourn.</strong> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:3:1-21:3:1" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 3:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:3:4-21:3:4" data-bid="32-2" class="b"> 4</a> states that there is “a time to weep and a time to laugh; a time to wail and a time to skip about.” In view of all mankind’s dying condition, the heart of the wise ones is shown to be “in the house of mourning” rather than in the banquet house. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:7:2-21:7:2" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Ec 7:2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:7:4-21:7:4" data-bid="33-2" class="b"> 4</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:14:13-20:14:13" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Pr 14:13</a>.) Thus, the wise person makes use of his opportunity to express sympathy and give comfort, instead of ignoring such an occasion in favor of seeking pleasure. This helps him to keep in mind his own mortal state and to keep his heart in a right attitude toward his Creator.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Valid motives for mourning are set forth in the Scriptures. In addition to the death of loved ones (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:42:38-1:42:38" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Ge 42:38;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:44:31-1:44:31" data-bid="35-2" class="b"> 44:31</a>), detestable and God-dishonoring practices of false religion are a cause for sighing and groaning (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:9:4-26:9:4" data-bid="36-1" class="b">Eze 9:4</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:5:2-46:5:2" data-bid="37-1" class="b">1Co 5:2</a>), and grief is rightly expressed because of one’s own errors. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:38:4-19:38:4" data-bid="38-1" class="b">Ps 38:4,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:38:6-19:38:10" data-bid="38-2" class="b"> 6-10</a>) Jehovah urges those who have drawn away from him: “Come back to me with all your hearts, and with fasting and with weeping and with wailing. And rip apart your hearts, and not your garments.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/29:2:12-29:2:13" data-bid="39-1" class="b">Joe 2:12, 13</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:4:8-59:4:9" data-bid="40-1" class="b">Jas 4:8, 9</a>.) Elsewhere, also, stress is laid, not on the external expressions of grief or mourning, but on the inner stirrings and pain of heart, marking genuine sadness.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:31:9-19:31:10" data-bid="41-1" class="b">Ps 31:9, 10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:14:10-20:14:10" data-bid="41-2" class="b"> Pr 14:10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:15:13-20:15:13" data-bid="41-3" class="b"> 15:13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:14:72-41:14:72" data-bid="41-4" class="b"> Mr 14:72;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:16:6-43:16:6" data-bid="41-5" class="b"> Joh 16:6</a>.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">Even Jehovah speaks of himself as being “hurt at his heart.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:6:6-1:6:6" data-bid="42-1" class="b">Ge 6:6</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:63:9-23:63:9" data-bid="43-1" class="b">Isa 63:9</a>.) God’s holy spirit can also be ‘grieved.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:4:30-49:4:30" data-bid="44-1" class="b">Eph 4:30</a>) Since that spirit works in God’s servants toward the producing of fruits of righteousness (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:5:22-48:5:24" data-bid="45-1" class="b">Ga 5:22-24</a>), those who fail to appreciate this divine provision, who resist its working, and who go contrary to its leading are, in effect, “grieving” it.​—Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:63:10-23:63:10" data-bid="46-1" class="b">Isa 63:10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/52:5:19-52:5:19" data-bid="46-2" class="b"> 1Th 5:19</a>.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb"><strong>A Balanced View of Mourning.</strong> In the time of Jesus’ earthly ministry, mourning was still frequently carried on by the people with much outward expression and accompanying noise and confusion. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:5:38-41:5:39" data-bid="47-1" class="b">Mr 5:38, 39</a>) Though Jesus ‘groaned within himself’ and wept on a number of occasions (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:11:33-43:11:35" data-bid="48-1" class="b">Joh 11:33-35,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:11:38-43:11:38" data-bid="48-2" class="b"> 38;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:19:41-42:19:41" data-bid="48-3" class="b"> Lu 19:41;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:14:33-41:14:34" data-bid="48-4" class="b"> Mr 14:33, 34;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:5:7-58:5:7" data-bid="48-5" class="b"> Heb 5:7</a>), there is no record of his employing the other more ostentatious expressions already described. (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:23:27-42:23:28" data-bid="49-1" class="b">Lu 23:27, 28</a>.) His disciples likewise expressed grief and mourning.

In explaining his acts to his surprised attendants, he stated: “Now that he has died, why is it I am fasting? Am I able to bring him back again? I am going to him, but, as for him, he will not return to me.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:12:16-10:12:16" data-bid="59-1" class="b">2Sa 12:16,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:12:19-10:12:23" data-bid="59-2" class="b"> 19-23</a>) Later, however, he needed help from straight-speaking Joab to pull out of his state of deep grief over the death of his son Absalom.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:18:33-10:18:33" data-bid="60-1" class="b">2Sa 18:33;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:19:1-10:19:8" data-bid="60-2" class="b"> 19:1-8</a>.</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/38:7:2-38:7:7" data-bid="63-1" class="b">Zec 7:2-7</a>) However, “sadness in a godly way makes for repentance to salvation.” Such sadness is the result of a person’s seeing a wrongdoing as a sin against God. It moves him to seek God’s forgiveness and to turn around from his wrong course. “But the sadness of the world produces death.” Although a person may be sad that his wrong was exposed and that this has meant loss to him, he has no desire to gain God’s forgiveness.

In its desolation, the land would grow up in weeds and develop a neglected, uncared-for appearance, like that of a person who has not attended to his face, hair, or clothing while in mourning. Similarly, land devastated by a plague upon the crops presents a mournful sight.</p>

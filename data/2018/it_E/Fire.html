<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">As today, so also in Bible times fire played an important role in man’s life. The refining, forging, and casting of metals, along with the preparing of food and the heating of homes, as well as the offering of sacrifices and the burning of incense, are among the things specifically mentioned in the Bible as requiring the use of fire. However, because of the destructiveness of uncontrolled fire, it is described as one of the four things that have not said: “Enough!” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:30:15-20:30:16" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Pr 30:15, 16</a>) For the same reason James compared the tongue when used wrongly to a fire.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:3:5-59:3:8" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Jas 3:5-8</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:16:27-20:16:27" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Pr 16:27</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The first man and woman were acquainted with fire, for Jehovah, upon expelling them from the garden of Eden, posted at the E of the garden “the cherubs and the flaming blade of a sword that was turning itself continually.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:3:24-1:3:24" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ge 3:24</a>) Cain and Abel may have brought their offerings to Jehovah before the cherubs and, though it is not directly stated in the Scriptures, likely they used fire in presenting them, or they may have expected fire to come from the cherubs to consume the sacrifices. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:4:3-1:4:4" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ge 4:3, 4</a>) Tubal-cain, in forging tools of copper and iron, must have employed the heat of intense fires, especially since the melting of iron requires a temperature of 1,535° C.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:11:3-1:11:3" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ge 11:3</a>) In view of the difficulty faced in kindling a fire anew, it was evidently a frequent practice to transfer fire from one place to another.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:22:6-1:22:6" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Ge 22:6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:30:14-23:30:14" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> Isa 30:14</a>.</p>

<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><strong><em>As relates to the tabernacle and the temple.</em></strong> Fire figured in the worship carried on at the tabernacle and then later at the temple. Each morning and between the two evenings, the high priest was to burn incense on the altar of incense. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:30:7-2:30:8" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Ex 30:7, 8</a>) God’s law required that the fire on the altar of burnt offering be kept burning continually. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:6:12-3:6:13" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Le 6:12, 13</a>) The traditional Jewish view that the altar fire was originally kindled miraculously by God, though widely accepted, is not actually supported by the Scriptures. According to Jehovah’s initial instructions to Moses, the sons of Aaron were to “put fire on the altar and set wood in order on the fire” before placing the sacrifice on the altar. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:1:7-3:1:8" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Le 1:7, 8</a>) It was <em>after</em> the installation of the Aaronic priesthood, and therefore after the installation sacrifices had been offered, that fire from Jehovah, probably proceeding from the cloud over the tabernacle, consumed the offering then upon the altar. In view of this, the miraculous fire manifested itself, not in kindling the wood on the altar, but in “consuming the burnt offering and the fatty pieces upon the altar.” The fire that then continued to burn on the altar, of course, was likely a result of the mixture of the fire from God and the fire already on the altar. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:8:14-3:9:24" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Le 8:14–9:24</a>) Likewise, miraculous fire from Jehovah consumed the sacrifices right after Solomon’s prayer at the dedication of the temple.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:7:1-14:7:1" data-bid="16-1" class="b">2Ch 7:1</a>; see also <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:6:21-7:6:21" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Jg 6:21;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:18:21-11:18:39" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> 1Ki 18:21-39;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:21:26-13:21:26" data-bid="17-3" class="b"> 1Ch 21:26</a> for other examples of Jehovah’s use of miraculous fire when accepting the offerings of his servants.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><strong><em>Legal provisions, and use in executions.</em></strong> The Mosaic Law prohibited lighting a fire on the Sabbath. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:35:3-2:35:3" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Ex 35:3</a>) According to the Law, if a fire got out of hand and caused a conflagration in the field of another, the one starting the fire had to make compensation. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:22:6-2:22:6" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Ex 22:6</a>) Garments or articles of skin in which a plague of leprosy developed and persisted were to be burned.

<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">On numerous occasions Jehovah used literal fire in executing his judgments against wrongdoers.

<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb"><strong>Use by Opposers of God’s Will.</strong> Fire was also used by opposers of God’s will in threats, cruel executions, and sacrifices. Angered Ephraimites threatened Jephthah: “Your very house we shall burn over you with fire.” Similarly, Samson’s 30 Philistine groomsmen threatened to burn his betrothed and her father’s house if she did not get Samson to tell her the solution to a riddle and then advise them accordingly. After Samson sent 300 foxes with lighted torches into the standing grain of the pagan Philistines, the Philistines did burn her and her father with fire.

<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb"><strong><em>Testing, refining, purging.</em></strong> “The messenger of the covenant” is compared to a refiner’s fire, a fire used in purifying gold and silver.

On one occasion Jesus warned his disciples against letting their hand, foot, or eye stumble them so that they would be pitched into Gehenna.

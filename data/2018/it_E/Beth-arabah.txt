BETH-ARABAH
(Beth-arʹa·bah) [House of the Desert Plain].
One of the six cities within Judah’s territory described as “in the wilderness.” (Jos 15:61) It is used in describing the mutual boundaries of the tribes of Benjamin and Judah. (Jos 15:6) Though listed as within the tribal assignment of Judah, it is thereafter spoken of as pertaining to Benjamin, perhaps indicating the site as an enclave city of the Benjamites. (Jos 18:21, 22) Remaining evidence of the name may be seen in ʽAin el-Gharabah, a spring on the N side of the Wadi el Qilt about 6 km (3.5 mi) ESE of Jericho. This location would place it in the desert region at the N end of the Dead Sea.

ADJUTANT
The Hebrew word sha·lishʹ (third man, referring to the third warrior in a war chariot) has been translated in various Bible versions as “captain,” “chariot-leader,” “lord,” “warrior,” “adjutant.”
Some monumental inscriptions illustrating “Hittite” and Assyrian war chariots show three men: one, the driver; another, the fighter with the sword, lance, or bow; and a third, the carrier of the shield. Though Egyptian monuments usually do not show three-manned chariots, the term is used at Exodus 14:7 with respect to Pharaoh’s charioteers. The third chariot warrior, usually the one carrying the shield, was an assistant commander in the war chariot, an adjutant. The English word “adjutant” literally means “one that helps; assistant.”
After mentioning that none of the sons of Israel were constituted slaves by Solomon, 1 Kings 9:22 states: “For they were the warriors and his servants and his princes and his adjutants and chiefs of his charioteers and of his horsemen.” Commenting on this text, C. F. Keil states that the term sha·li·shimʹ (plural), used in this passage, could be understood as “royal adjutants.”​—Commentary on the Old Testament, 1973, Vol. III, 1 Kings, p. 146.
In the days of King Jehoram of Israel, the Syrians put Samaria under siege, which in time caused famine conditions within the city. When Elisha prophesied that there would be plenty of food, Jehoram’s special adjutant ridiculed the prophecy. As Elisha had foretold, the adjutant saw the fulfillment of the prophecy but did not get to eat any of the food, being trampled to death in the gateway.​—2Ki 7:2, 16-20.
At Jehu’s command, his runners and adjutants, likely including Bidkar, struck down the Baal worshipers. (2Ki 9:25; 10:25) Pekah, another adjutant referred to in the Scriptures, assassinated Pekahiah the king of Israel and succeeded him to the throne.​—2Ki 15:25; see Eze 23:15, ftn.

BRAZIER
Generally, a heating device consisting of a panlike receptacle elevated off the ground by means of legs and designed for holding burning coals or charcoal. The Hebrew word rendered “brazier” (ʼach) is of Egyptian origin, suggesting that the brazier itself was an innovation from Egypt.
It appears that in the better homes the brazier was preferred to a depression in the floor of the house, in which a fire could be built. King Jehoiakim had a brazier, likely one made of metal, in his winter house.​—Jer 36:22, 23.

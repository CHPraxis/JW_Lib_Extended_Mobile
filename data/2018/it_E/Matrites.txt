MATRITES
(Matʹrites) [Of (Belonging to) Matar (Rain [thus born in the rainy season])].
A Benjamite family of which King Saul of Israel was a member. (1Sa 10:21) The King James Version uses the name “Matri” (Maʹtri). However, the Hebrew word mat·riʹ here is accompanied by the definite article. Thus the New World Translation appropriately reads “the Matrites,” as do other modern translations.​—AS; AT; RS.

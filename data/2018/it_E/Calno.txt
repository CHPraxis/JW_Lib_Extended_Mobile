CALNO
(Calʹno).
A city listed in Isaiah’s prophecy concerning the boasting of the Assyrians as to their conquests and the futility of trying to withstand their might. (Isa 10:5, 9-11) Most scholars consider Calno to be an alternate spelling of Calneh. (Am 6:2) Calno’s mention in connection with Carchemish would harmonize with the identification of Calneh with Kullani of the Assyrian texts, located between Carchemish and Aleppo. Kullani was conquered by Tiglath-pileser III, a contemporary of King Menahem of Israel.

KIDNAPPING
Seizing, carrying away, and detaining a person against his will through unlawful force, fraud, or intimidation. Kidnapping was a crime carrying the penalty of capital punishment under the Mosaic Law. If a person were to steal or kidnap a man and sell him, or if the kidnapped individual was found with him, the kidnapper was to be put to death. (Ex 21:16; De 24:7) Prior to the giving of this law to Israel, Jacob’s son Joseph, sold into slavery, was a victim of kidnapping. (Ge 37:27, 28; 40:15) God later turned this act into a blessing for Joseph in Egypt, and Joseph forgave his brothers for their wicked deed.​—Ge 45:4, 5.
In writing to Timothy, the apostle Paul made the observation that “law is promulgated, not for a righteous man,” but for lawless persons, including kidnappers.​—1Ti 1:8-11.

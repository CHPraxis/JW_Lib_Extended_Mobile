<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">The precious “perfumed oil” that Mary, the sister of Lazarus, applied to Jesus’ head and feet. By reason of its costliness, nard (Gr., <em>narʹdos</em>) was often subjected to adulteration and even counterfeiting. It may be noteworthy, therefore, that both Mark and John use the expression “genuine nard.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:14:3-41:14:3" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Mr 14:3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:12:3-43:12:3" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Joh 12:3</a>) Valuable ointment sealed in a small alabaster container anciently served as a good investment.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:12:5-43:12:5" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Joh 12:5</a>; see <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200004209/">SPIKENARD</a>.</p>

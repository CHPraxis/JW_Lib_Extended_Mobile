ZIMMAH
(Zimʹmah).
A Gershonite Levite. (1Ch 6:20) He is possibly the same Zimmah who is mentioned in 1 Chronicles 6:42. If this genealogy skips many names (as these lists commonly do), he may also be the one referred to at 2 Chronicles 29:12, whose descendant Joah helped to cleanse the temple in Hezekiah’s day.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">(Beth-eʹden) [House of Eden].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A city or region of Syria referred to at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/30:1:5-30:1:5" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Amos 1:5</a> in that prophet’s message against Damascus. It is now generally associated with the Bit-adini of the Assyrian inscriptions, a region located between the Euphrates and Balikh rivers. Such identification can be acceptable, however, only if “Damascus” in the prophecy is understood to represent the Aramaean (Syrian) kingdoms in general, inasmuch as the kingdom of Bit-adini lay some 480 km (300 mi) to the N of Damascus. Damascus is, indeed, called “the head of Syria” at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:7:8-23:7:8" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Isaiah 7:8</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Amos’ prediction (likely c. 804 B.C.E.) that “the people of Syria will have to go as exiles to Kir” was apparently fulfilled in the time of the Assyrian monarch Tiglath-pileser III, during the reign of King Ahaz (761-746 B.C.E.).​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:16:9-12:16:9" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2Ki 16:9</a>.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A cud-chewing mammal with hollow horns and usually long, relatively straight hair. A number of Hebrew and Greek terms are used to refer to male and female goats and their offspring. The common Hebrew term for “goat” is <em>ʽez.</em> (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:3:12-3:3:12" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Le 3:12</a>) Another Hebrew term for goat (<em>sa·ʽirʹ</em>) literally means “hairy.” (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:27:11-1:27:11" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ge 27:11</a>, where a word of the same form and from the same root is rendered “hairy.”) The male leader of a flock of goats was denoted by the Hebrew term <em>ʽat·tudhʹ,</em> rendered ‘he-goat.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:7:17-4:7:17" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Nu 7:17</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:50:8-24:50:8" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Jer 50:8</a>, ftn.)

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The Syrian goat (<em>Capra hircus mambrica</em>), distinguished by its long, drooping ears and its backward-curving horns, is the predominant breed of Palestine. Usually these goats are black; speckled ones are exceptional.

<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">To the Hebrews the goat was very valuable.

Monuments are still extant in which this symbol occurs, as one of the pilasters of Persepolis, where a goat is depicted with one immense horn on his forehead, and a Persian holding the horn, by which is intended the subjection of Macedon by Persia” (something accomplished by the Persians toward the close of the sixth century B.C.E.).</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb"><strong>Mountain Goat, Wild Goat.</strong> The Hebrew designation <em>yeʽe·limʹ,</em> rendered “mountain goats” (<em>NW</em>) and “wild goats” (<em>KJ</em>), is generally understood to refer to the Nubian ibex (<em>Capra ibex nubiana</em>), a mountain-dwelling wild goat with large, heavily ridged, backward-curving horns. This animal is at home in the high mountains (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:104:18-19:104:18" data-bid="39-1" class="b">Ps 104:18</a>), where it negotiates jagged crags and narrow mountain ledges with graceful ease. During the period of gestation these goats seek out places not easily found by man. This may be alluded to at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:39:1-18:39:1" data-bid="40-1" class="b">Job 39:1</a>, where the question raised points up the fact that these creatures are quite independent of man, the birth of their young taking place unobserved by man.</p>

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“The king’s Low Plain,” where Abraham, victorious over Chedorlaomer and his allies, was met by the king of Sodom and received a blessing from Melchizedek, king of Salem. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:14:17-1:14:24" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ge 14:17-24</a>) Centuries later, Absalom erected his monument in “the Low Plain of the King,” apparently the same place and likely near Jerusalem. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:18:18-10:18:18" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2Sa 18:18</a>) Josephus indicated that Absalom’s Monument was set up “two stades [370 m; 1,214 ft] distant from Jerusalem.” (<em>Jewish Antiquities,</em> VII, 243 [x, 3]) However, the exact location of the Low Plain of Shaveh cannot now be ascertained.</p>

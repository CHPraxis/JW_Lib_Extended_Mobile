<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">BEFORE ascending to heaven in 33 C.E., Jesus Christ gave his followers this parting commission: “You will be witnesses of me both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria and to the most distant part of the earth.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:1:8-44:1:8" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ac 1:8</a>) They proved true to their commission.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Ten days later, at Pentecost, holy spirit came upon about 120 disciples waiting in Jerusalem, and they proceeded to speak “about the magnificent things of God.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:2:1-44:2:4" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ac 2:1-4,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:2:11-44:2:11" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 11</a>) On that same day, about 3,000 were baptized. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:2:37-44:2:41" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ac 2:37-41</a>) Within a short time, the disciples ‘filled Jerusalem with their teaching.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:5:27-44:5:28" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ac 5:27, 28,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:5:40-44:5:42" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 40-42</a>) With what result? “The number of the disciples kept multiplying in Jerusalem very much.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:6:7-44:6:7" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ac 6:7</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">From Jerusalem, the witnessing work spread out. As a result of opposition to their witnessing in Jerusalem, the disciples were scattered throughout Judea and Samaria. Again, the result was increase.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:8:1-44:8:1" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ac 8:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:8:4-44:8:4" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 4,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:8:14-44:8:17" data-bid="6-3" class="b"> 14-17</a>.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">In 36 C.E. the apostle Peter brought the good news to Caesarea, where Cornelius and his household, the first uncircumcised Gentile converts, were baptized. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:10:1-44:10:48" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ac 10</a>) Following that, systematic witnessing among non-Jews apparently began in Syrian Antioch. As a result, “a great number that became believers turned to the Lord.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:11:20-44:11:21" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Ac 11:20, 21</a>) Since then, the witnessing work has expanded to other nations and has literally reached “to the most distant part of the earth.”</p>

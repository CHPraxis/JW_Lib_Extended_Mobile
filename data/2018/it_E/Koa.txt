KOA
(Koʹa).
A people or region mentioned with Pekod and Shoa at Ezekiel 23:23 and foretold by Jehovah to supply part of the enemy forces that would assault unfaithful Jerusalem and Judah. Koa was probably located E of Babylonia and has been generally linked with the Qutu, a people who resided E of the Tigris on the steppes between the upper ʽAdhaim and Diyala rivers. The Qutu are frequently coupled with the Sutu (perhaps the Shoa of Eze 23:23) in Assyrian inscriptions, such records showing them as fighting against Assyria.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">(Methʹeg-amʹmah) [Bridle of Ammah (possibly, Cubit)].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A place taken from the Philistines by King David. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:8:1-10:8:1" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2Sa 8:1</a>) Since no site by that name is known, Metheg-ammah may well be a figurative term designating one of the principal Philistine cities. The parallel passage at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:18:1-13:18:1" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Chronicles 18:1</a> says, “Gath and its dependent towns.” At <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:8:1-10:8:1" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2 Samuel 8:1</a> the <em>American Standard Version</em> evidently took the element “ammah” in Metheg-ammah to be from the Hebrew word for “mother” and translated Metheg-ammah as “the bridle of the mother city.” This thought is conveyed by <em>An American Translation,</em> which reads “the control of the metropolis” instead of “Metheg-ammah.”</p>

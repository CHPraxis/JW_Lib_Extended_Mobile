Prophetic Activity of Elijah and Elisha




ELIJAH was a prophet who called for a test of godship at Mount Carmel. The northern kingdom was being corrupted by Baal worship. But Elijah courageously challenged 450 prophets of Baal to prove that Baal was the true God. Frantic hours of prayer on their part yielded nothing. Then Elijah laid out his sacrifice, drenched it repeatedly with water, and prayed to Jehovah. When fire promptly fell from heaven, devoured the sacrifice, and licked up the water, the people exclaimed: “Jehovah is the true God!” At that, Elijah ordered that the prophets of Baal be slaughtered.​—1Ki 18:18-40.
Nevertheless, Elijah grew fearful when he learned that Queen Jezebel was plotting to kill him. He fled some 150 km (95 mi) to Beer-sheba and then traveled another 300 km (190 mi) to Mount Sinai. Jehovah did not reject Elijah for his temporary lapse of courage but assured him that there was further prophetic work for him to do.​—1Ki 19:1-18.
Elisha was Elijah’s successor. When Elisha was surrounded by Syrian war chariots, he had faith to realize that it was really the Syrian armies that were surrounded​—by a host of angelic chariots!​—2Ki 6:15-17.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Unnatural sexual intercourse of a man or a woman with an animal. The Mosaic Law emphatically condemned this perverted practice, sentencing the guilty person and the beast to death. “Where a man gives his seminal emission to a beast, he should be put to death without fail, and you should kill the beast. And where a woman approaches any beast to have a connection with it, you must kill the woman and the beast.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:20:15-3:20:16" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Le 20:15, 16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:18:23-3:18:23" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 18:23;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:22:19-2:22:19" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> Ex 22:19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:27:21-5:27:21" data-bid="1-4" class="b"> De 27:21</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">This prohibition, together with the rest of God’s laws governing sex relations, lifted the Israelites to a much higher moral level than their neighbors. In Egypt, bestiality constituted a part of idolatrous animal worship; historians attest to the cohabitation of women with goats, for example. Similar practices were also prevalent among the Canaanites (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:18:23-3:18:30" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Le 18:23-30</a>), and reportedly in Rome.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The depraved practice of bestiality is included in the Greek word <em>por·neiʹa</em> that is rendered “fornication.” (See <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200001555/">FORNICATION</a>.) Anyone indulging in such filthy practice is morally unclean, and if a member of the Christian congregation was to indulge in such a practice, that one would be subject to disfellowshipping.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:5:3-49:5:3" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Eph 5:3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:3:5-51:3:6" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Col 3:5, 6</a>.</p>

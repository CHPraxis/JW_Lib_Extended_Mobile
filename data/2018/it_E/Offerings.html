<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">From early times men have presented offerings to God. In the first recorded instance, Adam’s oldest son Cain presented some fruits of the ground, and Adam’s younger son Abel, the firstlings of his flock. Evidently the attitudes and motives of the two brothers were different, for God approved Abel’s offering but looked with disfavor on Cain’s. (Later, the Law covenant provided for both animal and grain offerings.) Abel must have had faith in God’s promise of liberation through the promised Seed and likely realized that blood would have to be shed, someone would have to be ‘bruised in the heel,’ so that mankind might be uplifted to the perfection that Adam and Eve had lost. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:3:15-1:3:15" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ge 3:15</a>) Acknowledging himself as a sinner, he was led by faith to present an offering requiring the shedding of blood, thereby accurately foreshadowing the real sacrifice for sins, Jesus Christ.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:4:1-1:4:4" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ge 4:1-4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:11:4-58:11:4" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Heb 11:4</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><strong>In Patriarchal Society.</strong> The family head Noah, on coming out of the ark, offered a thanksgiving sacrifice to Jehovah that was “restful” (soothing, tranquilizing), after which Jehovah made the “rainbow” covenant with Noah and his offspring.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:1:5-18:1:5" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Job 1:5</a>) The most notable and significant of ancient sacrifices was Abraham’s attempt to offer up Isaac, at Jehovah’s direction. Jehovah, after observing Abraham’s faith and obedience, kindly provided a ram as substitute. This act of Abraham foreshadowed Jehovah’s offering of his own only-begotten Son, Jesus Christ.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:22:1-1:22:14" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ge 22:1-14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:11:17-58:11:19" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> Heb 11:17-19</a>.</p>

<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><strong><em>Burnt offerings.</em></strong> Burnt offerings were presented in their entirety to God; no part of the animal being retained by the worshiper.

<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb"><strong><em>Communion offerings (or peace offerings).</em></strong> Communion offerings acceptable to Jehovah denoted peace with him. The worshiper and his household partook (in the courtyard of the tabernacle; according to tradition, booths were set up around the inside of the curtain surrounding the courtyard; in the temple, dining rooms were provided). The officiating priest received a portion, and the priests on duty, another portion. Jehovah, in effect, received the pleasing smoke of the burning fat. The blood, representing the life, was given to God as his. Therefore the priests, the worshipers, and Jehovah were as if together at the meal, signifying peaceful relationships. The person partaking while in a state of uncleanness (any of the uncleannesses mentioned in the Law) or who ate the flesh after it had been kept beyond the prescribed time (in the warm climate it would begin to putrefy) was to be cut off from his people. He defiled or desecrated the meal, because of either being unclean himself or eating that which was foul before Jehovah God, showing disrespect for sacred things.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:7:16-3:7:21" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Le 7:16-21;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:19:5-3:19:8" data-bid="30-2" class="b"> 19:5-8</a>.</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:10:16-46:10:16" data-bid="31-1" class="b">1Co 10:16</a>) Those in “the new covenant by virtue of [Jesus’] blood” share with one another in faith, partaking of the emblems representing Jesus’ body and blood. They share also with Jehovah as Author of the arrangement. These are seeking Jehovah’s approval and are at peace not only with one another but also with Jehovah through Jesus Christ. In line with the requirement of cleanness for sharers in a communion meal, Paul warns that the Christian should examine himself before the Memorial meal. To treat the occasion or the emblems of wine and unleavened bread lightly or with contempt would be desecration of sacred things, meriting adverse judgment.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:11:25-46:11:25" data-bid="32-1" class="b">1Co 11:25,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:11:27-46:11:29" data-bid="32-2" class="b"> 27-29</a>; see <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200002773/">LORD’S EVENING MEAL</a>.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">In the <em>thanksgiving offering,</em> which was a communion offering praising God for his provisions and loving-kindnesses, flesh and both leavened and unleavened bread were eaten. The worshiper therefore celebrated the occasion using what might be termed “daily food.” (However, no leavened bread was at any time put upon the altar as being offered to God.) And, in this expression of thanks and praise to God, the flesh had to be enjoyed that day, not the next. (In other communion offerings, the flesh could be eaten the second day.) (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:7:11-3:7:15" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Le 7:11-15</a>) This brings to mind the prayer Jesus Christ taught his followers: “Give us today our bread for this day.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:11-40:6:11" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Mt 6:11</a>.</p>

<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">A sin of the high priest committed in his official position and capacity as representative of the entire nation before Jehovah brought guilt upon the entire assembly. This might be an error such as a mistake in judgment, in application of the Law, or in dealing with a question of national importance.

<p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="sb"><strong><em>Guilt offerings.</em></strong> Guilt offerings were also offerings because of sin, for guilt of any sort involves sin. They were for special sins by which a person had contracted guilt, and they differed slightly from other sin offerings in that they appear to have been to satisfy or restore a right. Either a right of Jehovah or a right of his holy nation had been violated. The guilt offering was to satisfy Jehovah on the right that had been violated, or to restore or recover certain covenant rights for the repentant wrongdoer and to get relief from the penalty for his sin.​—Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:53:10-23:53:10" data-bid="62-1" class="b">Isa 53:10</a>.</p>

On the other hand, the sins dealt with at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:6:1-3:6:7" data-bid="64-1" class="b">Leviticus 6:1-7</a> were not unwitting or careless sins but, nevertheless, were sins due to fleshly weaknesses and desires, not deliberate, high-handed, and purposely in rebellion against God.

<p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="sb">These laws highlight the fact that, while the Law was strict for the deliberate, unrepentant sinner, there was room for consideration of motives, circumstances, and attitudes, so that mercy could be extended under the Law, even as is the case in the Christian congregation.

But note that none of these wrongs could be done with impunity; compensation had to be made to the individual harmed, and a guilt offering was to be made to Jehovah. The guilt offerings were, with a few variations, handled in the same way as the sin offerings, the priests getting a portion to eat.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:7:1-3:7:1" data-bid="67-1" class="b">Le 7:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:7:5-3:7:7" data-bid="67-2" class="b"> 5-7</a>.</p>

<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="sb"><strong><em>Grain offerings.</em></strong> Grain offerings were made along with communion offerings, burnt offerings, and sin offerings, and also as firstfruits; at other times they were made independently.

Grain offerings could be in the form of fine flour, roasted grain, or ring-shaped cakes or wafers that were baked, griddle cooked, or from the deep-fat kettle. Some of the grain offering was put on the altar of burnt offering, some was eaten by the priests, and in communion offerings the worshiper partook.

ANAKIM
(Anʹa·kim) [Those of (Belonging to) Anak].
A race of people of extraordinary size who inhabited the mountainous regions of Canaan as well as some coastal areas, particularly in the S thereof. At one time three prominent men of the Anakim, that is, Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, resided at Hebron. (Nu 13:22) It was here that the 12 Hebrew spies first saw the Anakim, and 10 of the spies subsequently gave a frightening report of the experience, alleging that these men were descendants of the pre-Flood Nephilim and that, by comparison with them, the Hebrews were like “grasshoppers.” (Nu 13:28-33; De 1:28) Their great stature caused them to be used as a standard of comparison in describing even the giantlike men of the Emim and the Rephaim. Their strength apparently produced the proverbial saying: “Who can make a firm stand before the sons of Anak?”​—De 2:10, 11, 20, 21; 9:1-3.
In Joshua’s rapid sweep through Canaan, he gained victories over the Anakim in the mountainous regions, destroying their cities, but others remained in the Philistine cities of Gaza, Ashdod, and Gath. Whether the Anakim were related to the Philistines, as some suggest, or were only associated with them is not stated in the record. (Jos 11:21, 22) Later, Caleb requested the city of Hebron (Kiriath-arba) and its territory, as promised him by God. (Jos 14:12-15; Nu 14:24) It appears that the Anakim had reestablished themselves in this area, perhaps while Joshua and his army were continuing their conquest in the northern parts of Canaan, and hence Caleb was now obliged to reconquer the territory.​—Jg 1:10, 20.
Egyptian execration texts (from pottery on which the names of enemies of the pharaoh were written and which was then broken as a curse) might make reference to a tribe of Anak in Palestine as Iy-ʽanaq.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">(Bikʹath-aʹven) [Valley Plain of Hurtfulness (Something Hurtful)].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A place or valley plain associated with Damascus and Beth-eden in Jehovah’s prophecy through Amos foretelling the exile of the people of Syria. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/30:1:5-30:1:5" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Am 1:5</a>) In the absence of any record of a Syrian city or town by that name, some scholars connect Bikath-aven with the Beqaʽ Valley between the Lebanon and the Anti-Lebanon mountains. The predicted cutting-off of the inhabitants of Bikath-aven evidently came about as a result of Assyrian King Tiglath-pileser III’s conquest of Syria.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:16:9-12:16:10" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2Ki 16:9, 10</a>.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">(So·pheʹreth) [from a root meaning “count; number”].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Apparently an ancestor of a family (“the sons of Sophereth”) among “the sons of the servants of Solomon” who returned from the Babylonian exile. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/15:2:55-15:2:55" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ezr 2:55;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:7:57-16:7:57" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Ne 7:57</a>) Ezra puts a definite article in front of <em>So·pheʹreth,</em> making it <em>Has·so·pheʹreth,</em> possibly meaning “the scribe.” Some suggest that the sons of Sophereth were a staff of scribes or copyists. The meanings of some of the other names in the list might allow for reference to an occupation, while others do not.</p>

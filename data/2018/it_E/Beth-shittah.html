<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">(Beth-shitʹtah) [House of the Acacia [Tree]].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A town mentioned in describing the line of flight followed by the Midianites after their rout in the Low Plain of Jezreel by Judge Gideon. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:7:22-7:7:22" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Jg 7:22</a>) Since the Midianites were heading for the region of the Jordan, Beth-shittah must be located somewhere to the E or SE of the hill of Moreh and the well of Harod, in which vicinity the battle took place. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:7:1-7:7:1" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Jg 7:1</a>) Shattah (Bet Ha-Shitta), about 4.5 km (3 mi) ESE of modern ʽEn Harod, is suggested by some as the likely location and one giving evidence of the original name. Others consider it too near to the scene of the battle and recommend a location more to the SE, though offering no definite identification.</p>

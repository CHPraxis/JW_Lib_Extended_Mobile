<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">(Asʹri·el).</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A male descendant of Manasseh who became the family head of the Asrielites. <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:26:29-4:26:31" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Numbers 26:29-31</a> indicates that he was the great-grandson of Manasseh through Machir and his son Gilead. According to <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:7:14-13:7:14" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Chronicles 7:14</a>, Asriel was a son of Manasseh born to him by his Syrian concubine. However, part of an apparent parenthetical statement that follows reads: “She bore Machir the father of Gilead.” Hence, as is not uncommon in Biblical genealogies, Asriel may here be termed a “son” of Manasseh only in the sense of being one of his later descendants (through Machir, Manasseh’s son by his Syrian concubine). But it is possible that Manasseh had both a direct son and a great-grandson bearing the same name. “The sons of Asriel” were among the descendants of Manasseh to whom Joshua made territorial allotments in the Promised Land.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:17:1-6:17:4" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Jos 17:1-4</a>.</p>

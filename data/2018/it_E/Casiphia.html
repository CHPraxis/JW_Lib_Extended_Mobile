<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">(Ca·si·phiʹa) [possibly, Place of Silversmiths].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A “place” evidently situated in Babylonia and apparently near the gathering point of the exiles returning with Ezra to Jerusalem in 468 B.C.E. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/15:8:17-15:8:20" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ezr 8:17-20</a>) Other than stating that it was the area from which Ezra recruited Levites and Nethinim while encamped at the river Ahava, the Bible does not precisely identify Casiphia as either a city or a district.</p>

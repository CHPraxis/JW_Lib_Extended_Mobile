MISREPHOTH-MAIM
(Misʹre·photh-maʹim) [Burnings at the Waters].
A point to which the Israelites pursued the armies of northern Canaanite kings allied with Jabin after having defeated them at the waters of Merom. (Jos 11:1-5, 8) When the Promised Land was divided into inheritance portions, the area extending from Lebanon to Misrephoth-maim remained to be conquered. (Jos 13:2, 6) Some tentatively identify Misrephoth-maim with the ruins at Khirbet el-Musheirefeh (Horvat Mashref), about 20 km (12 mi) NNE of Acco (ʽAkko). This location would have provided the citizens of Misrephoth-maim access to the cities in the Plain of Acco and also the Hula Basin. Perhaps Misrephoth-maim (meaning “Burnings at the Waters”) got its name from the warm springs situated about 180 m (590 ft) from the site.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">(Derʹbe).</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A ‘city of Lycaonia’ in Asia Minor, personally visited two times, or perhaps three, by the apostle Paul.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Probably sometime prior to the winter of 47-48 C.E., during his first missionary journey, <span id="page616" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="616" data-before-text="616"></span>Paul arrived at Derbe after a severe stoning at nearby Lystra. At Derbe, he and Barnabas ‘declared the good news’ and made “quite a few disciples,” including, possibly, “Gaius of Derbe,” who is later mentioned as a traveling companion of the apostle. While secular history indicates that after 41 C.E. Derbe was the easternmost city of the <em>political</em> province of Galatia, Luke’s description of it in this account as a ‘city of Lycaonia’ is apparently in a regional or ethnographic sense.

<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Derbe is now identified with Kerti Hüyük 21 km (13 mi) NNE of Karaman (ancient Laranda) and about 100 km (62 mi) SE of Konya (ancient Iconium).

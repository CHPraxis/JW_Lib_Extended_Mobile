<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">At <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:20:1-14:20:1" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 20:1</a> the Masoretic text refers to some of the “Ammonim [Heb., <em>ʽAm·moh·nimʹ</em>]” as being joined with the sons of Moab and of Ammon in war against Jehoshaphat king of Judah. The <em>King James Version</em> inserts the word “other” to make the text read, “the children of Moab, and the children of Ammon, and with them <em>other</em> beside the Ammonites”; while some other translations render the phrase in question as reading “some of the Ammonites” (<em>MR, JP, Dy</em>), though this seems illogical since the Ammonites are already mentioned in the verse. <em>Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia</em> (ftn) and most modern translations (<em>Ro, Mo, AT, RS, JB</em>) regard the text as referring to the Meunim of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:26:7-14:26:7" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 26:7</a>. This view supposes that a scribal error resulted in the first two consonants (מע) of the Hebrew <em>Meʽu·nimʹ</em> being transposed, thus giving <em>ʽAm·moh·nimʹ.</em> This identification with the Meunim may find support in the fact that the remainder of the account of the fight against Jehoshaphat refers to “the mountainous region of Seir” (in place of “the Ammonim”) as joined with the Ammonite-Moabite forces. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:20:10-14:20:10" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2Ch 20:10,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:20:22-14:20:23" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 22, 23</a>) The translators of the <em>Septuagint</em> used the same Greek word (<em>Mi·naiʹon</em>) to render the Hebrew term at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:20:1-14:20:1" data-bid="4-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 20:1</a> as they did in the texts referring to the Meunim, showing that they understood them to be the same.​—See <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200003024/">MEUNIM</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Since the matter is not certain, however, some translations, such as that of Isaac Leeser and the <em>New World Translation,</em> prefer simply to transliterate the term into English, thereby retaining the wording found in the Masoretic text.</p>

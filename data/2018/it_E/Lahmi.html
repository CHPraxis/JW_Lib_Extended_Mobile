<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The brother of Goliath the Gittite. The account at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:20:5-13:20:5" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Chronicles 20:5</a> reads, in part, “Elhanan the son of Jair got to strike down Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite,” during a war with the Philistines. However, in a parallel text at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:21:19-10:21:19" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Samuel 21:19</a> the reading is: “Elhanan the son of Jaare-oregim the Bethlehemite got to strike down Goliath the Gittite.” In the latter text it appears that <em>ʼeth-lach·miʹ</em> (in English, “Lahmi,” the Hebrew term <em>ʼeth</em> merely denoting that Lahmi is the object of a verb) was misread by a copyist to be <em>behth hal·lach·miʹ</em> (“Bethlehemite”). Therefore the original probably read, “got to strike down Lahmi,” just as the parallel text at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:20:5-13:20:5" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Chronicles 20:5</a> reads. This would make the two texts harmonize on this point. Lahmi, then, was evidently the brother of the Goliath that David killed. On the other hand, it is possible that there were two Goliaths.​—See <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200001739/">GOLIATH</a>.</p>

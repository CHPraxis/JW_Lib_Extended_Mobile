SHILLEM
(Shilʹlem) [from a root meaning “make peace; compensate; repay”].
Last named of Naphtali’s four sons listed among “the names of Israel’s sons who came into Egypt.” (Ge 46:8, 24) He founded the tribal family of Shillemites. (Nu 26:49, 50) At 1 Chronicles 7:13 his name is spelled Shallum in the Masoretic text, though Shillem is found in seven Hebrew manuscripts.

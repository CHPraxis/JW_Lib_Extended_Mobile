<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A family or tribe that descended from Ham’s son Canaan. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:10:15-1:10:15" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ge 10:15,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:10:18-1:10:18" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:1:13-13:1:13" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> 1Ch 1:13,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:1:16-13:1:16" data-bid="1-4" class="b"> 16</a>) Mention of this Canaanite people between “Arvadite” (linked with Arvad off the Phoenician coast) and “Hamathite” (likely associated with Hamath in Syria) indicates that the Zemarites settled along the N Phoenician coast. According to an emendation, <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:27:8-26:27:8" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ezekiel 27:8</a> mentions “skilled [wise] men of Zemer” (<em>RS; BE</em>), suggested by some as the city of the Zemarites and tentatively identified with Tell Kazel, about 35 km (22 mi) NE of Tripoli. However, here the Hebrew text reads: “Your skilled ones [men], O Tyre.” (<em>AT; RS,</em> ftn) Pointing to another location, others would link the Zemarites with Sumra, a seacoast town between Tripoli and Arvad.</p>

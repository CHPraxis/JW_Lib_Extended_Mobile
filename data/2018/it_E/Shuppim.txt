SHUPPIM
(Shupʹpim).
1. A descendant of Benjamin, perhaps through Bela and Ir(i). (1Ch 7:6, 7, 12) The introduction of Shuppim into the genealogies of Manasseh in 1 Chronicles 7:15 may indicate some unusual intertribal relationship. In Genesis 46:21 Shuppim is called Muppim, possibly because of the similarity of the letters in the ancient Hebrew alphabet represented in English by sh and m. The name is also spelled Shephupha(m, n), and it identifies the individual as founder of a Benjamite tribal family of Shuphamites.​—Nu 26:39; 1Ch 8:5.
2. A gatekeeper appointed to the W of the sanctuary. (1Ch 26:16) Since the last three characters of his name in Hebrew (Shup·pimʹ) are identical to the last three characters of the previous term (behth ha·ʼasup·pimʹ), scholars suspect that it is a dittograph (an unintentional scribal repetition), therefore, in this verse, not the name of a person.​—Compare 1Ch 26:10, 11.

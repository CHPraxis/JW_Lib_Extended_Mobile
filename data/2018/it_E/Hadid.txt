HADID
(Haʹdid).
An ancestral city of certain Benjamites returning from Babylonian exile (Ezr 2:1, 2, 33; Ne 7:6, 7, 37; 11:31, 34), commonly identified with el-Haditheh (Tel Hadid), an abandoned Arab village about 5 km (3 mi) ENE of Lod (Lydda). It is generally thought that Hadid is probably the same as the “Huditi” mentioned in the Karnak List of Thutmose III, and the “Adida” in the Apocryphal book of First Maccabees (12:38; 13:13, RS, ecumenical edition), there described as being situated in the Shephelah and overlooking the coastal plain.

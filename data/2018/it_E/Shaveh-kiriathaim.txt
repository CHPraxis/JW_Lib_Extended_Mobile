SHAVEH-KIRIATHAIM
(Shaʹveh-kir·i·a·thaʹim) [Smoothed-Out Place of Kiriathaim].
Scene of Chedorlaomer’s victory over the Emim. (Ge 14:5) It was apparently the plain near or surrounding the city of Kiriathaim, E of the Jordan and later built or rebuilt by the Reubenites. (Nu 32:37; Jos 13:15, 19) Geographers tentatively place Kiriathaim near Quraiyat, about 10 km (6 mi) WNW of Dibon.

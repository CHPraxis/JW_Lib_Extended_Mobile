<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Probably a musical term, perhaps one of a technical nature, found in the superscriptions of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:53:0-19:53:0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalms 53</a> and <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:88:0-19:88:0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">88</a>. Some believe that this term may be related to a Hebrew root verb meaning “grow weak; fall sick,” thereby suggesting a gloomy and melancholy tune. This would harmonize with the somewhat somber content of the two songs, particularly that of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:88:0-19:88:18" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Psalm 88</a>.</p>

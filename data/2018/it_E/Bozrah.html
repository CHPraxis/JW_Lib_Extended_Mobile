<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><strong>1.</strong> A prominent city of Edom, the home of the father of Jobab, an Edomite king in the second millennium B.C.E. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:36:31-1:36:31" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ge 36:31,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:36:33-1:36:33" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 33;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:1:44-13:1:44" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> 1Ch 1:44</a>) Its prominence is evident from the fact that the prophets Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Amos under inspiration referred to it as representative of all Edom, due for desolation.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:34:5-23:34:6" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Isa 34:5, 6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:63:1-23:63:4" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 63:1-4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:49:12-24:49:13" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> Jer 49:12, 13,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:49:17-24:49:17" data-bid="2-4" class="b"> 17,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:49:22-24:49:22" data-bid="2-5" class="b"> 22;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/30:1:11-30:1:12" data-bid="2-6" class="b"> Am 1:11, 12</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Bozrah is identified with modern Buzera, located about 50 km (30 mi) NNE of Petra and situated near the ancient road called the King’s Highway. It thus occupied a fairly central position in the Edomite kingdom and guarded the approaches to the copper mines in the Arabah. The ancient ruins at Buzera show Bozrah to have been a fortified city built on a narrow spur jutting out from the Jebel esh-Sheraʼ with deep wadis on either side.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The rendering of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/33:2:12-33:2:12" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Micah 2:12</a> in the <em>King James Version</em> contains the name “Bozrah,” but most modern translations view this as referring, not to a town, but to an enclosure or pen for sheep.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><strong>2.</strong> In prophesying against Moab, <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:48:24-24:48:24" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Jeremiah 48:24</a> refers to Bozrah as among cities “of the land of Moab.” It is included among other cities of the tableland or “land of level country” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:48:21-24:48:21" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Jer 48:21</a>), and the use of this same Hebrew expression in connection with Bezer (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:4:43-5:4:43" data-bid="6-1" class="b">De 4:43</a>) has caused some scholars to view them as likely the same place.​—See <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200000723/">BEZER</a> No. 2.</p>

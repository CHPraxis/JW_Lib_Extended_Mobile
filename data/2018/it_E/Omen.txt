OMEN
Anything viewed as giving some indication about the future; a situation or occurrence thought of as portending good or evil. (Ge 30:27; Nu 24:1) Looking for omens, as a form of divination, was specifically prohibited by God’s law to Israel. (Le 19:26; De 18:10) But apostates like Judean King Manasseh did look for omens. (2Ki 17:17; 21:6) Since this practice is condemned in the Scriptures, evidently faithful Joseph’s comment about use of his silver cup to read omens was merely part of a ruse. (Ge 44:5, 15) By making the comment, Joseph represented himself, not as one having faith in Jehovah, but as an administrator of a land where false worship prevailed. He thus gave no hint of having anything in common with his brothers and kept his true identity concealed from them.​—See DIVINATION.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">(Beth-daʹgon) [House of Dagon].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><strong>1.</strong> A town in the allotment of territory assigned to the tribe of Judah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:15:21-6:15:21" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Jos 15:21,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:15:41-6:15:41" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 41</a>) Although it is listed along with other towns of the Shephelah or lowland region, the suggested location is on the Plains of Philistia at Khirbet Dajun, a short distance SW of modern Beit Dajan (Bet Dagan) and about 10 km (6 mi) SE of Tel Aviv-Yafo. In this regard, it may be noted that other cities of the Philistine plain are listed in subsequent verses. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:15:45-6:15:47" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Jos 15:45-47</a>) This would make it an enclave city within the territory of Dan, as was also apparently the case with Gederah.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:15:36-6:15:36" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Jos 15:36</a>.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">(Beʹzek).</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><strong>1.</strong> The site at which Judah and Simeon defeated 10,000 Canaanite and Perizzite troops under Adoni-bezek. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:1:3-7:1:7" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Jg 1:3-7</a>) Some identify this Bezek with that of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:11:8-9:11:8" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Samuel 11:8</a> (No. 2 below), which is in an extreme northern location in relation to Jerusalem and the territory occupied by Judah and Simeon. Such a view would require the assumption that Adoni-bezek came S to join other Canaanite forces but was met by Judah and Simeon, was chased N to Bezek, and was defeated there. The context, however, seems to indicate a place in the general area of Jerusalem. In view of these circumstances, Bezek, the city of Adoni-bezek, is tentatively located in the Shephelah region at the site of Khirbet Bezqa, about 5 km (3 mi) NE of Gezer.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><strong>2.</strong> The location where Saul assembled the sons of Israel and Judah to fight against the Ammonites who were camped against Jabesh in Gilead. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:11:8-9:11:11" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1Sa 11:8-11</a>) The fact that this place was no more than a night’s march from Jabesh substantiates the view that it was located at the modern site of Khirbet Ibziq, 21 km (13 mi) NE of Shechem. A mountain W of Khirbet Ibziq rises 713 m (2,339 ft) above sea level and may have provided a suitable place for Saul to gather his forces.</p>

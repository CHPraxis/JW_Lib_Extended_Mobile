(Nahʹshon) [from a root meaning “serpent”].
Wilderness chieftain of the tribe of Judah. Nahshon was the son of Amminadab and among the fifth-listed generation after Judah. (1Ch 2:3-10) His sister was Aaron’s wife. (Ex 6:23) Nahshon formed a link in the line of descent that led to David and Jesus, becoming father to Salmon, who married Rahab, and grandfather of Boaz, who, in turn, married Ruth.​—1Ch 2:11-15; Ru 4:20; Mt 1:4-6, 16; Lu 3:32.
As chieftain of Judah, the leading tribe of Israel, Nahshon assisted Moses with the first wilderness registration of fighting men. He presented a contribution to the tabernacle service when the altar was inaugurated, and he headed Judah’s army of 74,600 that led Israel’s line of march.​—Nu 1:2-7; 2:3, 4; 7:2, 11-17; 10:14.

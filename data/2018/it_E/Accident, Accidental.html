<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Unforeseen occurrences that result from ignorance, carelessness, or unavoidable events and that cause loss or injury are commonly called accidents. The Hebrew word <em>ʼa·sohnʹ</em> evidently literally means “a healing” and is used as a euphemism for “a fatal accident.” (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:42:4-1:42:4" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ge 42:4</a>, ftn.) The Hebrew <em>miq·rehʹ,</em> which is derived from a root that means “meet; befall” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:44:29-1:44:29" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ge 44:29;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:25:18-5:25:18" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> De 25:18</a>), is rendered not only “accident” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:6:9-9:6:9" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1Sa 6:9</a>) but also “eventuality” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:2:14-21:2:15" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ec 2:14, 15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:3:19-21:3:19" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 3:19</a>) and “by chance.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/8:2:3-8:2:3" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ru 2:3</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Jacob feared that a fatal accident might befall his beloved son Benjamin if allowed to go to Egypt with his brothers. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:42:4-1:42:4" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ge 42:4,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:42:38-1:42:38" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 38</a>) The Philistines returned the ark of Jehovah to prove whether the plague of piles they suffered really was from Jehovah or was just “an accident.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:6:9-9:6:9" data-bid="7-1" class="b">1Sa 6:9</a>) Solomon recognized that anyone may become a victim of unforeseen occurrence.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:9:11-21:9:11" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Ec 9:11</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The Mosaic Law differentiated between an accident that proved fatal and one that was not. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:21:22-2:21:25" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ex 21:22-25</a>) It also distinguished between killing intentionally and unintentionally. For deliberate murder, capital punishment was mandatory; for those guilty of accidental homicide, cities of refuge were set up. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:35:11-4:35:25" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Nu 35:11-25,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:35:31-4:35:31" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> 31</a>; see <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200000979/">CITIES OF REFUGE</a>.) The law applied equally to native Israelite and alien resident, and instructions for the necessary sacrifices to atone for accidental or unintentional sins were provided.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:4:1-3:4:35" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Le 4:1-35;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:5:14-3:5:19" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 5:14-19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:15:22-4:15:29" data-bid="11-3" class="b"> Nu 15:22-29</a>.</p>

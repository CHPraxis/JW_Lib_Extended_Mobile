<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A tree whose wood Noah used in the construction of the ark but which cannot be identified with any degree of certainty. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:6:14-1:6:14" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ge 6:14</a>) The <em>King James Version</em> simply transliterates the Hebrew name. On the basis of the similarity between the Hebrew name and the Hebrew term for “tar” (“pitch,” <em>KJ;</em> Heb., <em>koʹpher</em>) some relate it to some kind of resinous tree. Scholars generally favor the cypress, which is a very durable tree, extremely resistant to decay.​—See <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200001099/">CYPRESS</a>.</p>

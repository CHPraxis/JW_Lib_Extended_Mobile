ACHSHAPH
(Achʹshaph) [Place of Practicing Sorcery].
A royal city of Canaan whose king responded to the call of Jabin, king of Hazor, and joined the encampment of kings at the waters of Merom to fight against Israel. (Jos 11:1, 5) He was killed in the battle that followed. (Jos 12:7, 20) The city of Achshaph was later included in the territory assigned as an inheritance to the tribe of Asher.​—Jos 19:25.
Some scholars propose identifying Achshaph with Tell Kisan (Tel Kison), a site about 10 km (6 mi) SE of Acco (Acre). However, others favor Khirbet el-Harbaj (Tel Regev) about 11 km (7 mi) SE of Haifa.

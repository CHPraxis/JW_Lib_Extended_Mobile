ARVADITE
(Arʹvad·ite) [Of (Belonging to) Arvad].
A member of the family descended from Ham through Canaan and that evidently inhabited Arvad, an island just off the northern coast of Syria. (Ge 10:6, 15, 18; 1Ch 1:16) The only other mention of them is Ezekiel’s reference to Arvadites as being skilled sailors and valiant soldiers for Tyre.​—Eze 27:8, 11.

BEZEK
(Beʹzek).
1. The site at which Judah and Simeon defeated 10,000 Canaanite and Perizzite troops under Adoni-bezek. (Jg 1:3-7) Some identify this Bezek with that of 1 Samuel 11:8 (No. 2 below), which is in an extreme northern location in relation to Jerusalem and the territory occupied by Judah and Simeon. Such a view would require the assumption that Adoni-bezek came S to join other Canaanite forces but was met by Judah and Simeon, was chased N to Bezek, and was defeated there. The context, however, seems to indicate a place in the general area of Jerusalem. In view of these circumstances, Bezek, the city of Adoni-bezek, is tentatively located in the Shephelah region at the site of Khirbet Bezqa, about 5 km (3 mi) NE of Gezer.
2. The location where Saul assembled the sons of Israel and Judah to fight against the Ammonites who were camped against Jabesh in Gilead. (1Sa 11:8-11) The fact that this place was no more than a night’s march from Jabesh substantiates the view that it was located at the modern site of Khirbet Ibziq, 21 km (13 mi) NE of Shechem. A mountain W of Khirbet Ibziq rises 713 m (2,339 ft) above sea level and may have provided a suitable place for Saul to gather his forces.

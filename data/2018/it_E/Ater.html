It may be a descendant of this Ater who was one of the headmen of the people attesting by seal the “trustworthy arrangement” of Nehemiah’s day.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:9:38-16:9:38" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ne 9:38;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:10:1-16:10:1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 10:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:10:17-16:10:17" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> 17</a>.</p>

GOD OF GOOD LUCK, GOD OF DESTINY
The apostate Jews in the time of Isaiah were involved in worshiping “the god of Good Luck” (Heb., gadh) and “the god of Destiny” (Heb., meniʹ). The worshipers of these deities set a table of food and drink before them. Jehovah said to such worshipers that he would destine them to slaughter by the sword.​—Isa 65:11, 12.
The Assyrians and Babylonians frequently prepared food and drink for their gods. People in Haran made vows and hoped to be accepted by the “Lord of Luck.” In his comment on Isaiah 65:11, Jerome wrote that “in all cities, and especially in Egypt and Alexandria, there was an ancient idolatrous custom, that on the last day of the final month of their year they would spread a table covered with various kinds of foods, and a cup mixed with sweet wine, ensuring good luck for the fertility either of the past or the coming year.”​—Corpus Christianorum, Series Latina, LXXIII A, S. Hieronymi presbyteri opera, Pars 1, 2A, Turnhout, Belgium, 1963, p. 754.

Judges Deliver Israel From Oppression




THE book of Judges is a thrilling record of the exploits of men of faith who were raised up by Jehovah to deliver Israel from oppression. The oppressors came from various directions; the areas where the Judges were active were not always the same. But, regardless of how powerful the enemy was, when Israel humbly repented of their bad practices and truly trusted in Jehovah, the Judge would deliver them. This Bible book gives a foregleam of the greater deliverance that God will provide for his servants by means of his Son.

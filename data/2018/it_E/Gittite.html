<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">(Gitʹtite) [Of (Belonging to) Gath].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A term often applied to an inhabitant or native of the Philistine city of Gath. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:13:2-6:13:3" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Jos 13:2, 3</a>) Giant Goliath was a Gittite.

<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The term “Gittite,” however, is also applied to Obed-edom, in whose home the ark of the covenant temporarily rested. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:6:10-10:6:11" data-bid="4-1" class="b">2Sa 6:10, 11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:13:13-13:13:13" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 1Ch 13:13</a>) Some scholars believe he similarly was from Philistine Gath. It seems more likely, however, that Obed-edom was a Levite and may have been called a Gittite because he came from the Levite city of Gath-rimmon.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:21:20-6:21:20" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Jos 21:20,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:21:23-6:21:24" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 23, 24</a>; see <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200003291/">OBED-EDOM</a> No. 1.</p>

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><strong>1.</strong> A settlement of Simeonites within the territory of Judah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:4:24-13:4:24" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1Ch 4:24,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:4:32-13:4:32" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 32</a>) Its location is uncertain, although some connect it with Tell ʽEitum (Tel ʽAitun), centrally located in Judah’s territory about 44 km (27 mi) W of En-gedi and the same distance SW of Jerusalem.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><strong>2.</strong> The crag Etam, where Samson lived after burning the Philistines’ fields. From this crag, 3,000 men of Judah took him, willingly bound, back to the Philistines. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:15:8-7:15:13" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Jg 15:8-13</a>) Whereas no positive identification for the crag Etam is possible, a connection with the town (No. 3 below) cannot be altogether eliminated. However, just 4 km (2.5 mi) ESE of the suggested site of Samson’s hometown Zorah (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:13:2-7:13:2" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Jg 13:2</a>) is ʽAraq Ismaʽin, an isolated crag with a lofty cavern affording a broad view of the Shephelah below. Appropriate to the meaning of the name, this may possibly be the site of the crag Etam.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><strong>3.</strong> A town of Judah located probably at Khirbet el-Khokh, on a hill about 2.5 km (1.5 mi) SW of Bethlehem. Apparently Etam and Bethlehem had been settled by close relatives. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:4:3-13:4:4" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1Ch 4:3, 4</a>; see <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200000463/">ATROTH-BETH-JOAB</a>.) According to Josephus, King Solomon often took a morning chariot ride from Jerusalem those 13 km (8 mi) out to Etan (Etam), where there were gardens and streams. (<em>Jewish Antiquities,</em> VIII, 186 [vii, 3]) Etam was rebuilt and fortified by Solomon’s successor Rehoboam. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:11:5-14:11:6" data-bid="5-1" class="b">2Ch 11:5, 6</a>) According to the Talmud, an aqueduct linked Jerusalem with a spring to the W of Etam.​—Babylonian Talmud, <em>Yoma</em> 31<em>a;</em> Palestinian (Jerusalem) Talmud, <em>Yoma</em> 41<em>a.</em></p>

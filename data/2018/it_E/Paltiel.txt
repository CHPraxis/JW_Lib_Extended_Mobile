1. Representative of Issachar at the time the tribes divided the Promised Land into inheritance portions; son of Azzan.​—Nu 34:17, 18, 26.
2. Son of Laish from Gallim. Saul, after outlawing David, took his daughter Michal, David’s wife, and gave her in marriage to Palti (Paltiel). (1Sa 25:44) After becoming king, David demanded of Abner and Ish-bosheth that Michal be returned to him. This greatly grieved Paltiel, who followed her, weeping, until Abner ordered him to go home.​—2Sa 3:13-16.

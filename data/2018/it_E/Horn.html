<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Animal horns were used in Israel as vessels for oil, as drinking flasks, as inkhorns and containers for cosmetics, and as musical or signaling instruments.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:16:1-9:16:1" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1Sa 16:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:16:13-9:16:13" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:1:39-11:1:39" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> 1Ki 1:39;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:9:2-26:9:2" data-bid="1-4" class="b"> Eze 9:2</a>; see <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200003876/">SECRETARY’S INKHORN</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><strong>Musical and Signaling Instruments.</strong> The Hebrew word <em>qeʹren</em> is the general designation for an animal’s horn. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:22:13-1:22:13" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ge 22:13</a>) It is used once to refer to a wind instrument, namely, in the expression “horn [Heb., <em>qeʹren</em>] of the ram” in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:6:5-6:6:5" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Joshua 6:5</a>. This expression is put in parallel with the Hebrew word <em>shoh·pharʹ</em> (horn), a term always referring to a ram’s horn used as a musical instrument. The modern <em>shoh·pharʹ</em> is a hollow ram’s horn about 36 cm (14 in.) long, straightened by heat but curved upward at the bell end. It has a separate mouthpiece to facilitate blowing. The <em>shoh·pharʹ</em> of Bible times, it is thought, had no separate mouthpiece, and according to the Talmud, the ram’s horn was not straightened but left crooked.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The <em>shoh·pharʹ</em> was basically used as a signaling instrument. It assembled the Israelite forces, sometimes sounded the “alarm signal” against a city to be attacked, and directed other maneuvers in warfare. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:3:27-7:3:27" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Jg 3:27;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:6:34-7:6:34" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 6:34;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:2:28-10:2:28" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> 2Sa 2:28;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/29:2:1-29:2:1" data-bid="4-4" class="b"> Joe 2:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/36:1:16-36:1:16" data-bid="4-5" class="b"> Zep 1:16</a>) In case of enemy attack, the <em>shoh·pharʹ</em> gave warning. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:4:18-16:4:20" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ne 4:18-20</a>) Being just a signaling instrument in battle, the sound of 300 of these horns would, under normal circumstances, indicate an army of considerable size. So when the Midianites heard the horns blown by everyone in Gideon’s band of 300 men, “the whole camp got on the run,” terror stricken.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:7:15-7:7:22" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Jg 7:15-22</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">In addition to the horn’s announcing every new moon, it proclaimed the year of Jubilee and added to the joyful spirit of other occasions. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:81:3-19:81:3" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ps 81:3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:25:8-3:25:10" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> Le 25:8-10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:6:15-10:6:15" data-bid="7-3" class="b"> 2Sa 6:15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:15:14-14:15:14" data-bid="7-4" class="b"> 2Ch 15:14</a>) When Jehovah stated the terms of the Law covenant, the miraculous sound of a horn was one of the features of the spectacle at Mount Sinai. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:19:16-2:19:19" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Ex 19:16-19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:20:18-2:20:18" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 20:18</a>) To proclaim the beginning and the end of the Sabbath with the <em>shoh·pharʹ</em> appears to have been a custom established before the Common Era.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Israelites of all stations seemed to know how to use the <em>shoh·pharʹ.</em> The priests blew it when marching around Jericho and likely were the ones who announced the Jubilee with it.

<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><strong>Horns of Altars.</strong> The horns of both the incense altar and the altar of sacrifice at the tabernacle were hornlike projections extending outward from the four corners. They were overlaid with the same material as the altar, either copper or gold.

<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb"><strong>Figurative Usage.</strong> An animal’s horn (Heb., <em>qeʹren;</em> Gr., <em>keʹras</em>) is a formidable weapon and Biblically was used quite often in a figurative sense, especially in the Hebrew Scriptures. Rulers and ruling dynasties, both the righteous and the wicked, were symbolized by horns, and their achieving of conquests was likened to pushing with the horns.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:33:17-5:33:17" data-bid="22-1" class="b">De 33:17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:7:24-27:7:24" data-bid="22-2" class="b"> Da 7:24;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:8:2-27:8:10" data-bid="22-3" class="b"> 8:2-10,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:8:20-27:8:24" data-bid="22-4" class="b"> 20-24;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/38:1:18-38:1:21" data-bid="22-5" class="b"> Zec 1:18-21;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:1:69-42:1:71" data-bid="22-6" class="b"> Lu 1:69-71;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:13:1-66:13:1" data-bid="22-7" class="b"> Re 13:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:13:11-66:13:11" data-bid="22-8" class="b"> 11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:17:3-66:17:3" data-bid="22-9" class="b"> 17:3,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:17:12-66:17:12" data-bid="22-10" class="b"> 12</a>; see <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200000591/">BEASTS, SYMBOLIC</a>.</p>

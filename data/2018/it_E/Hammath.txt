HAMMATH
(Hamʹmath).
1. “The father” of the house of Rechab and an ancestor of certain Kenites.​—1Ch 2:55.
2. [Place of a Hot (Spring)]. A fortified city of Naphtali. (Jos 19:32, 35) It is generally identified with Hammam Tabariyeh (Hame Teveriya), just S of Tiberias on the W side of the Sea of Galilee. The sulfurous spring there apparently gave Hammath its name. If, as most scholars believe, Hammoth-dor (Jos 21:32) and Hammon (1Ch 6:76) are alternate names for the same location, Hammath also functioned as a Levite city.

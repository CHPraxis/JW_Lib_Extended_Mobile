ABEL-KERAMIM
(Aʹbel-kerʹa·mim) [Watercourse of the Vineyards].
The most distant point to which Jephthah pursued the Ammonites in their defeat. (Jg 11:33) It is generally held to be situated between Heshbon and Rabbah, or Rabbah Ammon (modern ʽAmman). It is generally identified today with Khirbet es-Suq, about 8 km (5 mi) S of Rabbah (ʽAmman), which possibly fits Eusebius’ description. (Onomasticon, 32, 15-16) Some recommend Naʽur, about 14 km (9 mi) SW of Rabbah Ammon as the probable location.

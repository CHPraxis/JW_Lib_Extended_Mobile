AHIJAH
(A·hiʹjah) [Jehovah Is (My) Brother].
1. The fifth-named son of Jerahmeel, of the tribe of Judah.​—1Ch 2:25.
2. A family head in the tribe of Benjamin. (1Ch 8:6, 7) Some think he is the same as Ahoah in verse 4.
3. Son of Ahitub and great-grandson of Eli. He served as high priest in Shiloh when Saul was king. (1Sa 14:3, 18) Some suggest that he was either a brother of Ahimelech or, by substituting “melech” for “jah” in his name, was Ahimelech.​—1Sa 22:9.
4. One of the mighty men in David’s army, a Pelonite.​—1Ch 11:36.
5. A Levite appointed over the treasures of Jehovah’s house in David’s reign.​—1Ch 26:20.
6. Son of Shisha. He and his brother Elihoreph were Solomon’s princely secretaries.​—1Ki 4:2, 3.
7. A prophet of Jehovah residing in Shiloh who foretold how Solomon’s kingdom would be split. Ripping a new garment into 12 parts, Ahijah gave 10 pieces to Jeroboam, promising that if Jeroboam proved faithful, Jehovah would build him “a lasting house.” (1Ki 11:29-39; 12:15; 2Ch 10:15) After years of wicked rule Jeroboam sent his wife to inquire of Ahijah concerning the welfare of his sick son. The prophet, now old and blind, foretold that the boy would soon die and that Jehovah would “make a clean sweep behind the house of Jeroboam, just as one clears away the dung.” (1Ki 14:2-18; 15:29) “The prophecy of Ahijah,” one of the written records including Solomon’s affairs, survived to the time of Ezra’s compilation of Chronicles.​—2Ch 9:29.
8. Father of Baasha, who conspired against Nadab and made himself king of Israel; of the tribe of Issachar.​—1Ki 15:27, 33; 2Ki 9:9.
9. One of the 44 heads of the people whose descendant, if not he himself, joined in sealing Nehemiah’s “trustworthy arrangement” to walk in Jehovah’s laws.​—Ne 10:26; 9:38.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">The price that the Philistines charged the Israelites for sharpening various metal implements. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:13:20-9:13:21" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1Sa 13:20, 21</a>) The pim apparently was a weight. Several stone weights found in Palestinian excavations bear the consonants of “pim” in ancient Hebrew characters; these vary from 7.18 to 8.13 g (0.231 to 0.261 oz t). On this basis the pim would be approximately two thirds of a shekel.</p>

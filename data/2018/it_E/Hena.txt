HENA
(Heʹna).
A city or region listed with Sepharvaim and Ivvah and conquered by the Assyrians. (2Ki 18:34; 19:13; Isa 37:13) The Greek Septuagint here uses A·na, the name of a town on the middle course of the Euphrates River. Some scholars, however, consider it more likely that Hena, along with Sepharvaim and Ivvah, lay in Syria.

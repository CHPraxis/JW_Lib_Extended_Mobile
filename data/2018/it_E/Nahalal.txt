NAHALAL
(Na·halʹal) [Watering Place; Pasture].
A city in Zebulun assigned to the Merarite Levites. (Jos 19:10, 14, 15; 21:34, 35) It was also called Nahalol. Instead of driving out the Canaanites inhabiting this city as divinely instructed, the Zebulunites subjected them to forced labor. (Jg 1:30; 2:2) The site of Nahalal is uncertain.

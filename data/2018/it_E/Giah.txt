GIAH
(Giʹah) [Bursting Forth; Gushing].
A site near “the hill of Ammah” mentioned in describing the pursuit of Abner by Joab and Abishai. (2Sa 2:24) The context suggests to some that Giah was E of Gibeon in Benjamin’s territory. Certain scholars have proposed sites based on textual emendation, but Giah’s exact location remains unknown.​—See AMMAH.

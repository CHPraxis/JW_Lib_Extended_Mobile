<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">The officer, second in dignity to the high priest (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:4:1-44:4:1" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ac 4:1</a>), who had charge over the officiating priesthood and the Levites who were organized under lesser captains to guard the temple in Jerusalem and to keep order. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:22:4-42:22:4" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Lu 22:4,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:22:52-42:22:52" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 52</a>) There were 24 divisions of the Levites, which divisions served a week at a time in rotation, twice a year. Each division likely also had a captain over it, with several captains of smaller groups.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The captains were men of influence. They conspired with the chief priests in hiring Judas to betray Jesus. They brought their forces along with the priests to arrest Jesus. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:22:3-42:22:4" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Lu 22:3, 4,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:22:52-42:22:52" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 52</a>) It was the temple captain who lent official flavor to the arrest of Peter and John in the temple.

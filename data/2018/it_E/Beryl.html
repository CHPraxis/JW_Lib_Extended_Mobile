<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A translucent or opaque mineral composed of a silicate of aluminum and beryllium. It is harder than quartz and is usually yellow green, but sometimes it is green, yellow, blue, white, pale red, or colorless. Dark-green beryl is classed as emerald, the blue-green is aquamarine, and the rose variety is called morganite. Beryl is found normally in granitic rocks in the form of six-sided crystals. Individual beryl crystals weighing over 25 tons have been discovered.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Beryl was a very popular gemstone in ancient times. The Greeks made fine intaglios from it, and the Romans worked the natural crystals into ear pendants. Beryl (Gr., <em>beʹryl·los</em>) is mentioned once in the Scriptures (<em>NW, NE, RS</em>), it being the eighth foundation of the wall of New Jerusalem.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:2-66:21:2" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Re 21:2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:19-66:21:20" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 19, 20</a>.</p>

ABIASAPH
(A·biʹa·saph) [(My) Father Has Gathered].
One of the three sons of Korah the Levite, and a descendant of Kohath. (Ex 6:16-24) His brothers were Elkanah and Assir. He is apparently referred to as Ebiasaph at 1 Chronicles 6:37 and perhaps at 1 Chronicles 9:19 and 1 Chronicles 6:23.
It appears that Korah’s sons did not join their father in his rebellion, along with Dathan and Abiram, against Moses and Aaron. Hence, these sons did not die with their father at that time. (Nu 26:9-11) Thus, at a later period, we find reference made to “the sons of Korah” in the superscriptions of many of the Psalms (42, 44-49, 84, 85, 87, 88), although this term has, basically, the meaning of “the descendants of Korah,” or “the house of Korah.”

<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><strong>Father’s Authority and Responsibilities.</strong> As described in the Bible, the father was the head of the household, being guardian, protector, the one making final decisions, and the judge of the family group.

If the son married and set up an independent household, then he became head over it, although due respect was still shown toward the father.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:30:3-4:30:8" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Nu 30:3-8</a>) In Bible times the father usually arranged for the marriage of his children.

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><strong>Genealogical Use of Father’s Name.</strong> Ancestry of a man was customarily traced back through the father, not through the mother. Thus, whereas there seems to be sound reason for believing that Luke presents Jesus’ genealogy through his mother (an exception to the general rule), Luke does not list her. Apparently he lists her husband Joseph as the son of Heli, evidently Mary’s father. This would not be improper in the least, since Joseph would be Heli’s son-in-law.​—See <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200001647/">GENEALOGY OF JESUS CHRIST</a>.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">In the absence of family names (surnames), a man was regularly distinguished by being referred to as the son of “So-and-so.” For example, Isaac was called “the son of Abraham.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:25:19-1:25:19" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Ge 25:19</a>) Many Hebrew names included the Hebrew <em>ben</em> or Aramaic <em>bar,</em> “son,” followed by the name of the father as a surname, such as “Ben-hur” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:4:8-11:4:8" data-bid="34-1" class="b">1Ki 4:8</a>, <em>RS;</em> “the son of Hur,” <em>NW</em>) and “Simon Bar-jonah,” or “Simon son of Jonah.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:16:17-40:16:17" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Mt 16:17</a>, <em>KJ, NW.</em></p>

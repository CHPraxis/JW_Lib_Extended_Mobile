BETH-TAPPUAH
(Beth-tapʹpu·ah) [House of the Apple [Tree]].
A city in the hill country near Hebron and part of Judah’s territorial inheritance. (Jos 15:20, 48, 53) Some suggest that it received its name from the Judean named Tappuah (1Ch 2:42, 43); however, it is also possible that Beth-tappuah was named after the apple trees that likely once grew there in abundance. It is identified today with modern Taffuh, about 6 km (3.5 mi) WNW of Hebron.

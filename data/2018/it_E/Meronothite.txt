MERONOTHITE
(Me·ronʹo·thite).
A designation applied to Jehdeiah and Jadon, apparently identifying them as inhabitants of Meronoth. (1Ch 27:30; Ne 3:7) Some scholars believe that Meronoth was located near Gibeah, but its exact location is otherwise unknown. Others tentatively identify it with Beituniya, less than 5 km (3 mi) NNW of Gibeon.

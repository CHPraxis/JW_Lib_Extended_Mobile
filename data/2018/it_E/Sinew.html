<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A tendon of the body. Man is said to be woven together with bones and sinews.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:10:11-18:10:11" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Job 10:11</a>; see also <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:40:15-18:40:18" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Job 40:15-18</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">During Jacob’s grappling with an angel, the angel touched the socket of Jacob’s thigh joint, causing it to get out of place. The account written later by Moses says: “That is why the sons of Israel are not accustomed to eat the sinew of the thigh nerve, which is on the socket of the thigh joint, down to this [Moses’] day, because he touched the socket of Jacob’s thigh joint by the sinew of the thigh nerve.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:32:32-1:32:32" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ge 32:32</a>) Many Jews still adhere to this custom, removing the sciatic nerve together with arteries and tendons before eating the animal. This precept is considered by some Jewish commentators a reminder of God’s providence to Israel as exemplified in the experience of the patriarch Jacob, father of the 12 tribes.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><strong>Figurative Use.</strong> In a figurative sense the Israelites were said to have a neck as “an iron sinew,” meaning that they were rigid, stubborn, stiff-necked. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:48:4-23:48:4" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Isa 48:4</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:32:9-2:32:9" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ex 32:9</a>.) God’s spiritual revival of his people was pictured by the bringing together of bones and the putting of flesh and sinews upon them.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:37:6-26:37:8" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Eze 37:6-8</a>.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">An object such as a pole or pile of stones, usually in a form suggesting a human figure, arranged in a field in such a way as to frighten away birds or other animals. Jeremiah likened the idols of the nations to “a scarecrow [Heb., <em>toʹmer</em>] of a cucumber field.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:10:5-24:10:5" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Jer 10:5</a>) The word <em>toʹmer</em> is elsewhere rendered “palm tree.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:4:5-7:4:5" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Jg 4:5</a>) Truly the idols of the nations amounted to no more than a scarecrow, a falsity.​—<em>AT, Mo, NE, NW, RS.</em></p>

EL-PARAN
(El-paʹran) [Big Tree of Paran].
Apparently the southernmost point reached by Chedorlaomer and his allies in their invasion of Canaan. (Ge 14:5, 6) Its description as “at the wilderness” or, “on the border of the wilderness” (RS), appears to place it on the eastern edge of “the wilderness of Paran.” (Ge 21:21) Some scholars consider El-paran to be an ancient name for Elath.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A valley where, on two occasions, the Israelites defeated the Edomites. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:8:13-10:8:13" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2Sa 8:13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:14:7-12:14:7" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 2Ki 14:7</a>) Its precise location is uncertain, but scholars have generally recommended either of two locations, one near Beer-sheba and the other to the S of the Salt Sea.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">East from Beer-sheba in the Negeb is a valley the Arabic name of which (Wadi el-Milh) means Valley of Salt. The location is one where Judeans from the N and Edomites coming from the SE might conceivably meet in combat. However, some scholars, preferring a location in Edom’s territory, identify the Scriptural Valley of Salt with a plain SSW of the Salt Sea. At present, the lowland S of the Salt Sea is quite marshy and hardly a location that would be chosen for a battle. But, since the level of the Salt Sea has risen, the plain may have been more firm at the time the battles occurred, or the fighting could have begun in a portion of the valley where the ground was not marshy. After the second conflict, 10,000 Edomites were hurled to their deaths from a crag, but the location of that crag is not stated.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:25:11-14:25:12" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2Ch 25:11, 12</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">In the first battle, David and Joab (evidently with Abishai in charge of at least some of the troops) struck down 18,000 Edomites in the Valley of Salt.

ABI-ALBON
(Aʹbi-alʹbon).
A Benjamite and an outstanding warrior listed among 37 of King David’s most valiant fighters. (2Sa 23:31) He is evidently the Abiel referred to in a parallel passage at 1 Chronicles 11:32. He is called the Arbathite, perhaps because of coming from the city of Beth-arabah, which lay near the frontier between Benjamin and Judah above the N end of the Dead Sea. (Jos 15:6; 18:21, 22) His fighting valor was in accord with Jacob’s deathbed prophecy concerning the tribe of Benjamin.​—Ge 49:27.

HEMAN
(Heʹman).
1. One of four wise men whose wisdom, though great, was surpassed by that of King Solomon. Heman, Calcol, and Darda are designated as “the sons of Mahol,” an expression thought by some to refer to an association of dancers or musicians. (1Ki 4:31) At 1 Chronicles 2:3-6 Heman is identified as a descendant of Judah through Zerah. In the superscription to Psalm 88 he is called an “Ezrahite,” which apparently is simply another word for “Zerahite.”​—See EZRAHITE.
2. Son of Joel and grandson of the prophet Samuel of the family of Kohathites; a Levite singer and cymbalist during the reigns of David and Solomon. (1Ch 6:33; 15:17-19; 2Ch 5:11, 12) The father of 14 sons and 3 daughters, he led his family in song at the house of Jehovah. However, he himself, along with Asaph and Jeduthun, was under the immediate control of the king.​—1Ch 25:1, 4-6.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Jehovah God as the Creator of the universe has the supreme sovereignty. As acknowledged by the ancient nation of Israel, so he is to the universe, namely, Judge, Statute-Giver, and King. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:33:22-23:33:22" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Isa 33:22</a>) The family head Abraham acknowledged him as “Judge of all the earth.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:18:25-1:18:25" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ge 18:25</a>) Jehovah portrays himself as Supreme Judge in a legal case against Israel (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/33:6:2-33:6:2" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Mic 6:2</a>), also in a legal case in behalf of his people against the nations.

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><strong>Patriarchal Society.</strong> After the Flood, Noah emerged as the family head or patriarch, and God made a covenant with him and his sons as representatives of the human race. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:9:12-1:9:16" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ge 9:12-16</a>) Noah also received basic laws in addition to what God had stated previously. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:9:3-1:9:6" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ge 9:3-6</a>) As patriarch, Noah made decisions that affected not only his immediate household but also his married sons and their offspring.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:9:20-1:9:27" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Ge 9:20-27</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The family head was judge of the family, which included the slaves and all those living under the household of the family head, just as Jehovah God is the great family Head and Judge. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:38:24-1:38:24" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ge 38:24</a>) Disputes between families were settled between family heads when it was possible to settle them peaceably.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Jacob acted as judge for those in his household when Laban brought accusations that his teraphim had been stolen by someone in Jacob’s camp. Jacob said: “Whoever it is with whom you may find your gods, let him not live.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:31:32-1:31:32" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ge 31:32</a>) However, Jacob did not know that Rachel had taken them, and Laban did not find them, so Rachel was not accused. When Joseph’s brothers had sold him into Egypt and presented Joseph’s blood-soaked garment to make it appear that he had been killed by a wild beast, Jacob sat in judgment, examined the evidence, and made a judicial decision: “Joseph is surely torn to pieces!” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:37:33-1:37:33" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Ge 37:33</a>) Judah sat in judgment when he found that Tamar was pregnant, sentencing her to be put to death. But when he found that she had maneuvered him into performing that which he legally should have caused his son Shelah to perform, he pronounced Tamar more righteous than himself.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:38:24-1:38:26" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Ge 38:24-26</a>.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Among the worshipers of the true God, Jehovah was always acknowledged as the Supreme Judge. The family head as judge was reckoned as accountable to God, who himself sat in judgment in the cases of Adam and Eve (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:3:8-1:3:24" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Ge 3:8-24</a>); of Cain (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:4:9-1:4:15" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Ge 4:9-15</a>); of humankind at the time of the Flood (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:6:1-1:6:3" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Ge 6:1-3,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:6:11-1:6:13" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> 11-13,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:6:17-1:6:21" data-bid="15-3" class="b"> 17-21</a>); of the builders of the Tower of Babel (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:11:1-1:11:9" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Ge 11:1-9</a>); of Sodom and Gomorrah (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:18:20-1:18:33" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Ge 18:20-33</a>); and of Abimelech (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:20:3-1:20:7" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Ge 20:3-7</a>).</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><strong>Under the Law.</strong> With the Exodus of the Israelites from Egypt, Moses as Jehovah’s representative became judge. At first he was trying to handle all the cases, which were so numerous that he was busy from morning to evening. On the counsel of Jethro he appointed capable men as chiefs of thousands, of hundreds, of fifties, and of tens. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:18:13-2:18:26" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Ex 18:13-26</a>) It does not appear that this meant that there was one specially appointed judge for every seven or eight able-bodied males. Rather, the nation was organized with chiefs authorized to handle smaller cases whenever necessary. But anything unusually complicated or difficult, or a matter of national importance, was to be brought to Moses or to the sanctuary before the priests.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">These hard matters for judgment included the following: Where the husband was suspicious of the chastity of his wife (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:5:11-4:5:31" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Nu 5:11-31</a>), a case of bloodshed where there was a dispute (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:17:8-5:17:9" data-bid="21-1" class="b">De 17:8, 9</a>), and certain cases where revolt was charged against a man but where the evidence was unclear or suspicious (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:19:15-5:19:20" data-bid="22-1" class="b">De 19:15-20</a>).

<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">There were no regular provisions for appeal from the lower courts to the higher, but if the chiefs of tens could not decide a case they could refer it to the chiefs of fifties, and so on, or directly to the sanctuary or to Moses.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:18:26-2:18:26" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Ex 18:26;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:1:17-5:1:17" data-bid="24-2" class="b"> De 1:17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:17:8-5:17:11" data-bid="24-3" class="b"> 17:8-11</a>.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">The men selected as judges were to be capable, trustworthy men, fearing Jehovah, hating unjust profit. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:18:21-2:18:21" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Ex 18:21</a>) They were generally family heads or heads of tribes, older men of the city in which they acted as judges.

<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">Since the judges were to be upright men, judging according to Jehovah’s law, they represented Jehovah.

Also, the publicity that would be afforded any trial at the gate would tend to influence the judges toward care and justice in the trial proceedings and in their decisions.

<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">The Sanhedrin was the Jewish high court. It was located in Jerusalem. Seventy-one members constituted this high court called the Great Sanhedrin. In the time of Jesus’ earthly ministry the 71 members included the high priest and others who had held the office of high priest (a number of such might be living at one time, for the office had become an appointive one under Roman rule). It also included members of the high priestly families, older men, the heads of the tribes and families, and scribes, men versed in the Law.

<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">According to the Tosefta (<em>Sanhedrin</em> 7:1) and the Mishnah (<em>Sanhedrin</em> 4:1), the Sanhedrin sat from the time of the offering of the daily morning sacrifice until the evening sacrifice. It did not sit in judgment on the Sabbath or on feast days. In capital cases the Sanhedrin held trial during the daytime, and the verdict had to be reached during the daytime. If it was a verdict of conviction, it had to be issued on the following day. Therefore, trials could not be held on the eve of a Sabbath or on the eve of a festival day. However, this procedure was ignored in the case of Jesus’ trial.</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">The Mishnah (<em>Sanhedrin</em> 4:3) states: “The Sanhedrin was arranged like the half of a round threshing-floor so that they all might see one another. Before them stood the two scribes of the judges, one to the right and one to the left, and <span id="page519" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="519" data-before-text="519"></span>they wrote down the words of them that favoured acquittal and the words of them that favoured conviction.”​—Translated by H. Danby.</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">According to Jewish tradition the Sanhedrin was set up by Moses (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:11:16-4:11:25" data-bid="55-1" class="b">Nu 11:16-25</a>) and reorganized by Ezra immediately after the return from the exile. But there is no historical evidence to support the idea that 70 older men sat as a single court to hear cases in those early times. Rather, the Sanhedrin seems to have come into existence during the time of Greek rule in Palestine. In the time of Jesus’ earthly ministry the Roman government allowed the Sanhedrin a great measure of independence, granting it civil and administrative authority. It had officers at its disposal as well as the power of arrest and imprisonment. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:26:47-40:26:47" data-bid="56-1" class="b">Mt 26:47;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:4:1-44:4:3" data-bid="56-2" class="b"> Ac 4:1-3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:9:1-44:9:2" data-bid="56-3" class="b"> 9:1, 2</a>) Its religious authority was recognized even among the Jews of the Dispersion. (See <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:9:1-44:9:2" data-bid="57-1" class="b">Ac 9:1, 2</a>.) However, under the Roman rule the Sanhedrin in time evidently lost the legal authority to execute the death penalty, unless they got the permission of the Roman governor (procurator). (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:18:31-43:18:31" data-bid="58-1" class="b">Joh 18:31</a>) After the destruction of Jerusalem in 70 C.E., the Sanhedrin was abolished.</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">In Jerusalem there were, in addition, lower courts composed of 23 members each. According to the Mishnah (<em>Sanhedrin</em> 1:6), these smaller courts were also located in other cities of sufficient size throughout Palestine. The full number of judges comprising the court did not sit on every case. The number varied according to the seriousness of the matter to be judged and the difficulty in reaching a verdict. Additionally, there was the village court consisting of three men, and a court consisting of seven older men of the village.</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">The synagogues, which were used primarily for education, were also used to some extent as places for local courts, at times referred to as ‘local Sanhedrins,’ having the power to inflict the penalties of scourging and excommunication.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:10:17-40:10:17" data-bid="59-1" class="b">Mt 10:17</a>, ftn; <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:23:34-40:23:34" data-bid="60-1" class="b">23:34;</a> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:13:9-41:13:9" data-bid="61-1" class="b">Mr 13:9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:21:12-42:21:12" data-bid="61-2" class="b"> Lu 21:12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:9:22-43:9:22" data-bid="61-3" class="b"> Joh 9:22;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:12:42-43:12:42" data-bid="61-4" class="b"> 12:42;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:16:2-43:16:2" data-bid="61-5" class="b"> 16:2</a>; see <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200002147/">ILLUSTRATIONS</a> (Some of Jesus’ prominent illustrations [21]).</p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb"><strong>The Christian Congregation.</strong> The Christian congregation, while having no secular authority as a court, may take action against disorderly members who require spiritual discipline, and it can even expel them from the congregation. Therefore, the apostle Paul tells the congregation that they, that is, the representative members thereof, those having oversight, must judge those inside the organization. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:5:12-46:5:13" data-bid="62-1" class="b">1Co 5:12, 13</a>) In writing to congregations and to overseers both Paul and Peter point out that the elders should keep a close watch on the congregation’s spiritual condition and should assist and admonish anyone who is taking an unwise or wrong step. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:4:2-55:4:2" data-bid="63-1" class="b">2Ti 4:2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:5:1-60:5:2" data-bid="63-2" class="b"> 1Pe 5:1, 2</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:6:1-48:6:1" data-bid="64-1" class="b">Ga 6:1</a>.) Those who are causing divisions or sects are to be warned a first and a second time before congregational action is taken. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/56:3:10-56:3:11" data-bid="65-1" class="b">Tit 3:10, 11</a>) But insistent practicers of sin are to be removed, expelled from the congregation. This constitutes discipline, showing to the offenders that their course of sin cannot be tolerated in the congregation. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:1:20-54:1:20" data-bid="66-1" class="b">1Ti 1:20</a>) Paul instructs those men in the congregation having the responsibility to act as judges to gather together to hear such a matter. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:5:1-46:5:5" data-bid="67-1" class="b">1Co 5:1-5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:6:1-46:6:5" data-bid="67-2" class="b"> 6:1-5</a>) They are to accept the accusation as true only when there are two or three witnesses, weighing the evidence without prejudgment, doing nothing according to a biased leaning.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:5:19-54:5:19" data-bid="68-1" class="b">1Ti 5:19,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:5:21-54:5:21" data-bid="68-2" class="b"> 21</a>.</p>
<p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb">Jesus commanded his disciples that if one sinned against another, efforts should first be made to settle the matter personally between themselves. If these efforts failed and the issue was of a serious nature, they should take it to the congregation for settlement (that is, to those appointed to responsible positions in governing the congregation). Paul later admonished Christians to settle difficulties in this manner and not to be taking one another before worldly courts.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:18:15-40:18:17" data-bid="69-1" class="b">Mt 18:15-17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:6:1-46:6:8" data-bid="69-2" class="b"> 1Co 6:1-8</a>; see <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200002713/">LEGAL CASE</a>.</p>

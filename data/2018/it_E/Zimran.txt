ZIMRAN
(Zimʹran).
First named of the six sons Keturah bore to Abraham. Zimran and his five full brothers were given gifts and sent into “the land of the East.” (Ge 25:1, 2, 6; 1Ch 1:32) The conjecture of some is that Zimran’s descendants were associated either with Zabram, a town situated W of Mecca on the Arabian shore of the Red Sea, or with Zimri, mentioned in Jeremiah 25:25.

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><strong>1.</strong> The sixth son of Jacob’s wife Leah. Being the less-loved wife, Leah was especially pleased about the birth of the boy. The name she gave him reflected the hope that her standing with Jacob would be enhanced. Leah exclaimed: “At last my husband will tolerate me, because I have borne him six sons.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:30:20-1:30:20" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ge 30:20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:35:23-1:35:23" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 35:23;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:1:1-2:1:3" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> Ex 1:1-3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:2:1-13:2:1" data-bid="1-4" class="b"> 1Ch 2:1</a>) Zebulun eventually became the father of three sons​—Sered, Elon, and Jahleel. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:46:14-1:46:14" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ge 46:14</a>) A distant descendant of Zebulun bearing the same name as one of these three sons, Elon, served as a judge in Israel.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:12:11-7:12:12" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Jg 12:11, 12</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><strong>2.</strong> The name Zebulun also designates the tribe descended from him through his three sons. About a year after the Israelites were liberated from enslavement in Egypt, this tribe’s able-bodied men from 20 years old upward numbered 57,400. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:1:1-4:1:3" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Nu 1:1-3,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:1:30-4:1:31" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 30, 31</a>) A second census taken at the close of Israel’s 40 years’ wandering in the wilderness revealed an increase of 3,100 registered males.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:26:26-4:26:27" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Nu 26:26, 27</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">In the wilderness, the tribe of Zebulun, alongside the tribes of Judah and Issachar, camped on the E side of the tabernacle. This three-tribe division was first in the order of march. Eliab the son of Helon served as the chieftain of the Zebulunite army.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:1:9-4:1:9" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Nu 1:9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:2:3-4:2:7" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 2:3-7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:7:24-4:7:24" data-bid="6-3" class="b"> 7:24;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:10:14-4:10:16" data-bid="6-4" class="b"> 10:14-16</a>.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><strong>Tribal Inheritance.</strong> Regarding the inheritance of the tribe of Zebulun, the dying patriarch Jacob stated: “Zebulun will reside by the seashore, and he will be by the shore where the ships lie anchored; and his remote side will be toward Sidon.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:49:13-1:49:13" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ge 49:13</a>) Since Sidon was to the N of Israel and since Zebulun’s territory was to be toward Sidon, the location of Zebulun’s territory was to be a northern one. While not bordering directly on the sea, the area assigned to Zebulun was situated between the Sea of Galilee on the E and the Mediterranean on the W and thus gave the Zebulunites easy access to both bodies of water. Hence, they could easily engage in commercial trade, which may be alluded to by Moses’ words of blessing: “Rejoice, O Zebulun, in your going out.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:33:18-5:33:18" data-bid="8-1" class="b">De 33:18</a>.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">At the time the distribution of the Promised Land continued from Shiloh, the third lot was drawn for Zebulun. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:18:8-6:18:8" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Jos 18:8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:19:10-6:19:16" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 19:10-16</a>) To assist in the division of the land, Elizaphan the son of Parnach was the divinely appointed representative of the tribe of Zebulun. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:34:17-4:34:17" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Nu 34:17,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:34:25-4:34:25" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> 25</a>) When the territorial boundaries were established, Zebulun was surrounded by Asher (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:19:24-6:19:24" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Jos 19:24,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:19:27-6:19:27" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 27</a>), Naphtali (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:19:32-6:19:34" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Jos 19:32-34</a>), and Issachar.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Several Levite cities were situated in the territory of Zebulun.

<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb"><strong>Outstanding Warriors.</strong> The tribe of Zebulun produced courageous warriors. Ten thousand men from Naphtali and Zebulun responded to Barak’s call to fight against the forces under the command of Sisera. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:4:6-7:4:6" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Jg 4:6,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:4:10-7:4:10" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> 10</a>) Following the victory, Barak and Deborah sang: “Zebulun was a people that scorned their souls to the point of death.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:5:18-7:5:18" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Jg 5:18</a>) Among those supporting Barak were Zebulunites “handling the equipment of a scribe,” evidently men in charge of numbering and enrolling the warriors.

Zebulunites also came to Judge Gideon in response to his call for warriors. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:6:34-7:6:35" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Jg 6:34, 35</a>) Among David’s supporters were 50,000 Zebulunites, loyal men not having “a double heart.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:12:33-13:12:33" data-bid="20-1" class="b">1Ch 12:33,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:12:38-13:12:40" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> 38-40</a>) During David’s reign Zebulunites evidently had a notable share in subduing the enemies of Israel.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:68:27-19:68:27" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Ps 68:27</a>.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb"><strong>Attitude Toward True Worship.</strong> In the latter half of the eighth century B.C.E., individuals from the tribe of Zebulun humbled themselves and responded to Judean King Hezekiah’s invitation to attend the Passover celebration at Jerusalem.

<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb"><strong>Referred to in Visions.</strong> In Ezekiel’s vision, Zebulun’s land assignment was situated between Issachar and Gad (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:48:26-26:48:27" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Eze 48:26, 27</a>), and one of the gates of the city “Jehovah Himself Is There” bears the name Zebulun.

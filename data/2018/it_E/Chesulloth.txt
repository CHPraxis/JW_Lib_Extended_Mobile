CHESULLOTH
(Che·sulʹloth) [Loins, [that is, slopes]].
A boundary city of Issachar (Jos 19:18) and probably the same as Chisloth-tabor. (Jos 19:12) It is generally identified with Iksal (Kislot Tavor), situated at the base of the hills of Nazareth and 3 km (2 mi) SE of that city. Hence it lay in the Plain of Jezreel to the W of Mount Tabor.

DEDAN
(Deʹdan).
1. A Cushite in the line of Raamah. (Ge 10:7; 1Ch 1:9) His posterity apparently settled part of Arabia.
2. A descendant of Abraham through Jokshan. (Ge 25:3; 1Ch 1:32) The Dedanites descending from Jokshan apparently settled S and SE of the Promised Land in the same general vicinity to which Abraham sent all his offspring through Keturah.​—Ge 25:6.
Since both families of Dedanites (those of Raamah and of Jokshan) evidently settled in sections of Arabia, there is some question as to which Dedan is meant when the name occurs in later Biblical writings. However, the connection that is sometimes made with other Semitic peoples such as Edom, Tema, and Buz indicates Dedan through Jokshan. For example, Dedan is listed as at one extremity of Edom, whose land was due to be ravaged. (Eze 25:13) Dedan, in “the desert plain,” is also told to flee before the invading forces. The Dedanite caravans are to seek quarters in the woods, while Tema, through whose territory they apparently make their flight, is called on to provide food and drink for the fugitives’ sustenance. (Isa 21:11-15; Jer 49:8) Like Edom, Dedan would also ultimately be forced to taste of the cup of the wine of Jehovah’s rage.​—Jer 25:15, 21, 23.
Scholars link Dedan with the oasis of el-Ula, about 120 km (75 mi) SW of Taima.
Other references to Dedan give no indications as to whether a Hamitic or a Semitic people is meant. For instance, Dedan is named at Ezekiel 27:15, 20 as a trader with Tyre. Dedan also views with selfish interest the planned plundering of God’s people by Gog of Magog.​—Eze 38:13.

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">In the Hebrew Scriptures there is no apparent reference to the domestic chicken (<em>Gallus domesticus</em>), but in the Christian Greek Scriptures Jesus Christ referred to the hen gathering her chicks under her protective wings in his simile concerning his desire to gather unresponsive Jerusalem. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:23:37-40:23:37" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Mt 23:37;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:13:34-42:13:34" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Lu 13:34</a>) The Greek word there used (<em>orʹnis</em>) is generic and hence may refer to any bird, wild or domesticated. But in Attic Greek it usually meant a hen, since this was the most common and useful of the domestic fowl. Jesus’ reference to a son asking his father for an egg (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:11:11-42:11:12" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Lu 11:11, 12</a>) indicates that the domestic hen was common in Palestine at that time. (See <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200001002/">COCK</a>.) From the Greek <em>orʹnis</em> (genitive: <em>orʹni·thos</em>) comes the English word “ornithology,” the branch of zoology that deals with birds.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Certain rabbinic laws forbade the eating of eggs laid on the Sabbath day, since it was held that this constituted work on the part of the hen; some, however, allowed the eating of the eggs if the hen was one kept for eating and not for laying. (Babylonian Talmud, <em>Bezah</em> 2<em>a, b</em>) The Bible, however, contains no such rules.</p>

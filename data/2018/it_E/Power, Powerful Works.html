<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Power is the ability to perform acts, the capacity to accomplish things, to do work; also, authority or influence as a result of endowments or position. The Hebrew word <em>koʹach</em> is translated “power”; <em>gevu·rahʹ,</em> “mightiness”; and <em>ʽoz,</em> “strength.” The Greek <em>dyʹna·mis</em> is translated both “power” and “powerful works,” as the context makes appropriate.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">At the close of the sixth creative “day,” God began “resting from all his work that [he had] created for the purpose of making.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:2:2-1:2:3" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ge 2:2, 3</a>) He rested from <em>these creative</em> works, but his power has since not become dormant or remained quiescent. Over 4,000 years after the completion of earthly creation, his Son stated: “My Father has kept working until now, and I keep working.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:5:17-43:5:17" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Joh 5:17</a>) Not only as regards the spirit realm has Jehovah been active; the Bible record pulsates with his expressions of power and his mighty acts toward humankind. Though at times he has “kept quiet . . . exercising self-control,” whenever his due time came to act he has taken vigorous action with “full might.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:42:13-23:42:14" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Isa 42:13, 14</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:80:2-19:80:2" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ps 80:2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:63:15-23:63:15" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Isa 63:15</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“Work” indicates purposeful activity. Jehovah’s acts are not isolated, unrelated, or erratic expressions of energy but are coordinated, purposeful acts with a definite end in view. Although his power sustains the universe and the living creatures in it (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:136:25-19:136:25" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ps 136:25;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:148:2-19:148:6" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 148:2-6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:5:45-40:5:45" data-bid="5-3" class="b"> Mt 5:45</a>), Jehovah is not like an impersonal power plant; his acts prove he is a personal and purposeful God. He is also a historical God, as he has perceptively intervened in human affairs at definite dates of history, at specified places, and with regard to particular persons or peoples. As the “living and true God” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/52:1:9-52:1:9" data-bid="6-1" class="b">1Th 1:9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:3:10-6:3:10" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> Jos 3:10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:10:10-24:10:10" data-bid="6-3" class="b"> Jer 10:10</a>), he has shown himself aware of all that is taking place in the universe, reacting according to what has occurred, as well as taking the initiative in furthering his purpose.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">In every case, his varied expressions of power have been in harmony with his righteousness (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:98:1-19:98:2" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ps 98:1, 2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:111:2-19:111:3" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 111:2, 3,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:111:7-19:111:7" data-bid="7-3" class="b"> 7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:5:16-23:5:16" data-bid="7-4" class="b"> Isa 5:16</a>); they all bring enlightenment to his creatures. They show on the one hand that fear of him “is fitting,” for he is a God “exacting exclusive devotion” and “a consuming fire” against those practicing wickedness, making it “a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:10:6-24:10:7" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Jer 10:6, 7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:20:5-2:20:5" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> Ex 20:5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:10:26-58:10:31" data-bid="8-3" class="b"> Heb 10:26-31;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:12:28-58:12:29" data-bid="8-4" class="b"> 12:28, 29</a>) He is not to be trifled with.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:8:29-2:8:29" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ex 8:29</a>.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">On the other hand, his use of power is even more wonderfully manifest in rewarding righteous-hearted persons sincerely seeking him, strengthening them to do assigned tasks and needful work (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:84:5-19:84:7" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ps 84:5-7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:40:29-23:40:31" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> Isa 40:29-31</a>) as well as to endure under stress (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:46:1-19:46:1" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Ps 46:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:25:4-23:25:4" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> Isa 25:4</a>), providing for and sustaining them (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:145:14-19:145:16" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Ps 145:14-16</a>), protecting, saving, and liberating them in times of danger and aggression. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:20:6-19:20:7" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Ps 20:6, 7</a>) “His eyes are roving about through all the earth to show his strength in behalf of those whose heart is complete toward him.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:16:9-14:16:9" data-bid="14-1" class="b">2Ch 16:9</a>) Those who come to know him find his name to be “a strong tower” to which they can turn. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:18:10-20:18:10" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Pr 18:10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:91:1-19:91:8" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> Ps 91:1-8</a>) Knowledge of his mighty acts gives assurance that he hears the prayers of his trusting servants and is able to answer, if necessary, with “fear-inspiring things in righteousness.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:65:2-19:65:2" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Ps 65:2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:65:5-19:65:5" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> 5</a>) In a figurative sense, he is “near” and hence can be swift in responding.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:145:18-19:145:19" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Ps 145:18, 19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/65:1:24-65:1:25" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> Jude 24, 25</a>.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><strong>Power Manifest in Creation.</strong> Humans see evidence of power in all physical creation, in the immense and countless stellar bodies (compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:38:31-18:38:33" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Job 38:31-33</a>) as well as in all earthly things. The very soil is spoken of as having power (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:4:12-1:4:12" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Ge 4:12</a>), producing food that gives strength (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:28:22-9:28:22" data-bid="20-1" class="b">1Sa 28:22</a>), and power is seen in all living things​—plants, animals, and man. In modern times the tremendous power potential in even the minute atomic elements forming all matter has also become well known. Scientists sometimes call matter organized energy.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Throughout the Scriptures the power and “dynamic energy” of God as the Maker of heaven and earth are repeatedly highlighted. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:40:25-23:40:26" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Isa 40:25, <span id="page660" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="660" data-before-text="660"></span>26;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:10:12-24:10:12" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> Jer 10:12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:32:17-24:32:17" data-bid="21-3" class="b"> 32:17</a>) The very term for “God” in Hebrew (<em>ʼEl</em>) probably has the root meaning of “mighty” or “powerful.” (Compare the use of the term at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:31:29-1:31:29" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Ge 31:29</a> in the expression “the power [<em>ʼel</em>] of my hand.”)</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb"><strong>Need for Special Demonstrations of Power.</strong> The first man knew Jehovah God as his Creator, his only Parent and Life-Giver. God endowed man with a measure of power, intellectual and physical, and gave him work to perform. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:26-1:1:28" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Ge 1:26-28;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:2:15-1:2:15" data-bid="23-2" class="b"> 2:15</a>) Such exercise of power must harmonize with his Creator’s will and hence be governed by other qualities divinely granted, such as wisdom, justice, and love.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">The rebellion in Eden presented a challenge to God’s sovereignty. Primarily a moral issue, it nevertheless has caused God to exercise his power in special ways. (See <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200002391/">JEHOVAH</a> [The supreme issue a moral one].) The rebellion was instigated by a spirit son of God who thereby became God’s opposer or resister (Heb., <em>sa·tanʹ</em>). Jehovah reacted to the situation, judging the rebels. His expulsion of the human pair from Eden and the stationing of his loyal spirit creatures at the garden’s entrance was a demonstration of divine power. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:3:4-1:3:5" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Ge 3:4, 5,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:3:19-1:3:19" data-bid="24-2" class="b"> 19,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:3:22-1:3:24" data-bid="24-3" class="b"> 22-24</a>) Jehovah’s word proved to be, not impotent, weak, or wavering, but full of power, irresistible as to fulfillment. (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:23:29-24:23:29" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Jer 23:29</a>.) As the Sovereign God, he proved ready and able to back up his word with the full weight of his authority.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Fixing his purpose, Jehovah has consistently worked toward its realization. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:3:15-1:3:15" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Ge 3:15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:1:8-49:1:11" data-bid="26-2" class="b"> Eph 1:8-11</a>) In his due time he would end all earthly rebellion, cause the original spirit rebel and those allied with him to be crushed as one crushes the head of a serpent. (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:16:20-45:16:20" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Ro 16:20</a>.) While allowing his spirit Adversary to continue for a time and to endeavor to prove successful his challenge, Jehovah would not abdicate his sovereign position. Exercising rightful authority, he would reward or punish when and as he saw fit, judging men according to their deeds. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:34:6-2:34:7" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Ex 34:6, 7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:32:17-24:32:19" data-bid="28-2" class="b"> Jer 32:17-19</a>) Additionally, he would use his power to attest the credentials of those whom he designated as his representatives on earth. By revealing his power, he would put the seal of genuineness on messages they delivered.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">This has been a divine kindness. Thereby Jehovah has given men proof that he, and no other, is the true God; he has given proof of his worthiness to receive the fear, respect, trust, praise, and love of his intelligent creatures. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:31:24-19:31:24" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Ps 31:24;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:86:16-19:86:17" data-bid="29-2" class="b"> 86:16, 17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:41:10-23:41:13" data-bid="29-3" class="b"> Isa 41:10-13</a>) Over the centuries, Jehovah has repeatedly assured his servants that his power has not waned, his “hand” has not ‘grown short,’ and his “ear” has not become too heavy to hear. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:11:23-4:11:23" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Nu 11:23;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:40:28-23:40:28" data-bid="30-2" class="b"> Isa 40:28;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:50:2-23:50:2" data-bid="30-3" class="b"> 50:2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:59:1-23:59:1" data-bid="30-4" class="b"> 59:1</a>) More important, these expressions of power have magnified Jehovah’s own name. His use of power exalts him, it does not debase him, does not sully his reputation; rather, by it he makes “a beautiful name” for himself.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:36:22-18:36:23" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Job 36:22, 23;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:37:23-18:37:24" data-bid="31-2" class="b"> 37:23, 24;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:63:12-23:63:14" data-bid="31-3" class="b"> Isa 63:12-14</a>.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb"><strong>Prior to and at the Global Flood.</strong> In the pre-Flood period, men had ample evidence of God’s power. They knew the way back into Eden was impassable, blocked by powerful spirit creatures. God showed he was alive to what was going on, approving Abel’s sacrifice, expressing judgment upon his murderous brother Cain, yet warning men against executing Cain.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:3:24-1:3:24" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Ge 3:24;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:4:2-1:4:15" data-bid="32-2" class="b"> 4:2-15</a>.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Some 1,400 years later, the earth became filled with wickedness and violence. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:6:1-1:6:5" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Ge 6:1-5,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:6:11-1:6:12" data-bid="33-2" class="b"> 11, 12</a>) God expressed displeasure at this situation. After sounding a warning through his servant Noah, he forcefully demonstrated by means of a global Flood that he would not allow wicked men to ruin the earth. He did not use his power to force them to worship him but, through Noah’s work as “a preacher of righteousness,” gave them opportunity to change. At the same time he showed his ability to liberate righteous-hearted persons from evil circumstances. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:2:4-61:2:5" data-bid="34-1" class="b">2Pe 2:4, 5,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:2:9-61:2:9" data-bid="34-2" class="b"> 9</a>) Even as his judgment came upon the wicked suddenly and his destruction of them did not ‘slumber’ but wiped them out within a 40-day period, so he would act in similar ways in the future.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:2:3-61:2:3" data-bid="35-1" class="b">2Pe 2:3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:7:17-1:7:23" data-bid="35-2" class="b"> Ge 7:17-23;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:37-40:24:39" data-bid="35-3" class="b"> Mt 24:37-39</a>.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb"><strong>Challenge of False Gods in Post-Flood Era.</strong> Both the Scriptures and ancient secular records reveal men’s deviation from worship of the true God in the post-Flood period. There is strong evidence that Nimrod, who “displayed himself [as] a mighty hunter in opposition to Jehovah,” played a major role in this; and there is evidence pointing to Babel (Babylon) as the major site where false worship developed. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:10:8-1:10:12" data-bid="36-1" class="b">Ge 10:8-12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:11:1-1:11:4" data-bid="36-2" class="b"> 11:1-4,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:11:9-1:11:9" data-bid="36-3" class="b"> 9</a>; see <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200000529/">BABEL</a>; <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200000530/">BABYLON</a> No. 1; <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200001732/">GODS AND GODDESSES</a>.) The tower project proposed at Babel was a demonstration of human power and ability, independent of God, unauthorized by him. It was to bring reputation and fame to its builders, not to God. And, as God realized, this would be only the beginning. It could lead to a series of ambitious power projects taking men on a course farther and farther away from the true God, in defiance of him and his purpose for the planet and for the human race. Again, God stepped in, throwing the project into confusion by acting upon human powers of speech, causing the <span id="page661" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="661" data-before-text="661"></span>peoples to disperse throughout the globe.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:11:5-1:11:9" data-bid="37-1" class="b">Ge 11:5-9</a>.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb"><strong><em>“Nature gods” contrasted with the true God.</em></strong> Ancient documents from Babylon and from points of mankind’s migration show that the worship of “nature gods” (such as the Babylonian sun-god Shamash and the Canaanite fertility god Baal) became very prominent in those early times. The “nature gods” were associated in men’s minds with periodic or cyclic manifestations of power, such as the daily beaming forth of the sun’s rays, the seasonal results of solstices and equinoxes (producing summer and winter, spring and fall), the winds and storms, the falling of rain and its effect on earth’s fertility in seedtime and harvest, and similar evidences of power. These forces are impersonal. So men had to fill in the blank, providing personality for their gods by their own imagination. The personalities they conjured up for their gods were generally capricious; they lacked any definite purpose, were morally debased, and were unworthy of worship and service.</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">Yet the visible heavens and earth give clear proof of a superior Source of power that produced all these forces in an interrelated, coordinated arrangement, one giving undeniable evidence of intelligent purpose. To that Source the acclamation goes: “You are worthy, Jehovah, even our God, to receive the glory and the honor and the power, because you created all things, and because of your will they existed and were created.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:4:11-66:4:11" data-bid="38-1" class="b">Re 4:11</a>) Jehovah is not a God governed by or limited to celestial or earthly cycles. Nor are his expressions of power capricious, erratic, or inconsistent. In each case they reveal something about his personality, his standards, his purpose. The <em>Theological Dictionary of the New Testament,</em> edited by G. Kittel, in treating the view of God contained in the Hebrew Scriptures, thus observes that “the important and predominant feature is not force or power but the will which this power must execute and therefore serve. This is everywhere the decisive feature.”​—Translated and edited by G. Bromiley, 1971, Vol. II, p. 291.</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">The worship of such “nature gods” by the Israelites was apostasy, a suppression of truth in favor of a lie, an unreasoning course of worshiping the creation rather than the One who created it; this is what the apostle states at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:1:18-45:1:25" data-bid="39-1" class="b">Romans 1:18-25</a>. Though invisible, Jehovah God had made his qualities manifest among men, for as Paul says, these are “clearly seen from the world’s creation onward, because they are perceived by the things made, even his eternal power and Godship, so that they are inexcusable.”</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb"><strong><em>God’s control of natural forces distinctive.</em></strong> To prove himself the true God, Jehovah might reasonably be expected to demonstrate his control over the created forces, doing so in a way that would be distinctly connected with his name. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:135:5-19:135:6" data-bid="40-1" class="b">Ps 135:5, 6</a>) Since the sun, moon, planets, and stars follow their regular courses, since the earthly atmospheric conditions (producing wind, rain, and other effects) obey the laws governing them, since locusts swarm and birds migrate, then these and many other normal functions would not suffice to sanctify God’s name in the face of opposition and false worship.</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">Nevertheless, Jehovah God could cause the natural creation and elements to testify to his Godship by using them to fulfill specific purposes beyond their ordinary function, often at a specifically designated time. Even when the events, such as a drought, a rainstorm, or a similar weather condition, were not unique in themselves, their coming in fulfillment of Jehovah’s prophecy made them distinctive. (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:17:1-11:17:1" data-bid="41-1" class="b">1Ki 17:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:18:1-11:18:2" data-bid="41-2" class="b"> 18:1, 2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:18:41-11:18:45" data-bid="41-3" class="b"> 41-45</a>.) In most cases, though, the events were extraordinary in themselves, either because of their magnitude or intensity (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:9:24-2:9:24" data-bid="42-1" class="b">Ex 9:24</a>) or because they occurred in an unusual, even unheard of, way or at an abnormal time.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:34:10-2:34:10" data-bid="43-1" class="b">Ex 34:10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:12:16-9:12:18" data-bid="43-2" class="b"> 1Sa 12:16-18</a>.</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">Similarly, the birth of a child was ordinary. But the birth of a child to a woman who had been sterile all her life and who had passed the age of childbirth (as in the case of Sarah) was extraordinary.

Death, too, was a common occurrence. But when the death came at a predicted time or in a preannounced way with the causative factor otherwise unknown, this was extraordinary, pointing to divine action. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:2:34-9:2:34" data-bid="45-1" class="b">1Sa 2:34;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:7:1-12:7:2" data-bid="45-2" class="b"> 2Ki 7:1, 2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:7:20-12:7:20" data-bid="45-3" class="b"> 20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:28:16-24:28:17" data-bid="45-4" class="b"> Jer 28:16, 17</a>) All these things proved Jehovah to be the true God, and the “nature gods” to be “valueless gods.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:96:5-19:96:5" data-bid="46-1" class="b">Ps 96:5</a>.</p>

<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="sb">What Jesus did gave proof of God’s interest in mankind, evidence of what God would eventually do for all loving righteousness. Jesus’ powerful works were largely related to mankind’s problems, first and most basic among which is that of sin, with all its damaging effects.

<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="sb">His powerful works were also portents of other blessings due to come by his kingly rule.

<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="sb">More important, these things were all related to spiritual matters.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:31-40:6:33" data-bid="121-1" class="b">Mt 6:31-33</a>) Jesus set the example in this by his refusal to change stones into bread for himself.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:4:1-40:4:3" data-bid="122-1" class="b">Mt 4:1-3</a>.</p>

<p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="sb">It was foretold that miraculous abilities granted by the spirit to the apostles, and passed on by them to others, would last only during the ‘infancy’ of the Christian congregation, thereafter ending.

M’Clintock and Strong’s <em>Cyclopædia</em> (Vol. VI, p. 320) says that it is “an uncontested statement that during the first hundred years after the death of the apostles we hear little or nothing of the working of miracles by the early Christians.” Nevertheless, Jesus and his apostles warned of future deceptive powerful works that would be done by apostates and also by a symbolic wild beast, enemies of God.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:7:21-40:7:23" data-bid="159-1" class="b">Mt 7:21-23;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:23-40:24:25" data-bid="159-2" class="b"> 24:23-25;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/53:2:9-53:2:10" data-bid="159-3" class="b"> 2Th 2:9, 10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:13:11-66:13:13" data-bid="159-4" class="b"> Re 13:11-13</a>; see <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200000591/">BEASTS, SYMBOLIC</a>.</p>

ANAB
(Aʹnab) [Grape].
A town in the S part of the hill country of Judah from which the giant Anakim were expelled by Joshua. (Jos 11:21; 15:48, 50) The site is identified with Khirbet ʽAnab es-Saghireh, 1.5 km (1 mi) W of Edh Dhahiriya, about halfway between Hebron and Beer-sheba. The original name of the city may have been Kiriath-anab, since Egyptian texts apparently mention it as Qrt ʽnb.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">(Elʹkosh·ite) [Of (Belonging to) Elkosh].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A resident of Elkosh. “Elkoshite” is applied only to the prophet Nahum. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/34:1:1-34:1:1" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Na 1:1</a>) Some would place Elkosh in Galilee. However, Nahum may have been in Judah at the time he wrote the book bearing his name. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/34:1:15-34:1:15" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Na 1:15</a>) If so, this would make the suggested identity with Judean site Beit Jibrin (Bet Guvrin), about 6 km (3.5 mi) NE of Lachish, the most likely proposal. The identification, however, remains tentative.</p>

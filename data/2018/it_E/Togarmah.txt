TOGARMAH
(To·garʹmah).
1. A son of Gomer the son of Japheth, hence a great-grandson of Noah.​—Ge 10:1-3; 1Ch 1:4-6.
2. Descendants of Gomer’s son Togarmah and the region they occupied. In Ezekiel’s dirge concerning Tyre, Togarmah is mentioned as the source of “horses and steeds and mules,” for which Tyre traded certain goods. (Eze 27:2, 14) The same prophet lists Togarmah among Gog of Magog’s allies and gives its situation as among the peoples of “the remotest parts of the north.”​—Eze 38:6.
Many commentators connect Togarmah with the Armenians. The Armenians themselves traditionally claim to be descended from “Haik, son of Thorgom.” Ancient Greek writers speak of the Armenians as famed for their horses and mules.

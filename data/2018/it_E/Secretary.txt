SECRETARY
Usually an appointed official skilled at writing and keeping records. The Hebrew word so·pherʹ can also be rendered “scribe” and “copyist.”
At least at times in Israel there was a trusted court official of high rank called “the secretary of the king” or “the secretary.” (2Ch 24:11; 2Ki 19:2) He was not simply a scribe who was employed in making documents, nor was he merely a copyist of the Law. (Jg 5:14; Ne 13:13; compare 2Sa 8:15-18; 20:23-26; see COPYIST; SCRIBE.) On occasion the secretary of the king handled financial matters (2Ki 12:10, 11) and spoke as a representative of the king, in a capacity similar to that of a ‘foreign secretary.’ (Isa 36:2-4, 22; 37:2, 3) Under Solomon’s rule two of the “princes” are named as secretaries.​—1Ki 4:2, 3; compare 2Ch 26:11; 34:13.
In addition to “the secretary of the king,” the Bible mentions “the secretary of the chief of the army” (2Ki 25:19; Jer 52:25) and “the secretary of the Levites.” (1Ch 24:6) Baruch was a scribal secretary for Jeremiah.​—Jer 36:32.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">(Misʹre·photh-maʹim) [Burnings at the Waters].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A point to which the Israelites pursued the armies of northern Canaanite kings allied with Jabin after having defeated them at the waters of Merom. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:11:1-6:11:5" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Jos 11:1-5,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:11:8-6:11:8" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 8</a>) When the Promised Land was divided into inheritance portions, the area extending from Lebanon to Misrephoth-maim remained to be conquered. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:13:2-6:13:2" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Jos 13:2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:13:6-6:13:6" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 6</a>) Some tentatively identify Misrephoth-maim with the ruins at Khirbet el-Musheirefeh (Horvat Mashref), about 20 km (12 mi) NNE of Acco (ʽAkko). This location would have provided the citizens of Misrephoth-maim access to the cities in the Plain of Acco and also the Hula Basin. Perhaps Misrephoth-maim (meaning “Burnings at the Waters”) got its name from the warm springs situated about 180 m (590 ft) from the site.</p>

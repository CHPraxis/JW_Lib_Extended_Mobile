<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A place mentioned in prophecies of doom against Moab.

Identified by <span id="page282" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="282" data-before-text="282"></span>Eusebius and Jerome with a place called Loueitha, Luhith has been linked with either Rujm Madinat er Ras, about 20 km (12 mi) SW of Karak, or nearby Khirbet Fas. Another view is that Luhith was not a city but merely the name of the ascent or slope to be used by the fleeing and weeping Moabite refugees.​—Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:34:4-4:34:4" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Nu 34:4</a>.</p>

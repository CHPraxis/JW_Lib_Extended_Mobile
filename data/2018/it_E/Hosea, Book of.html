<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A book of the Hebrew Scriptures written by “Hosea the son of Beeri.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/28:1:1-28:1:1" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ho 1:1</a>) In it the writer’s domestic life is paralleled with God’s relationship to Israel. (Chaps 1-3) The book shows that mere formal religious ceremony does not find acceptance with Jehovah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/28:6:6-28:6:6" data-bid="2-1" class="b">6:6</a>) It also highlights God’s mercy and loving-kindness.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/28:2:19-28:2:19" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2:19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/28:11:1-28:11:4" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 11:1-4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/28:14:4-28:14:4" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> 14:4</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><strong>Time and Place of Composition.</strong> Hosea began serving as a prophet at a time when Judean King Uzziah (829-778 B.C.E.) and King Jeroboam II of Israel (c. 844-804 B.C.E.) were contemporaries, and thus no later than 804 B.C.E., the apparent end of Jeroboam’s reign. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/28:1:1-28:1:1" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ho 1:1</a>) Hosea’s prophetic ministry continued into the reign of King Hezekiah of Judah, whose kingship began about 745 B.C.E. Hence, it spanned no less than 59 years, though it doubtless covered some time in the reigns of Jeroboam II and Hezekiah, thus being somewhat longer. Although Hosea recorded a prophecy concerning Samaria’s destruction (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/28:13:16-28:13:16" data-bid="5-1" class="b">13:16</a>), he did not report its fulfillment, which he probably would have done if the writing of the book had extended to 740 B.C.E., the date of Samaria’s fall. Therefore, the book of Hosea was evidently written in the district of Samaria and completed sometime between 745 and 740 B.C.E.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><strong>Setting.</strong> The book of Hosea is concerned primarily with the northern ten-tribe kingdom of Israel (also called Ephraim after its dominant tribe, the names being used interchangeably in the book). When Hosea began to prophesy during King Jeroboam’s reign, Israel enjoyed material prosperity. But the people had rejected knowledge of God. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/28:4:6-28:4:6" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ho 4:6</a>) Their wicked practices included acts of bloodshed, stealing, fornication, adultery, and the veneration of Baal and calf idols. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/28:2:8-28:2:8" data-bid="7-1" class="b">2:8,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/28:2:13-28:2:13" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/28:4:2-28:4:2" data-bid="7-3" class="b"> 4:2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/28:4:13-28:4:14" data-bid="7-4" class="b"> 13, 14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/28:10:5-28:10:5" data-bid="7-5" class="b"> 10:5</a>) After King Jeroboam died, prosperity ceased, and frightful conditions, marked by unrest and political assassination, came into existence. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:14:29-12:15:30" data-bid="8-1" class="b">2Ki 14:29–15:30</a>) Faithful Hosea also prophesied amid these circumstances. Finally, in <span id="page1147" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="1147" data-before-text="1147"></span>740 B.C.E., Samaria fell to the Assyrians, bringing the ten-tribe kingdom to its end.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:17:6-12:17:6" data-bid="9-1" class="b">2Ki 17:6</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><strong>Hosea’s Wife and the Children.</strong> At Jehovah’s command, Hosea took to himself “a wife of fornication and children of fornication.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/28:1:2-28:1:2" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ho 1:2</a>) This does not mean that the prophet married a prostitute or an immoral woman already having illegitimate children. It indicates that the woman would become adulterous and have such children after her marriage to the prophet. Hosea married Gomer, who “bore to him a son,” Jezreel. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/28:1:3-28:1:4" data-bid="11-1" class="b">1:3, 4</a>) Gomer later gave birth to a daughter, Lo-ruhamah, and thereafter to a son named Lo-ammi, both evidently being fruits of her adultery, as no personal reference is made to the prophet in connection with their births. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/28:1:6-28:1:6" data-bid="12-1" class="b">1:6,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/28:1:8-28:1:9" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> 8, 9</a>) Lo-ruhamah means “[She Was] Not Shown Mercy,” and the meaning of Lo-ammi is “Not My People,” these names indicating Jehovah’s disapproval of wayward Israel. On the other hand, the name of the firstborn child “Jezreel,” meaning “God Will Sow Seed,” is applied to the people favorably in a restoration prophecy.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/28:2:21-28:2:23" data-bid="13-1" class="b">2:21-23</a>.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">After the birth of these children, Gomer apparently abandoned Hosea for her paramours, but it is not said that the prophet divorced her. Evidently she was later forsaken by her lovers and fell into poverty and slavery, for <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/28:3:1-28:3:3" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Hosea 3:1-3</a> seems to indicate that the prophet purchased her as though she were a slave and took her back as a wife. His relationship with Gomer paralleled that of Jehovah with Israel, God being willing to take back his erring people after they repented of their spiritual adultery.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/28:2:16-28:2:16" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Ho 2:16,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/28:2:19-28:2:20" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> 19, 20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/28:3:1-28:3:5" data-bid="15-3" class="b"> 3:1-5</a>.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Some Bible scholars have viewed Hosea’s marriage as visionary, as a trance, or a dream, never carried into action. However, the prophet did not say or indicate that a vision, or a dream, was involved. Others have considered the marriage to be an allegory or a parable. But Hosea did not use symbolic or figurative terminology when discussing it. Viewing this as an account of the actual marriage of Hosea to Gomer and of Gomer’s literal restoration to the prophet gives force and significance to the application of these things historically and factually to Israel. It does not strain the plain Biblical account, and it harmonizes with Jehovah’s choosing of Israel, the nation’s subsequent spiritual adultery, and the people’s restoration to God upon their repentance.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><strong>Style.</strong> Hosea’s writing style is concise, even abrupt at times. There are rapid changes of thought. The book contains expressions of great feeling and power in the form of rebuke, warning, and exhortation, as well as tender pleas for repentance. And it contains excellent figures of speech.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/28:4:16-28:4:16" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Ho 4:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/28:5:13-28:5:14" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> 5:13, 14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/28:6:3-28:6:4" data-bid="16-3" class="b"> 6:3, 4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/28:7:4-28:7:8" data-bid="16-4" class="b"> 7:4-8,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/28:7:11-28:7:12" data-bid="16-5" class="b"> 11, 12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/28:8:7-28:8:7" data-bid="16-6" class="b"> 8:7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/28:9:10-28:9:10" data-bid="16-7" class="b"> 9:10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/28:10:1-28:10:1" data-bid="16-8" class="b"> 10:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/28:10:7-28:10:7" data-bid="16-9" class="b"> 7,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/28:10:11-28:10:13" data-bid="16-10" class="b"> 11-13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/28:11:3-28:11:4" data-bid="16-11" class="b"> 11:3, 4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/28:13:3-28:13:3" data-bid="16-12" class="b"> 13:3,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/28:13:7-28:13:8" data-bid="16-13" class="b"> 7, 8,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/28:13:15-28:13:15" data-bid="16-14" class="b"> 15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/28:14:5-28:14:7" data-bid="16-15" class="b"> 14:5-7</a>.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb"><strong>Canonicity.</strong> The book of Hosea stands first in the order of the so-called minor prophets in <span id="page1148" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="1148" data-before-text="1148"></span>common English Bibles, as well as in the ancient Hebrew and <em>Septuagint</em> texts. Jerome specified that one of the divisions of the Jews’ sacred books was The Book of the Twelve Prophets, which evidently included the book of Hosea to fill out the number 12. Melito of the second century C.E. left a catalog including these books, as did Origen and others.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb"><strong>Harmony With Other Bible Books.</strong> This book harmonizes with thoughts expressed elsewhere in the Bible. (For instance, compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/28:6:1-28:6:1" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Ho 6:1</a> with <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:32:39-5:32:39" data-bid="18-1" class="b">De 32:39;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/28:13:6-28:13:6" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> Ho 13:6</a> with <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:8:11-5:8:14" data-bid="19-1" class="b">De 8:11-14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:32:15-5:32:15" data-bid="19-2" class="b"> 32:15,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:32:18-5:32:18" data-bid="19-3" class="b"> 18</a>.)

Hosea’s prophecy also showed that Israel would be deserted by her lovers among the nations. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/28:8:7-28:8:10" data-bid="37-1" class="b">Ho 8:7-10</a>) Indeed, they were of no assistance when Samaria was destroyed and inhabitants of Israel became Assyrian captives in 740 B.C.E.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:17:3-12:17:6" data-bid="38-1" class="b">2Ki 17:3-6</a>.</p>

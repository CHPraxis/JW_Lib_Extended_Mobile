BEEROTHITE
(Be·erʹoth·ite) [Of (Belonging to) Beeroth].
A resident or native of Beeroth. At the time of the Israelites’ entry into Canaan its inhabitants were Hivites. The territory was thereafter assigned to Benjamin, and the Hivite residents became “gatherers of wood and drawers of water.” (Jos 9:17, 27; 18:21, 25; see BEEROTH.) The assassins of Ish-bosheth, namely, Baanah and Rechab, were “sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, of the sons of Benjamin.” (2Sa 4:2, 5, 9) Naharai, one of David’s mighty men, is called “the Beerothite” in 2 Samuel 23:37 and “the Berothite” in 1 Chronicles 11:39.

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">JEHOVAH’S law given to Israel prohibited the making of images for worship. The true God is a Spirit, and the making of any image to represent Him is grossly inappropriate. In contrast, many images of the gods of other ancient nations have been unearthed. They were nothing more than “the product of the hands of man, wood and stone.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:4:28-5:4:28" data-bid="1-1" class="b">De 4:28</a>) They were “valueless gods,” as the Bible says, having neither eyes to see nor ears to hear those who worshiped them. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:16:26-13:16:26" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1Ch 16:26;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:115:4-19:115:8" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Ps 115:4-8</a>) Today they are merely museum relics. Nevertheless, they reveal much about the roots of religious beliefs that are widespread today.</p>

The goddess Heqt, to whom the frog was sacred, was unable to help the Egyptians when the second plague covered the land with frogs. The death of the firstborn in the tenth plague proved to be the most devastating of all, as Pharaoh’s son was considered to be the son of Amon-Ra, represented by a ram</p>

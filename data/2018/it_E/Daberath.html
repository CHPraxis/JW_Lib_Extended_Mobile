<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A city mentioned in the boundary list of Zebulun (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:19:10-6:19:10" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Jos 19:10,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:19:12-6:19:12" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 12</a>) but regarded as belonging to the neighboring tribe of Issachar when later apportioned with its pasture ground to Levites of the family of Gershon (Gershom).

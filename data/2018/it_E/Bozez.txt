BOZEZ
(Boʹzez).
One of two rocks, or toothlike crags, associated with Jonathan’s victory over the Philistines, recorded at 1 Samuel 14:4-14. Jonathan, looking for a passage to cross over to attack the Philistine outpost, saw the two crags, one on the N facing Michmash (where the Philistines were encamped), the other on the S facing Geba. (1Sa 13:16; 14:5) Between these two cities the Wadi Suweinit (Nahal Mikhmas) descends toward the Jordan and becomes a deep gorge with nearly vertical cliffs somewhat to the E of the cities. The location of the two crags is considered to have been at the point where the wadi makes a sharp bend, though the precise identification of the crags is conjectural.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A portion of land in Ezekiel’s vision of the division of the Promised Land.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Each of the 12 tribes, with the exception of Levi (Ephraim and Manasseh standing for Joseph, thus making up the 12), was given an allotment running E and W across the land. South of the portion for Judah, which was the seventh allotment from the northern extremity, was an administrative strip of land. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:48:1-26:48:8" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Eze 48:1-8</a>) The northern border of this strip ran along the southern border of Judah’s allotment; it was bounded on the S by Benjamin’s portion, which was the fifth allotment from the southern extremity. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:48:23-26:48:28" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Eze 48:23-28</a>) This administrative strip was 25,000 cubits (13 km; 8 mi) wide from N to S. It was to be given by the people for governmental use.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:48:8-26:48:8" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Eze 48:8</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The sanctuary of Jehovah was located in the midst of a 25,000-cubit-square “contribution” within the administrative strip. The remainder of the strip to the E and W of this “contribution” consisted of two portions for the chieftain. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:48:20-26:48:22" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Eze 48:20-22</a>; see <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200000951/">CHIEFTAIN</a>.) The square “contribution” was divided as follows: a strip along the northern boundary, 10,000 cubits (5.2 km; 3.2 mi) wide, for the nonpriestly Levites. None of this assignment of land was to be sold or exchanged, “for it is something holy to Jehovah.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:48:13-26:48:14" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Eze 48:13, 14</a>) Bordering the Levite portion on the S was a 10,000-cubit strip, a “holy contribution for the priests.” This priestly section contained Jehovah’s sanctuary, or temple. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:48:9-26:48:12" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Eze <span id="page1132" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="1132" data-before-text="1132"></span>48:9-12</a>) This left a strip 5,000 cubits (2.6 km; 1.6 mi) wide on the south. This section was “something profane for the city, for a dwelling place and for pasture ground.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:48:15-26:48:15" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Eze 48:15</a>) In the center of this section was to be the city called “Jehovah Himself Is There.” The city was 4,500 cubits (2.3 km; 1.4 mi) square, having 12 gates, with a pasture ground 250 cubits (130 m; 425 ft) wide all around it. The remaining portion of the 25,000-cubit square, namely 10,000 cubits to the E of the city and 10,000 cubits to the W (5,000 cubits wide), was also considered profane and was to be cultivated by the tribes of Israel to provide food for the city.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:48:15-26:48:19" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Eze 48:15-19,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:48:30-26:48:35" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 30-35</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Thus, “the holy contribution” was actually 25,000 cubits E to W and 20,000 cubits N to S. It consisted of two 10,000-cubit-wide strips, one assigned to the priests and the other to the Levites. The remainder of the 25,000-cubit-square contribution was “something profane,” being used “for the city, for a dwelling place and for pasture ground.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:48:10-26:48:10" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Eze 48:10,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:48:13-26:48:15" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 13-15,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:48:18-26:48:18" data-bid="9-3" class="b"> 18,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:48:20-26:48:21" data-bid="9-4" class="b"> 20, 21</a>.</p>

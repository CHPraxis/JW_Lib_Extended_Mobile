ACHSAH
(Achʹsah) [Anklet; Bangle].
The daughter of the Judean spy Caleb whom he offered in marriage as a prize to whoever captured the stronghold of Debir in Judah’s newly acquired territory. Caleb’s nephew Othniel, who evidently became the first judge after Joshua (Jg 3:9, 10), captured it and, as a reward, married his cousin Achsah.​—See OTHNIEL.
When Achsah left for her new home, she requested and received from her father an additional choice gift, a section containing the Upper and Lower Gulloth. (Jos 15:15-19; Jg 1:12-15) Achsah may have been the mother of Hathath.​—1Ch 4:13.

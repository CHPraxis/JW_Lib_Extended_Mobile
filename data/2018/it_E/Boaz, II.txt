BOAZ, II
(Boʹaz) [possibly, In Strength].
The northernmost of the two huge copper pillars erected before the porch of Solomon’s glorious temple was named Boaz, possibly meaning “In Strength.” The southern pillar was called Jachin, meaning “May [Jehovah] Firmly Establish.” So, putting the two together and reading from right to left as one faced the E would convey the thought ‘May [Jehovah] firmly establish [the temple] in strength.’​—1Ki 7:15-21; see CAPITAL.

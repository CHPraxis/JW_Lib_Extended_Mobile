(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:10:6-5:10:6" data-bid="1-1" class="b">De 10:6</a>) It was evidently near Mount Hor (whereon Aaron died), but its exact location is unknown. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:33:38-4:33:38" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Nu 33:38</a>) The plural form of Moserah, “Moseroth,” appears at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:33:30-4:33:31" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Numbers 33:30, 31</a> and apparently refers to an earlier Israelite encampment there.</p>

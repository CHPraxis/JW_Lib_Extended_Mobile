<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">(Meʹshech).</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><strong>1.</strong> One of the sons born after the Flood to Japheth, the son of Noah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:10:2-1:10:2" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ge 10:2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:1:5-13:1:5" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 1Ch 1:5</a>) The name evidently extended to his descendants and the land of their settlement. The prophet Ezekiel regularly mentions Meshech along with Tubal, indicating that they were located to the N of Palestine. They are described as exporting slaves and copper to Tyre, as being warlike, and as either allies or subjects of ‘Gog of Magog’ in his prophesied vicious campaign against “the mountains of Israel.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:27:13-26:27:13" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Eze 27:13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:32:26-26:32:26" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 32:26;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:38:2-26:38:3" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> 38:2, 3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:39:1-26:39:2" data-bid="2-4" class="b"> 39:1, 2</a>; see <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200001734/">GOG</a> No. 2.) Meshech is mentioned independently of Tubal at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:120:5-19:120:5" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Psalm 120:5</a>, evidently as representing an aggressive, barbarous people.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">About a thousand years after the Flood, Assyrian inscriptions begin to mention a people called the <em>Musku</em> occupying an area in Asia Minor to the W of Assyria. Assyrian Emperors Tiglath-pileser I, Tukulti-Ninurta II, Ashurnasirpal II, and Sargon all mention conflicts with them. The fact that the <em>Musku</em> are frequently mentioned along with the <em>Tabali</em> (evidently the Biblical Tubal) gives reason for believing that the name <em>Musku</em> derives from Meshech. Herodotus (III, 94) later refers to the Moschi and the Tibareni in the same manner.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Many scholars suggest that the <em>Musku</em> are to be related with the Phrygians, who apparently dominated much of western and central Asia Minor about the close of the second millennium B.C.E. King Mita of Muski, referred to by Assyrian Emperor Sargon, is construed by some scholars as being identical with King Midas of Phrygia, described in Greek tradition as ruling in the same period.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><strong>2.</strong> Meshech appears in the Masoretic text at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:1:17-13:1:17" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 Chronicles 1:17</a> as a descendant of Shem, but the corresponding genealogy at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:10:23-1:10:23" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Genesis 10:23</a> reads “Mash.”</p>

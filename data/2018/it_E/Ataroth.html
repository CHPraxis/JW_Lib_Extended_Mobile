<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">(Atʹa·roth) [Crowns [that is, circular enclosures]].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><strong>1.</strong> A town on the E side of the Jordan, among those requested by the tribes of Gad and Reuben as their possession. The section was considered especially suitable for the livestock of these tribes. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:32:1-4:32:5" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Nu 32:1-5</a>) The town was thereafter rebuilt by the Gadites.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:32:34-4:32:34" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Nu 32:34</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The Moabite Stone of King Mesha also mentions this place, in lines 10 and 11 of the inscription. In part it says: “Now the men of Gad had always dwelt in the land of Ataroth, and the king of Israel had built Ataroth for them; but I fought against the town and took it and slew all the people of the town . . . And I brought back from there Arel (or Oriel), its chieftain . . . and I settled there men of Sharon and men of Maharith.”​—<em>Ancient Near Eastern Texts,</em> edited by J. B. Pritchard, 1974, p. 320.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The location of this site is generally considered to be present-day Khirbet ʽAttarus, E of the Dead Sea and some 13 km (8 mi) NW of Dibon (mentioned after Ataroth in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:32:3-4:32:3" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Nu 32:3</a>). The ruins are located on the W slope of a mountain bearing the same name and about 750 m (2,500 ft) high. Although this location is within the territory of Reuben, it appears that there was some mutual sharing of tribal territory between Gad and Reuben.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><strong>2.</strong> A town along the boundary between the territories of Ephraim and Benjamin. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:16:2-6:16:2" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Jos 16:2</a>) It is evidently the same as Ataroth-addar referred to at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:16:5-6:16:5" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Joshua 16:5</a> and <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:18:13-6:18:13" data-bid="6-1" class="b">18:13</a>. In this latter verse it is presented as forming part of the N boundary of Benjamin and as located “upon the mountain that is on the south of Lower Beth-horon.”</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><strong>3.</strong> A town on the NE boundary of the tribe of Ephraim.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:16:7-6:16:7" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Jos 16:7</a>.</p>

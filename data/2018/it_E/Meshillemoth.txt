MESHILLEMOTH
(Me·shilʹle·moth) [from a root meaning “make peace; compensate; repay”].
1. An Ephraimite whose “son” Berechiah was one of the headmen of Ephraim who persuaded the Israelites of King Pekah’s day to release the captives they had taken in a successful military campaign against Judah.​—2Ch 28:6-8, 12-15.
2. A priest who descended from Immer and who was the ancestor of certain priests residing in Jerusalem after the Jews returned from Babylonian exile. (Ne 11:10, 13, 14) He is probably identical with the Meshillemith of 1 Chronicles 9:12.

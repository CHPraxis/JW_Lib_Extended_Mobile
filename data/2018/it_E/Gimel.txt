GIMEL
[ג] (giʹmel).
The third letter in the Hebrew alphabet. It is the softest of the palatal letters except for yohdh [י] and corresponds generally to the English “g” when it has within it the point (daghesh lene); but without this point it is pronounced softer, more down in the throat. (See HEBREW, II.) In the Hebrew, this is the first letter in the opening word in each of the eight verses of Psalm 119:17-24.

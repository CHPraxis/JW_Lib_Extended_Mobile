<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">(A·shiʹma).</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A deity worshiped by the people from Hamath whom the king of Assyria settled in Samaria after his taking the Israelites into captivity. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:17:24-12:17:24" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2Ki 17:24,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:17:30-12:17:30" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 30</a>) Ashima, according to the Babylonian Talmud (<em>Sanhedrin</em> 63<em>b</em>), was represented as a hairless he-goat, and for this reason some have identified Ashima with Pan, a pastoral god of fertility. Another suggestion is that the name Ashima may be a deliberate alteration of “Asherah” (the Canaanite fertility goddess) to combine it with the Hebrew word <em>ʼa·shamʹ</em> (“guilt”; <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:26:10-1:26:10" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ge 26:10</a>). However, nothing can be stated with any certainty aside from what is contained in the Bible.</p>

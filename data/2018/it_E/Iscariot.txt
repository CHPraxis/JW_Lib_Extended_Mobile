ISCARIOT
(Is·carʹi·ot) [from Heb., possibly, Man From Kerioth].
The designation for the traitor apostle Judas (and his father Simon) that sets him apart from the other apostle also named Judas. (Mt 10:4; Lu 6:16; Joh 6:71) If “Iscariot” means, as is most commonly thought, “Man From Kerioth,” then it likely identifies Simon and his son as being from the Judean town of Kerioth-hezron.​—Jos 15:25; see JUDAS No. 4.

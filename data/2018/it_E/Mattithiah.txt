MATTITHIAH
(Mat·ti·thiʹah) [Gift of Jehovah].
1. A Levite who played a harp when the ark of the covenant was brought to Jerusalem from the house of Obed-edom. (1Ch 15:17-21, 25) Probably this same Mattithiah was one of the Levite musicians whom David put before the Ark “both to call to remembrance and to thank and praise Jehovah the God of Israel” (1Ch 16:4, 5) and was the individual who was later selected by lot from among the sons of Jeduthun to head the 14th division of 12 Levite musicians.​—1Ch 25:1, 3, 9, 21.
2. A Kohathite Levite of the family of Korah and the firstborn son of Shallum. This Mattithiah was among the Levites returning from Babylonian exile and “was in the office of trust over the things baked in pans.”​—1Ch 9:31, 32.
3. A Levite or priest who stood at Ezra’s right hand when the copyist read the Law of Moses to the Jews assembled in Jerusalem.​—Ne 8:1, 4.
4. An Israelite “of the sons of Nebo” who was among those accepting foreign wives but who sent them away “along with sons” in Ezra’s day.​—Ezr 10:25, 43, 44.

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><strong>1.</strong> The firstborn son of Aaron and Elisheba.

He with his next younger brother Abihu and 70 other Israelites were called with Aaron and Moses up into Sinai, where they saw a vision of Jehovah.

Just what made the fire illegitimate is not stated, but it was probably more than just getting intoxicated (suggested by the immediate prohibition to priests not to drink wine or intoxicating liquor when on duty). However, intoxication may have contributed to their wrongdoing. For their transgression, they were killed by fire from Jehovah and their bodies were disposed of outside the camp.

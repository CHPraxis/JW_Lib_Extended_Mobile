GLEDE
[Heb., dai·yahʹ].
The Hebrew name for this bird occurs in the list of unclean birds at Deuteronomy 14:13 but does not appear in the corresponding list at Leviticus 11:14. Four Hebrew manuscripts, and also the Samaritan Pentateuch and the Greek Septuagint, omit dai·yahʹ at Deuteronomy 14:13. Some scholars believe that it may be a scribal correction originally placed in the margin but which eventually was introduced into the text itself. However, the plural form (dai·yohthʹ) appears at Isaiah 34:15 as describing birds gathered at the ruins of Edom following its desolation.
The identification of this bird is uncertain. It is suggested that the Hebrew name is derived from the verb meaning “pounce” or “come darting.” “Glede” is a suitable translation, since it is a term variously applied to any of several birds of prey, though especially to the red kite (Milvus milvus). Most modern scholars relate the Hebrew dai·yahʹ to the kite, there being more than one variety of this bird found in Palestine.​—See KITE.

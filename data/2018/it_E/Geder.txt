GEDER
(Geʹder) [Stone Wall].
A town in Canaan; its king was one of 31 conquered by Joshua. (Jos 12:13) Joshua 12:7, 8 shows it as being on the W side of the Jordan, and its being mentioned next to Debir may place it in the Shephelah region. It may be the same as the Beth-gader at 1 Chronicles 2:51. But its exact location is uncertain. In David’s time, a man called Baal-hanan the Gederite was in charge of David’s olive groves and sycamore trees in the Shephelah, and it is thought that he may have come from either Geder or Gederah.​—1Ch 27:28.

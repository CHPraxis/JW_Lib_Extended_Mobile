MADON
(Maʹdon) [from a root verb meaning “judge”].
A royal Canaanite city that leagued itself with Hazor against the Israelites and was subsequently defeated. (Jos 11:1-12; 12:19) Madon is usually identified with Qarn Hattin (Horvat Qarne Hittim), about 8 km (5 mi) WNW of Tiberias. Khirbet Madin, about 1 km (0.6 mi) to the S, seems to preserve the ancient name. However, some question the identification because it is based solely on the similarity of the name of nearby Madin to the Biblical name.

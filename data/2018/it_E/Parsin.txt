PARSIN
(Parʹsin).
One of the words mysteriously written on the wall of Belshazzar’s palace and read and interpreted by Daniel. (Da 5:25) It is the plural number of “Peres,” which means “a half shekel,” a division of a shekel. In giving the interpretation, Daniel did not use the plural “Parsin,” but used the singular form (Peres). (Da 5:28) Perhaps this was because only Belshazzar was present to hear the prophet explain the prophetic message, although it applied to both rulers of the Babylonian Empire, Belshazzar and Nabonidus.​—See PERES.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">The powerful Amorite king of Bashan (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:4:19-11:4:19" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1Ki 4:19</a>) whom the Israelites defeated before crossing into the Promised Land. Og was one of the giant Rephaim. In fact, his immense iron bier (perhaps a sarcophagus of black basalt) measured 4 by 1.8 m (13.1 by 5.8 ft). (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:3:11-5:3:11" data-bid="2-1" class="b">De 3:11</a>, ftn) He and Sihon ruled the Amorites E of the Jordan.

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The defeat of Og at the hands of Israel came toward the end of Israel’s 40-year wandering, just before they encamped on the Plains of Moab. After defeating Sihon, Israel clashed with Og’s forces at Edrei and, in an overwhelming God-given victory, killed off Og and all his army and took possession of his cities and towns.

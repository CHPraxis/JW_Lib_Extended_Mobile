DAMARIS
(Damʹa·ris).
A woman who heard Paul’s defense at the Athenian Areopagus (Mars’ Hill) and became a believer. (Ac 17:33, 34) Damaris possibly was not a Greek, in view of the fact that in Athenian society women normally remained in seclusion. Since Damaris is the only woman named, she may have been of some prominence. There is no valid basis for concluding that she was married to Dionysius, simply because the two are mentioned together.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A translation of the Aramaic expression <em>ʽat·tiqʹ yoh·minʹ,</em> which indicates “one advanced (or aged) in days.” This title of Jehovah appears only at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:7:9-27:7:9" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Daniel 7:9,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:7:13-27:7:13" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 13</a>, and <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:7:22-27:7:22" data-bid="2-1" class="b">22</a> and alternates with the title “Supreme One.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:7:18-27:7:18" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Da 7:18,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:7:22-27:7:22" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 22,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:7:25-27:7:25" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> 25,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:7:27-27:7:27" data-bid="3-4" class="b"> 27</a>) The scene is a courtroom where the Ancient of Days sits to judge the world powers, described under the symbolism of huge beasts. Their lease of rulership over the earth is taken away, and the “rulership and dignity and kingdom” are given to one “like a son of man” to whom all peoples are commanded to render obedience.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:7:10-27:7:14" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Da 7:10-14</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The title “Ancient of Days” appropriately contrasts the everlasting God with the successive world powers that rise and fall, and it portrays Jehovah in his role as the majestic and venerable Judge of all.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:90:2-19:90:2" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ps 90:2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:75:7-19:75:7" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 75:7</a>.</p>

EN-RIMMON
(En-rimʹmon) [Fountain (or, Spring) of the Pomegranate Tree].
A city of Judah mentioned after the exile as being inhabited by the sons of Judah. (Ne 11:25, 29) Its name is a combination of Ain and Rimmon, mentioned at Joshua 15:32 and 19:7 and 1 Chronicles 4:32. Today it is generally considered identifiable with Khirbet Umm er-Ramamin, about 15 km (9 mi) to the N of Beer-sheba.

RABBITH
(Rabʹbith) [Multitude; Abundance].
According to the Masoretic text, a site on Issachar’s boundary. (Jos 19:17, 18, 20) It is thought to be the same as Daberath, identified with Khirbet Dabura (Horvat Devora). (Jos 19:12) Supporting this view is the fact that Vatican Manuscript No. 1209, of the fourth century C.E., has Da·bi·ron in place of “Rabbith.”​—See DABERATH.

MOSERAH
(Mo·seʹrah), Moseroth (Mo·seʹroth).
The place where the Israelites were encamped when Aaron died. (De 10:6) It was evidently near Mount Hor (whereon Aaron died), but its exact location is unknown. (Nu 33:38) The plural form of Moserah, “Moseroth,” appears at Numbers 33:30, 31 and apparently refers to an earlier Israelite encampment there.

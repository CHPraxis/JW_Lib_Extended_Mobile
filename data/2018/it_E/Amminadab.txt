AMMINADAB
(Am·minʹa·dab) [My People Are Willing (Noble; Generous)].
1. A son of Ram of the family of Hezron, tribe of Judah. (1Ch 2:10) His son, Nahshon, was chieftain of Judah during the wilderness trek (Nu 1:7; 7:11, 12); his daughter, Elisheba, became Aaron’s wife. (Ex 6:23) Amminadab was an ancestor of King David and of Christ Jesus.​—Ru 4:19-22; Mt 1:4-16; Lu 3:23-33.
2. Perhaps an alternative name for Izhar, a son of Kohath and father of Korah. (1Ch 6:22; compare vss 2, 18, 37, 38; Ex 6:18, 21; Nu 3:19, 27.) Some copies of the Greek Septuagint give “Izhar” instead of “Amminadab” at 1 Chronicles 6:22 (6:7, LXX).
3. A Levite, of the sons of Uzziel; a family head in David’s time. He helped to bring the ark of the covenant to Jerusalem.​—1Ch 15:10-12.

HAMON-GOG
(Haʹmon-Gog) [Gog’s Crowd].
The English derivation of the Hebrew name of a valley, evidently symbolic, described as “the valley of those passing through on the east of the [Dead] sea.” In this valley, Gog and all his forces are buried after their destruction by Jehovah.​—Eze 39:11, 15, ftns; see GOG No. 2.

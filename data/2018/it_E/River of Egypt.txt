RIVER OF EGYPT
Jehovah promised that Abraham’s seed would be given the land “from the river of Egypt” to the Euphrates River. (Ge 15:18) Commentators generally understand “the river of Egypt” to refer to “the torrent valley of Egypt” now identified with Wadi el-ʽArish of the Sinai Peninsula, which empties into the Mediterranean Sea about 150 km (90 mi) E of Port Said. (See EGYPT, TORRENT VALLEY OF.) At 1 Chronicles 13:5 certain translations read “river [shi·chohrʹ] of Egypt” (NW, La, AT), and this reference also may be to Wadi el-ʽArish. However, another possibility is that both texts refer to a branch of the Nile.​—See SHIHOR.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A unit of the Roman army in which Cornelius of Caesarea served as a centurion. In the Bible’s only reference to it, Cornelius is said to have been “an army officer of the Italian band, as it was called.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:10:1-44:10:1" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ac 10:1</a>) This was probably a cohort, so named to distinguish it from the regular Roman legions. A cohort in full strength consisted of about 600 men, that is, about one tenth the size of a legion. As its name implies, this cohort was probably made up of volunteers mustered in Italy, having Roman citizenship either as freeborn men or as freedmen.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The scripture does not say this Italian band was stationed at Caesarea. It only says that Cornelius, one of its army officers, had his home in Caesarea.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:10:1-44:10:2" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ac 10:1, 2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:10:22-44:10:22" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 22,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:10:24-44:10:24" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> 24</a>.</p>

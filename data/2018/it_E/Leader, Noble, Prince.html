<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Several Hebrew words may be translated variously as “leader,” “noble,” and “prince.” Those appearing most frequently are as follows:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><em>Na·ghidhʹ,</em> meaning “leader,” is applied to Saul and David in connection with their being designated as kings over Israel and to Hezekiah as the king of Judah, with the responsibility of shepherding Jehovah’s people. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:9:16-9:9:16" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1Sa 9:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:25:30-9:25:30" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 25:30;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:5:2-10:5:2" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> 2Sa 5:2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:20:5-12:20:5" data-bid="1-4" class="b"> 2Ki 20:5</a>) The tribe of Judah was selected by Jehovah to be leader of the 12 tribes of Israel, and it was from Judah that the kingly dynasty of David came.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:28:4-13:28:4" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1Ch 28:4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:49:10-1:49:10" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Ge 49:10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:1:2-7:1:2" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> Jg 1:2</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Jesus is referred to as “Messiah the Leader” and “a leader and commander to the national groups,” at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:9:25-27:9:25" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Daniel 9:25</a> and <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:55:4-23:55:4" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Isaiah 55:4</a>.

While there are those who ‘take the lead’ in God’s service, they are not titled “leader” or addressed as such, and their example is to be followed only as they imitate Christ.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:11:1-46:11:1" data-bid="6-1" class="b">1Co 11:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:13:7-58:13:7" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> Heb 13:7</a>.</p>

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><em>Sar,</em> meaning “prince,” “chief,” is drawn from a verb meaning “exercise dominion.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:9:22-7:9:22" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Jg 9:22</a>, ftn) While it is often translated “prince,” it does not necessarily apply to the son of a king or a person of royal rank in every instance.

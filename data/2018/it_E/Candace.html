<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A queen of Ethiopia whose treasurer became a Christian. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:8:27-44:8:27" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ac 8:27</a>) Instead of being a specific personal name, “Candace,” like “Pharaoh” and “Caesar,” is considered to be a title. Ancient writers, including Strabo, Pliny the Elder, and Eusebius, used this designation in referring to queens of Ethiopia. Pliny the Elder (c. 23-79 C.E.) wrote that “the town [Meroë, capital of ancient Ethiopia] possesses few buildings. They said that it is ruled by a woman, Candace, a name that has passed on through a succession of queens for many years.”​—<em>Natural History,</em> VI, XXXV, 186.</p>

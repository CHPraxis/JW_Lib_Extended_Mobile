HERODION
(He·roʹdi·on).
One to whom Paul sent personal greetings in his letter to the Christian congregation at Rome. Paul refers to Herodion as “my relative.” (Ro 16:11) Some suggest that this may simply mean that Herodion was a fellow Jew rather than an immediate member of Paul’s family, in view of the apostle’s use of the designation “relatives” at Romans 9:3. However, since Paul does not refer to all the Jews to whom he sent greetings as “my relatives” (compare Ac 18:2; Ro 16:3), likely a closer relative is meant.​—See ANDRONICUS.

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The Semitic expression used by Jesus Christ at the time he resurrected Jairus’ daughter. It means, “Maiden, I say to you, Get up!” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:5:41-41:5:41" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Mr 5:41</a>) The transliterations of this expression vary in Greek manuscripts. While it is often referred to as Aramaic, at least the latter part of the phrase <em>(“cumi”</em>) could be either Hebrew or Aramaic, according to <em>Vine’s Expository Dictionary of Old and New Testament Words</em> (1981, Vol. 4, p. 109). Lexicographer Gesenius derives <em>“talitha”</em> from the Hebrew word for lamb (<em>ta·lehʹ</em>).​—<em>A Hebrew and English Lexicon of the Old Testament,</em> by Brown, Driver, and Briggs, 1980, p. 378.</p>

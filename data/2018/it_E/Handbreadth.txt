HANDBREADTH
A linear measure approximately corresponding to the width of the hand at the base of the fingers. The handbreadth is reckoned at 7.4 cm (2.9 in.); four fingerbreadths equaled a handbreadth, and six handbreadths equaled a cubit. (Ex 25:25; 37:12; 1Ki 7:26; 2Ch 4:5; Eze 40:5, 43; 43:13) According to Psalm 39:5, David said: “You have made my days just a few”; however, “just handbreadths” appears in the Hebrew Masoretic text. (NW, ftn) Christ Jesus similarly employed the word “cubit”: “Who of you by being anxious can add one cubit to his life span?”​—Mt 6:27.

HIRAM-ABIV
(Hiʹram-aʹbiv) [Hiram His Father].
A term used in reference to the skilled craftsman sent from Tyre to supervise construction of the furnishings of Solomon’s temple. It seems to indicate that Hiram was “father,” not in a literal sense, but in that he was a master workman.​—2Ch 4:16; see HIRAM No. 2.

(Am·a·riʹah) [Jehovah Has Said].
1. A priestly descendant of Aaron’s son Eleazar through Phinehas; son of Meraioth; father of Ahitub; grandfather of Zadok, who served as a secondary priest during the reign of David and high priest during the reign of Solomon. (1Ch 6:7, 52) It cannot be stated definitely that Amariah officiated as high priest, since the office temporarily switched to the house of Eli at about that time.
2. A Levite descendant of Kohath’s son Hebron, listed in David’s reorganization of temple service.​—1Ch 23:1, 12, 19; 24:23.
3. Chief priest “for every matter of Jehovah,” especially legal cases, during Jehoshaphat’s reign.​—2Ch 19:11.
4. Another descendant of Eleazar who lived at a later time than No. 1 above. Son of Azariah and father of another Ahitub.​—1Ch 6:11; Ezr 7:3.
5. A Levite who assisted in distributing the tithes to the priests in their cities during the reign of Hezekiah.​—2Ch 31:14, 15.
6. Son of Hezekiah (probably the king of Judah) and great-grandfather of the prophet Zephaniah.​—Zep 1:1.
7. One of the principal priests returning from Babylon with Zerubbabel, 537 B.C.E. (Ne 12:1, 2, 7) In the days of Governor Nehemiah there was a ‘paternal house’ of priests by his name.​—Ne 12:12, 13, 26.
8. A descendant of Binnui; one of those who sent away their pagan wives and sons in the days of Ezra.​—Ezr 10:10-12, 38, 42, 44.
9. A priest, or the forefather of one, who attested to the “trustworthy arrangement” during Nehemiah’s governorship. (Ne 9:38; 10:1, 3) He would have been more than 112 years old if the same as No. 7 above.
10. Ancestor of residents of Jerusalem in Nehemiah’s time; of the tribe of Judah.​—Ne 11:4.

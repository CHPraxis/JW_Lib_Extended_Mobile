HOR-HAGGIDGAD
(Hor-hag·gidʹgad).
An Israelite wilderness camping site. As discussed under the heading BENE-JAAKAN, a comparison of Numbers 33:31-33 with Deuteronomy 10:6, 7 seems to indicate that the Israelites passed through this same region twice, Hor-haggidgad being called “Gudgodah” on the later trip. (See GUDGODAH.) The exact location cannot be determined with certainty. Most scholars, however, tentatively identify Hor-haggidgad (Gudgodah) with a site on the Wadi Khadakhid, about 65 km (40 mi) NNW of the Gulf of ʽAqaba.

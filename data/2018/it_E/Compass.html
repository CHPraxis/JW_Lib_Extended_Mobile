<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">An instrument used by a carpenter or another craftsman to mark or inscribe a circle or an arc on wood or some other material. The only Biblical reference to a compass is at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:44:13-23:44:13" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Isaiah 44:13</a>. There the idolatrous wood-carver is said to use the measuring line, red chalk, and a wood scraper to fashion an idol. And, “with a compass he keeps tracing it out [evidently to make sure it is well proportioned], and gradually he makes it like the representation of a man, like the beauty of mankind, to sit in a house.” The Hebrew word for “compass” (<em>mechu·ghahʹ</em>) is related to <em>chugh</em> (circle).​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:8:27-20:8:27" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Pr 8:27;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:40:22-23:40:22" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Isa 40:22</a>.</p>

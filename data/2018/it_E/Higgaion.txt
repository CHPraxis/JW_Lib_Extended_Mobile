HIGGAION
(Hig·gaʹion).
A transliteration of the Hebrew expression hig·ga·yohnʹ, understood by lexicographers to denote a technical term of musical direction. (Ps 9:16) On the basis of the context in its appearances in the Hebrew text, it has been variously rendered as “soft utterance,” “meditation,” “thoughts,” “melody,” “sweet music,” “resounding music,” and “muttering(s).” (Ps 19:14; 92:3; La 3:62, AT, Mo, NW, Ro, RS, Yg) At Psalm 9:16, Higgaion may signify either a solemn, deep-toned harp interlude or a solemn pause conducive to meditation.

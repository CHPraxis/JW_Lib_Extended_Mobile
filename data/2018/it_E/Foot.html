<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">The Hebrew <em>reʹghel</em> and the Greek <em>pous</em> basically refer to the lowest part of the leg, the body part upon which a person or an animal stands. Both terms are used literally and figuratively.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">In ancient times, as in many parts of the earth today, the feet were the main means of transportation. Some of the common people went barefoot, but sandals consisting of little more than a sole were commonly worn. (See <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200003830/">SANDAL</a>.) On entering a house, a person removed his sandals. An essential, virtually obligatory mark of hospitality was to wash the feet of a guest; the service was performed either by the householder or by a servant, or at least water was provided for the purpose.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:18:4-1:18:4" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ge 18:4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:24:32-1:24:32" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 24:32;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:25:41-9:25:41" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> 1Sa 25:41;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:7:37-42:7:38" data-bid="1-4" class="b"> Lu 7:37, 38,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:7:44-42:7:44" data-bid="1-5" class="b"> 44</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Since the sandals were removed when one was on holy ground, the priests when performing duties <span id="page847" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="847" data-before-text="847"></span>in the tabernacle or the temple undoubtedly served barefoot. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:3:5-2:3:5" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ex 3:5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:5:15-6:5:15" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Jos 5:15</a>) No sandals were included in the instructions for making the priests’ garments.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:28:1-2:28:43" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ex chap 28</a>; see <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200000467/">ATTITUDES AND GESTURES</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><strong>Christ Washes Disciples’ Feet.</strong> Jesus Christ gave his disciples a lesson in humility and service to one another when he, their Master, washed their feet. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:13:5-43:13:14" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Joh 13:5-14</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:5:9-54:5:10" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1Ti 5:9, 10</a>.) On this occasion Jesus said: “He that has bathed does not need to have more than his feet washed, but is wholly clean,” doubtless referring to the fact that even if a person was bathed, his feet would get dusty even in a short walk and would frequently need washing. In the days of Jesus’ earthly ministry, the priests and Levites on guard duty at the temple, after immersing themselves early in the morning, were not required to bathe again that day, except to wash their hands and feet. (See also <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:30:19-2:30:21" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ex 30:19-21</a>.) By saying, “you men are clean, but not all [referring to Judas],” Jesus apparently gave his actions on this occasion an additional spiritual significance. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:13:10-43:13:11" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Joh 13:10, 11</a>) At <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:5:25-49:5:26" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Ephesians 5:25, 26</a> Jesus is shown as cleansing the Christian congregation with “the bath of water by means of the word” of truth. Logically, Jesus’ faithful followers were likewise to show humble concern not only for the physical needs of their brothers but even more so for their spiritual needs. Thereby they would help one another to keep clean from the daily temptations and entanglements that might contaminate a Christian while walking in this world.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:10:22-58:10:22" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Heb 10:22;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:6:1-48:6:1" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> Ga 6:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:12:13-58:12:13" data-bid="9-3" class="b"> Heb 12:13</a>; see <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200004577/">WASHING OF FEET</a>.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><strong>“Walking.”</strong> The words “foot” and “feet” are frequently used to denote a person’s inclination or the course he takes, good or bad.

God directs the feet of his faithful servants in the right path, figuratively, showing them the way to go so as not to stumble to a spiritual fall or be ensnared in evil, and sometimes even safeguarding them against capture by the enemy.

HUKKOK
(Hukʹkok) [Engraved; Inscribed; Hewn Out].
A border city of Naphtali. (Jos 19:32, 34) Whereas some consider it to be too far N and E, present-day Huqoq has been identified with ancient Hukkok. This site lies about 7 km (4.5 mi) W of the northern end of the Sea of Galilee and overlooks the fertile Plain of Gennesaret.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">The quality or state of taking an active interest in the welfare of others; friendly and helpful acts or favors. The principal word for “kindness” in the Christian Greek Scriptures is <em>khre·stoʹtes.</em> Jehovah God takes the lead and is the best example of one showing kindness in so many ways toward others, even toward the unthankful and wicked, encouraging them to repentance. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:6:35-42:6:35" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Lu 6:35;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:2:4-45:2:4" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Ro 2:4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:11:22-45:11:22" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> 11:22;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/56:3:4-56:3:5" data-bid="1-4" class="b"> Tit 3:4, 5</a>) Christians, in turn, under the kindly yoke of Christ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:11:30-40:11:30" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Mt 11:30</a>), are urged to clothe themselves with kindness (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:3:12-51:3:12" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Col 3:12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:4:32-49:4:32" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Eph 4:32</a>) and to develop the fruitage of God’s spirit, which includes kindness. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:5:22-48:5:22" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ga 5:22</a>) In this way they recommend themselves as God’s ministers.

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“Kindness” (or, reasonableness; literally, yieldingness; Gr., <em>e·pi·ei·kiʹa</em>) is an outstanding characteristic of Christ Jesus. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:10:1-47:10:1" data-bid="7-1" class="b">2Co 10:1</a>, ftn) Paul was treated with unusual “human kindness” (literally, affection for mankind; Gr., <em>phi·lan·thro·piʹa</em>) by the inhabitants of Malta.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:28:2-44:28:2" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Ac 28:2</a>, ftn.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><strong>Loving-Kindness of God.</strong> As in the Christian Greek Scriptures so also in the Hebrew Scriptures, frequent mention is made of kindness. The Hebrew word <em>cheʹsedh,</em> when used in reference to kindness, occurs 245 times. The related verb <em>cha·sadhʹ</em> means “act in loyalty (or, loving-kindness)” and carries with it more than just the thought of tender regard or kindness stemming from love, though it includes such traits. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:18:25-19:18:25" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ps 18:25</a>, ftn) <em>Cheʹsedh</em> is kindness that lovingly attaches itself to an object until its purpose <span id="page154" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="154" data-before-text="154"></span>in connection with that object is realized. According to the <em>Theological Dictionary of the Old Testament, cheʹsedh</em> “is active, social, and enduring. . . . [<em>Cheʹsedh</em>] always designates not just a human attitude, but also the act that emerges from this attitude. It is an act that preserves or promotes life. It is intervention on behalf of someone suffering misfortune or distress. It is demonstration of friendship or piety. It pursues what is good and not what is evil.” (Edited by G. J. Botterweck and H. Ringgren, 1986, Vol. 5, p. 51) Hence, <em>cheʹsedh</em> is more comprehensively rendered “loving-kindness,” or, because of the fidelity, solidarity, and proved loyalty associated with it, an alternate translation would be “loyal love.” In the plural number it may be rendered “loving-kindnesses,” “acts of loyal love,” “full loving-kindness,” or “full loyal love.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:25:6-19:25:6" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ps 25:6</a>, ftn; <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:55:3-23:55:3" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Isa 55:3</a>, ftn.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Loving-kindness is a precious quality of Jehovah God in which he delights, and it is manifest in all his dealings with his servants.

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">With the development of the nation of Israel and thereafter, Jehovah’s loving-kindness in connection with his covenant continued to be magnified.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:20:6-20:20:6" data-bid="67-1" class="b">Pr 20:6</a>) Saul and David both remembered the loving-kindness that others had shown (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:15:6-9:15:7" data-bid="68-1" class="b">1Sa 15:6, 7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:2:5-10:2:6" data-bid="68-2" class="b"> 2Sa 2:5, 6</a>), and it seems that the kings of Israel gained some sort of reputation for loving-kindness (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:20:31-11:20:31" data-bid="69-1" class="b">1Ki 20:31</a>), perhaps in comparison with the pagan rulers. However, on one occasion David’s display of loving-kindness was rebuffed through a misinterpretation of the motives behind it.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:10:2-10:10:4" data-bid="70-1" class="b">2Sa 10:2-4</a>.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Law, Paul says, was not made for righteous persons but for bad people, who, among other things, are lacking in loving-kindness. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:1:9-54:1:9" data-bid="71-1" class="b">1Ti 1:9</a>) The Greek word <em>a·noʹsi·os,</em> here rendered “lacking loving-kindness,” also has the sense of “disloyal.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:2-55:3:2" data-bid="72-1" class="b">2Ti 3:2</a>.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb"><strong>Undeserved Kindness.</strong> The Greek word <em>khaʹris</em> occurs more than 150 times in the Greek Scriptures and is rendered in a variety of ways, depending on the context. In all instances the central idea of <em>khaʹris</em> is preserved​—that which is agreeable (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:2:19-60:2:20" data-bid="73-1" class="b">1Pe 2:19, 20</a>) and winsome. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:4:22-42:4:22" data-bid="74-1" class="b">Lu 4:22</a>) By extension, in some instances it refers to a kind gift (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:16:3-46:16:3" data-bid="75-1" class="b">1Co 16:3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:8:19-47:8:19" data-bid="75-2" class="b"> 2Co 8:19</a>) or the kind manner of the giving.

<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">On the other hand, in the great majority of occurrences, <em>khaʹris</em> is rendered “grace” by most English Bible translators. The word “grace,” however, with some 14 different meanings does not convey to most readers the ideas contained in the Greek word. To illustrate: In <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:1:14-43:1:14" data-bid="78-1" class="b">John 1:14</a>, where the <em>King James Version</em> says “the Word was made flesh . . . full of grace and truth,” what is meant? Does it mean “gracefulness,” or “favor,” or what?</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">Scholar R. C. Trench, in <em>Synonyms of the New Testament,</em> says <em>khaʹris</em> implies “a favour freely done, without claim or expectation of return​—the word being thus predisposed to receive its new emphasis [as given it in the Christian writings] . . . , to set forth the entire and absolute freeness of the loving-kindness of God to men. Thus Aristotle, defining [<em>khaʹris</em>], lays the whole stress on this very point, that it is conferred freely, with no expectation of return, and finding its only motive in the bounty and free-heartedness of the giver.” (London, 1961, p. 158) Joseph H. Thayer in his lexicon says: “The word [<em>khaʹris</em>] contains the idea of <em>kindness which bestows upon one what he has not deserved</em> . . . the N. T. writers use [<em>khaʹris</em>] pre-eminently of that kindness by which God bestows favors even upon the ill-deserving, and grants to sinners the pardon of their offences, and bids them accept of eternal salvation through Christ.” (<em>A Greek-English Lexicon of the New Testament,</em> 1889, p. 666) <em>Khaʹris</em> is closely related to another Greek word, <em>khaʹri·sma,</em> concerning which William Barclay’s <em>New Testament Wordbook</em> (1956, p. 29) says: “The whole basic idea of the word [<em>khaʹri·sma</em>] is that of a free and undeserved gift, of something given to a man unearned and unmerited.”​—Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:1:11-47:1:11" data-bid="79-1" class="b">2Co 1:11</a>, <em>Int.</em></p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">When <em>khaʹris</em> is used in the above sense, in reference to kindness bestowed on one who does not deserve it, as is true with the kindnesses extended by Jehovah, “undeserved kindness” is a very good English equivalent for the Greek expression.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:15:40-44:15:40" data-bid="80-1" class="b">Ac 15:40;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:18:27-44:18:27" data-bid="80-2" class="b"> 18:27;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:4:10-60:4:10" data-bid="80-3" class="b"> 1Pe 4:10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:5:10-60:5:10" data-bid="80-4" class="b"> 5:10,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:5:12-60:5:12" data-bid="80-5" class="b"> 12</a>.</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">A worker is entitled to what he has worked for, his pay; he expects his wages as a right, as a debt owed him, and payment of it is no gift or special undeserved kindness. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:4:4-45:4:4" data-bid="81-1" class="b">Ro 4:4</a>) But for sinners condemned to death (and we are all born as such) to be released from that condemnation and to be declared righteous, this is indeed kindness that is totally undeserved.

<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">This special manifestation of undeserved kindness on God’s part toward mankind in general was the release by ransom from condemnation through the blood of Jehovah’s beloved Son, <span id="page156" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="156" data-before-text="156"></span>Christ Jesus. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:1:7-49:1:7" data-bid="84-1" class="b">Eph 1:7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:2:4-49:2:7" data-bid="84-2" class="b"> 2:4-7</a>) By means of this undeserved kindness God brings salvation to all sorts of men (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/56:2:11-56:2:11" data-bid="85-1" class="b">Tit 2:11</a>), something that the prophets had spoken about. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:1:10-60:1:10" data-bid="86-1" class="b">1Pe 1:10</a>) Paul’s reasoning and argument, therefore, is sound: “Now if it is by undeserved kindness, it is no longer due to works; otherwise, the undeserved kindness no longer proves to be undeserved kindness.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:11:6-45:11:6" data-bid="87-1" class="b">Ro 11:6</a>.</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">Paul, more than any other writer, mentioned God’s undeserved kindness​—more than 90 times in his 14 letters. He mentions the undeserved kindness of God or of Jesus in the opening salutation of all his letters with the exception of Hebrews, and in the closing remarks of each letter, without exception, he again speaks of it.

<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">Paul had every reason for emphasizing Jehovah’s undeserved kindness, for he had formerly been “a blasphemer and a persecutor and an insolent man.” “Nevertheless,” he explains, “I was shown mercy, because I was ignorant and acted with a lack of faith. But the undeserved kindness of our Lord abounded exceedingly along with faith and love that is in connection with Christ Jesus.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:1:13-54:1:14" data-bid="89-1" class="b">1Ti 1:13, 14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:15:10-46:15:10" data-bid="89-2" class="b"> 1Co 15:10</a>) Paul did not spurn such undeserved kindness, as some have foolishly done (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/65:1:4-65:1:4" data-bid="90-1" class="b">Jude 4</a>), but he gladly accepted it with thanksgiving and urged others also who accept it ‘not to miss its purpose.’​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:20:24-44:20:24" data-bid="91-1" class="b">Ac 20:24;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:2:21-48:2:21" data-bid="91-2" class="b"> Ga 2:21;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:6:1-47:6:1" data-bid="91-3" class="b"> 2Co 6:1</a>.</p>

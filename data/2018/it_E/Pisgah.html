<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">(Pisʹgah).</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">An elevated place in the northern section of the Abarim mountain range immediately E of the Dead Sea. The exact location is unknown. Bible references are not in conflict with its suggested identity with Ras es-Siyaghah, a headland located about 16 km (10 mi) E of where the Jordan empties into the Dead Sea. Ras es-Siyaghah is a little NW of Jebel en-Neba, the summit traditionally known as Mount Nebo (Har Nevo).</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The physical features of these two elevations are in agreement with the Bible’s brief description. Ras es-Siyaghah is about 100 m (330 ft) lower in elevation than Jebel en-Neba and is separated from the latter by a slight depression, or saddle. Though slightly lower than its neighbor summit, Ras es-Siyaghah is closer to Jericho and affords an unobstructed view of the Dead Sea some 1,000 m (3,300 ft) below, as well as a splendid view of the Jordan Valley, of the central range on which Hebron, Bethlehem and Jerusalem are situated, and of Mount Hermon over 160 km (100 mi) to the N.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The first mention of this place is in connection with the campsites along the line of Israel’s march toward the Promised Land. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:21:20-4:21:20" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Nu 21:20</a>) It was located in the southern part of that territory taken in the conquest of the Amorites after their king, Sihon, refused to let the Israelites pass through the land. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:4:46-5:4:46" data-bid="2-1" class="b">De 4:46,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:4:49-5:4:49" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 49;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:12:1-6:12:3" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> Jos 12:1-3</a>) Later, Balak the king of Moab took Balaam “to the field of Zophim, to the top of Pisgah,” in a vain attempt to have the Israelites cursed.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:23:14-4:23:14" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Nu 23:14</a>.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Pisgah, however, is best remembered in connection with Moses’ extensive view of the Promised Land shortly before his death. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:3:27-5:3:27" data-bid="4-1" class="b">De 3:27;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:34:1-5:34:3" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 34:1-3</a>) Pisgah was designated as part of Reuben’s tribal territory.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:3:16-5:3:17" data-bid="5-1" class="b">De 3:16, 17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:13:15-6:13:15" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Jos 13:15,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:13:20-6:13:20" data-bid="5-3" class="b"> 20</a>.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Wherever the name Pisgah occurs in the Bible, it is always qualified by such expressions as “the head of,” “the top of,” or “the slopes of” Pisgah. As a consequence it is frequently referred to as <em>Mount</em> Pisgah, though not so in the Scriptures.</p>

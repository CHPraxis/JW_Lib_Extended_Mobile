<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">The name given by Jacob to the first altar that he built after he returned from Haran.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">As a result of his encounter at Peniel with the angel of Jehovah, Jacob was given the name Israel, and after a peaceable meeting with his brother Esau, he dwelt at Succoth and then Shechem. Here he acquired a tract of land from the sons of Hamor and pitched his tent upon it. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:32:24-1:32:30" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ge 32:24-30;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:33:1-1:33:4" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 33:1-4,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:33:17-1:33:19" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> 17-19</a>) “After that he set up there an altar and called it God the God of Israel,” or “God Is the God of Israel.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:33:20-1:33:20" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ge 33:20</a>) In identifying himself by his newly given name Israel with the name of the altar, Jacob indicated his acceptance and appreciation of that name and of God’s guiding him safely back into the Promised Land. The expression occurs only once in the Scriptures.</p>

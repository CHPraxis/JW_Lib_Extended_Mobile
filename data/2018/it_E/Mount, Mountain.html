<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb"><strong>Figurative and Prophetic Use.</strong> Sometimes the term “mountain” applies to the soil, vegetation, and trees on the mountain’s surface.

(Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:64:1-23:64:3" data-bid="38-1" class="b">Isa 64:1-3</a>.)

(Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/34:2:11-34:2:13" data-bid="46-1" class="b">Na 2:11-13</a>.) Regarding Jehovah, David said: “You have made my mountain to stand in strength,” probably meaning that Jehovah had exalted David’s kingdom and firmly established it.

Why do you, O you mountains of peaks, keep watching enviously the mountain that God has desired for himself to dwell in? Even Jehovah himself will reside there forever. . . .

<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb"><strong><em>Obstacles.</em></strong> At times mountains represent obstacles. For example, the obstacles that stood in the way of Israel’s returning from Babylonian exile and those that later prevented progress in the temple rebuilding work were compared to mountains. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:40:1-23:40:4" data-bid="66-1" class="b">Isa 40:1-4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/38:4:7-38:4:7" data-bid="66-2" class="b"> Zec 4:7</a>) Faith can move similar mountainous obstacles and, if it be God’s will, even literal mountains.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:17:20-40:17:20" data-bid="67-1" class="b">Mt 17:20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:21:21-40:21:21" data-bid="67-2" class="b"> 21:21;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:11:23-41:11:23" data-bid="67-3" class="b"> Mr 11:23;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:13:2-46:13:2" data-bid="67-4" class="b"> 1Co 13:2</a>.</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb"><strong><em>Stability, permanence, or loftiness.</em></strong> Stability and permanence are ascribed to the mountains. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:54:10-23:54:10" data-bid="68-1" class="b">Isa 54:10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/35:3:6-35:3:6" data-bid="68-2" class="b"> Hab 3:6</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:46:2-19:46:2" data-bid="69-1" class="b">Ps 46:2</a>.) Therefore, when the psalmist spoke of Jehovah’s righteousness as being like “mountains of God” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:36:6-19:36:6" data-bid="70-1" class="b">Ps 36:6</a>) he may have meant that Jehovah’s righteousness is immovable. Or, since mountains are lofty, this may point to the fact that God’s righteousness by far transcends that of man. (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:55:8-23:55:9" data-bid="71-1" class="b">Isa 55:8, 9</a>.) In connection with the outpouring of the seventh bowl of God’s anger, <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:16:20-66:16:20" data-bid="72-1" class="b">Revelation 16:20</a> says: <span id="page446" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="446" data-before-text="446"></span>“Mountains were not found.” This suggests that not even things as lofty as mountains would escape the outpouring of God’s anger.​—Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:4:23-24:4:26" data-bid="73-1" class="b">Jer 4:23-26</a>.</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb"><strong><em>The mountains rejoice and praise Jehovah.</em></strong> When Jehovah turns his favorable attention to his people, this has a good effect upon the land. Cultivated and cared for, mountain slopes cease to have an unkept appearance, as if mourning in a state of desolation or plague. Therefore, figuratively, the mountains “cry out joyfully” and their beauty and productivity praise Jehovah.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:98:8-19:98:8" data-bid="74-1" class="b">Ps 98:8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:148:7-19:148:9" data-bid="74-2" class="b"> 148:7-9</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:44:23-23:44:23" data-bid="75-1" class="b">Isa 44:23;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:49:13-23:49:13" data-bid="75-2" class="b"> 49:13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:55:12-23:55:13" data-bid="75-3" class="b"> 55:12, 13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:36:1-26:36:12" data-bid="75-4" class="b"> Eze 36:1-12</a>.</p>

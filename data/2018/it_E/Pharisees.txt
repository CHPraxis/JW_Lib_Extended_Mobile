PHARISEES
(Pharʹi·sees).
A prominent religious sect of Judaism existing in the first century C.E. According to some scholars, the name literally means “Separated Ones; Separatists,” referring perhaps to avoidance of ceremonial uncleanness or to separation from Gentiles. Just when the Pharisees had their beginning is not precisely known. The writings of the Jewish historian Josephus indicate that in the time of John Hyrcanus I (latter half of the second century B.C.E.) the Pharisees already formed an influential body. Wrote Josephus: “And so great is their influence with the masses that even when they speak against a king or high priest, they immediately gain credence.”​—Jewish Antiquities, XIII, 288 (x, 5).
Josephus also provides details concerning the beliefs of the Pharisees. He observes: “They believe that souls have power to survive death and that there are rewards and punishments under the earth for those who have led lives of virtue or vice: eternal imprisonment is the lot of evil souls, while the good souls receive an easy passage to a new life.” (Jewish Antiquities, XVIII, 14 [i, 3]) “Every soul, they maintain, is imperishable, but the soul of the good alone passes into another body, while the souls of the wicked suffer eternal punishment.” Regarding their ideas about fate or providence, Josephus reports: “[They] attribute everything to Fate and to God; they hold that to act rightly or otherwise rests, indeed, for the most part with men, but that in each action Fate co-operates.”​—The Jewish War, II, 162, 163 (viii, 14).
The Christian Greek Scriptures reveal that the Pharisees fasted twice each week, tithed scrupulously (Mt 9:14; Mr 2:18; Lu 5:33; 11:42; 18:11, 12), and did not agree with the Sadducees in saying that “there is neither resurrection nor angel nor spirit.” (Ac 23:8) They prided themselves on being righteous (actually, self-righteous) and looked down on the common people. (Lu 18:11, 12; Joh 7:47-49) To impress others with their righteousness, the Pharisees broadened the scripture-containing cases that they wore as safeguards and they enlarged the fringes of their garments. (Mt 23:5) They loved money (Lu 16:14) and desired prominence and flattering titles. (Mt 23:6, 7; Lu 11:43) The Pharisees were so biased in their application of the Law that they made it burdensome for the people, insisting that it be observed according to their concepts and traditions. (Mt 23:4) They completely lost sight of the important matters, namely, justice, mercy, faithfulness, and love of God. (Mt 23:23; Lu 11:41-44) The Pharisees went to great lengths in making proselytes.​—Mt 23:15.
The main issues over which they contended with Christ Jesus involved Sabbath observance (Mt 12:1, 2; Mr 2:23, 24; Lu 6:1, 2), adherence to tradition (Mt 15:1, 2; Mr 7:1-5), and association with sinners and tax collectors (Mt 9:11; Mr 2:16; Lu 5:30). The Pharisees apparently thought that defilement resulted from association with persons who did not observe the Law according to their view of it. (Lu 7:36-39) Therefore, when Christ Jesus associated and even ate with sinners and tax collectors, this prompted them to object. (Lu 15:1, 2) The Pharisees found fault with Jesus and his disciples because of their not practicing the traditional washing of hands. (Mt 15:1, 2; Mr 7:1-5; Lu 11:37, 38) But Jesus exposed their wrong reasoning and showed them to be violators of God’s law on account of their adherence to man-made traditions. (Mt 15:3-11; Mr 7:6-15; Lu 11:39-44) Rather than rejoicing and glorifying God in connection with the miraculous cures performed by Christ Jesus on the Sabbath, the Pharisees were filled with rage over what they deemed a violation of the Sabbath law and therefore plotted to kill Jesus. (Mt 12:9-14; Mr 3:1-6; Lu 6:7-11; 14:1-6) To a blind man whom Jesus had cured on the Sabbath they said concerning Jesus: “This is not a man from God, because he does not observe the Sabbath.”​—Joh 9:16.
The attitude the Pharisees displayed showed that they were not righteous and clean inside. (Mt 5:20; 23:26) Like the rest of the Jews, they were in need of repentance. (Compare Mt 3:7, 8; Lu 7:30.) But the majority of them preferred to remain spiritually blind (Joh 9:40) and intensified their opposition to the Son of God. (Mt 21:45, 46; Joh 7:32; 11:43-53, 57) There were Pharisees who falsely accused Jesus of expelling demons by means of the ruler of the demons (Mt 9:34; 12:24) and of being a false witness. (Joh 8:13) Certain Pharisees tried to intimidate the Son of God (Lu 13:31), demanded that he display a sign to them (Mt 12:38; 16:1; Mr 8:11), endeavored to trap him in his speech (Mt 22:15; Mr 12:13; Lu 11:53, 54), and otherwise tried to test him by questionings (Mt 19:3; 22:34-36; Mr 10:2; Lu 17:20). Jesus finally silenced their questionings by asking them how it would be possible for David’s lord also to be David’s son. (Mt 22:41-46) The mob that later seized Jesus in the garden of Gethsemane included Pharisees (Joh 18:3-5, 12, 13), and Pharisees were among those who requested that Pilate secure Jesus’ tomb so that the body could not be stolen.​—Mt 27:62-64.
During the earthly ministry of Christ Jesus, the Pharisees exerted such great influence that prominent persons were afraid to confess him openly. (Joh 12:42, 43) One of such fearful ones evidently was Nicodemus, himself a Pharisee. (Joh 3:1, 2; 7:47-52; 19:39) There may also have been Pharisees who did not manifest bitter opposition or who later became Christians. For example, the Pharisee Gamaliel counseled against interfering with the work of Christians (Ac 5:34-39), and the Pharisee Saul (Paul) of Tarsus became an apostle of Jesus Christ.​—Ac 26:5; Php 3:5.

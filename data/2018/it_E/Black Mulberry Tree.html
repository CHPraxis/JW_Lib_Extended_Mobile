<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Also called the sycamine, this tree is mentioned but once, in Jesus’ statement to the apostles relative to their faith. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:17:5-42:17:6" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Lu 17:5, 6</a>, ftn) The Greek word used was regularly applied to the mulberry tree, and the black mulberry (<em>Morus nigra</em>) is commonly cultivated in Israel. It is a sturdy tree growing to a height of about 6 m (20 ft), with large heart-shaped leaves and dark-red or black fruit resembling the blackberry.</p>

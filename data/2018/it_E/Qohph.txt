QOHPH
[ק].
The 19th letter of the Hebrew alphabet. In translating Hebrew names where it occurs, qohph is usually represented in English by “c” or “k,” as in “Cainan” and “Kish.” The sound is stronger than that of the letter kaph [כ] and is pronounced farther back in the throat, as a strong English “q” formed at the back of the palate. In the Hebrew, it is the initial letter in each of the eight verses in Psalm 119:145-152.

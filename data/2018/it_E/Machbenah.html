<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The name appears in a list of Caleb’s descendants through his concubine Maacah, her son Sheva being called “the father of Machbenah and the father of Gibea.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:2:48-13:2:49" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1Ch 2:48, 49</a>) Some commentators, noting that many of the names in this section also occur as names of towns, suggest that Machbenah may be the name of a town founded or ‘fathered’ by Sheva.</p>

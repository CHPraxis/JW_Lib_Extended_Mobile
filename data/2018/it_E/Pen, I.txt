PEN, I
A small enclosure for animals. (Zep 2:6; see SHEEPFOLD.) In Micah’s prophecy, regathered and united Israel is likened to “a flock in the pen.” (Mic 2:12, NW; Le) The Masoretic text here uses the Hebrew word bots·rahʹ, which is elsewhere rendered “Bozrah,” the name of a city of Edom and a city of Moab. However, in view of the phraseology of Micah 2:12, some scholars feel that bots·rahʹ also means a “pen” or “fold.” (JP, Mo) If the word should be vowel pointed slightly differently, it would correspond closely to the Arabic sirat (pen).

MUTH-LABBEN
(Muth-labʹben).
An expression included in the superscription of one of David’s psalms (Ps 9), traditionally said to mean “[concerning] the death of the son.” Some commentators suggest that it indicated to the musical director the name or perhaps the opening words of a familiar song that furnished the melody to be used in singing this psalm. One possibility of the word’s meaning is advanced by the Targum, in which the superscription of Psalm 9 reads: “On the death of the man who came forth from between the camps,” alluding to a champion. The apparent reference here is to Goliath, the Philistine champion whom David defeated in battle between the Israelite and Philistine encampments.​—1Sa 17:45-51.

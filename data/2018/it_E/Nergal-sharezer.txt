NERGAL-SHAREZER
(Nerʹgal-shar·eʹzer) [from Akkadian, meaning “May Nergal Protect the King”].
1. A Babylonian prince of Nebuchadnezzar’s time.​—Jer 39:3.
2. Another important prince in Nebuchadnezzar’s forces at the overthrow of Jerusalem, distinguished from No. 1 by the added title Rabmag. It was this Rabmag who assisted in the release of Jeremiah.​—Jer 39:3, 13, 14.
Because this name bears such a striking resemblance to that found in Babylonian inscriptions (Nergal-shar-usur), some scholars think this prince was Neriglissar (Greek form), believed to be the successor of King Evil-merodach (Awil-Marduk).​—Ancient Near Eastern Texts, edited by J. Pritchard, 1974, p. 308.

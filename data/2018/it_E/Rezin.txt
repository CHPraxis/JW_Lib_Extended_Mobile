REZIN
(Reʹzin).
1. King of Syria who reigned in Damascus during parts of the reigns of King Jotham (777-762 B.C.E.) of Judah and his son King Ahaz (whose reign ended in 746 B.C.E.).
Evidently near the end of Jotham’s reign, Rezin joined with Pekah the king of Israel in warring against Judah. (2Ki 15:36-38) During the warfare, which continued into the reign of Ahaz, the Syrians, evidently under Rezin, captured many Judeans and took them to Damascus. (2Ch 28:5) Also, Rezin wrested from Judah the city of Elath on the Gulf of ʽAqaba, clearing out the Jews and restoring the city to the Edomites. (2Ki 16:6) The combined Syro-Israelite forces laid siege to Jerusalem, intending to make “the son of Tabeel” its king, but they were unable to capture the city. (2Ki 16:5; Isa 7:1, 6) The situation greatly frightened Ahaz, despite Isaiah’s assurance that Rezin of Syria and Pekah of Israel need cause no fear. (Isa 7:3-12; 8:6, 7) Ahaz turned to Assyria for help, bribing Tiglath-pileser III to attack Syria.​—2Ki 16:7, 8; 2Ch 28:16, 20.
Tiglath-pileser III warred against Damascus, capturing it and putting Rezin to death. Syria thus came under Assyrian domination.​—2Ki 16:9.
2. The father of a certain family of Nethinim, some of whom returned to Jerusalem from Babylon in 537 B.C.E.​—Ezr 2:1, 43, 48; Ne 7:6, 46, 50.

PILLORY
(pilʹlo·ry).
A device for confining the neck and arms; used to punish offenders by exposing them to public ridicule. At Jeremiah 29:26, “pillory” is translated from the Hebrew word tsi·noqʹ.
From exile in Babylon, the false prophet Shemaiah wrote to the priests in Jerusalem, urging that Jeremiah be rebuked and put in the pillory.

HA-ELEPH
(Ha-eʹleph) [The Ox; The Cow].
A city of Benjamin, the site of which is today unknown. (Jos 18:21, 28) Some scholars think that Ha-eleph may actually be part of the name of the preceding city, “Zelah.” However, those who would combine “Zelah” with “Ha-eleph” thereby reduce the number of cities to 13, and this does not agree with the Bible’s reference to 14 cities.

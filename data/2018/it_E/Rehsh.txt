REHSH
[ר] (or, as commonly Anglicized, resh).
The 20th letter of the Hebrew alphabet. Because of the similarity in form between rehsh [ר] and daʹleth [ד], the two were sometimes confused by copyists.
In the Hebrew, this letter appears as the initial letter in each of the eight verses of Psalm 119:153-160.

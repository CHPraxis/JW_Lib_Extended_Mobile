<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">(Shaʹphir) [Elegant; Polished; Agreeable].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A place, evidently in Judah, the inhabitants of which were included in Micah’s prophecy of judgment that was due to come upon Judah and Jerusalem. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/33:1:11-33:1:11" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Mic 1:11</a>) In this section of the prophecy, Micah makes a frequent play on words in his usage of the place-names. (See <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200000684/">BETH-EZEL</a>.) A tentative identification of Shaphir is with Khirbet el-Kaum, about 15 km (9.5 mi) W of Hebron.</p>

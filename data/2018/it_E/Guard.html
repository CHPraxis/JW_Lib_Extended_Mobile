<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">In the pre-Christian Scriptures the noun “guard” is drawn, in many instances, from the Hebrew verb <em>sha·marʹ,</em> meaning “guard; keep; observe; watch.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:3:24-1:3:24" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ge 3:24;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:17:9-1:17:9" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 17:9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:37:11-1:37:11" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> 37:11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:26:15-9:26:15" data-bid="1-4" class="b"> 1Sa 26:15</a>) The workmen rebuilding Jerusalem’s wall under Nehemiah’s direction served also as guards at night.

<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">It was the practice in Roman prisons to chain a prisoner to a soldier guard or, for maximum security, to two guards, as Peter was.

<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">The Roman Praetorian Guard was formed by Caesar Augustus in 13 B.C.E. to serve as imperial bodyguards. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:1:12-50:1:13" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Php 1:12, 13</a>) Emperor Tiberius had this guard encamped permanently near the walls of Rome and by means of them held in check any unruliness of the people. This attached great importance to the commander of the guard, whose force came to amount to about 10,000 men. In time the Praetorian Guard became so powerful that it was able both to put emperors into office and to dethrone them.</p>

JOEL, BOOK OF
An inspired book of the Hebrew Scriptures written by “Joel the son of Pethuel.” (Joe 1:1) Virtually nothing is known about this prophet’s life. From his references to Judah, Jerusalem, and Jehovah’s house there, it may be inferred that he prophesied in Judah and perhaps resided in Jerusalem. (1:9, 14; 2:17, 32; 3:1, 2, 16-20) The fact that he mentioned “the low plain of Jehoshaphat” (3:2, 12) implies that he wrote his book after Jehovah’s great victory on behalf of King Jehoshaphat. But the exact period involved is in question.
Time of Writing. Scholars variously assign the book of Joel dates from before 800 B.C.E. to about 400 B.C.E. Regarding their arguments in favor of a late or an early composition for the book, The International Standard Bible Encyclopædia (edited by James Orr, 1960, Vol. III, p. 1690) observes: “Many of the arguments adduced are of a negative kind, i.e. consideration of what the prophet does not mention or refer to [including the Chaldeans, the Assyrians, a Judean king, and the ten-tribe kingdom], and the argument from silence is notoriously precarious.” Similarly, whether Joel quoted other prophets or was quoted by them cannot be established with certainty. A date after the Babylonian exile would be indicated if Joel (2:32) quoted Obadiah (17). On the other hand, not only Obadiah but even the much earlier prophet Amos (compare Joe 3:16 with Am 1:2) may have quoted from Joel. This would mean that Joel wrote his book no later than the time of Uzziah (Am 1:1), perhaps about 820 B.C.E. Though not conclusive, the place occupied by the book of Joel in the Hebrew canon between Hosea and Amos seems to favor the earlier period.
Authenticity. The Jews did not question the canonicity of the book of Joel but placed it second among the “minor” prophets. It also harmonizes completely with the rest of the Scriptures, as is evident from the numerous parallels between Joel and other Bible books. (Compare Joe 2:2 with Zep 1:14, 15; Joe 2:4, 5, 10 with Re 9:2, 7-9; Joe 2:11 with Mal 4:5; Joe 2:12 with Jer 4:1; Joe 2:13 with Ex 34:6, Nu 14:18, Ps 86:15, and 106:45; Joe 2:31 with Isa 13:9, 10, Mt 24:29, 30, and Re 6:12-17.) The fulfillment of Joel’s prophecies furnishes yet another argument for its authenticity. As foretold, Tyre, Philistia, and Edom experienced Jehovah’s judgments. (Joe 3:4, 19; for details, see EDOM, EDOMITES; PHILISTIA, PHILISTINES; TYRE.) On the day of Pentecost in the year 33 C.E., the apostle Peter showed that the outpouring of God’s spirit upon the disciples of Jesus Christ was a fulfillment of Joel’s prophecy. (Joe 2:28-32; Ac 2:17-21) Later, the apostle Paul applied the prophetic words found at Joel 2:32 to both Jews and non-Jews who call upon Jehovah in faith.​—Ro 10:12, 13.

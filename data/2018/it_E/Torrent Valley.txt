TORRENT VALLEY
The Hebrew word naʹchal may denote either the valley through which a stream flows (Ge 26:19; 2Ki 3:16; Job 30:6; Ca 6:11) or the stream itself. (1Ki 17:4; Ps 110:7) Regarding the word naʹchal, A. P. Stanley, in his book Sinai and Palestine (1885, p. 590), observes: “No English word is exactly equivalent, but perhaps ‘torrent-bed’ most nearly expresses it.” A Hebrew and Aramaic lexicon by Koehler and Baumgartner lists “torrent-valley” as one of its definitions. (Lexicon in Veteris Testamenti Libros, Leiden, 1958, p. 607) The term “wadi” (Arabic) is also used to designate a torrent valley.​—Ge 32:23, ftn.
The Promised Land is described as “a land of torrent valleys of water, springs and watery deeps issuing forth in the valley plain and in the mountainous region.” (De 8:7) Some of the streams are fed by springs and are therefore perennial, whereas others are torrents during the rainy season but dry up completely during the rainless season. (1Ki 17:7; 18:5) Faithful Job compared the treacherous dealings of his brothers toward him to a winter torrent that dries up in the summer.​—Job 6:15.
Among the torrent valleys mentioned in the Bible are those of the Arabah (Am 6:14), Arnon (De 2:36), Besor (1Sa 30:9), Cherith (1Ki 17:3), Egypt (Jos 15:4), Eshcol (Nu 13:23), Gerar (Ge 26:17), Jabbok (De 2:37), Kanah (Jos 16:8), Kidron (2Sa 15:23), Kishon (Jg 4:7), Sorek (Jg 16:4), and Zered (De 2:13; see the torrent valleys under their respective names). Other torrent valleys that are not mentioned but are principal tributaries of the Jordan are the Yarmuk and the Farʽah.

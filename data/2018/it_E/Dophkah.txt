DOPHKAH
(Dophʹkah) [possibly, Driven; Shoved].
The first stopping place for the Israelites after leaving the Wilderness of Sin on their way to the Promised Land. (Nu 33:12, 13) The Bible does not indicate its exact geographic location. However, many scholars associate Dophkah with the Egyptian Mafqat, a district named for the turquoise mined since ancient times around Sarabit el-Khadim, about 34 km (21 mi) E of modern-day Abu Zanima on the Sinai Peninsula.

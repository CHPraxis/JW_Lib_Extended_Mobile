<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A descriptive designation applied to the “king of Babylon.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:14:4-23:14:4" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Isa 14:4,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:14:12-23:14:12" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 12</a>) The Hebrew expression thus translated (<em>NW, Ro, Yg</em>) comes from a root meaning “shine.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:29:3-18:29:3" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Job 29:3</a>) The rendering “Lucifer” (<em>KJ, Da</em>) is derived from the Latin <em>Vulgate.</em></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The “shining one” is represented as saying in his heart: “Above the stars of God I shall lift up my throne, and I shall sit down upon the mountain of meeting.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:14:13-23:14:13" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Isa 14:13</a>) Biblical evidence points to Mount Zion as the “mountain of meeting.” (See <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200003126/">MOUNTAIN OF MEETING</a>.) Hence, since stars can refer to kings (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:24:17-4:24:17" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Nu 24:17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:22:16-66:22:16" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Re 22:16</a>), “the stars of God” must be the kings of the Davidic line who ruled from Mount Zion. The “king of Babylon” (the dynasty of Babylonian kings), reflecting the attitude of Satan the god of this system of things, indicated his ambition to lift up his throne “above the stars of God” by desiring to make the kings of the line of David mere vassals and then finally to dethrone them. Like stars that shed light, the “king of Babylon” shone brightly in the ancient world and could be termed “shining one.”</p>

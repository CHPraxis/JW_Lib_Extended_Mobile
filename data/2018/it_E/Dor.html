<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">One of the Palestinian cities that allied with Canaanite King Jabin of Hazor to fight against Joshua (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:11:1-6:11:2" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Jos 11:1, 2</a>) and was summarily defeated.

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The city of Dor is usually identified with Khirbet el-Burj (Tel Dor), 13 km (8 mi) N of Caesarea, on the long narrow coastal plain stretching along the Mediterranean Sea. This location on the coastal plain has caused some discussion as to the meaning of the frequently used phrase “the mountain ridges [from the Heb. <em>na·phahʹ</em>] of Dor.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:11:2-6:11:2" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Jos 11:2</a>) Some scholars believe this refers to the cliffs that line much of the coast in this region, thus associating the Hebrew <em>na·phahʹ</em> with the Arabic term <em>nafnaf,</em> meaning “cliff, precipice.” Others believe it may indicate the hilly slopes that begin 3 km (2 mi) inland from Dor and culminate in the heights of Mount Carmel.</p>

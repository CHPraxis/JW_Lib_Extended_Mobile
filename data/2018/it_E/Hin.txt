HIN
A liquid measure (Ex 30:24; Nu 28:14; Eze 45:24; 46:5, 7, 11); also used with reference to the container for measuring a hin. (Le 19:36) According to the Jewish historian Josephus, a hin equaled two Athenian choes; a bath equaled 72 sextarii. (Jewish Antiquities, III, 197 [viii, 3]; VIII, 57 [ii, 9]) Since other sources indicate that two Athenian choes amounted to 12 sextarii, the hin may be reckoned at one sixth of a bath measure or about 3.67 L (7.75 pt).
The Scriptures also mention fractions of a hin: a half, a third, a fourth, and a sixth; this last was the daily water ration allowed Ezekiel when depicting the severe condition to come upon Jerusalem under siege.​—Ex 29:40; Le 23:13; Nu 15:4-7, 9, 10; 28:5, 7; Eze 4:11; 46:14.

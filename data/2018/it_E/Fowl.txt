FOWL
Although the English word “fowl” is mainly used today to refer to a large or edible bird, the Hebrew term (ʽohph), derived from the verb “fly,” applied to all winged or flying creatures. (Ge 1:20-22) G. R. Driver said that ʽohph “seems to represent the rhythmical beating of wings on the air and its displacement thereby.” (Palestine Exploration Quarterly, London, 1955, p. 5) The term not only embraced all the birds (Ge 9:10; Le 1:14; 7:26), including quail (Ps 78:27; compare Ex 16:13) and also carrion-eating birds (1Sa 17:44, 46; 2Sa 21:10), but could be applied as well to the winged insects, which are included among the “swarming [Heb, sheʹrets]” winged creatures.​—Le 11:20-23; De 14:19; see SWARMING THING.
The expression “fatted fowl” at 1 Kings 4:23 in KJ and RS is considered under CUCKOO.

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A torrent valley at which the Israelites camped on their way around the frontier of Moab, at the end of the 38 additional years of wandering from the time of the rebellion at Kadesh-barnea. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:21:12-4:21:12" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Nu 21:12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:2:13-5:2:14" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> De 2:13, 14</a>) It is generally identified with the Wadi el-Hasaʼ, the southernmost tributary of the Dead Sea. This valley formed the boundary between Moab and Edom, and over a 56-km (35 mi) stretch, it descends some 1,190 m (3,900 ft), entering the Dead Sea at the SE end. The valley is some 5 to 6 km (3 to 4 mi) across at the top. There is evidence there of a series of Edomite fortresses that served to guard the natural approaches to the S of the Wadi el-Hasaʼ.</p>

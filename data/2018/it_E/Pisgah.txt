PISGAH
(Pisʹgah).
An elevated place in the northern section of the Abarim mountain range immediately E of the Dead Sea. The exact location is unknown. Bible references are not in conflict with its suggested identity with Ras es-Siyaghah, a headland located about 16 km (10 mi) E of where the Jordan empties into the Dead Sea. Ras es-Siyaghah is a little NW of Jebel en-Neba, the summit traditionally known as Mount Nebo (Har Nevo).
The physical features of these two elevations are in agreement with the Bible’s brief description. Ras es-Siyaghah is about 100 m (330 ft) lower in elevation than Jebel en-Neba and is separated from the latter by a slight depression, or saddle. Though slightly lower than its neighbor summit, Ras es-Siyaghah is closer to Jericho and affords an unobstructed view of the Dead Sea some 1,000 m (3,300 ft) below, as well as a splendid view of the Jordan Valley, of the central range on which Hebron, Bethlehem and Jerusalem are situated, and of Mount Hermon over 160 km (100 mi) to the N.
The first mention of this place is in connection with the campsites along the line of Israel’s march toward the Promised Land. (Nu 21:20) It was located in the southern part of that territory taken in the conquest of the Amorites after their king, Sihon, refused to let the Israelites pass through the land. (De 4:46, 49; Jos 12:1-3) Later, Balak the king of Moab took Balaam “to the field of Zophim, to the top of Pisgah,” in a vain attempt to have the Israelites cursed.​—Nu 23:14.
Pisgah, however, is best remembered in connection with Moses’ extensive view of the Promised Land shortly before his death. (De 3:27; 34:1-3) Pisgah was designated as part of Reuben’s tribal territory.​—De 3:16, 17; Jos 13:15, 20.
Wherever the name Pisgah occurs in the Bible, it is always qualified by such expressions as “the head of,” “the top of,” or “the slopes of” Pisgah. As a consequence it is frequently referred to as Mount Pisgah, though not so in the Scriptures.

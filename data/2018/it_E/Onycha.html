<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">An ingredient of the incense designated exclusively for sanctuary use. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:30:34-2:30:37" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ex 30:34-37</a>) Some believe that onycha may have been derived from the closing valves of certain shellfish. However, since this ingredient was used for a sacred purpose, others consider it to have been a vegetable product instead of something obtained from an unclean animal.</p>

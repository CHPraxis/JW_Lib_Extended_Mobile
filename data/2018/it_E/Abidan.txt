ABIDAN
(Abʹi·dan) [(My) Father Has Judged].
The chieftain of the tribe of Benjamin at the time of the census of Israel in the second year following the Exodus from Egypt. (Nu 1:11, 16) He was the head over the 35,400 men of Benjamin over 20 years of age who camped on the W side of the tabernacle.​—Nu 2:18, 22, 23.
At the completion of the tabernacle and its inauguration (1512 B.C.E.), during 12 days each chieftain presented a noncompetitive offering of silver and gold dishware, worth about $1,720, in addition to offerings of grain, oil, incense, and livestock, and it was on the ninth day that Abidan did so. (Nu 7:10, 60-65) He died during the 40-year journey in the wilderness.​—Nu 14:29, 30.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">The Hebrew word <em>sha·lishʹ</em> seems to be related to a root signifying “three.” (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:14:7-2:14:7" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ex 14:7</a>, ftn.) Hence, the plural form <em>sha·li·shimʹ</em> at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:18:6-9:18:6" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Samuel 18:6</a> has been variously translated as “instruments of three strings” (<em>Ro</em>), “three-stringed instruments” (<em>Yg</em>), and as favored by some modern lexicons, “lutes” (<em>NW</em>). The context of this verse suggests a comparatively light musical instrument, for it was played by Israelite women as they sang and danced in celebration of the victories of King Saul and of David.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:18:6-9:18:7" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1Sa 18:6, 7</a>.</p>

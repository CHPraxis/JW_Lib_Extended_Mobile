<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The thorny lotus (<em>Zizyphus lotus</em>) is a thickly branched shrub or low tree, often growing to a height of only 1.5 m (5 ft). The leaves are small, oval, and leathery, and at the base of each leaf is a pair of thorns. The only reference to it is at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:40:21-18:40:22" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Job 40:21, 22</a>, which speaks of Behemoth (the hippopotamus) as lying in the shade cast by the tree. While this tree is found in dry places in Palestine, <em>A Dictionary of Life in Bible Times</em> speaks of it as “flourishing in the hot and humid marshland” of N Africa.​—By W. Corswant, Suffolk, 1960, p. 177.</p>

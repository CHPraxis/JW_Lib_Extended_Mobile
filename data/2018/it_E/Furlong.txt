FURLONG
The Greek word (staʹdi·on) thus translated denotes a linear measure equal to 185 m (625 Roman ft; 606.75 English ft) or 1⁄8 Roman mile. (The Roman mile equals 1,479.5 m; 4,854 ft.) (Re 14:20; 21:16) This is the approximate length of both the Attic and the Roman stadium. This is different from the modern furlong of 201 m (660 ft). At 1 Corinthians 9:24 the term staʹdi·on (stadium) is rendered “race,” the length of the Greek racecourse being one stadium. The stadium of the Olympic course, however, was actually 192 m (630 ft).

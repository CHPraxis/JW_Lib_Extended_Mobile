<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A transparent or translucent precious stone; a variety of corundum. Although sapphires occur in many colors, the deep-blue shades are most highly esteemed. The sapphires referred to in the Bible were apparently blue.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A sapphire was one of the stones in the high priest’s “breastpiece of judgment.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:28:15-2:28:18" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ex 28:15-18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:39:11-2:39:11" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 39:11</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Job, who lived in about the 17th century B.C.E., described the efforts of men in digging deep into the earth to mine gold and precious jewels, and he mentions the sapphire as being among the rare stones so located. But, says Job, valuable as sapphire is and difficult as it is to obtain, wisdom is far superior and cannot be paid for with such stones.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:28:4-18:28:6" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Job 28:4-6,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:28:12-18:28:12" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 12,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:28:16-18:28:16" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> 16</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><strong>Figurative Use.</strong> The lustrous beauty, as well as the pleasurable, captivating, and enthralling effect caused by viewing precious gems, was used figuratively in connection with visions of God’s glory. After the Law covenant was instituted, Moses, Aaron, Nadab, Abihu, and 70 of the older men of Israel received a vision of Jehovah, and beneath his feet “there was what seemed like a work of sapphire flagstones and like the very heavens for purity.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:24:8-2:24:11" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ex 24:8-11</a>) In visions of the glory of Jehovah, Ezekiel twice beheld “the likeness of a throne” that was “like sapphire stone.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:1:1-26:1:1" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Eze 1:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:1:26-26:1:28" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 26-28;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:10:1-26:10:4" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> 10:1-4</a>.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">When Jehovah, as Zion’s husbandly Owner, spoke of her restoration and beautification, he said: “I will lay your foundation with sapphires.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:54:5-23:54:5" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Isa 54:5,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:54:11-23:54:11" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 11</a>) Similarly, the apostle John’s vision of the heavenly New Jerusalem revealed that sapphire was part of its foundations.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:2-66:21:2" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Re 21:2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:19-66:21:19" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 19</a>.</p>

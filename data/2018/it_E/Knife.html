<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A single- or double-edged cutting implement. Knives used in Biblical lands in times past were made of stone (particularly of flint), copper, bronze, or iron.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The Hebrew term <em>ma·ʼakheʹleth,</em> which literally refers to an instrument for eating, is also applied to large knives such as those employed in cutting up the carcasses of sacrificial animals. A “slaughtering knife” (Heb., <em>ma·ʼakheʹleth</em>) was the instrument faithful Abraham took in hand when about to sacrifice Isaac (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:22:6-1:22:6" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ge 22:6,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:22:10-1:22:10" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 10</a>), and the same type was used by a certain Levite to cut the body of his dead concubine into 12 pieces. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:19:29-7:19:29" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Jg 19:29</a>) Also, <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:30:14-20:30:14" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Proverbs 30:14</a> speaks of “a generation whose teeth are swords and whose jawbones are slaughtering knives,” thus employing the same Hebrew term as a figure of rapaciousness.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“Flint knives” were made by Joshua for use in circumcising the sons of Israel at Gibeath-haaraloth. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:5:2-6:5:4" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Jos 5:2-4</a>) Part of the Hebrew term designating these knives is <em>cheʹrev,</em> generally rendered “sword.” (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:5:2-6:5:2" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Jos 5:2</a>, ftn.) The common “Canaanite” flint knife was about 15 cm (6 in.) in length and had a raised center ridge and a double edge.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Scribes and secretaries of ancient times used a type of knife to sharpen their reed pens and to make erasures. <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:36:23-24:36:23" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Jeremiah 36:23</a> tells of the use of a “secretary’s knife” to tear apart a roll of a book prepared by Jeremiah at Jehovah’s direction.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Many ancient knives of copper have a straight blade from 15 to 25 cm (6 to 10 in.) in length; some with curved tips have also been discovered. Handles were often one piece with the blade. Other handles were made of wood and were fastened to the blade.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:23:1-20:23:2" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Proverbs 23:1, 2</a> makes figurative reference to a knife, recommending the ‘putting of a knife to one’s throat’ when eating with a king, evidently emphasizing the need to restrain one’s appetite in such a circumstance.</p>

SPEARMEN
Soldiers armed with spears. They anciently constituted a section of the light infantry, and they were backed up by archers and slingers. Charioteers and cavalrymen often carried spears. Spearmen were a part of the Roman occupational forces in Palestine, 200 of whom were included in secretly escorting Paul out of Jerusalem.​—Ac 23:23.

BILLHOOK
This translates the Hebrew word ma·ʽatsadhʹ, which denotes a tool used for shaping wood, and even iron. (Jer 10:3; Isa 44:12) The root from which this Hebrew term is considered to be drawn has been linked with words in related languages meaning “reap,” “cut off.” Consequently Koehler and Baumgartner define ma·ʽatsadhʹ as “billhook.” (Lexicon in Veteris Testamenti Libros, Leiden, 1958, p. 550) The modern billhook consists of a handle and a blade with a hook-shaped point. However, others understand ma·ʽatsadhʹ to designate a kind of ax, since this is its meaning in late Hebrew, and suggest that it may refer to an adz.

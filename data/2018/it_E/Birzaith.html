<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">(Birʹza·ith).</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A name in the genealogy of Asher of the family of Malchiel. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:7:30-13:7:31" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1Ch 7:30, 31</a>) Because Birzaith is the only name of those listed in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:7:30-13:7:31" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Chronicles 7:30, 31</a> that is not found in the parallel genealogical record of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:46:17-1:46:17" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Genesis 46:17</a>, some consider Birzaith to refer to a site around which the descendants of Malchiel settled, or they think it was an area in which Malchiel was a chief inhabitant, even as Shobal is spoken of as “the father of Kiriath-jearim” and Salma as “the father of Bethlehem.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:2:51-13:2:52" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1Ch 2:51, 52</a>) Supposing Birzaith to have been the name of a place, some would identify it with Birzeit, about 21 km (13 mi) NNW of Jerusalem; but, despite the similarity of the names, Birzeit’s location near the southern border of Ephraim (instead of in the territory of Asher) does not lend support to such an identification.</p>

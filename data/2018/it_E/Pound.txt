POUND
[Gr., liʹtra].
A weight mentioned only at John 12:3 (ftn) and 19:39 (ftn). The Greek term is usually equated with the Roman pound (Lat., libra). Thus it was about 327 g (11.5 oz). Some versions render the Greek word mna as “pound” (Lu 19:18, KJ, Dy, JB, We), but it is more appropriately rendered “mina.” (Da, Fn, NW, Ro) Whereas “pound” is used in the Bible just as a weight or measurement, “mina” is a monetary weight indicating a specific value of gold or silver.

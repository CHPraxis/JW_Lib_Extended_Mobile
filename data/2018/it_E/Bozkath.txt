BOZKATH
(Bozʹkath) [Swollen Thing [that is, an elevated spot]].
A town in the inheritance of Judah (Jos 15:39); home of King Josiah’s maternal grandfather Adaiah. (2Ki 22:1) Listed between Eglon and Lachish, it was apparently in the lowland, or Shephelah region. Its identification is uncertain; some would place it at Dawaʼimeh (present-day Amazya), about 19 km (12 mi) W of Hebron.

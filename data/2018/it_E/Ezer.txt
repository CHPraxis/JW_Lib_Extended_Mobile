EZER
(Eʹzer).
1. [possibly, Store Up]. One of the Horite sheiks in the land of Seir. (Ge 36:20, 21, 30) The Horites were later dispossessed and annihilated by the sons of Esau. (De 2:22) The name Ezer in this case possibly means “Store Up,” because of a difference in the spelling in the original Hebrew. At 1 Chronicles 1:38 it has been misprinted “Ezar” in many modern editions of the King James Version, although it was correct in the edition of 1611 as well as other early editions.
[2-6: Help]

4. The chief one of the 11 valiant Gadites who separated themselves to David in the wilderness while he was still under restriction because of Saul. Being the head, Ezer was evidently the greatest and therefore ‘equal to a thousand.’​—1Ch 12:1, 8, 9, 14.
5. The son of Jeshua, a prince of Mizpah, who shared in repairing a section of the wall of Jerusalem under Nehemiah in 455 B.C.E.​—Ne 3:19.

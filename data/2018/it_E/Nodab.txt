NODAB
(Noʹdab).
One of the confederated groups overwhelmingly defeated with Jehovah’s help by the tribes of Reuben and Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh. (1Ch 5:18-22) Nothing more is known of this tribe, except the possible preservation of the name in that of the village of Nudebe, in the desert E of Palestine.

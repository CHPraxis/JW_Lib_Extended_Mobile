ESHCOL
(Eshʹcol) [Cluster [of Grapes]].
1. A brother of Aner and Mamre the Amorite. (Ge 14:13) Eshcol and his brothers were confederates of Abraham in defeating a league of Eastern kings.​—Ge 14:14, 24; see ANER No. 1.
2. A wadi or torrent valley, probably located a short distance N of Hebron. It was from this valley that the Israelite spies carried off a large cluster of grapes, and the vineyards in this area are still noted for the high quality of their grapes. (Nu 13:23, 24; 32:9; De 1:24) The name possibly resulted from this event during the spying trip.

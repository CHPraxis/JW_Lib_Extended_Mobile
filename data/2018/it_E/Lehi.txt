LEHI
(Leʹhi) [Jawbone].
The scene of one or, possibly, two Israelite victories over the Philistines. Its exact location is unknown today. Some identify it with Khirbet es-Suyag, which perhaps derives its name from the Greek word si·a·gonʹ (jawbone), less than 3 km (2 mi) E of Beth-shemesh.
At Lehi, Samson struck down a thousand Philistines with the moist jawbone of an ass. Subsequently he called the site Ramath-lehi (meaning “Lofty Place of the Jawbone”), probably to memorialize the victory Jehovah had given him there. (Jg 15:9-19) Originally, though, Lehi may have got its name from the shape of its crags.
Later, according to the rendering of numerous translators, Shammah struck down many Philistines assembled at Lehi. (2Sa 23:11, 12; AT, JB, NW, RS) However, the Hebrew term la·chai·yahʹ literally means “into the tent village,” and, by a slight change in vowel pointing, is rendered “to Lehi.”

JABNEEL
(Jabʹne·el) [May God Build; God Has Built].
1. A Judean boundary site (Jos 15:1, 11), probably the same as the Jabneh that King Uzziah (829-778 B.C.E.) wrested from the Philistines. (2Ch 26:6) Jabneel is identified with modern Yavne. Situated about 6 km (3.5 mi) from the Mediterranean Sea, Yavne stands on an isolated, sandy hill 20 km (12 mi) S of Joppa.
2. A boundary site of Naphtali. (Jos 19:32, 33) Although some suggest an identification of the Talmudic Jabneel with Khirbet Yamma, the Biblical Jabneel is identified with Tell en-Naʽam (Tel Yinʽam), near a spring, about 8 km (5 mi) SSW of Tiberias. The name is preserved in the present-day village of Yavneʼel nearby.

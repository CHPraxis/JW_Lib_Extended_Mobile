<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Among true worshipers of Jehovah before the formation of the Christian congregation, priests officially represented God to the people they served, instructing them about God and his laws. In turn, they represented the people before God, offering sacrifices as well as interceding and pleading for the people. <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:5:1-58:5:1" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Hebrews 5:1</a> explains: “Every high priest taken from among men is appointed in behalf of men over the things pertaining to God, that he may offer gifts and sacrifices for sins.” The Hebrew term translated “priest” is <em>ko·henʹ;</em> the Greek, <em>hi·e·reusʹ.</em></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><strong>In Early Times.</strong> In patriarchal times the family head served as priest for his family, the duty passing to the firstborn son in the event of the father’s death. Thus, in very early times we find Noah representing his family in a priestly capacity. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:8:20-1:8:21" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ge 8:20, 21</a>) The family head Abraham had a large household with which he traveled from place <span id="page683" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="683" data-before-text="683"></span>to place, building altars and making sacrifices to Jehovah at his various places of encampment.

However, the Bible does not specifically call these men <em>ko·henʹ</em> or <em>hi·e·reusʹ.</em> On the other hand, Jethro, the family head and the father-in-law of Moses, is called a “priest [<em>ko·henʹ</em>] of Midian.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:2:16-2:2:16" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ex 2:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:3:1-2:3:1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 3:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:18:1-2:18:1" data-bid="7-3" class="b"> 18:1</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Melchizedek king of Salem was a priest (<em>ko·henʹ</em>) extraordinary. The Bible gives no record of his ancestry, his birth, or his death. His priesthood was not by inheritance, and he had no predecessors or successors in office. Melchizedek held both the office of king and of priest. His priesthood was greater than the Levitical priesthood, for Levi, in effect, paid tithes to Melchizedek, since he was still in the loins of Abraham when Abraham offered tithes to Melchizedek and was blessed by him. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:14:18-1:14:20" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Ge 14:18-20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:7:4-58:7:10" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> Heb 7:4-10</a>) In these things Melchizedek foreshadowed Jesus Christ, the “priest forever according to the manner of Melchizedek.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:7:17-58:7:17" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Heb 7:17</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Evidently the family heads acted as priests among the offspring of Jacob (Israel) until the Levitical priesthood was established by God. Hence, when God led the people to Mount Sinai he commanded: “Let the priests also who regularly come near to Jehovah sanctify themselves, that Jehovah may not break out upon them.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:19:22-2:19:22" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ex 19:22</a>) This was before the Levitical priesthood was established. But Aaron, though not yet designated as priest, was allowed to go partially up the mountain with Moses. This circumstance harmonized with the later appointment of Aaron and his posterity as priests. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:19:24-2:19:24" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Ex 19:24</a>) Seen in retrospect, this was an early indication that God had in mind a superseding of the old arrangement (of family-head priesthood) by means of a priesthood of Aaron’s house.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><strong>Under the Law Covenant.</strong> When the Israelites were in slavery in Egypt, Jehovah sanctified to himself every firstborn son of Israel at the time that he destroyed Egypt’s firstborn in the tenth plague. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:12:29-2:12:29" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Ex 12:29;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:3:13-4:3:13" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> Nu 3:13</a>) These firstborn ones accordingly belonged to Jehovah, to be used exclusively in special service to him. God could have designated all of these firstborn males of Israel as the priests and caretakers of the sanctuary. Instead, it suited his purpose to take male members of the tribe of Levi for this service. For this reason he permitted the nation to substitute the Levite males for the firstborn males of the other 12 tribes (the offspring of Joseph’s sons Ephraim and Manasseh being counted as two tribes). In a census there proved to be 273 more firstborn non-Levite sons from a month old and upward than there were Levite males, so God required a ransom price of five shekels ($11) for each of the 273, the money being turned over to Aaron and his sons. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:3:11-4:3:16" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Nu 3:11-16,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:3:40-4:3:51" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 40-51</a>) Prior to this transaction Jehovah had already set apart the male members of the family of Aaron of the tribe of Levi as constituting the priesthood of Israel.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:1:1-4:1:1" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Nu 1:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:3:6-4:3:10" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> 3:6-10</a>.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">For a long period of time Israel had the exclusive opportunity to supply the members of “a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:19:6-2:19:6" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Ex 19:6</a>) But that opportunity ceased to be exclusively theirs because of the national rejection of God’s Son.​—Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:21:43-40:21:43" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Mt 21:43;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:2:7-60:2:10" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> 1Pe 2:7-10</a>.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Initially, Israel’s King was Jehovah. Later Jehovah directed that the kingship be vested in the line of David. Jehovah was still their invisible King but used the Davidic line as his representatives, as to secular rulership. As such, these earthly kings were said to sit on “Jehovah’s throne.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:29:23-13:29:23" data-bid="17-1" class="b">1Ch 29:23</a>) But the priesthood was still kept separate, in the line of Aaron. Therefore to that nation alone belonged both the kingdom and the priesthood of Jehovah God with its “sacred service.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:9:3-45:9:4" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Ro 9:3, 4</a>.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb"><strong><em>Inauguration of the priesthood.</em></strong> The appointment of a priest must come from God; a man does not take the office of his own accord. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:5:4-58:5:4" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Heb 5:4</a>) Accordingly, Jehovah himself appointed Aaron and his house to the priesthood “to time indefinite,” separating them from the family of the Kohathites, one of the three main divisions of the tribe of Levi. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:6:16-2:6:16" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Ex 6:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:28:43-2:28:43" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> 28:43</a>) First, however, Moses the Levite, as mediator of the Law covenant, represented God in the sanctification of Aaron and his sons and the filling of their hands with power to serve as priests, the procedure being described at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:29:1-2:29:46" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Exodus chapter 29</a> and <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:8:1-3:8:36" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Leviticus chapter 8</a>. Their installation apparently occupied the seven-day period of Nisan 1-7, 1512 B.C.E. (See <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200002179/">INSTALLATION</a>.) The newly installed priesthood began their services toward Israel the next day, Nisan 8.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb"><strong><em>Qualifications.</em></strong> Jehovah laid down the qualifications for those of Aaron’s family line who would serve at God’s altar. To be a priest, a man had to <span id="page684" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="684" data-before-text="684"></span>be physically sound and of normal appearance. Otherwise he could not approach the altar with offerings and he could not come near to the curtain between the Holy and Most Holy compartments of the tabernacle. Such a one was entitled, however, to receive support from the tithe and could partake of “the holy things” provided as food for the priesthood.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:21:16-3:21:23" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Le 21:16-23</a>.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">The age for entering upon the priesthood is not specifically stated, although the census of the Kohathites, taken at Mount Sinai, included those from 30 to 50 years old. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:4:3-4:4:3" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Nu 4:3</a>) The service of the Levites at the sanctuary began at age 25 (reduced in King David’s time to 20). (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:8:24-4:8:24" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Nu 8:24;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:23:24-13:23:24" data-bid="25-2" class="b"> 1Ch 23:24</a>) Retirement of nonpriestly Levites from obligatory service at the sanctuary was at 50 years, but there was no retirement provided for priests.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:8:25-4:8:26" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Nu 8:25, 26</a>; see <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200003710/">RETIREMENT</a>.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb"><strong><em>Maintenance.</em></strong> The tribe of Levi was not given a block of land as an inheritance, but they were ‘scattered in Israel,’ receiving 48 cities in which to live with their families and cattle. Thirteen of these cities went to the priests. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:49:5-1:49:5" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Ge 49:5,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:49:7-1:49:7" data-bid="27-2" class="b"> 7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:21:1-6:21:11" data-bid="27-3" class="b"> Jos 21:1-11</a>) One of the cities of refuge, Hebron, was a priestly city. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:21:13-6:21:13" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Jos 21:13</a>) The Levites received no region as a tribal inheritance because, as Jehovah said, “I am your share and your inheritance in the midst of the sons of Israel.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:18:20-4:18:20" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Nu 18:20</a>) The Levites did the assigned work of their ministry and maintained their houses and the pasture grounds of the cities allotted to them. They would also care for other land that the Israelites might devote to sanctuary use. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:27:21-3:27:21" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Le 27:21,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:27:28-3:27:28" data-bid="30-2" class="b"> 28</a>) Jehovah provided for the Levites by arranging for them to receive a tithe of all the produce of the land from the other 12 tribes. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:18:21-4:18:24" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Nu 18:21-24</a>) Of this tithe, or tenth, the Levites were, in turn, to give a tenth of the very best as a tithe to the priesthood.

<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">This provision for the priesthood, though abundant, was in contrast to the luxury and financial power attained by the priesthood of pagan nations. In Egypt, for example, the priests <em>owned</em> portions of the land (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:47:22-1:47:22" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Ge 47:22,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:47:26-1:47:26" data-bid="33-2" class="b"> 26</a>) and by crafty maneuvering eventually were the richest and most powerful men in Egypt. James H. Breasted, in <em>A History of the Ancient Egyptians</em> (1908, pp. 355, 356, 431, 432), records that during the so-called Twentieth Dynasty the Pharaoh was reduced to a mere puppet. The priesthood had possession of the Nubian gold country and the great province of the Upper Nile. The high priest was the most important fiscal officer of the state, next to the chief treasurer himself. He commanded all the armies and held the treasury in his hands. He is represented more prominently in the monuments than the Pharaoh.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">It was only when Israel became lax in their worship and negligent in paying their tithes that the priesthood suffered, along with nonpriestly Levites, who had to look for other work to provide for themselves and their families. In turn, this bad attitude toward the sanctuary and its maintenance caused the nation to suffer still further for lack of spirituality and knowledge of Jehovah.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:13:10-16:13:13" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Ne 13:10-13</a>; see also <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/39:3:8-39:3:10" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Mal 3:8-10</a>.</p>

<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb"><strong><em>Dress.</em></strong> In performing their official duties, the priests served barefoot, in harmony with the fact that the sanctuary was holy ground. (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:3:5-2:3:5" data-bid="45-1" class="b">Ex 3:5</a>.) In the instructions for making the special garments for the priests, sandals were not mentioned.

<p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sn"><strong><em>How were the assignments of temple service for the priests in Israel determined?</em></strong></p>
<p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb">Of the 24 divisions, or courses, of the priests established by King David, 16 were made up from the house of Eleazar and 8 from the house of Ithamar. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:24:1-13:24:19" data-bid="77-1" class="b">1Ch 24:1-19</a>) However, at least initially, priests from only four of the divisions returned from the Babylonian exile. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/15:2:36-15:2:39" data-bid="78-1" class="b">Ezr 2:36-39</a>) Some suggest that, in order to continue the former organizational arrangement, the four families returning were divided so that there were again 24 courses. Alfred Edersheim, in <em>The Temple</em> (1874, p. 63), suggests that this was accomplished by each family’s drawing five lots for those who had not returned, thereby forming from their groups 20 more courses to which they gave the original names. John the Baptizer’s father Zechariah was a priest of the eighth division, that of Abijah. However, if the above view represents the true case, he may not have been a descendant of Abijah​—he may have merely belonged to the division which carried his name. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:24:10-13:24:10" data-bid="79-1" class="b">1Ch 24:10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:1:5-42:1:5" data-bid="79-2" class="b"> Lu 1:5</a>) Absence of full information does not allow for firm conclusions on these points.</p>
<p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb">In the temple service the priests were organized under various officers. Lots were drawn in assigning certain services. Each of the 24 divisions served one week at a time, being on assigned duty twice a year. Evidently the entire priesthood served at festival seasons when thousands of sacrifices were offered by the people, as they did at the temple dedication. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:24:1-13:24:18" data-bid="80-1" class="b">1Ch 24:1-18,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:24:31-13:24:31" data-bid="80-2" class="b"> 31;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:5:11-14:5:11" data-bid="80-3" class="b"> 2Ch 5:11</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:29:31-14:29:35" data-bid="81-1" class="b">2Ch 29:31-35;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:30:23-14:30:25" data-bid="81-2" class="b"> 30:23-25;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:35:10-14:35:19" data-bid="81-3" class="b"> 35:10-19</a>.) A priest might serve at other times as long as he did not interfere with the allotted services of the priests on assigned duty. According to rabbinic traditions, in the time of Jesus’ earthly life, the priests were numerous, so that the service of the week was subdivided among the various families making up the division, each family serving one or more days according to their number.</p>
<p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sb">Probably considered the most honorable of the daily services was the burning of incense on the golden altar. This was done after the sacrifice was offered. During the burning of incense, the people would be gathered outside the sanctuary in prayer. Rabbinic tradition is that lots were drawn for this service but that one who had previously officiated was not allowed to participate unless all present had performed the service before. (<em>The Temple,</em> pp. 135, 137, 138) If this is so, a priest would usually have the honor only once in a lifetime. It was this service that Zechariah was performing when the angel Gabriel appeared to him to announce that Zechariah and his wife Elizabeth would have a son. When Zechariah came out of the sanctuary, the crowd gathered there could discern by his appearance and his inability to speak that Zechariah had seen a supernatural sight in the sanctuary; thus the event became public knowledge.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:1:8-42:1:23" data-bid="82-1" class="b">Lu 1:8-23</a>.</p>
<p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="sb">Each Sabbath day, it appears, the priests had the privilege of changing the showbread. It was also on the Sabbath that the priestly division for that week completed its service and the new course began duty for the following week. These and other necessary duties were performed by the priests without constituting a breaking of the Sabbath.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:12:2-40:12:5" data-bid="83-1" class="b">Mt 12:2-5</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:21:6-9:21:6" data-bid="84-1" class="b">1Sa 21:6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:11:5-12:11:7" data-bid="84-2" class="b"> 2Ki 11:5-7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:23:8-14:23:8" data-bid="84-3" class="b"> 2Ch 23:8</a>.</p>

<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="sb">Just as the ancient tent of meeting in the wilderness was God’s place of dwelling with men, a sanctuary where they could approach him, so during the thousand years God’s tent will again be with mankind in a much closer, more lasting and beneficial way, as he deals with them representatively through his great High Priest, Jesus Christ, and the 144,000 who serve with Christ as underpriests in the great spiritual temple that was foreshadowed by that sacred tabernacle.

<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="sb"><strong>Pagan Priests.</strong> The ancient nations had priests through whom they made approach to their gods. These men were reverenced by the people and always wielded great influence, generally being among the ruling class, or being close advisers to the rulers. The priesthood was the most educated class and generally held the people in ignorance. In this way they were able to prey on the superstition of the people and their fear of the unknown. In Egypt, for example, the people were led to worship the Nile River as a god, viewing their priests as possessing divine control over its seasonal overflow, on which their crops depended.</p>
<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="sb">This encouragement of superstitious ignorance was in direct contrast to Israel’s priests, who constantly read and taught the Law to the entire nation. Each man was to know God and his law. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:6:1-5:6:3" data-bid="116-1" class="b">De 6:1-3</a>) The people themselves were able to read and write, being commanded by Jehovah to read and teach his law to their children.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:6:4-5:6:9" data-bid="117-1" class="b">De 6:4-9</a>.</p>
<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="sb"><strong><em>Not the pattern for Israel’s priesthood.</em></strong> In spite of these facts, there are some who claim that the priesthood of Israel and the formulation of many of its regulations were patterned after those of Egypt. They argue that Moses, the mediator of the Law covenant, was deeply influenced by his life in Egypt, his training in the court of Pharaoh, and his instruction “in all the wisdom of the Egyptians.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:7:22-44:7:22" data-bid="118-1" class="b">Ac 7:22</a>) Their line of argument, however, ignores the fact that Moses, though used to deliver the Law to Israel, was in no sense the lawmaker. Israel’s Lawgiver was Jehovah God (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:33:22-23:33:22" data-bid="119-1" class="b">Isa 33:22</a>), who used angels to transmit the Law by the hand of the mediator Moses.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:3:19-48:3:19" data-bid="120-1" class="b">Ga 3:19</a>.</p>
<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="sb">Every detail of Israel’s worship was outlined by God. The plans for the tent of meeting were given to Moses (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:26:30-2:26:30" data-bid="121-1" class="b">Ex 26:30</a>), and it is written that he was commanded: “See that you make all things after their pattern that was shown to you in the mountain.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:8:5-58:8:5" data-bid="122-1" class="b">Heb 8:5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:25:40-2:25:40" data-bid="122-2" class="b"> Ex 25:40</a>) All the service at the sanctuary was of Jehovah’s origination and direction. The record repeatedly assures us of this by saying that Moses and the sons of Israel “kept doing according to all that Jehovah had commanded Moses. They did just so.” “According to all that Jehovah had commanded Moses, that was the way the sons of Israel did all the service. And Moses got to see all the work, and, look! they had done it just as Jehovah had commanded. That was the way they had done.” “And Moses proceeded to do according to all that Jehovah had commanded him. He did just so.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:39:32-2:39:32" data-bid="123-1" class="b">Ex 39:32,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:39:42-2:39:43" data-bid="123-2" class="b"> 42, 43;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:40:16-2:40:16" data-bid="123-3" class="b"> 40:16</a>.</p>
<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="sb">According to Egyptologists, in some things the dress of the Egyptian priests was similar to that of the priests of Israel, such as their use of linen; there was a shaving of the bodies of the Egyptian priests, as with the Levites (though the priests of Israel did not; <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:8:7-4:8:7" data-bid="124-1" class="b">Nu 8:7</a>); there were washings. But do these few similarities prove that they had the same origin, or that one came from the other? Similar materials and methods are used worldwide in making clothing, houses, and buildings and in performing daily duties, such as washing, but there is great divergence also in style and methods. We do not say that one came from the other, or that the dress or the act has the same religious or symbolic significance.</p>
<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="sb">In most features of their dress and functions there was no similarity whatsoever between the Israelite and the Egyptian priests. For example, while the Israelite priests served barefoot, the Egyptian priests wore sandals. The robes of the Egyptian priests were entirely different in design, and their dress and appurtenances bore symbols of the worship of their false gods. They shaved their heads, which Israel’s priests did not do (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:21:5-3:21:5" data-bid="125-1" class="b">Le 21:5</a>), and used wigs or wore headgear totally unlike that of Israel’s priests, according to inscriptions found on monuments in Egypt. Furthermore, Jehovah made it clear that Israel was not to adopt any of the practices of Egypt or the other nations, either in worship or in judicial practice.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:18:1-3:18:4" data-bid="126-1" class="b">Le 18:1-4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:6:14-5:6:14" data-bid="126-2" class="b"> De 6:14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:7:1-5:7:6" data-bid="126-3" class="b"> 7:1-6</a>.</p>
<p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="sb">The argument made by supporters of the theory that Israel’s priesthood borrowed from Egypt has, therefore, no foundation. We must remember that the idea of sacrifice and priesthood came originally from God and, from the beginning, was expressed by faithful men such as Abel and Noah; in patriarchal society it was carried out by Abraham and others. All nations therefore had an inheritance of this knowledge, though it was distorted into many forms because they forsook the true God and pure worship. Having the inborn desire to worship but lacking the guidance of Jehovah, the pagan nations developed many unrighteous and even degrading rites, all of which brought them into opposition to true worship.</p>

ELIM
(Eʹlim) [Big Trees].
The second encampment location of the Israelites after crossing the Red Sea. (Ex 15:27; 16:1; Nu 33:9, 10) Although its exact location is not certain, it is traditionally identified with Wadi Gharandel on the Sinai Peninsula, about 88 km (55 mi) SSE of Suez. Like the Biblical Elim, which had “twelve springs of water and seventy palm trees,” this modern site is well known as a watering place with vegetation and palms.

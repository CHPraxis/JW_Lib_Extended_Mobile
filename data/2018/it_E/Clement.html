<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">(Clemʹent).</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A faithful Christian who fought side by side with the apostle Paul, presumably at Philippi, for the sake of “the good news.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:4:3-50:4:3" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Php 4:3</a>) The name Clement was quite common and therefore provides no valid basis for connecting him with Clement of Rome, as is done by Origen.</p>

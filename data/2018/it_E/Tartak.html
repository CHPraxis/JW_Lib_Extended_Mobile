<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">(Tar πtak).</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A deity worshiped by the Avvites, whom the king of Assyria settled in the territory of Samaria after he took the Israelites of the ten-tribe kingdom into exile. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:17:31-12:17:31" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2Ki 17:31</a>) According to the Babylonian Talmud, Tartak had the form of an ass. (<em>Sanhedrin</em> 63<em>b</em>) Based on the conclusion that the name Tartak may be comparable to the Pahlavi (Persian) word <em>tar-thakh</em> (intense darkness, hero of darkness), it has been suggested that Tartak may have been a demon of the lower regions. Aside from the brief reference to Tartak in the Scriptures, however, nothing can be stated with any certainty concerning the nature of this deity.</p>

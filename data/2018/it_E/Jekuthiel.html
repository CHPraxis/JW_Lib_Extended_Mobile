<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A descendant of Judah and “father of Zanoah.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:4:1-13:4:1" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1Ch 4:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:4:18-13:4:18" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 18</a>) Zanoah is the name of a city rather than a person in its other occurrence (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:15:56-6:15:57" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Jos 15:56, 57</a>), so Jekuthiel as its “father” was likely the father of those who settled there, or was himself its founder or chief settler.</p>

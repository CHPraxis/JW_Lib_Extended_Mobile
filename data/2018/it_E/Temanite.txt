TEMANITE
(Teʹman·ite) [Of (Belonging to) Teman].
A term generally understood to refer to a native of Teman in Edom. An early Edomite king, Husham, came from “the land of the Temanites,” and Eliphaz, one of Job’s three companions, was a Temanite. (Ge 36:31-34; Job 2:11; 4:1; 42:7) That Eliphaz came from Teman in Edom is suggested by the understanding that the land of Uz, where Job lived, was near Edom. Some scholars, however, believe that there is a possibility that the Eliphaz named in the book of Job was, not from Teman, but from Tema, a place identified with an oasis on the Arabian Peninsula about 400 km (250 mi) SE of Ezion-geber.​—Job 6:19.

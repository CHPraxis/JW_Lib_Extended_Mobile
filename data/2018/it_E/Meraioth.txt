MERAIOTH
(Me·raʹioth) [possibly, Rebellious Ones].
1. A priestly descendant of Aaron through Eleazar; called “the son of Zerahiah.”​—1Ch 6:3-7, 52; Ezr 7:3, 4.
2. A priest identified as “the son of Ahitub, a leader of the house of the true God” and who appears to be the father of Zadok.​—1Ch 9:10, 11; Ne 11:11.
3. Founder of a priestly paternal house, the head of which was Helkai in the days of Joiakim. (Ne 12:12, 15) “Meraioth,” which was the name of this house following the Jews’ return from Babylonian exile, may be a variation of “Meremoth,” the name of one of the priests accompanying Zerubbabel to Jerusalem in 537 B.C.E.​—Ne 12:1, 3.

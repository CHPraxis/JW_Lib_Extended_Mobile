SITNAH
(Sitʹnah) [Accusation].
A well that Isaac’s servants dug in the vicinity of Gerar and Rehoboth. It was named Sitnah because of their dispute over it with the shepherds of Gerar. (Ge 26:19-22) It was perhaps somewhere in Wadi Ruheibe (Nahal Shunera), about 30 km (19 mi) SW of Beer-sheba. But Sitnah’s exact location is not known.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">The Hebrew word <em>koh·khavʹ</em> as well as the Greek <em>a·sterʹ</em> and <em>aʹstron</em> are applied in a general sense to any luminous body in space, except the sun and moon, for which other names are used.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><strong>Vastness of Universe.</strong> The galaxy within which Earth is located, commonly called the Milky Way, is believed to measure some 100,000 light-years across and to contain over 100,000,000,000 stars like our sun. The closest star to Earth, one of the Alpha Centauri group, is over 40,000,000,000,000 km (25,000,000,000,000 mi) away. Yet this immensity seems relatively small in view of <span id="page1032" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="1032" data-before-text="1032"></span>the estimate that there are 100,000,000,000 galaxies throughout universal space. About 10,000,000,000 of these are within the range of modern telescopes.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The vastness of the stellar creation adds infinite force and meaning to the Creator’s statement at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:40:26-23:40:26" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Isaiah 40:26</a>: “Raise your eyes high up and see. Who has created these things? It is the One who is bringing forth the army of them even by number, all of whom he calls even by name. Due to the abundance of dynamic energy, he also being vigorous in power, not one of them is missing.” (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:147:4-19:147:4" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ps 147:4</a>.) The reverent psalmist was led to say: “When I see your heavens, the works of your fingers, the moon and the stars that you have prepared, what is mortal man that you keep him in mind, and the son of earthling man that you take care of him?”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:8:3-19:8:4" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ps 8:3, 4</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><strong>Age.</strong> The fact that rays from remote stars and galaxies millions of light-years distant now reach giant telescopes on earth indicates that the creation of these astral bodies occurred millions of years in the past, since otherwise these rays would not yet have reached our planet. Such creation is evidently included in the initial statement at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:1-1:1:1" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Genesis 1:1</a>: “In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.” <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:16-1:1:16" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Verse 16</a> does not contradict this in saying that during the fourth creative “day,” or period, “God proceeded to make . . . the stars.” The word “make” (Heb., <em>ʽa·sahʹ</em>) does not mean the same as the word “create” (Heb., <em>ba·raʼʹ</em>).​—See <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200001061/">CREATION</a>.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><strong>Number of Stars.</strong> In addressing man, God used the stars to denote a countless number, comparable to the grains of sand on the seashore. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:22:17-1:22:17" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ge 22:17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:15:5-1:15:5" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 15:5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:32:13-2:32:13" data-bid="6-3" class="b"> Ex 32:13</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:9:23-16:9:23" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ne 9:23;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/34:3:15-34:3:16" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> Na 3:15, 16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:11:12-58:11:12" data-bid="7-3" class="b"> Heb 11:12</a>.) Since the stars clearly discernible to the unaided eye number only a few thousand, this comparison was viewed by many in the past as out of balance. Yet today the evidence shows that the number of stars does indeed compare to all the grains of sand in all the earth.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">It is of interest to note that, while Moses spoke of Israel as having seen a certain fulfillment of this Abrahamic promise, the censuses taken of the population, as recorded in the Bible, never did include the total number in the nation. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:1:10-5:1:10" data-bid="8-1" class="b">De 1:10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:10:22-5:10:22" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 10:22;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:28:62-5:28:62" data-bid="8-3" class="b"> 28:62</a>) David is mentioned later as specifically refraining from taking the number of those “from twenty years of age and under, because Jehovah had promised to make Israel as many as the stars of the heavens.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:27:23-13:27:23" data-bid="9-1" class="b">1Ch 27:23</a>) Such concept of the innumerableness of these heavenly bodies distinguishes the Bible writings as unique when compared with contemporary views of ancient peoples.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><strong>Orderly Arrangement.</strong> Additionally, the orderliness of the arrangement of these celestial bodies is emphasized in various texts, references being made to “statutes,” “regulations,” and “orbits” (“courses,” <em>RS</em>). (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:31:35-24:31:37" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Jer 31:35-37;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:5:20-7:5:20" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> Jg 5:20</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/65:1:13-65:1:13" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Jude 13</a>.) The tremendous forces that determine the relative positions of certain stars according to physical laws are indicated by God’s questions to Job: “Can you tie fast the bonds of the Kimah constellation, or can you loosen the very cords of the Kesil constellation? Can you bring forth the Mazzaroth constellation in its appointed time? And as for the Ash constellation alongside its sons, can you conduct them? Have you come to know the statutes of the heavens, or could you put its authority in the earth?” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:38:31-18:38:33" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Job 38:31-33</a>; see <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200000411/">ASH CONSTELLATION</a>; <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200002597/">KESIL CONSTELLATION</a>; <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200002608/">KIMAH CONSTELLATION</a>; <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200002943/">MAZZAROTH CONSTELLATION</a>.) Thus, the <em>New Bible Dictionary</em> states: “We assert, then, that the Bible consistently assumes a universe which is fully rational, and vast in size, in contrast to the typical contemporary world-view, in which the universe was not rational, and no larger than could actually be proved by the unaided senses.”​—Edited by J. Douglas, 1985, p. 1144.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">The apostle Paul’s expression concerning the difference between individual stars can be appreciated even more in the light of modern astronomy, which shows the contrast existing as to color, size, amount of light produced, temperature, and even the relative density of the stars.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:15:40-46:15:41" data-bid="13-1" class="b">1Co 15:40, 41</a>.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb"><strong>Star Worship.</strong> While star worship was rampant among the ancient nations of the Middle East, the Scriptural view held by God’s faithful servants was that such astral bodies were simply material bodies subject to divine laws and control, not dominating man but serving as luminaries and time indicators. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:14-1:1:18" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Ge 1:14-18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:136:3-19:136:3" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> Ps 136:3,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:136:7-19:136:9" data-bid="14-3" class="b"> 7-9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:148:3-19:148:3" data-bid="14-4" class="b"> 148:3</a>) In warning Israel against making any representation of the true God Jehovah, Moses commanded them not to be seduced into worship of sun, moon, and stars, “which Jehovah your God has apportioned to all the peoples under the whole heavens.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:4:15-5:4:20" data-bid="15-1" class="b">De 4:15-20</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:17:16-12:17:16" data-bid="16-1" class="b">2Ki 17:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:21:5-12:21:5" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> 21:5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:23:5-12:23:5" data-bid="16-3" class="b"> 23:5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/36:1:4-36:1:5" data-bid="16-4" class="b"> Zep 1:4, 5</a>.) Pagan nations identified their particular gods with certain stars and thus took a nationalistic view of those stellar bodies. Sakkuth and Kaiwan, mentioned at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/30:5:26-30:5:26" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Amos 5:26</a> as gods worshiped by apostate Israel, are considered to be Babylonian names for the planet Saturn, called Rephan in Stephen’s quotation of this text.

<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb"><strong>“Star” Seen After Jesus’ Birth.</strong> The “astrologers from eastern parts,” hence from the neighborhood of Babylon, whose visit to King Herod after the birth of Jesus resulted in the slaughter of all the male infants in Bethlehem, were obviously not servants or worshipers of the true God. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:2:1-40:2:18" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Mt 2:1-18</a>; see <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200000448/">ASTROLOGERS</a>.) As to the “star” (Gr., <em>a·sterʹ</em>) seen by them, many suggestions have been given as to its having been a comet, a meteor, a supernova, or, more popularly, a conjunction of planets. None of such bodies could logically have ‘come to a stop above where the young child was,’ thereby identifying the one house in the village of Bethlehem where the child was found. It is also notable that only these pagan astrologers “saw” the star. Their condemned practice of astrology and the adverse results of their visit, placing in danger the life of the future Messiah, certainly allow for, and even make advisable, the consideration of their having been directed by a source <em>adverse</em> to God’s purposes as relating to the promised Messiah. It is certainly reasonable to ask if the one who “keeps transforming himself into an angel of light,” whose operation is “with every powerful work and lying signs and portents,” who was able to make a serpent appear to speak, and who was referred to by Jesus as “a manslayer when he began,” could not also cause astrologers to ‘see’ a starlike object that guided them first, not to Bethlehem, but to Jerusalem, where resided a mortal enemy of the promised Messiah.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:11:3-47:11:3" data-bid="21-1" class="b">2Co 11:3,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:11:14-47:11:14" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> 14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/53:2:9-53:2:9" data-bid="21-3" class="b"> 2Th 2:9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:3:1-1:3:4" data-bid="21-4" class="b"> Ge 3:1-4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:8:44-43:8:44" data-bid="21-5" class="b"> Joh 8:44</a>.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb"><strong>Figurative Use.</strong> Stars are used in the Bible in a figurative sense and in metaphors or similes to represent persons, as in Joseph’s dream in which his parents were represented by the sun and moon, and his 11 brothers by 11 stars.

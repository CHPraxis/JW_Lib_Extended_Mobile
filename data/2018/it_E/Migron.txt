MIGRON
(Migʹron) [Threshing Floor].
A location “at the outskirts of Gibeah” where King Saul was encamped when Jonathan and his armor-bearer killed about 20 men from the Philistine outpost near Michmash. (1Sa 13:16, 23; 14:1, 2, 13-16) Tell Miryam, about 1 km (0.6 mi) WSW of Mukhmas (Michmash), is tentatively identified with Migron.
At Isaiah 10:28 Migron is foretold to be one of the cities through which the Assyrians would pass on their way toward Jerusalem. Its being mentioned after Ai (Aiath) and before Michmash appears to locate Migron N, not S, of Michmash. Therefore, a second Migron (Makrun to the NW of Michmash) has been suggested. However, if the Migron of Saul’s day was still in existence, it seems unlikely that there would be another town by the same name less than 3 km (2 mi) away. So the prophecy may simply be listing cities to be affected by the Assyrian invasion and that without regard for the order or geographic position of one city in relation to another. (Isa 10:24, 28-32) Thus the Migron of Isaiah 10:28 may be the same as the one mentioned at 1 Samuel 14:2.

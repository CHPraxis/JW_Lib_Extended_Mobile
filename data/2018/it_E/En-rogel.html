<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">(En-roʹgel) [Fountain (Spring) of Rogel (Foot)].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A spring or well near Jerusalem that marked the boundary between Judah and Benjamin.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:17:17-10:17:17" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2Sa 17:17</a>) Near here David’s other rebellious son Adonijah later held a feast to enlist support for his usurpation of the throne.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:1:9-11:1:9" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1Ki 1:9</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">It is generally agreed that En-rogel corresponds to the modern Bir Ayyub, or Job’s well. It is located S of the SE corner of Jerusalem’s wall, at the foot of the western bank of the Kidron Valley about 100 m (330 ft) S of the junction with the Valley of Hinnom. The well reaches an underground stream or spring, which, after a rain, sometimes flows so abundantly that it raises the level of water to the surface.</p>

APHEKAH
(A·pheʹkah) [Streambed].
A city in the mountainous region of southern Judah, mentioned as in the neighborhood of Hebron. (Jos 15:48, 53, 54) Some scholars propose identifying it with Khirbet el-Hadab, about 6 km (3.5 mi) SW of Hebron. There are two water sources nearby, and archaeological remains of the Israelite period have been found at the site.

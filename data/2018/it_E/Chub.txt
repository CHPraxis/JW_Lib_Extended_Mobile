CHUB
An unidentified people included among those allied with Egypt. Chub is listed with Ethiopia, Put, Lud, and “the sons of the land of the covenant” (which may refer to Israelites who fled to Egypt after the murder of Gedaliah in 607 B.C.E.), all of whom are destined to “fall by the very sword.” (Eze 30:4, 5) Some think that Chub refers to Libya, and it is so rendered by some translations.​—LXX; RS.

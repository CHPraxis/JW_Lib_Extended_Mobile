SENIR
(Seʹnir).
The Amorite name for Mount Hermon. (De 3:9) Since 1 Chronicles 5:23 mentions “Senir and Mount Hermon,” the name Senir may also have been used to denote a part of the Hermon, or Anti-Lebanon, Range. Senir was a source of juniper timbers (Eze 27:5) and a haunt of lions and leopards. (Ca 4:8) One Assyrian inscription describes Senir (Sa-ni-ru) as “a mountain, facing the Lebanon.”​—Ancient Near Eastern Texts, edited by J. Pritchard, 1974, p. 280; see HERMON.

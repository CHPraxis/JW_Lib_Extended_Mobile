GENUBATH
(Ge·nuʹbath).
Son of Edomite prince Hadad. When the army chief Joab occupied Edom during the reign of David, Hadad fled to Egypt. There he gained the favor of Pharaoh, whose sister-in-law he was given as a wife. By her, Hadad fathered Genubath, who was raised with the sons of Pharaoh.​—1Ki 11:14-20.

Events Leading Up to the Death of Christ









EVENTS leading up to Jesus’ death took place in and around Jerusalem. Here the Son of God was presented to the nation as its King. As he approached the city, a multitude of the disciples cried out: “Blessed is the One coming as the King in Jehovah’s name!” (Lu 19:37, 38) But the religious leaders of the nation rejected him and falsely charged that he was inciting the people to revolt. When the Roman governor, Pontius Pilate, pointedly asked Jesus whether he was a king, Jesus replied: “My kingdom is no part of this world.” When Pilate himself presented Jesus to the Jews, saying: “See! Your king!” the chief priests answered: “We have no king but Caesar.”​—Joh 18:33-38; 19:14, 15.

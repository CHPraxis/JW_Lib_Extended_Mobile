STORAGE CITIES
Cities especially designed as government storage centers. Reserves of provisions such as grain, as well as other things, were preserved in warehouses and granaries built at these locations.
Under Egyptian oppression, the Israelites were compelled to build “cities as storage places for Pharaoh, namely, Pithom and Raamses.” (Ex 1:11) Storage cities were also built by Solomon. (1Ki 9:17-19; 2Ch 8:4-6) Later, as King Jehoshaphat prospered, “he went on building fortified places and storage cities in Judah.”​—2Ch 17:12; see STOREHOUSE.

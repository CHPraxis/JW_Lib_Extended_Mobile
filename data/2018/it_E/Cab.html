<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A measure that, according to rabbinic sources, was 1⁄18 ephah (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:6:25-12:6:25" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2Ki 6:25</a>), and hence also 1⁄18 bath measure. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:45:11-26:45:11" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Eze 45:11</a>) If the bath measure is to be viewed as having a capacity of 22 L (5.81 gal; 4.99 dry gal), as archaeological evidence seems to indicate, then the cab measure would have a capacity of 1.22 L (2.58 liquid pt; 2.2 dry pt).</p>

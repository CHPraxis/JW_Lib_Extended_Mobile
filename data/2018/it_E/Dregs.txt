DREGS
Suspended particles that precipitate and settle to the bottom when wine is allowed to stand undisturbed. In the Scriptures the term occurs five times, always in the plural (Heb., shema·rimʹ). It is generally rendered “lees” by Bible translators. Keeping a good wine “on the dregs” for a long time to age fully gives it clarity, strength, and mellowness. (Isa 25:6) On the other hand, when a wine that is bad to start with because of a poor quality of grape is left to congeal on the dregs, it does not improve in taste or smell, facts to which the prophets refer in illustrations. (Jer 48:11; Zep 1:12) Also, in a figure of speech the psalmist says that “all the wicked ones of the earth” will be compelled to drain the cup of Jehovah’s anger, drinking the dregs and all, down to the last bitter drop.​—Ps 75:8; compare Eze 23:32-34; see WINE AND STRONG DRINK.

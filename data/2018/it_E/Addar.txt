ADDAR
(Adʹdar).
1. A son of Bela, a Benjaminite.​—1Ch 8:1, 3.
2. A southern border town of Judah located near Kadesh-barnea. (Jos 15:3) In Joshua’s account it is listed as lying between Hezron and Karka, but at Numbers 34:4 it appears that the name Hezron (meaning “Courtyard; Settlement”) is combined with Addar to form Hazar-addar, since the accounts are parallel. The book Biblical Archaeology (by G. E. Wright, 1962, p. 71) suggests as a possible location that of ʽAin el-Qudeirat, where a perennial spring waters a small but fertile valley. It lies about 8 km (5 mi) NNW of ʽAin Qedeis, the possible location of Kadesh-barnea.

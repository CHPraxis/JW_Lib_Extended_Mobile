HELKATH-HAZZURIM
(Helʹkath-haz·zuʹrim) [Field of Flint Knives; or, by an emendation, Field of Sides].
A field near “the pool of Gibeon.” Twenty-four young men, 12 representing the armies of Ish-bosheth and 12 from the servants of David, died there while ‘putting on a combat.’ The place was subsequently named from this incident.​—2Sa 2:12-16.

NEKODA
(Ne·koʹda) [Speckled].
1. The forefather of a group of Nethinim who returned from Babylonian exile in 537 B.C.E.​—Ezr 2:1, 43, 48; Ne 7:46, 50.
2. The forefather of a group “unable to tell the house of their fathers and their origin.” (Ezr 2:59, 60; Ne 7:61, 62) Since the names of Delaiah and Tobiah associated with Nekoda in these verses do not occur elsewhere in a list of returning exiles, it is assumed that this Nekoda is a person different from No. 1.

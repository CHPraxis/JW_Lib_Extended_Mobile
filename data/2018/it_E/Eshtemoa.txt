ESHTEMOA
(Esh·te·moʹa), Eshtemoh (Eshʹte·moh) [possibly, Place of Listening [that is, for God’s word]].
1. Son of Ishbah or, possibly, a Judean town many of whose inhabitants descended from Ishbah.​—1Ch 4:17.
2. A Maacathite and descendant of Hodiah.​—1Ch 4:19.
3. A town in the mountainous region of Judah, also called Eshtemoh. Though originally assigned to Judah, it was thereafter allotted, along with its pasture grounds, to the Levites. (Jos 15:50; 21:14; 1Ch 6:57) It corresponds to the modern village of es Samuʽ (Eshtemoaʽ), situated about 15 km (9 mi) SSW of Hebron. Perhaps the same as No. 1.
Eshtemoa was one of the places frequented by David as a fugitive, and after his victory over the marauding Amalekites, he sent a gift from the spoils to friends there.​—1Sa 30:26-28.

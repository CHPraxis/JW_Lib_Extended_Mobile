STOMACH
An enlarged part of the alimentary canal in humans and animals. In some animals the stomach includes four compartments. Under the Law, a person who sacrificed a victim had to give the stomach (Heb., qe·vahʹ) to the priest. (De 18:3) In the Christian Greek Scriptures, the apostle Paul recommended that Timothy use a little wine for the sake of his stomach (Gr., stoʹma·khos).​—1Ti 5:23.
In some instances where the Hebrew words translated “belly” and “inward parts” are used, they apparently include the stomach. (Pr 13:25; Jon 1:17) The same is true in the usage of “belly” in the Christian Greek Scriptures, as, for example, at Romans 16:18 and 1 Corinthians 6:13.​—See BELLY.

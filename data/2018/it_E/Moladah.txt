MOLADAH
(Mo·laʹdah) [from a root meaning “give birth; become father to; bear”].
One of the cities in southern Judah allotted to Simeon. Moladah remained in the hands of this tribe at least down till David’s reign. (Jos 15:21, 26; 19:1, 2; 1Ch 4:24, 28, 31) After the exile, Judeans resettled the site.​—Ne 11:25, 26.
The site of Moladah has not been identified with any certainty.

MASKIL
(Masʹkil).
This word appears in the superscription of 13 psalms (32, 42, 44, 45, 52, 53, 54, 55, 74, 78, 88, 89, 142) and possibly means “contemplative poem.” However, because the meaning of the Hebrew word is not certain, it is left untranslated in many versions. A clue to its sense may be indicated in the fact that a word of similar form is elsewhere translated “acting prudently,” ‘acting with discretion,’ “acting with consideration,” “having insight,” and so forth.​—1Sa 18:14, 15; 2Ch 30:22; Ps 41:1; 53:2.

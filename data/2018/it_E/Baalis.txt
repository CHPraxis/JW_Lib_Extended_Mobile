BAALIS
(Baʹa·lis).
King of Ammon, who reportedly sent Ishmael to murder Governor Gedaliah of Judah in 607 B.C.E. The Greek Septuagint spells this name “Belisa.”​—Jer 40:14.
A seal impression bearing the name Baʽalyishʽa was discovered in 1984 in the excavations at Tell el-ʽUmeiri in Jordan. This seal impression was dated paleographically to the latter part of the seventh century B.C.E. The inscription on it, written in ancient Ammonite characters, reads: “Belonging to Milkomʼor [or, Milkomʼur], servant of Baʽalyishʽa.” Baʽalyishʽa is possibly the Baalis of the Bible.

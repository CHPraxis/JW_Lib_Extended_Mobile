APHRAH
(Aphʹrah) [probably, Dust].
A place mentioned by Micah (1:10) apparently in the Shephelah or the Plains of Philistia, according to the other towns mentioned in the context. Micah evidently makes a play on words in saying: “In the house of Aphrah [Heb., ʽAph·rahʹ] wallow in the very dust [Heb., ʽa·pharʹ].”

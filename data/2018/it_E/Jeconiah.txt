JECONIAH
(Jec·o·niʹah) [Jehovah Firmly Establishes].
King of Judah for only three months and ten days before being taken captive to Babylon by Nebuchadnezzar in 617 B.C.E.; son of Jehoiakim and grandson of good King Josiah. (1Ch 3:15-17; Es 2:6; Jer 24:1) His name is occasionally contracted to Coniah. (Jer 22:24; 37:1) In certain translations it is sometimes spelled Jechoniah (Mt 1:11, 12, JB; Mo; RS), but most often it occurs as Jehoiachin.​—2Ki 24:6, 8-15; see JEHOIACHIN.

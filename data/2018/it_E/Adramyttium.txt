ADRAMYTTIUM
(Ad·ra·mytʹti·um).
A seaport city on the Aegean Sea, located in Mysia at the NW corner of Asia Minor, N of Pergamum. In modern Turkey the inland town of Edremit (E of the harbor) preserves the earlier name.
Adramyttium was part of the province of Asia under Roman rule and was evidently at one time a maritime commercial center of some importance, since it lay on the Roman road that passed through Pergamum and Ephesus to the S and Assos, Troas, and the Hellespont to the W and N. It is likely that Paul passed through Adramyttium on his third missionary tour. The only direct Bible reference to the place, however, is at Acts 27:2. At Caesarea, Paul, as a prisoner in the custody of the Roman officer Julius, boarded a ship from Adramyttium that was sailing to points along the coast of Asia Minor. Paul’s party left the ship at Myra in Lycia, transferring to a grain boat from Alexandria that was sailing for Italy.​—Ac 27:3-6.

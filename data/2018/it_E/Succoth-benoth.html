<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">(Sucʹcoth-beʹnoth) [Booths of Benoth].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A deity worshiped by the Babylonians whom the king of Assyria brought into the cities of Samaria after his taking the Israelites of the ten-tribe kingdom into exile. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:17:30-12:17:30" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2Ki 17:30</a>) Some scholars suggest that the name “Succoth-benoth” is a Hebraized form of Sarpanitu, the consort of Merodach (Marduk). Others favor an identification with Merodach, or Marduk, on the basis that the name “Succoth-benoth” may be <em>Sakut</em>(<em>h</em>)<em>banʼwat</em>(<em>h</em>)<em>,</em> meaning “the Counselor, Creator of the Land.” This title is understood to apply to Merodach, who was viewed by the Babylonians as the creator of the world.</p>

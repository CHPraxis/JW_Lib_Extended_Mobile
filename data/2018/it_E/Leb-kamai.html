<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">(Leb-kaʹmai) [Heart of Those Rising Up Against Me].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">This appears to be a cryptographic name for Chaldea, or <em>Kas·dimʹ.</em> It occurs only at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:51:1-24:51:1" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Jeremiah 51:1</a>, in a statement regarding what Jehovah would do to Babylon and the inhabitants of Chaldea. The term is employed there in keeping with a system called athbash, in which the last letter of the Hebrew alphabet (<em>taw</em>) represents the first letter thereof (<em>ʼaʹleph</em>), the second-last letter (<em>shin</em>) represents the second (<em>behth</em>), and so forth. Hence, at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:51:1-24:51:1" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Jeremiah 51:1</a> the real name (<em>Kas·dimʹ</em>) is disguised by forming the Hebrew word <em>Lev qa·maiʹ</em> (Leb-kamai). For “Leb-kamai” the Greek <em>Septuagint</em> has “the Chaldeans” and the Targums read “the land of the Chaldeans.”</p>

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Assyrian writings indicate that the title Tartan applied to an officer of high rank, probably second only to the king. Concerning the order of the titles in Assyrian eponym lists, James B. Pritchard, editor of <em>Ancient Near Eastern Texts</em> (1974, p. 274), comments: “Later on, the position of the official within the hierarchy was decisive for the sequence, the highest official (<em>tartanu</em>) following the king immediately, while important palace officers . . . and the governors of the foremost provinces took their turn in well-established order.” (See <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200000970/">CHRONOLOGY</a> [Eponym (limmu) lists].) An inscription by Assyrian King Ashurbanipal, now in the British Museum, reads, in part: “I became very angry on account of these happenings, my soul was aflame. I called the <em>turtan -</em>official, the governors, and also their assistants and gave immediately the order.”​—<em>Ancient Near Eastern Texts,</em> p. 296.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">King Sennacherib sent the Tartan along with other officials, including the Rabshakeh, the king’s chief cupbearer who acted as spokesman, to deliver an ultimatum of capitulation to Jerusalem. The Tartan is listed first, possibly because his was the superior position.

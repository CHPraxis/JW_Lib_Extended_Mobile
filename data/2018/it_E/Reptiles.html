<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A reptile is a cold-blooded, vertebrate, air-breathing animal. The Hebrew term for reptiles comes from the verb <em>za·chalʹ,</em> meaning “glide.” As stated at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:32:24-5:32:24" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 32:24</a>, among the things that would bring trouble upon idolatrous Israel was “the venom of reptiles of the dust,” evidently referring there to poisonous snakes. (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:8:17-24:8:17" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Jer 8:17</a>.) At <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/33:7:17-33:7:17" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Micah 7:17</a>, the nations that are overwhelmed by God’s power are spoken of as coming out of their defensive positions like excited reptiles.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">In addition to serpents, other reptiles mentioned in the Bible are the chameleon, the gecko and other lizards.​—See comments under their individual names.</p>

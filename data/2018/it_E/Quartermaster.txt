QUARTERMASTER
Possibly the officer in charge of rations and supplies for the troops. A literal translation of the Hebrew sar menu·chahʹ is “prince of the resting-place” and may mean the one in charge of the king’s living quarters when on a campaign or journey. Seraiah as quartermaster for King Zedekiah of Judah accompanied him on the trip to Babylon in the fourth year of Zedekiah’s reign, carrying with him Jeremiah’s written prophecy against Babylon. After reading it aloud in that city, Seraiah pitched it, tied to a stone, into the Euphrates, as a symbol of Babylon’s future fall, never to rise again.​—Jer 51:59-64.

LAUNDRYMAN’S FIELD
Apparently an area close to the city of Jerusalem where laundrymen worked.
Isaiah and his son Shear-jashub were to meet King Ahaz by the “highway of the laundryman’s field”; later, Sennacherib’s emissaries came to the same vicinity. (2Ki 18:17; Isa 7:3; 36:2) While this “highway of the laundryman’s field” was obviously outside the city, it was near enough that the taunts of Sennacherib’s messengers could be heard by those on the city walls.​—2Ki 18:18, 26, 27; Isa 36:1, 2.
A “conduit” is mentioned in connection with the “highway of the laundryman’s field.” This could not refer to what is called Hezekiah’s tunnel, as that had not yet been constructed in Ahaz’ day. The conduit therefore seems to have been one that ran through the torrent valley of Kidron down to the S end of the City of David. The laundryman’s field appears to have been located either in this part of the valley or somewhat farther S, near the suggested site of En-rogel.

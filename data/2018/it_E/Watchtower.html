<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A place of lookout or post of observation, often built on a city wall. (See <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200004459/">TOWER</a>.) Other watchtowers were constructed in wilderness areas or on frontiers. They were principally designed for military purposes and served to protect a city or a boundary; they were also constructed as places of refuge for shepherds and farmers in isolated areas and enabled a watchman to warn of marauders so that flocks and ripening crops in the area might be protected.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:20:24-14:20:24" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2Ch 20:24;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:21:8-23:21:8" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Isa 21:8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:32:14-23:32:14" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> 32:14</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A number of cities were named Mizpeh (Heb., <em>mits·pehʹ,</em> “Watchtower”), probably because of being on high elevations or because of notable towers erected there. Sometimes the Bible distinguished these cities by naming their location, as “Mizpeh of Gilead” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:11:29-7:11:29" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Jg 11:29</a>) and “Mizpeh in Moab.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:22:3-9:22:3" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1Sa 22:3</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">A pile of stones was set up by Jacob and called “Galeed” (meaning “Witness Heap”) and “The Watchtower.” Laban then said: “Let Jehovah keep watch between me and you when we are situated unseen the one from the other.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:31:45-1:31:49" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ge 31:45-49</a>) This pile of stones would testify to the fact that Jehovah was watching to see that Jacob and Laban carried out their covenant of peace.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">[ג] (giʹmel).</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The third letter in the Hebrew alphabet. It is the softest of the palatal letters except for <em>yohdh</em> [י] and corresponds generally to the English “g” when it has within it the point (daghesh lene); but without this point it is pronounced softer, more down in the throat. (See <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200001953/">HEBREW, II</a>.) In the Hebrew, this is the first letter in the opening word in each of the eight verses of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:119:17-19:119:24" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 119:17-24</a>.</p>

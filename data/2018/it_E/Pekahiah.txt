PEKAHIAH
(Pek·a·hiʹah) [Jah Has Opened].
King of Israel in Samaria, son and successor of Menahem. His brief reign of two years (c. 780-779 B.C.E.) was marked by idolatrous calf worship like that introduced by Jeroboam and permitted by Menahem. Pekahiah’s adjutant, Pekah, conspired against him, killed him, and began to reign in his place.​—2Ki 15:22-26.

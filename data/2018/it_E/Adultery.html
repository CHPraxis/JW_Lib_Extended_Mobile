<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">As used in the Bible, adultery generally refers to voluntary sexual intercourse by a married person with one of the opposite sex other than one’s mate, or, during the time that the Mosaic Law was in effect, such intercourse by any man with a married or a betrothed woman. The Hebrew root meaning “commit adultery” is <em>na·ʼaphʹ,</em> while its Greek counterpart is <em>moi·kheuʹo.</em>​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:16:32-26:16:32" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Eze 16:32</a>, ftn; <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:5:32-40:5:32" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Mt 5:32</a>, ftn.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Certain primitive societies allow free relations within the same tribe, but promiscuity outside tribal bounds is considered adultery. On the history of adultery, <em>Funk &amp; Wagnalls Standard Dictionary of Folklore, Mythology and Legend</em> (1949, Vol. 1, p. 15) says: “It occurs in all parts of the world and though it is considered reprehensible by many cultures it has enjoyed a considerable popularity in all cultures and at all times.” Monuments attest to its prevalence in ancient Egypt; Potiphar’s wife, who proposed that Joseph have relations with her, was such an Egyptian. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:39:7-1:39:7" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ge 39:7,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:39:10-1:39:10" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 10</a>) Historically as well as at present, adultery is generally forbidden, but penalties are seldom imposed.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Jehovah’s law separated Israel and raised the moral status of marriage and family life to a much higher level than that of the surrounding nations. The seventh commandment of the Decalogue stated in direct, unmistakable language: “You must not commit adultery.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:20:14-2:20:14" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ex 20:14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:5:18-5:5:18" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> De 5:18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:18:20-42:18:20" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> Lu 18:20</a>) Adulterous invasion of another man’s domain was prohibited, as were other forms of sexual misconduct.​—See <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200001555/">FORNICATION</a>; <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200003566/">PROSTITUTE</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Under the Law of Moses the penalty for adultery was severe​—death for both guilty parties: “In case a man is found lying down with a woman owned by an owner, both of them must then die together.” This applied even to a betrothed woman, it being considered that she had committed adultery if she had relations with a man other than the one to whom she was duly engaged. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:22:22-5:22:24" data-bid="5-1" class="b">De 22:22-24</a>) If suspected of adultery, a wife had to stand trial.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:5:11-4:5:31" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Nu 5:11-31</a>; see <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200004382/">THIGH</a>.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Christians, though not under Mosaic Law, must also refrain from adultery. “For the law code, ‘You must not commit adultery,’ . . . is summed up in this word, namely, ‘You must love your neighbor as yourself.’” There can be no hypocrisy in this matter. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:13:9-45:13:9" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ro 13:9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:2:22-45:2:22" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 2:22</a>) In teaching Bible principles, Jesus raised the moral standard still higher for Christians. He broadened out the matter of adultery, saying it was not limited to sexual contact a man might have with a woman not his mate: “Everyone that keeps on looking at a woman so as to have a passion for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart.” Such men are among those who “have eyes full of adultery.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:5:27-40:5:28" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Mt 5:27, 28;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:2:14-61:2:14" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 2Pe 2:14</a>.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Jesus also pointed out that if a divorce was obtained by either husband or wife, except on the ground of fornication (Gr., <em>por·neiʹa</em>), the remarriage of either one would constitute adultery. Even a single man who took such a divorced <span id="page54" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="54" data-before-text="54"></span>woman as his wife would be guilty of adultery.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:5:32-40:5:32" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Mt 5:32;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:19:9-40:19:9" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 19:9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:10:11-41:10:12" data-bid="9-3" class="b"> Mr 10:11, 12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:16:18-42:16:18" data-bid="9-4" class="b"> Lu 16:18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:7:2-45:7:3" data-bid="9-5" class="b"> Ro 7:2, 3</a>.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Adultery is “actually sin against God.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:39:9-1:39:9" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ge 39:9</a>) Jehovah will judge those guilty of adultery, and none who persist in such a course “will inherit God’s kingdom.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/39:3:5-39:3:5" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Mal 3:5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:6:9-46:6:10" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 1Co 6:9, 10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:13:4-58:13:4" data-bid="11-3" class="b"> Heb 13:4</a>) How true the proverb: “Anyone committing adultery with a woman is in want of heart; he that does it is bringing his own soul to ruin.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:6:32-20:6:35" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Pr 6:32-35</a>.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sn"><strong><em>How could one become guilty of spiritual adultery?</em></strong></p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">In a spiritual sense, adultery denotes unfaithfulness to Jehovah on the part of those who are joined to him in a covenant. Natural Israel in the Law covenant was, therefore, guilty of spiritual adultery because of false religious practices, some of which included sex-worship rites and disregard for the seventh commandment. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:3:8-24:3:9" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Jer 3:8, 9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:5:7-24:5:8" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 5:7, 8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:9:2-24:9:2" data-bid="13-3" class="b"> 9:2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:13:27-24:13:27" data-bid="13-4" class="b"> 13:27;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:23:10-24:23:10" data-bid="13-5" class="b"> 23:10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/28:7:4-28:7:4" data-bid="13-6" class="b"> Ho 7:4</a>) For similar reasons Jesus denounced as adulterous the generation of Jews in his day. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:12:39-40:12:39" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Mt 12:39;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:8:38-41:8:38" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> Mr 8:38</a>) Likewise today, if Christians who are dedicated to Jehovah and who are in the new covenant defile themselves with the present system of things, they commit spiritual adultery.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:4:4-59:4:4" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Jas 4:4</a>.</p>

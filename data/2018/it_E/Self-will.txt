SELF-WILL
The Greek term rendered “self-willed” (Tit 1:7; 2Pe 2:10, AS, KJ, NW) literally means “self-pleasing” and “denotes one who, dominated by self-interest, and inconsiderate of others, arrogantly asserts his own will.” (Vine’s Expository Dictionary of Old and New Testament Words, 1981, Vol. 3, p. 342) Self-will is therefore a quality that is out of harmony with the spirit of Christianity. Especially should it not be reflected by Christian overseers. (Tit 1:5, 7) The apostle Peter described individuals who had departed from proper Christian conduct as being “daring” and “self-willed.”​—2Pe 2:10.

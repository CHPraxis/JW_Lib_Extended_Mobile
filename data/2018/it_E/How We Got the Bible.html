<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">THERE is solid evidence that the Bible, the inspired Word of God, has been accurately copied and transmitted down to us. The evidence consists of ancient manuscripts available today​—perhaps 6,000 of the entire Hebrew Scriptures or portions of it and some 5,000 of the Christian Scriptures in Greek.</p>

<h3 id="p4" data-pid="4"><strong>Original Writings</strong></h3>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The original Bible writings were handwritten on perishable materials such as papyrus and vellum; none of the originals are known to exist today</p>
<h3 id="p6" data-pid="6"><strong>Copies​—Hebrew or Greek</strong></h3>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Soon after the originals were written, manuscript copies began to be produced. The copyists exercised great care to transmit the text accurately; the Masoretes counted even the letters that they copied</p>
<h3 id="p8" data-pid="8"><strong>Early Translations</strong></h3>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">To make the Scriptures available in other languages, Bible translation became necessary. There exist today manuscripts of such early versions as the <em>Septuagint</em> (a translation of the Hebrew Scriptures into Greek, from the third and second centuries B.C.E.) and Jerome’s <em>Vulgate</em> (a translation of Hebrew and Greek texts into Latin, originally produced c. 400 C.E.)</p>
<h3 id="p10" data-pid="10"><strong>Master Texts</strong></h3>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">By a comparative study of hundreds of existing Bible manuscripts, scholars have prepared master texts. These printed editions of original-language texts suggest the best readings available while drawing attention to variations that may exist in certain manuscripts. Texts of the Hebrew Scriptures with comparative readings in footnotes have been prepared by such scholars as Ginsburg and Kittel. Included among the master texts of the Christian Greek Scriptures are those published by Westcott and Hort as well as by Nestle and Aland</p>
<h3 id="p12" data-pid="12"><strong>Modern Translations</strong></h3>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Bible translators today generally use original-language master texts to produce modern translations</p>

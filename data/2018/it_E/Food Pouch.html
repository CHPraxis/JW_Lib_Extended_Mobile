<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A bag, usually made of leather, carried over the shoulder by travelers, shepherds, farmers, and others. It was used for food, clothing, and other provisions, but it was not the same as the smaller girdle purse used for gold, silver, and copper coins. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:10:9-40:10:9" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Mt 10:9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:6:8-41:6:8" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Mr 6:8</a>) David’s “shepherds’ bag” was doubtless such a food pouch. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:17:40-9:17:40" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1Sa 17:40</a>) Jesus Christ, when sending out first the 12 apostles and then the 70 disciples to preach in Israel, told them not to carry food pouches. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:10:5-40:10:5" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Mt 10:5,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:10:9-40:10:10" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 9, 10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:9:3-42:9:3" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> Lu 9:3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:10:1-42:10:1" data-bid="3-4" class="b"> 10:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:10:4-42:10:4" data-bid="3-5" class="b"> 4</a>) Jehovah would care for their needs through the hands of fellow Israelites, among whom hospitality was a custom. Just before his death Jesus indicated that circumstances would change as a result of official <span id="page846" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="846" data-before-text="846"></span>opposition, so he told his disciples to take along both purse and food pouch. Nevertheless, they were to seek first God’s Kingdom instead of being anxious about material needs; thus they would give evidence that they depended upon Jehovah God to care for them in the ministry.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:22:35-42:22:36" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Lu 22:35, 36;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:25-40:6:34" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Mt 6:25-34</a>.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A thing that confines or restrains from liberty, such as a fetter or chain, a shackle, a manacle; also confinement (when plural); a binding force or influence; a cause of union; a uniting tie. In Bible times various means were employed for restraint of prisoners, including fetters, stocks, shackles, and handcuffs, as well as prison houses.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">In the Scriptures the Hebrew word <em>nechoʹsheth,</em> usually meaning “copper,” is frequently translated “fetters of copper” or “copper fetters,” because fetters were often made of copper or bronze, although wood and iron were also employed. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:3:34-10:3:34" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2Sa 3:34;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:25:7-12:25:7" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 2Ki 25:7</a>) At Tocra, Libya, iron fetters were found closely resembling those pictured on Assyrian palace reliefs. Metal loops or bands 13 cm (5 in.) in diameter, large enough to encase the ankles, are linked by a flat bar. The bar, measured from end to end, is 18 cm (7 in.), which would force very small steps, making it difficult to walk. The Greek word for a “fetter” is <em>peʹde,</em> related to <em>pous</em> (foot).​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:8:29-42:8:29" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Lu 8:29</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The Hebrew verb <em>ʼa·sarʹ,</em> meaning “tie; bind; put in bonds” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:16:5-7:16:5" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Jg 16:5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:3:25-26:3:25" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Eze 3:25;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:23:33-12:23:33" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> 2Ki 23:33</a>), is the root of three other words having to do with bondage. <span id="page351" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="351" data-before-text="351"></span><em>ʼE·surʹ</em> refers to “fetters” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:37:15-24:37:15" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Jer 37:15</a>), <em>moh·se·rohthʹ</em> to “bands” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:2:3-19:2:3" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ps 2:3</a>), and <em>ma·soʹreth</em> to a “bond” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:20:37-26:20:37" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Eze 20:37</a>). The Greek word for a bond is <em>de·smosʹ</em> (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:8:29-42:8:29" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Lu 8:29</a>), while <em>synʹde·smos</em> refers to a “uniting bond,” or “joint-bond.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:4:3-49:4:3" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Eph 4:3</a>, <em>Int.</em></p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Chains were also used to bind prisoners. Two Hebrew words to denote a chain (<em>rethu·qahʹ</em> and <em>rat·tohqʹ</em>) come from the root <em>ra·thaqʹ,</em> meaning “bind.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/34:3:10-34:3:10" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Na 3:10</a>) <em>Haʹly·sis</em> is the Greek word for a chain.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:5:3-41:5:4" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Mr 5:3, 4</a>.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Many of the faithful pre-Christian witnesses suffered bonds and imprisonment. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:11:36-58:11:36" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Heb 11:36</a>) Of Jacob’s son Joseph in Egypt it is said, “with fetters they afflicted his feet, into irons his soul came.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:105:18-19:105:18" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Ps 105:18</a>) Delilah used seven still-moist sinews and, later, new ropes as bonds in an attempt to bring Samson into captivity to the Philistines, but these he broke easily. Finally, after he lost his strength and was captured, he was bound with two fetters of copper. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:16:6-7:16:12" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Jg 16:6-12,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:16:21-7:16:21" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 21</a>) Jeremiah was put in stocks by Pashhur, the temple commissioner, and was imprisoned by the princes of Judah in “the house of fetters.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:20:2-24:20:3" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Jer 20:2, 3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:37:15-24:37:15" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> 37:15</a>.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Because of unfaithfulness, Jehovah allowed King Manasseh of Judah to be put in fetters of copper by the king of Assyria.

<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Jesus was bound by the men who seized him in the garden of Gethsemane and was led to Annas and sent away in the same condition to Caiaphas.

<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">During his first imprisonment in Rome, Paul, in several of his letters written from there, mentions being in prison bonds, and he refers to himself as “an ambassador in chains.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:6:20-49:6:20" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Eph 6:20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:1:7-50:1:7" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> Php 1:7,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:1:13-50:1:17" data-bid="20-3" class="b"> 13-17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:4:18-51:4:18" data-bid="20-4" class="b"> Col 4:18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/57:1:10-57:1:10" data-bid="20-5" class="b"> Phm 10,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/57:1:13-57:1:13" data-bid="20-6" class="b"> 13</a>) However, as the description of his situation in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:28:16-44:28:31" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Acts 28:16-31</a> indicates, he was granted considerable freedom of movement, which allowed for writing, as well as receiving guests and visitors and preaching to them.

<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb"><strong>Metaphoric and Symbolic Uses.</strong> The expressions “bonds” and “chains” are often used metaphorically in the Scriptures for imprisonment or some form of confinement. With reference to the Babylonian exile, Zion is prophetically spoken of as being in bonds or as having bands on her neck.

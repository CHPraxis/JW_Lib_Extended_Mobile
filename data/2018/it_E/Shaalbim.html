(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:1:35-7:1:35" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Jg 1:35</a>) Later, Shaalbim was included in one of the districts annually providing Solomon’s household with food. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:4:7-11:4:9" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1Ki 4:7-9</a>) It is generally understood to be the same as Shaalabbin, a border city of Dan. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:19:40-6:19:42" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Jos 19:40-42</a>) There is only the difference of the final consonant in the Hebrew spelling of the two names. Shaalbon may be an alternate name for Shaalbim.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:23:32-10:23:32" data-bid="4-1" class="b">2Sa 23:32;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:11:33-13:11:33" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 1Ch 11:33</a>.</p>

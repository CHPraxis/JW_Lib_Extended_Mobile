SPELT
[Heb., kus·seʹmeth].
An inferior kind of wheat, the kernels of which are not readily separated from the chaff. Spelt (Triticum spelta) was anciently cultivated in Egypt (Ex 9:32), where, according to the Greek historian Herodotus (II, 36, 77), it was made into bread. (See Eze 4:9.) The Israelites seem to have planted it as a border around their fields to serve as a kind of fence.​—Isa 28:25.

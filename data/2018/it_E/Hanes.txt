HANES
(Haʹnes).
A site mentioned at Isaiah 30:4 in Jehovah’s denunciation of those seeking help from Egypt. (Isa 30:1-5) The location is uncertain.
There are various possible meanings given to the text. Some commentators believe the “envoys” are Jewish, sent to obtain Egyptian military aid, and that these arrive at Hanes on such a mission. Others suggest that the envoys are those of Pharaoh (mentioned in Isa 30:3) depicted as receiving the Jewish delegation when it reached Hanes. Whatever is the case, Jehovah showed that Egypt would be a vain source of help.​—Isa 30:5.

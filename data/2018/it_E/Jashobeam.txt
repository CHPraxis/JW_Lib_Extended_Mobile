JASHOBEAM
(Ja·shoʹbe·am) [possibly, The People Have Returned].
1. A Korahite warrior who joined David’s forces at Ziklag. (1Ch 12:1, 6) Possibly the same as No. 2.
2. The head one of David’s three most outstanding mighty men. Jashobeam used his spear to fight off several hundred of the enemy and was also one of the three to force their way into the Philistine camp to get water for David from the cistern of Bethlehem. (1Ch 11:11, 15-19) In the course of events, Jashobeam was appointed head of the first monthly division of 24,000. (1Ch 27:1, 2) He was a son of Zabdiel; a Hachmonite. His name is spelled Josheb-basshebeth at 2 Samuel 23:8.​—See JOSHEB-BASSHEBETH.

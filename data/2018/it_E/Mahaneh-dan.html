<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">(Maʹha·neh-dan) [Camp of Dan].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A place once described as lying “between Zorah and Eshtaol” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:13:25-7:13:25" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Jg 13:25</a>) and another time as being located W of Kiriath-jearim. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:18:11-7:18:12" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Jg 18:11, 12</a>) Some believe that these are two different sites, since the suggested locations for Eshtaol and Zorah are a number of miles SW of Kiriath-jearim. In any event, the location(s) of Mahaneh-dan is unknown. Its name means “Camp of Dan” and, therefore, perhaps simply denoted a temporary settlement or a campsite and understandably could have applied to more than one place.</p>

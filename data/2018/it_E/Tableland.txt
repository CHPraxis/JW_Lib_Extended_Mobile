TABLELAND
The Hebrew term mi·shohrʹ, rendered “tableland,” is derived from a root meaning “be straight, right.” This Hebrew word may refer to “level land” in contrast to mountainous or hilly country (1Ki 20:23, 25; Isa 40:4; 42:16; Zec 4:7) and can mean “uprightness” (Ps 27:11; 45:6; 67:4; 143:10; Isa 11:4) or designate a situation free from obstacles. (Ps 26:12) At times mi·shohrʹ applies to the tableland situated E of the Dead Sea between Heshbon in the N and the torrent valley of Arnon in the S.​—De 3:10; Jos 13:9, 15-17; 20:8.

ZALMON
(Zalʹmon).
1. An Ahohite warrior of David. (2Sa 23:8, 28) Apparently called Ilai at 1 Chronicles 11:29.
2. A mountain near Shechem. From Mount Zalmon, Abimelech and his forces cut wood with which to burn down the vault belonging to the city of Shechem. (Jg 9:48, 49) As the only mountains near Shechem are Ebal and Gerizim, Zalmon was either a peak or slope of one of these, or else it was some other less important hill nearby.
3. A lofty peak evidently in Bashan, E of the Jordan. (Ps 68:14, 15) It was perhaps the highest peak of Mount Hauran (Jebel ed Druz).

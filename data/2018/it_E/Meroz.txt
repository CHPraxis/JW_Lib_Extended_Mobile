MEROZ
(Meʹroz).
A place cursed by an angel for not coming “to the assistance of Jehovah.” (Jg 5:23) It may be that the inhabitants of Meroz did not aid Jehovah’s designated commander Barak in the actual fight against the Canaanites under Sisera. (Jg 5:5-16) Or, if Meroz lay on defeated Sisera’s escape route, perhaps its inhabitants failed to detain him. (Jg 4:17) The fact that the Bible account next relates Jael’s courageous act in killing Sisera lends some support to the latter view. (Jg 5:24-27) The angel pronouncing the curse possibly was one who fought for Israel.
Meroz’ exact location is unknown, although some tentatively place it at Khirbet Marus, about 8 km (5 mi) S of Kedesh in Naphtali.

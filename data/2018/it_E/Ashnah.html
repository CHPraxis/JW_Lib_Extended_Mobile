<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><strong>1.</strong> A town of Judah in the Shephelah mentioned among other cities, including Eshtaol and Zorah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:15:33-6:15:33" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Jos 15:33</a>) A tentative identification is the village of <em>ʽ</em>Aslin, between Eshtaol and Zorah, near the edge of the Judean coastal plain.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><strong>2.</strong> A second town of Judah, listed among nine cities and evidently farther to the S than the first Ashnah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:15:43-6:15:43" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Jos 15:43</a>) The identification is uncertain; a suggested site is Idhna, located about midway between Hebron and Lachish, and about 8 km (5 mi) ESE of Mareshah, which appears in the same list.</p>

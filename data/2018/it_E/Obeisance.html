<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><strong>Obeisance in the Christian Greek Scriptures.</strong> The Greek <em>pro·sky·neʹo</em> corresponds closely to the Hebrew <em>hish·ta·chawahʹ</em> as to conveying the thought of both obeisance to creatures and worship to God or a deity. The <em>manner</em> of expressing the obeisance is perhaps not so prominent in <em>pro·sky·neʹo</em> as in <em>hish·ta·chawahʹ,</em> where the Hebrew term graphically conveys the thought of prostration or bowing down. Scholars derive the Greek term from the verb <em>ky·neʹo,</em> “kiss.” The usage of the word in the Christian Greek Scriptures (as also in the Greek <em>Septuagint</em> translation of the Hebrew Scriptures) shows that persons to whose actions the term is applied prostrated themselves or bowed down.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:2:11-40:2:11" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Mt 2:11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:18:26-40:18:26" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> 18:26;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:28:9-40:28:9" data-bid="20-3" class="b"> 28:9</a>.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">As with the Hebrew term, the context must be considered to determine whether <em>pro·sky·neʹo</em> refers to obeisance solely in the form of deep respect or obeisance in the form of religious worship.

So, too, where the object of the obeisance is left unstated, its being directed to God is understood. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:12:20-43:12:20" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Joh 12:20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:8:27-44:8:27" data-bid="23-2" class="b"> Ac 8:27;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:24:11-44:24:11" data-bid="23-3" class="b"> 24:11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:11:21-58:11:21" data-bid="23-4" class="b"> Heb 11:21;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:11:1-66:11:1" data-bid="23-5" class="b"> Re 11:1</a>) On the other hand, the action of those of “the synagogue of Satan” who are made to “come and do obeisance” before the feet of Christians is clearly not worship.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:3:9-66:3:9" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Re 3:9</a>.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Obeisance to a human king is found in Jesus’ illustration at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:18:26-40:18:26" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Matthew 18:26</a>. It is evident that this was the kind of obeisance that the astrologers <span id="page524" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="524" data-before-text="524"></span>rendered to the child Jesus, “born king of the Jews,” that Herod professed interest in expressing, and that the soldiers mockingly rendered to Jesus before his impalement. They clearly did not view Jesus as God or as a deity. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:2:2-40:2:2" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Mt 2:2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:2:8-40:2:8" data-bid="26-2" class="b"> 8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:15:19-41:15:19" data-bid="26-3" class="b"> Mr 15:19</a>) While some translators use the word “worship” in the majority of cases where <em>pro·sky·neʹo</em> describes persons’ actions toward Jesus, the evidence does not warrant one’s reading too much into this rendering. Rather, the circumstances that evoked the obeisance correspond very closely to those producing obeisance to the earlier prophets and kings. (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:8:2-40:8:2" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Mt 8:2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:9:18-40:9:18" data-bid="27-2" class="b"> 9:18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:15:25-40:15:25" data-bid="27-3" class="b"> 15:25;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:20:20-40:20:20" data-bid="27-4" class="b"> 20:20</a> with <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:25:23-9:25:24" data-bid="28-1" class="b">1Sa 25:23, 24;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:14:4-10:14:7" data-bid="28-2" class="b"> 2Sa 14:4-7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:1:16-11:1:16" data-bid="28-3" class="b"> 1Ki 1:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:4:36-12:4:37" data-bid="28-4" class="b"> 2Ki 4:36, 37</a>.) The very expressions of those involved often reveal that, while they clearly recognized Jesus as God’s representative, they rendered obeisance to him, not as to God or a deity, but as “God’s Son,” the foretold “Son of man,” the Messiah with divine authority. On many occasions their obeisance expressed a gratitude for divine revelation or evidence of favor like that expressed in earlier times.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:14:32-40:14:33" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Mt 14:32, 33;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:28:5-40:28:10" data-bid="29-2" class="b"> 28:5-10,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:28:16-40:28:18" data-bid="29-3" class="b"> 16-18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:24:50-42:24:52" data-bid="29-4" class="b"> Lu 24:50-52;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:9:35-43:9:35" data-bid="29-5" class="b"> Joh 9:35,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:9:38-43:9:38" data-bid="29-6" class="b"> 38</a>.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">While earlier prophets and also angels had accepted obeisance, Peter stopped Cornelius from rendering such to him, and the angel or angels of John’s vision twice stopped John from doing so, referring to himself as “a fellow slave” and concluding with the exhortation to “worship God [<em>toi The·oiʹ pro·skyʹne·son</em>].” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:10:25-44:10:26" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Ac 10:25, 26;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:19:10-66:19:10" data-bid="30-2" class="b"> Re 19:10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:22:8-66:22:9" data-bid="30-3" class="b"> 22:8, 9</a>) Evidently Christ’s coming had brought in new relationships affecting standards of conduct toward others of God’s servants. He taught his disciples that “one is your teacher, whereas all you are brothers . . . your Leader is one, the Christ” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:23:8-40:23:12" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Mt 23:8-12</a>), for it was in him that the prophetic figures and types found their fulfillment, even as the angel told John that “the bearing witness to Jesus is what inspires prophesying.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:19:10-66:19:10" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Re 19:10</a>) Jesus was David’s Lord, the greater than Solomon, the prophet greater than Moses.

<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">So, too, John, by virtue of having been declared righteous or justified by God as an anointed Christian, called to be a heavenly son of God and a member of the Kingdom, was in a different relationship to the angel(s) of Revelation than were the Israelites to the angels that had earlier appeared to them. The angel(s) evidently recognized this change of relationship when rejecting John’s obeisance.​—Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:6:3-46:6:3" data-bid="34-1" class="b">1Co 6:3</a>; see <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200001142/">DECLARE RIGHTEOUS</a>.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb"><strong><em>Obeisance to the glorified Jesus Christ.</em></strong> On the other hand, Christ Jesus has been exalted by his Father to a position second only to God, so that “in the name of Jesus every knee should bend of those in heaven and those on earth and those under the ground, and every tongue should openly acknowledge that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:2:9-50:2:11" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Php 2:9-11</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:7:13-27:7:14" data-bid="36-1" class="b">Da 7:13, 14,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:7:27-27:7:27" data-bid="36-2" class="b"> 27</a>.) <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:1:6-58:1:6" data-bid="37-1" class="b">Hebrews 1:6</a> also shows that even the angels render obeisance to the resurrected Jesus Christ. Many translations of this text here render <em>pro·sky·neʹo</em> as “worship,” while some render it by such expressions as “bow before” (<em>AT; Yg</em>) and ‘pay homage’ (<em>NE</em>). No matter what English term is used, the original Greek remains the same and the understanding of what it is that the angels render to Christ must accord with the rest of the Scriptures. Jesus himself emphatically stated to Satan that “it is Jehovah your God you must worship [form of <em>pro·sky·neʹo</em>], and it is to him alone you must render sacred service.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:4:8-40:4:10" data-bid="38-1" class="b">Mt 4:8-10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:4:7-42:4:8" data-bid="38-2" class="b"> Lu 4:7, 8</a>) Similarly, the angel(s) told John to “worship God” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:19:10-66:19:10" data-bid="39-1" class="b">Re 19:10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:22:9-66:22:9" data-bid="39-2" class="b"> 22:9</a>), and this injunction came after Jesus’ resurrection and exaltation, showing that matters had not changed in this regard.

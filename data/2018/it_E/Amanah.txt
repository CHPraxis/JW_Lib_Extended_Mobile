AMANAH
(A·maʹnah) [from a root meaning “trustworthy; faithful; long-lasting”].
This name appears in the Hebrew at Song of Solomon 4:8 in connection with Lebanon and Mount Hermon. Most translations simply transliterate the Hebrew word; however, some scholars understand it to refer to the Anti-Lebanon Range, while others apply it to that portion of the Anti-Lebanons in which the Nahr Barada has its source.​—See ANTI-LEBANON.

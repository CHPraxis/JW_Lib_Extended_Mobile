SHEMER
(Sheʹmer) [possibly from a root meaning “guard”].
1. A descendant of Asher, perhaps his great-grandson. Four sons of Shemer are named. (1Ch 7:30, 34) Shemer is spelled Shomer in 1 Chronicles 7:32.
2. A Merarite Levite, ancestor of Ethan.​—1Ch 6:44-47.
3. The owner of the hill of Samaria; possibly a tribe rather than an individual, for “Samaria” means “Belonging to the Clan Shemer.” Israelite King Omri bought the mountain for two talents of silver ($13,212) and began ruling from there in about 945 B.C.E.​—1Ki 16:23, 24.

Around the Sea of Galilee




MAP: Around the Sea of Galilee







SURROUNDED by hills in northern Palestine lies the freshwater inland lake called the Sea of Galilee, Sea of Tiberias, or Lake of Gennesaret. Set like a jewel in a deep basin, the lake is located some 210 m (700 ft) below sea level. It is about 21 km (13 mi) long and about 12 km (7.5 mi) wide. Both on and around this lake many outstanding events of Jesus’ ministry took place.
Several times Jesus spoke from a boat to crowds assembled on the shores of the sea. (Mr 4:1, 2) Capernaum, a city on the northern shore, came to be known as Jesus’ “own city,” even though he traveled much of the time. (Mt 9:1; Mr 2:1) Jesus walked on the waters of this sea and appeared near it after his resurrection.​—Joh 6:1, 16-21; 21:1, 4-19.

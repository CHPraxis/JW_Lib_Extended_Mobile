LO-AMMI
(Lo-amʹmi) [Not My People].
The name of the second son borne by Hosea’s wife Gomer. Jehovah commanded that the child be given this meaningful name to show that He had disowned faithless Israel. (Ho 1:8, 9) It has been suggested that this boy was not Hosea’s offspring but a child of Gomer’s adultery (Ho 1:2), for when Jezreel was born, it was said that Gomer “bore to him [Hosea] a son,” whereas regarding Lo-ammi it is merely said that “she proceeded to become pregnant and give birth to a son.”​—Ho 1:3, 8.

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A town E of the Jordan, taken by Israel from Amorite King Sihon and assigned to the Reubenites, who desired it because of surrounding pasturelands. Apparently it was also called Sebam.

It was noted for its vineyards and summer fruitage.

However, some tentatively identify it with Qurn el-Kibsh, about 5 km (3 mi) WSW of Heshbon (modern Hisban).</p>

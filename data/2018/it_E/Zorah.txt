ZORAH
(Zoʹrah).
A city in the Shephelah allotted to the tribe of Judah. (Jos 15:20, 33) Situated on the boundary between Dan and Judah, it was inhabited by people of Dan. (Jos 19:41, 48; Jg 18:2, 8, 11) The Danite Samson was born at Zorah and was buried nearby. (Jg 13:2, 24, 25; 16:31) The city was fortified by King Rehoboam, perhaps because of its strategic location about 25 km (16 mi) W of Jerusalem. (2Ch 11:5, 10) Zorah was repopulated by some sons of Judah who returned from Babylonian exile. (Ne 11:25, 29) It is identified with present-day Sarʽah (Tel Zorʽa), on the N side of what is suggested to be the Valley of Sorek.

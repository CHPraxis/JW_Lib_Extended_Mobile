GEBA
(Geʹba) [Hill].
A city of Benjamin given to the Kohathites; one of the 13 priestly cities. (Jos 18:21, 24; 21:17, 19; 1Ch 6:54, 60) Geba apparently was situated by the northern boundary of the kingdom of Judah, whence the expression “from Geba as far as Beer-sheba.” (2Ki 23:8) The ancient city is usually identified with the village of Jabaʽ, almost 9 km (5.5 mi) NNE of the Temple Mount in Jerusalem. A steep valley separates this site from the suggested location of ancient Michmash. In the valley there are two hills with steep rocky sides. These perhaps correspond to the ‘toothlike crags’ Bozez and Seneh, one “facing Michmash,” the other “facing Geba.”​—1Sa 14:4, 5.
Geba was one of the cities that figured in King Saul’s campaign against the Philistines. Evidently at the direction of his father Saul, Jonathan struck down the Philistine “garrison” at Geba. (1Sa 13:3, 4) In retaliation, the Philistines assembled a mighty force at Michmash, whereupon many Israelites fearfully went into hiding, some even fleeing across the Jordan. (1Sa 13:5-7) Later, Jonathan made his way from Geba to the Philistine outpost, undoubtedly stationed at the edge of “the ravine pass of Michmash.” On his hands and feet, Jonathan ascended the steep passage to the outpost and, with the cooperation of his armor-bearer, struck down about 20 Philistines.​—1Sa 14:6-14; compare 1Sa 13:16, 23.
Years later, Asa fortified Geba with stones and timbers of Ramah. (1Ki 15:22; 2Ch 16:6) At a time not specified in the Bible, certain inhabitants of Geba were taken into exile at Manahath. (1Ch 8:6) On its way toward Jerusalem, the Assyrian army under Sennacherib apparently passed through Geba. (Isa 10:24, 28-32) Among the Jews coming back from Babylonian exile were ‘sons of Geba’; the city itself was also reoccupied after the return. (Ezr 2:1, 26; Ne 7:6, 30; 11:31; 12:29) Alluding to the exaltation of rebuilt Jerusalem, the prophet Zechariah spoke of the hilly and mountainous land that lies between Geba and Rimmon as becoming low like the Arabah.​—Zec 14:10; see GIBEAH No. 2.

METALS
More than 75Â percent of the more than a hundred elements known to man are metals. Gold, silver, copper, iron, and lead are all mentioned specifically in the Scriptures. The first Biblical references to metals are in Genesis 2:11 and 4:22.
In physical properties metals are opaque, fusible, and ductile; they have a metallic luster and are usually good conductors of heat and electricity. Chemically and physically the metals have certain distinguishing characteristics. For specific information and the Scriptural occurrences, see the above-mentioned metals under their individual names; also the heading REFINE, REFINER.

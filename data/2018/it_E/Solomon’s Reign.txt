Solomon’s Reign




THE reign of King Solomon gives us a prophetic glimpse of the future. During his royal rule Israel reached its pinnacle of wealth and glory. Solomon was both a wise king and a master organizer. He built a magnificent temple to Jehovah, various government buildings, and a royal palace, as depicted below. He established administrative districts that, on a rotational basis, provided the royal household with a variety of food, regardless of the season.
Solomon’s rule was a time of genuine peace and security. This well foreshadows the peaceful reign of the Messiah, who “will have subjects from sea to sea and from the River [Euphrates] to the ends of the earth.”​—Ps 72:8.

During Solomon’s reign, Judah and Israel dwelt in security​—figuratively speaking, everyone under his own vine and under his own fig tree (1Ki 4:25)
Even rulers of other lands came to hear his wisdom (1Ki 4:34; 10:1)

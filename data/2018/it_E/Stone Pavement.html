<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A paved place at Jerusalem where Roman Governor Pontius Pilate sat on the judgment seat when Jesus Christ was before him for trial. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:19:13-43:19:13" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Joh 19:13</a>) The site was called, in Hebrew, <em>“Gabbatha,”</em> a word of uncertain derivation and possibly meaning “hill,” “height,” or “open space.” The Greek name for it, <em>Li·thoʹstro·ton</em> (Stone Pavement), may indicate a tessellated pavement, one of ornamental mosaic work.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“The Stone Pavement” where Jesus appeared before Pilate was in some way associated with “the governor’s palace.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:19:1-43:19:13" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Joh 19:1-13</a>) It may have been an open area in front of the palace of Herod the Great; some scholars favor identification with a site near or a central court within the Tower of Antonia, NW of the temple grounds. But the exact site of The Stone Pavement remains unknown.​—See <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200000295/">ANTONIA, TOWER OF</a>; <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200001750/">GOVERNOR’S PALACE</a>.</p>

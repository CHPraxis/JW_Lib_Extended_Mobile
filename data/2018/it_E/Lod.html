<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A city with dependent towns apparently built by the Benjamite Shemed, ‘son’ of Elpaal. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:8:1-13:8:1" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1Ch 8:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:8:12-13:8:12" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 12</a>) After the Jews returned from Babylonian exile Lod was one of their most westerly settlements. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/15:2:33-15:2:33" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ezr 2:33;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:7:37-16:7:37" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Ne 7:37;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:11:35-16:11:35" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> 11:35</a>) It is thought to be the same as Lydda, where Peter healed Aeneas. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:9:32-44:9:38" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ac 9:32-38</a>) Situated in a fertile valley at the southern edge of the Plain of Sharon, el-Ludd (Lod) is about 18 km (11 mi) SE of Joppa. Its location anciently placed the city at the intersection of what is considered to have been the <span id="page262" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="262" data-before-text="262"></span>principal route between Egypt and Babylon and the main road from Joppa to Jerusalem. During the Common Era this strategic position exposed the city to ravages by the armies of the Romans, Saracens, Crusaders, and Mongols.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">(Eʹvil-merʹo·dach) [from Babylonian, meaning “Worshiper of Marduk”].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The Babylonian king who succeeded Nebuchadnezzar to the throne in 581 B.C.E. In the year of his becoming king, Evil-merodach extended kindness to Jehoiachin the king of Judah by releasing him from the house of detention. That was in the 37th year of Jehoiachin’s exile in Babylon. Evil-merodach granted him a position of favor above all the other kings who were in captivity in Babylon. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:25:27-12:25:30" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2Ki 25:27-30;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:52:31-24:52:34" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Jer 52:31-34</a>) Josephus claims that Evil-merodach viewed Jehoiachin as one of his most intimate friends.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">There is also archaeological testimony concerning Evil-merodach (Awil-Marduk, Amil-Marduk). For example, an inscription on a vase found near Susa reads: “Palace of Amil-Marduk, King of Babylon, son of Nebuchadnezzar, King of Babylon.” (<em>Mémoires de la mission archéologique de Susiane,</em> by V. Scheil, Paris, 1913, Vol. XIV) Berossus, quoted by Josephus, attributes to him a reign of two years. Josephus himself assigns him 18 years. Supposedly slain as the result of a plot, Evil-merodach was replaced by Neriglissar (Nergal-sharezer). Reliable confirmation of these details is lacking.</p>

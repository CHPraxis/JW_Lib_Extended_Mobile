<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">[Heb., <em>peʹreʼ</em>].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">An animal of the horse family resembling the wild ass in appearance and habits, though easily distinguished from the latter by its dark or black stripes. The stripes distort the shape and unity of the zebra’s outline to such an extent that even sharp-eyed natives are often unaware of its presence just 40 or 50 m (130 or 160 ft) away. The zebra’s keen senses of sight and smell, as well as its ability to run swiftly, serve as a protection from carnivores. The animal has been reported to travel at 64 km/​hr (40 mph) after its initial burst of speed. Also, its hooves and teeth are effective weapons of defense.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The zebra is a wild animal that is hard to tame.

EPAENETUS
(E·paeʹne·tus) [Praised; Commended].
A Christian in the congregation at Rome whom Paul mentions by name and to whom he sends personal greetings. (Ro 16:5) Epaenetus is called “a firstfruits of Asia.” Possibly he was contacted personally by Paul, since the household of Stephanas is similarly referred to as “the firstfruits of Achaia,” and Paul baptized this household.​—1Co 1:16; 16:15.

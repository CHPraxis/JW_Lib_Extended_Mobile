TEMA
(Teʹma).
1. One of the sons of Ishmael.​—Ge 25:13-15; 1Ch 1:29, 30.
2. The same as modern Taima, an oasis located about 400 km (250 mi) SE of Ezion-geber, where two major caravan routes crossed. (Job 6:19) Tema, along with nearby Dedan, is mentioned in the prophecies of Isaiah (21:13, 14) and Jeremiah (25:15-23). In this latter prophecy Tema was specifically named as among the places whose inhabitants would be compelled to drink of Jehovah’s “cup of the wine of rage.” Babylonian King Nabonidus apparently established a second capital in Tema, leaving Belshazzar at Babylon in charge during his absence.

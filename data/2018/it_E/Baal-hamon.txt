BAAL-HAMON
(Baʹal-haʹmon) [Owner of a Crowd (Multitude)].
A place mentioned at Song of Solomon 8:11 as the location of a productive vineyard of King Solomon. No indication is given as to its site. While many view it as a literal location, some suggest that it is used in this poetic writing figuratively to represent the realm over which Solomon ruled and which produced great wealth.​—Compare 1Ki 4:20, 21.

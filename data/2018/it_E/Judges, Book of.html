<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A Bible book that basically covers a period of some 330 years between Israel’s conquest of Canaan and the beginning of the monarchy. Earlier, the Israelites had been forewarned that their failure to drive out the inhabitants <span id="page135" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="135" data-before-text="135"></span>of the land, as divinely commanded, would lead to their adopting the debased religious practices of the Canaanites. Finally this would result in Jehovah’s disfavor and his abandoning them to their enemies. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:23:32-2:23:33" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ex 23:32, 33;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:34:11-2:34:17" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 34:11-17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:33:55-4:33:55" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> Nu 33:55;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:7:2-5:7:5" data-bid="1-4" class="b"> De 7:2-5</a>) The historical record found in the book of Judges shows how the warning became a reality. However, rather than deal extensively with Israel’s unfaithfulness and the resultant foreign oppression, the book primarily relates the exploits of the judges and the marvelous deliverances Jehovah performed by means of them. Thus Jehovah’s saving ability and his long-suffering, mercy, undeserved kindness, and justice are highlighted. The judges themselves stand out as sterling examples of faith.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:11:32-58:11:34" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Heb 11:32-34,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:11:39-58:11:40" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 39, 40</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><strong>Arrangement.</strong> Judges is linked with the preceding Bible book by its opening words, “And after the death of Joshua.” However, some of the happenings narrated therein evidently occurred before Joshua died. For example, <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:2:6-7:2:6" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Judges 2:6</a> reads: “When Joshua sent the people away, then the sons of Israel went their way, each to his inheritance, to take possession of the land.” So it appears that <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:1:1-7:3:6" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Judges 1:1–3:6</a> serves as an introduction, the writer having drawn on events taking place before and after Joshua’s death in order to provide the historical background for the account that follows. The section running from <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:3:7-7:3:7" data-bid="5-1" class="b">chapter 3, verse 7</a>, to the end of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:16:1-7:16:31" data-bid="6-1" class="b">chapter 16</a> is, basically, in chronological order and relates the activities of 12 judges (not including Deborah), starting with Othniel and concluding with Samson. The last part of the book could be termed an appendix and fits a period much earlier than Samson’s judgeship. The capture of Laish by the Danites could reasonably have taken place before Joshua’s death. (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:19:47-6:19:47" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Jos 19:47;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:18:27-7:18:29" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> Jg 18:27-29</a>.) The mass sex crime of the men of Gibeah and subsequent events resulting in the near extermination of the tribe of Benjamin probably occurred not many years after Joshua’s death. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:19:1-7:21:25" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Jg 19:1–21:25;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:24:31-6:24:31" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> Jos 24:31</a>) This would allow <span id="page136" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="136" data-before-text="136"></span>sufficient time for the Benjamites to have increased from about 600 men (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:20:47-7:20:47" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Jg 20:47</a>) to nearly 60,000 warriors by the time of David’s reign.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:7:6-13:7:12" data-bid="10-1" class="b">1Ch 7:6-12</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><strong>Writer and Time of Composition.</strong> Internal evidence provides a basis for determining when the book of Judges was written. It was compiled while a king ruled over Israel. Otherwise, the writer, when referring to the past, would not have said: “In those days there was no king in Israel.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:17:6-7:17:6" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Jg 17:6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:18:1-7:18:1" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 18:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:19:1-7:19:1" data-bid="11-3" class="b"> 19:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:21:25-7:21:25" data-bid="11-4" class="b"> 21:25</a>) Yet it was at a time when the Jebusites still inhabited Jerusalem. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:1:21-7:1:21" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Jg 1:21</a>) Since, in 1070 B.C.E., David captured “the stronghold of Zion” (a part of Jerusalem) from the Jebusites and transferred his capital there (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:5:6-10:5:9" data-bid="13-1" class="b">2Sa 5:6-9</a>), the book of Judges must have been committed to writing before that date, probably during Saul’s reign. At that time Samuel was the main advocate of true worship and, as Jehovah’s prophet, would have been the logical one to have recorded this book.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><strong>Authenticity.</strong> That the book of Judges rightly occupies a place in the Bible canon there can be no question. It is frank and honest, and it does not hide Israel’s gross sins. Throughout, the book gives glory and honor, not to the human judges, but to Jehovah God as Israel’s real Deliverer. It shows that God’s spirit empowered the judges (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:3:9-7:3:10" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Jg 3:9, 10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:6:34-7:6:34" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> 6:34;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:11:29-7:11:29" data-bid="14-3" class="b"> 11:29;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:13:24-7:13:25" data-bid="14-4" class="b"> 13:24, 25;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:14:6-7:14:6" data-bid="14-5" class="b"> 14:6,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:14:19-7:14:19" data-bid="14-6" class="b"> 19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:15:14-7:15:14" data-bid="14-7" class="b"> 15:14,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:15:18-7:15:18" data-bid="14-8" class="b"> 18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:16:20-7:16:20" data-bid="14-9" class="b"> 16:20,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:16:28-7:16:30" data-bid="14-10" class="b"> 28-30</a>) and they, in turn, recognized Jehovah as Judge (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:11:27-7:11:27" data-bid="15-1" class="b">11:27</a>) and King (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:8:23-7:8:23" data-bid="16-1" class="b">8:23</a>).

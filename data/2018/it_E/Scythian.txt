SCYTHIAN
(Scythʹi·an).
A fierce, nomadic people generally associated with the region N and NE of the Black Sea. Evidence suggests that they extended their roaming to western Siberia near the border of Mongolia. In the first century C.E. the word “Scythian” implied the worst of uncivilized people. However, even such persons could become Christians and have an equal standing with other believers as members of Christ’s body. Wrote the apostle Paul: “There is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, foreigner, Scythian, slave, freeman, but Christ is all things and in all.”​—Col 3:11; see CUTTINGS.

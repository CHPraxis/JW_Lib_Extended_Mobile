<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">(Tir·shaʹtha).</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The Persian title for the governor of a jurisdictional district. In the five times it is used, it is preceded by the Hebrew definite article <em>ha,</em> making it in English <em>“the</em> Tirshatha.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The officials mentioned in the Bible by the title “Tirshatha” ruled over Judah, one of the Persian provinces. Zerubbabel was evidently the Tirshatha mentioned in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/15:2:63-15:2:63" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ezra 2:63</a> and <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:7:65-16:7:65" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Nehemiah 7:65,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:7:70-16:7:70" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 70</a>. Later when Nehemiah became governor he was the Tirshatha and is referred to as such at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:8:9-16:8:9" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Nehemiah 8:9</a> and <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:10:1-16:10:1" data-bid="4-1" class="b">10:1</a>.</p>

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The husband of one of the Marys that stood beside Jesus as he hung on the torture stake. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:19:25-43:19:25" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Joh 19:25</a>) Presumably he was the husband of “the other Mary,” and father of the apostle James the Less and of his brother Joses.

That Clopas was a brother of Joseph, the adoptive father of Jesus, is a conjecture based entirely on tradition.</p>

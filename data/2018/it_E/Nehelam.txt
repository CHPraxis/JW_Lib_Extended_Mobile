NEHELAM
(Ne·helʹam) [Of (Belonging to) Nehelam; or, possibly, The Dreamer].
Perhaps the home of the false prophet Shemaiah. (Jer 29:24, 31, 32) But a location by this name is unknown. Therefore some have suggested that “of Nehelam” may be a family designation and thus translate the phrase “the Nehelamite.” (KJ, NE) Others believe that Jeremiah was perhaps making a play on the Hebrew word cha·lamʹ, meaning “dream.”​—Compare Jer 23:25.

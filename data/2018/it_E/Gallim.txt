GALLIM
(Galʹlim) [Heaps].
The home of Palti, to whom Saul gave his daughter Michal as his wife after David was outlawed. (1Sa 25:44) It is possibly the same as the Gallim whose inhabitants, centuries later, cried out in lamentation over the approaching Assyrian army under Sennacherib. (Isa 10:24, 30) Some scholars place Gallim at Khirbet Kakul (Horvat Kaʽkul), about 4.5 km (3 mi) NNE of the Temple Mount.

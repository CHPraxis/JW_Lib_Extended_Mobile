<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">(As·shuʹrim).</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Descendants of Dedan, son of Jokshan, one of Abraham’s sons by Keturah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:25:1-1:25:3" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ge 25:1-3</a>) The use in the Hebrew text of the plural ending (<em>im</em>) with this name may indicate that Asshurim represents a tribe or people. Specific identification is not possible, but some north Arabian tribe is probably meant. They should not be confused, however, with the Assyrians who were descendants of Shem’s son Asshur.</p>

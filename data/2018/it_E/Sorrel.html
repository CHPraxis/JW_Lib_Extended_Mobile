<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Any of a number of plants of the buckwheat family having a sour taste because of the presence of oxalic acid in their juicy leaves and stems. The radical leaves of sorrel (<em>Rumex acetosella</em>) grow in a cluster. Shaped like an arrow at the base, the somewhat oval leaves measure about 10 cm (4 in.) in length. The flower stalks may attain a height of about 0.6 m (2 ft) or more. Anciently, the Israelites mixed sorrel with the fodder for their cattle and asses.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:30:24-23:30:24" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Isa 30:24</a>.</p>

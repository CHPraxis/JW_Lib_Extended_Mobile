KEDEMOTH
(Kedʹe·moth) [from a root meaning “east”].
The name applied to a city E of the Jordan and apparently also to the wilderness surrounding it. From the Wilderness of Kedemoth, Moses sent messengers to Amorite King Sihon, requesting permission to pass through his land. (De 2:26, 27) Originally given to the Reubenites, Kedemoth was later assigned to the Merarite Levites. (Jos 13:15, 18; 21:34, 36, 37; 1Ch 6:77-79) Scholars generally favor as a possible identification one of the tells near where the torrent valley of Arnon begins, such as Qasr ez-Zaʽfaran, situated about 16 km (10 mi) NE of what is thought to be the site of ancient Dibon.

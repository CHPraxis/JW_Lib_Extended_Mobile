<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A well that Isaac’s servants dug in the vicinity of Gerar and Rehoboth. It was named Sitnah because of their dispute over it with the shepherds of Gerar. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:26:19-1:26:22" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ge 26:19-22</a>) It was perhaps somewhere in Wadi Ruheibe (Nahal Shunera), about 30 km (19 mi) SW of Beer-sheba. But Sitnah’s exact location is not known.</p>

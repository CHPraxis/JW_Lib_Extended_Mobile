TABBATH
(Tabʹbath).
After being attacked by Gideon’s forces, the enemy Midianites fled “as far as the outskirts of Abel-meholah by Tabbath.” (Jg 7:12, 19-22) Tabbath is tentatively identified with Ras Abu Tabat, about 5 km (3 mi) E of the Jordan River and 10 km (6 mi) N of Succoth. Abel-meholah apparently was W of the Jordan and is spoken of as “by [“opposite,” JB] Tabbath.”​—See ABEL-MEHOLAH.

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A name appearing at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:25:1-1:25:3" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Genesis 25:1-3</a> along with Asshurim and Letushim, all being descendants of Abraham and Keturah through Dedan. The use of the plural Hebrew ending <em>im</em> in the name Leummim may indicate that it represents a tribe or people. Specific identification of this Dedanite tribe is not possible. It has been suggested, however, that they inhabited some part of Arabia, likely in the vicinity generally assigned to Dedan.​—See <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200003094/">MIZRAIM</a>.</p>

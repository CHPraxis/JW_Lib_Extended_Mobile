QUART
After the opening of “the third seal,” as referred to at Revelation 6:5, 6, both a khoiʹnix of wheat and three khoiʹni·kes of barley are said to sell for a denarius. Generally, scholars believe the size of the khoiʹnix to be slightly more than a liter or a little less than a U.S. dry quart. Since a denarius was a day’s wage in John’s time (Mt 20:1-12), the selling of grains at such prices would indicate famine conditions.

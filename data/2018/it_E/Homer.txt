HOMER
A dry measure corresponding to the cor and equaling ten baths or ten ephahs. (Eze 45:11, 14) Based on the estimated volume of the bath measure, the ephah has been reckoned at 22 L (20 dry qt). The homer would therefore equal 220 L (200 dry qt). (Ho 3:2) In the wilderness, greedy Israelites gathered miraculously provided quail in such numbers that the “one collecting least gathered ten homers” (2,200 L; 2,000 dry qt; 62 bu). (Nu 11:32) The Scriptures also mention the homer as a measure for barley, seed, and wheat.​—Le 27:16; Isa 5:10; Eze 45:13.

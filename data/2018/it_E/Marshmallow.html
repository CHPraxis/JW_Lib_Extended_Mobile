<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">[Heb., <em>chal·la·muthʹ</em>].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A perennial plant that is closely related to the hollyhock. The woody stems of the marshmallow (<em>Althaea officinalis</em>) measure up to 1.8 m (6 ft) in height. The plant’s large, wide leaves are notched and terminate in a sharp point. Both the stems and the leaves are covered with soft downy hair. The pale-pink, five-petal flowers are about 5 cm (2 in.) across. In times of famine, the marshmallow’s white carrotlike root has been used for food. The sole Scriptural reference to the marshmallow alludes to its tastelessness.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:6:6-18:6:6" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Job 6:6</a>.</p>

REPURCHASE, REPURCHASER
The Hebrew verb ga·ʼalʹ, appearing first in Genesis 48:16 (‘recover’), also has the meaning of “repurchase or redeem,” that is, to recover, redeem, or buy back the person, property, or inheritance of the next of kin; it was also used with reference to a blood avenger. (Ps 74:2; Isa 43:1) The next of kin having the obligation of being a repurchaser (Heb., go·ʼelʹ) evidently fell in this order: (1) brother, (2) uncle, (3) son of an uncle, (4) any other male blood relative of the family.​—Le 25:48, 49; compare the order in Nu 27:5-11; see AVENGER OF BLOOD.
Under the Mosaic Law, if an Israelite, because of economic circumstances, had sold himself into slavery, the repurchaser could buy him back out of slavery. (Le 25:47-54) Or, if he had sold his land inheritance, his repurchaser could buy back the property, and he could return to his possession. (Le 25:25-27) However, no thing “devoted,” “devoted to destruction,” not even a man’s life, could be repurchased.​—Le 27:21, 28, 29; see DEVOTED THING.
An example of the transaction of repurchase by a go·ʼelʹ is found in the book of Ruth. When Ruth reported that she had gleaned in the field of Boaz, her mother-in-law Naomi exclaimed: “The man is related to us. He is one of our repurchasers.” (Ru 2:20) Boaz accepted this obligation and concluded a covenant of repurchase before judges and witnesses, but only after another relative more closely related than Boaz had turned down this privilege.​—Ru 3:9, 12, 13; 4:1-17.
Jehovah as Repurchaser. By the sacrifice of his only-begotten Son, Jehovah as Repurchaser provided for the recovery of mankind from sin and death and the power of the grave. This Son had to come to earth, becoming “like his ‘brothers’ in all respects,” partaking of blood and flesh, thereby being a near relative of mankind. (Heb 2:11-17) The apostle Paul writes to Christians: “By means of him we have the release by ransom through the blood of that one.”​—Eph 1:7; compare Re 5:9; 14:3, 4; for further details see RANSOM.

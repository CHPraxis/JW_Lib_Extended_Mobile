<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">The Hebrew expression carries the thought of a fountain, spring, or well of a land or sea monster, and it is variously translated as: “dragon well” (<em>KJ, Le</em>); “Serpent’s Well” (<em>AT</em>); “snake-fountain” (<em>Ro</em>); “Fountain of the Big Snake” (<em>NW</em>). The Greek <em>Septuagint,</em> however, reads “Fountain of the Fig Trees.”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">This water source was located along the route Nehemiah took on his first inspection of Jerusalem’s broken-down walls. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:2:12-16:2:13" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ne 2:12, 13</a>) Since this name is not found again in the Scriptures, the fountain or well, if elsewhere referred to, must be under a different designation. En-rogel is commonly suggested as its alternate name. This could well be, for though En-rogel is a considerable distance down the Kidron Valley, the account simply says that Nehemiah passed “in front of the Fountain,” and this could mean by the corner of the wall facing En-rogel and within sight of, but still some distance from, the fountain.​—See <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200001374/">EN-ROGEL</a>.</p>

STATER
A silver coin with which the temple tax was paid for Jesus and his apostle Peter. Equivalent to four drachmas, it amounted to about four days’ wages at that time. (Mt 17:24, 27) Many scholars view it as the tetradrachma minted at Antioch, Syria, or at Tyre. The Tyrian tetradrachma, approximately the size of the United States half-dollar, bore the head of the god Melkart on the obverse side, an eagle perched on a ship’s rudder on the reverse side, and an inscription reading “Tyre the Holy and Invincible.” A likeness of Emperor Augustus appeared on the tetradrachma of Antioch.

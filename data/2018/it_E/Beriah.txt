BERIAH
(Be·riʹah) [With Calamity].
1. The fourth-listed son of Asher who, perhaps with his own two sons Heber and Malchiel, came to Egypt with Jacob’s household. (Ge 46:8, 17) He and his two sons are listed as ancestral family heads, his descendants being Beriites.​—Nu 26:44, 45; 1Ch 7:30, 31.
2. A son of Ephraim, born after men of Gath had killed his older brothers. Ephraim “called his name Beriah, because it was with calamity [Heb., vera·ʽahʹ] that she [Beriah’s mother] happened to be in his house.”​—1Ch 7:20-23.
3. One of the five sons of Elpaal and one of the Benjamite family heads who chased away the inhabitants of Gath.​—1Ch 8:12, 13.
4. The last-named son of Shimei, a Levite descendant of Gershon. Beriah and his brother Jeush “did not have many sons; so they became a paternal house for one official class.”​—1Ch 23:6-11.

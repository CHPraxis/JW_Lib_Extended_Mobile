JEHUD
(Jeʹhud).
A site in the territory of Dan (Jos 19:40, 45) usually identified with el-Yehudiyeh (Yehud), some 13 km (8 mi) E of Tel Aviv-Yafo. The Greek Septuagint (Vatican MS. No. 1209), though, uses “Azor” instead of “Jehud.” (Jos 19:45) Therefore some scholars link Jehud with a tell near Yazur (Azor), about 6 km (3.5 mi) ESE of Tel Aviv-Yafo. It is believed that this is the place called Azuru in Sennacherib’s annals.

GEDOR
(Geʹdor) [Stone Wall].
1. The son of Jeiel of the town of Gibeon. A member of the tribe of Benjamin, he was a great-uncle of King Saul.​—1Ch 8:29-31; 9:35-39.
2. A son of Penuel of the tribe of Judah. It may be the name of a town.​—1Ch 4:4.
3. A son of Jered also of the tribe of Judah.​—1Ch 4:18.
4. A town in the mountainous region of Judah. (Jos 15:48, 58) It is identified with Khirbet Jedur about 12 km (7.5 mi) N of Hebron. It may also be referred to at 1 Chronicles 4:18. The mention, in the same verse, of Soco and Zanoah, both of which appear elsewhere as names of towns, is thought by some to indicate that Gedor is likely also a town of which Jered was the founder, or “father.”
5. A town that is mentioned in connection with activities of the Simeonites. (1Ch 4:24, 39) The Greek Septuagint here reads “Gerar.”​—See GERAR.
6. A place in Benjamin. (1Ch 12:1, 2, 7) A suggested location is Khirbet el-Gudeira, about 16 km (10 mi) NW of Jerusalem.

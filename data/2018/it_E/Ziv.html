The comment on <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:6:1-11:6:1" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Kings 6:1</a> in the <em>Soncino Books of the Bible</em> says concerning the month of Ziv: “Now known as Iyyar, the second month after Nisan. It was called <em>Ziv</em> (brightness) because it falls at the time of the year when the earth is ‘brightened’ with blossoms and flowers.” (Edited by A. Cohen, London, 1950) The name Iyyar is found in the Jewish Talmud and other postexilic works.</p>

The hills of Galilee are ablaze with flowers. The dry season begins during this month, and the early morning clouds soon disappear in the heat of the day. During this time the plants depend upon the nightly dews that form, and they await the end of the dry season in October.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/28:6:4-28:6:4" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ho 6:4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:18:4-23:18:4" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Isa 18:4</a>.</p>

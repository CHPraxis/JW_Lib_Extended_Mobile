CAB
A measure that, according to rabbinic sources, was 1⁄18 ephah (2Ki 6:25), and hence also 1⁄18 bath measure. (Eze 45:11) If the bath measure is to be viewed as having a capacity of 22 L (5.81 gal; 4.99 dry gal), as archaeological evidence seems to indicate, then the cab measure would have a capacity of 1.22 L (2.58 liquid pt; 2.2 dry pt).

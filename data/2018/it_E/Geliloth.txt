GELILOTH
(Gel·iʹloth) [Regions; Circuits; from a root meaning “roll; roll away”].
A site listed in connection with the boundary of Benjamin. (Jos 18:17) Geliloth’s location, described as “in front of the ascent of Adummim,” matches that of Gilgal (Jos 15:7), for which reason some scholars consider it a variant name for the Gilgal near Jericho. Others suggest that Geliloth is a site or small region in the vicinity of Talʽat ed-Damm (Maʽale Adummim) in the Wadi el Qilt SW of Jericho.​—See ADUMMIM; GILGAL No. 1.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">The bowels or entrails. The Hebrew word <em>qeʹrev</em> is used to describe the “interior parts,” “inward parts,” or “intestines” of men and of animals. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:12:9-2:12:9" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ex 12:9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:29:13-2:29:13" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 29:13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:5:9-19:5:9" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> Ps 5:9</a>) It denotes that which is “inside” and is often used as a preposition, with the meaning “within; in the midst of.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:25:22-1:25:22" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ge 25:22;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:17:20-5:17:20" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> De 17:20</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Another term that refers to the internal organs is the Hebrew <em>me·ʽehʹ.</em> Always occurring in the plural (<em>me·ʽimʹ</em>), it is used for “intestines” in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:20:10-10:20:10" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2 Samuel 20:10</a> and <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:21:15-14:21:15" data-bid="4-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 21:15,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:21:18-14:21:19" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 18, 19</a>. The word may denote the “inward parts” of a creature, as in the account of the large fish that swallowed Jonah. There it occurs twice and is shown in parallel with the “belly” of the large fish. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/32:1:17-32:1:17" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Jon 1:17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/32:2:1-32:2:2" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 2:1, 2</a>) The reproductive system of humans may also be referred to by this Hebrew term. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:15:4-1:15:4" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ge 15:4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/8:1:11-8:1:11" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> Ru 1:11</a>) Because of the evident link between the emotions and internal organs, the intestines, or bowels, were considered the seat of the deepest emotions.​—Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:63:15-23:63:15" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Isa 63:15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:4:19-24:4:19" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> Jer 4:19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:31:20-24:31:20" data-bid="7-3" class="b"> 31:20</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Physical food is assimilated by the intestines. This fact was metaphorically used to represent mental or spiritual digestion when, in vision, Ezekiel was told to eat a scroll, filling his intestines (Heb., <em>me·ʽimʹ</em>) with it. Ezekiel was to gain spiritual strength by meditating upon and storing in his memory the words written in the scroll. He was thereby nourished spiritually and provided with a message to speak.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:3:1-26:3:6" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Eze 3:1-6</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:10:8-66:10:10" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Re 10:8-10</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">In the Christian Greek Scriptures, the word <em>splagʹkhna,</em> which literally means “intestines,” is used once to refer to the literal intestines. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:1:18-44:1:18" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ac 1:18</a>) Elsewhere it is metaphorically used to denote “tender affections” and “tender compassions.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:6:12-47:6:12" data-bid="11-1" class="b">2Co 6:12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:1:8-50:1:8" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> Php 1:8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:2:1-50:2:1" data-bid="11-3" class="b"> 2:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:3:12-51:3:12" data-bid="11-4" class="b"> Col 3:12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:3:17-62:3:17" data-bid="11-5" class="b"> 1Jo 3:17</a>.</p>

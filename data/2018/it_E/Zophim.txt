ZOPHIM
(Zoʹphim).
A field on the top of Pisgah where Balaam had seven altars built, where sacrifices were offered, and where the prophet took up one of his proverbial utterances regarding Israel. (Nu 23:14-24) The name Zophim seems to be preserved at Telaʽat es-Safa near the suggested location of Pisgah, E of the N end of the Dead Sea. Some scholars, however, translate the word tsoh·phimʹ instead of considering it a proper name, using such expressions as “the field of the watchmen.”​—Le; compare JB, NE.

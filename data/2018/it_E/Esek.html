<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A well of fresh water dug by Isaac’s servants in the torrent valley of Gerar. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:26:20-1:26:20" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ge 26:20</a>) The Philistine shepherds of that area, however, claimed the well as theirs, and the resultant “quarreling” between the two parties gave the site its name. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:26:12-1:26:20" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ge 26:12-20</a>) Its exact location is today unknown.</p>

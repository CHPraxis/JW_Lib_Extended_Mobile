<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><strong>2.</strong> An eminence in the mountainous region of Ephraim. From this mountain, King Abijah of Judah spoke, pointing out that Jeroboam and the ten tribes of Israel had rejected Jehovah’s kingdom covenant with David. Apparently, Bethel was in the same neighborhood.

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A believing Jewess, the daughter of Lois. She was the wife of an unbelieving Greek and the mother of Timothy. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:16:1-44:16:1" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ac 16:1</a>) It is very likely that the apostle Paul met Eunice at Lystra in Asia Minor on his first missionary tour and that then, as a result of his preaching, she and her mother Lois became Christians. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:14:4-44:14:18" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ac 14:4-18</a>) The faith of Eunice was “without any hypocrisy.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:1:5-55:1:5" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2Ti 1:5</a>) Although married to a pagan husband, she was exemplary in teaching her son Timothy “the holy writings” from his “infancy,” and when she became a Christian, she doubtless instructed him accordingly. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:15-55:3:15" data-bid="4-1" class="b">2Ti 3:15</a>) Since Eunice’s husband was a Greek, Timothy’s parents had not had him circumcised.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:16:3-44:16:3" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ac 16:3</a>.</p>

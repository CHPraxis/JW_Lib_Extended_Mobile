<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">(Cuʹshan-rish·a·thaʹim) [possibly, Cushite (Ethiopian) of the Double Wickedness].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A king of Mesopotamia from whose domination Othniel liberated the Israelites after eight years of servitude. He is also called “the king of Syria.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:3:7-7:3:11" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Jg 3:7-11</a>) Some view the second half (“rishathaim”) of this composite name as the name of a place or region, while others translate it to mean “Double Wickedness.” “Cushan” is used at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/35:3:7-35:3:7" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Habakkuk 3:7</a> to parallel Midian; however, it is stated that King Cushan-rishathaim was from Mesopotamia (Heb., <em>ʼAramʹ na·haraʹyim;</em> compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:24:10-1:24:10" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ge 24:10</a>, where the same term is used to describe the location of the city of Nahor in Syria). A list of Pharaoh Ramses III mentions a district in northern Syria called Qusanaruma, and this is suggested by some scholars to have been the possible seat of this king’s domain. Cushan-rishathaim was Israel’s first major oppressor during the period of the Judges.</p>

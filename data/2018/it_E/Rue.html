<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The common variety of rue (<em>Ruta graveolens</em>) is a strong-scented shrubby perennial with hairy stems that attains a height of about 1 m (3 ft). It has gray-green leaves and bears clusters of yellow flowers. During the days of Jesus’ earthly ministry rue may have been cultivated in Palestine for use in medicine and as a flavoring for food.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">This plant is mentioned only at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:11:42-42:11:42" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Luke 11:42</a>, with reference to the scrupulous tithing of the Pharisees. Instead of “rue,” the parallel account at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:23:23-40:23:23" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matthew 23:23</a> mentions “dill,” as does a third-century manuscript (P<sup>45</sup>) at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:11:42-42:11:42" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Luke 11:42</a>.</p>

TIMNATH-SERAH
(Timʹnath-seʹrah).
The city given to Joshua as his inheritance in the mountainous region of Ephraim. He requested Timnath-serah, and the sons of Israel gave it to him “at the order of Jehovah.” Joshua built up the city and was later buried there. (Jos 19:49, 50; 24:30) Judges 2:9 reads “Timnath-heres” instead of “Timnath-serah” in both the Hebrew Masoretic text and the Greek Septuagint. The reason for this difference in names is unknown.
Some identify Timnath-serah with Khirbet Tibnah, about 30 km (19 mi) SW of Shechem. Situated on the western edge of the mountainous region, Khirbet Tibnah overlooks the coastal plain. Mount Gaash, S of Timnath-serah (Timnath-heres) (Jos 24:30; Jg 2:9), cannot now be located definitely.

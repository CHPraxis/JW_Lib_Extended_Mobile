CARPENTER
An artisan, craftsman, or worker in wood. The Hebrew term cha·rashʹ is the general designation for a “craftsman,” “worker,” or “builder,” who would use various materials such as wood, metal, or stone. (2Ki 12:11; 2Ch 24:12; Ex 28:11; 1Ch 14:1) The Greek equivalent is teʹkton, translated “carpenter” in Matthew 13:55 and Mark 6:3.
Noah and his three sons had much carpentry work to do in building the huge ark, according to the pattern given by Jehovah.​—Ge 6:14-16.
The carpenter in Israel would be employed in constructing houses and, in later times, structures such as synagogues. Although buildings were for the most part made of stone or earth, some wood was used, for example, in beams and doors. The things constructed by the carpenter in Bible times included furniture, such as tables, stools, and benches. Many implements such as plows and threshing sledges were partly or entirely made of wood. (2Sa 24:22) In the construction of the tabernacle and its furnishings, Bezalel and Oholiab were especially guided by Jehovah God. His spirit accentuated their ability to do the finest work in wood, as well as other materials. (Ex 31:2-11) Skilled workers in wood were brought from Tyre for the building of David’s house. (2Sa 5:11) Zerubbabel used carpenters in building the second temple in Jerusalem.​—Ezr 3:7.
Jesus was called not only “the carpenter’s son” (Mt 13:55) but “the carpenter” as well. (Mr 6:3) Since the Hebrew father usually taught his son his trade, Jesus no doubt learned carpentry from his adoptive father Joseph.

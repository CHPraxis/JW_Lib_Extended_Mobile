MALCHUS
(Malʹchus) [from a Heb. root meaning “king”].
The high priest’s slave who accompanied Judas Iscariot and the crowd to Gethsemane, where Christ was arrested. Peter struck off Malchus’ right ear with a sword (Joh 18:10; Mt 26:51; Mr 14:47), but Jesus miraculously healed it. (Lu 22:50, 51) Another slave of the high priest Caiaphas, a relative of Malchus, later recognized Peter, and this led to the apostle’s third denial of Christ.​—Joh 18:26, 27.

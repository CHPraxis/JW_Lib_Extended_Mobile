Later, Ithamar and Eleazar received a greater portion of priestly duties as Jehovah progressively outlined these. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:10:1-3:10:20" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Le 10:1-20</a>) Ithamar was made overseer of the various tabernacle services performed by the Gershonites and Merarites.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:3:2-4:3:4" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Nu 3:2-4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:4:28-4:4:28" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 4:28,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:4:33-4:4:33" data-bid="5-3" class="b"> 33;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:7:8-4:7:8" data-bid="5-4" class="b"> 7:8</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Ithamar’s descendants continued as priests, and during the reigns of Saul, David, and Solomon, members of the house of Ithamar’s descendant Eli temporarily officiated as high priest. When David organized the temple service, 8 of the 24 priestly divisions were of the house of Ithamar.

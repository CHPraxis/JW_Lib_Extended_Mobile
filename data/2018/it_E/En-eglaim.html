<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">In a symbolic vision given to Ezekiel the salt-laden waters of the Dead Sea were to be “healed” and fishers were to stand on its shores from En-gedi up to En-eglaim. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:47:8-26:47:10" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Eze 47:8-10</a>) The name itself indicates a place by a spring. Most scholars connect En-eglaim with ʽAin Feshka, near the NW end of the Dead Sea. ʽAin Feshka and, some 29 km (18 mi) to the S, ʽAin Jidi (which perpetuates the name of En-gedi) constitute the two major oases on the Dead Sea’s western shore. On the other hand, others suggest a site on the SE shore of the Dead Sea, near Zoar. On the basis of ancient written documents, which refer to the district of ʽAgaltain, Y. Yadin concludes that “it is clear that ‘the district of ʽAgaltain’ is the south-eastern sector of the Dead Sea . . . If there is a connection between ʽAgaltain and En-eglaim in Ezekiel’s prophecy on the Dead Sea (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:47:10-26:47:10" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ezek. 47:10</a>: ‘and it shall come to pass that the fishers shall stand upon it from En-gedi even unto En-eglaim’)​—the interpretation of this passage should be that the Sea will be healed from coast to coast—​a very vivid and clear picture. There is no need to look for En-eglaim on the west coast (it was recently suggested to identify it with Ain-Feshkha), an identification that narrows the prophetic vision to the western shore alone.”​—<em>Israel Exploration Journal,</em> Jerusalem, 1962, Vol. 12, pp. 250, 251.</p>

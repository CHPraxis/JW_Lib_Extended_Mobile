<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A military attendant who carried the armor and weapons of a king or other leader, stood by him in danger, and did his bidding. “Armor-bearer” translates the Hebrew expression <em>no·seʼʹ ke·limʹ,</em> literally meaning “one carrying armor or weapons.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:14:6-9:14:6" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1Sa 14:6</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:14:1-9:14:1" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1Sa 14:1</a>.) Foes wounded by a prominent warrior might be given the final deathblow by his armor-bearer. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:14:13-9:14:13" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1Sa 14:13</a>) These attendants were selected from among valiant soldiers, and some were evidently very devoted to their commanders.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:14:6-9:14:7" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1Sa 14:6, 7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:31:5-9:31:5" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 31:5</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Mortally wounded Abimelech had the attendant bearing his weapons put him to death so that it might not be said, “It was a woman that killed him.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:9:52-7:9:54" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Jg 9:52-54</a>) David once served as King Saul’s armor-bearer (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:16:21-9:16:21" data-bid="6-1" class="b">1Sa 16:21</a>); while a later armor-bearer, who refused to put the dying ruler to death, followed Saul in the course of suicide. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:31:3-9:31:6" data-bid="7-1" class="b">1Sa 31:3-6</a>) Armor-bearers also attended Jonathan and Joab (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:14:6-9:14:14" data-bid="8-1" class="b">1Sa 14:6-14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:18:15-10:18:15" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 2Sa 18:15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:23:37-10:23:37" data-bid="8-3" class="b"> 23:37;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:11:39-13:11:39" data-bid="8-4" class="b"> 1Ch 11:39</a>) and chief warriors of various ancient nations, such as the Philistine giant Goliath.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:17:7-9:17:7" data-bid="9-1" class="b">1Sa 17:7,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:17:41-9:17:41" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 41</a>.</p>

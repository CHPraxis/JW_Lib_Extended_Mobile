GEBAL
(Geʹbal) [possibly, Territory; Border], Gebalites (Geʹbal·ites).
1. Gebal, a Phoenician city on the Mediterranean seacoast, is identified with modern Jebeil, about 28 km (17 mi) NNE of Beirut. Historians consider Gebal, the Byblos of the Greeks, to be one of the oldest cities of the Middle East.​—See Jos 13:5, ftn.
Jehovah included “the land of the Gebalites” among those regions yet to be taken by Israel in Joshua’s day. (Jos 13:1-5) Critics have picked on this as an inconsistency, since the city of Gebal was far N of Israel (c. 100 km [60 mi] N of Dan) and apparently never came under Israelite domination. Certain scholars have suggested that the Hebrew text may be damaged at this verse and consider that the account anciently read “the land adjoining Lebanon,” or ‘as far as the border of the Gebalites.’ However, it should also be observed that Jehovah’s promises in Joshua 13:2-7 were conditional. Thus Israel may never have gained Gebal because of its own disobedience.​—Compare Jos 23:12, 13.
Gebalites helped Solomon in the 11th century B.C.E. with the preparation of the materials for the temple construction. (1Ki 5:18) Jehovah lists the “old men of Gebal” among those who assisted in maintaining ancient Tyre’s commercial might and glory.​—Eze 27:9.
2. A different Gebal is listed with Ammon and Amalek in Psalm 83:7, and thus apparently lay S or E of the Dead Sea. Although its exact location is unknown, some scholars place it in the vicinity of Petra, about 100 km (60 mi) NNE of the Gulf of ʽAqaba.

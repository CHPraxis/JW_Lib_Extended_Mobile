<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A place of confinement for one being held for trial or for one found guilty of lawbreaking.

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Among various ancient peoples, including the Egyptians, Philistines, Assyrians, Babylonians, and Persians, imprisonment was a form of legal punishment.

<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Prisons date back at least to the 18th century B.C.E., for it was then that Joseph was wrongly confined to the jail that was connected to “the house of the chief of the bodyguard.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:39:20-1:39:20" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Ge 39:20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:40:3-1:40:3" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 40:3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:41:10-1:41:10" data-bid="13-3" class="b"> 41:10</a>) This Egyptian jail apparently had a dungeon, or hole shaped like a cistern, where some prisoners were kept.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:40:15-1:40:15" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Ge 40:15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:41:14-1:41:14" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> 41:14</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:24:22-23:24:22" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Isa 24:22</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The Mosaic Law did not provide for prisons as a form of punishment.

The prophet Jeremiah, for example, was held in “the house of fetters, in the house of Jehonathan.” This place of confinement had “vaulted rooms,” perhaps dungeon cells. Conditions were so bad there that Jeremiah feared for his life.

<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">In the first century C.E., according to Roman custom, the jailers or guards were held personally accountable for prisoners.

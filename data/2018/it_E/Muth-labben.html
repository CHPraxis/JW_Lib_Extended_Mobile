<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">An expression included in the superscription of one of David’s psalms (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:9:0-19:9:20" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ps 9</a>), traditionally said to mean “[concerning] the death of the son.” Some commentators suggest that it indicated to the musical director the name or perhaps the opening words of a familiar song that furnished the melody to be used in singing this psalm. One possibility of the word’s meaning is advanced by the Targum, in which the <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:9:0-19:9:0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">superscription of Psalm 9</a> reads: “On the death of the man who came forth from between the camps,” alluding to a champion. The apparent reference here is to Goliath, the Philistine champion whom David defeated in battle between the Israelite and Philistine encampments.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:17:45-9:17:51" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1Sa 17:45-51</a>.</p>

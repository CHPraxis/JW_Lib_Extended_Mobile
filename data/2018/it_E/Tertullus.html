<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">(Ter·tulʹlus) [from Lat., diminutive of Tertius].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A public speaker who presented the Jews’ case against Paul before Governor Felix in Caesarea. Of what Luke recorded, much of Tertullus’ statement personally praises Felix, with only a very brief accusation against Paul, attempting to implicate him with the frequent seditions against Rome. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:24:1-44:24:8" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ac 24:1-8</a>) Nothing definite is known as to Tertullus’ nationality, whether Jewish or Roman.</p>

SHUAH
(Shuʹah).
The sixth- and last-named son of Abraham by his second wife Keturah. (1Ch 1:32) Shuah and his five brothers received gifts from Abraham and were sent out of his household toward the E. (Ge 25:1, 2, 5, 6) Shuah’s descendants, the Shuhites, are thought by some to have lived along the Euphrates between two of its tributaries, the Balikh and Khabur. The only Shuhite named in the Bible is Job’s companion Bildad.​—Job 2:11.

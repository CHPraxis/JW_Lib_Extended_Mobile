<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A mountainous island located in the NE Aegean Sea, having a city of the same name on its N side. Likely in the spring of 50 C.E., during Paul’s second missionary journey, the ship on which he was traveling came “with a straight run” to the island of Samothrace from Troas in NW Asia Minor. There is, however, no indication that he went ashore. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:16:11-44:16:11" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ac 16:11</a>) The modern-day island (Samothraki) lacks a good harbor, though it offers a number of places for safe anchorage.</p>

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:23:1-26:23:49" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ezekiel chapter 23</a> depicts Samaria (representing the ten-tribe kingdom of Israel) as the prostitute Oholah, the older sister of Oholibah, representing Jerusalem (the kingdom of Judah). The fact that the ten-tribe kingdom established its own centers of worship may be alluded to by the name Oholah, “Her Tent [of Worship].” Her spiritual prostitution began in Egypt and continued in the Promised Land. In later times it involved her currying the favor of the Assyrians and engaging in degrading idolatrous practices, including child sacrifice. For her unfaithfulness to him, Jehovah delivered Oholah (the northern kingdom) into the hands of the Assyrians, her lovers.</p>

HARIPHITE
(Harʹi·phite) [Of (Belonging to) Hariph or Haruph].
A designation applied to a Benjamite, Shephatiah, who joined David at Ziklag while David was still under restrictions because of Saul. Shephatiah’s being called a Hariphite may mean that he was either a native of Hariph, or Haruph (a place of unknown location), or a descendant of a certain Hariph, or Haruph.​—1Ch 12:1, 2, 5.

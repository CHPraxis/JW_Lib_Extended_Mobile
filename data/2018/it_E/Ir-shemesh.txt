IR-SHEMESH
(Ir-sheʹmesh) [City of the Sun].
A town on the boundary of Dan, listed between Eshtaol and Shaalabbin in Joshua 19:41, 42. It is possibly the same as Beth-shemesh of Joshua 15:10. If so, then it was later occupied by the tribe of Judah and assigned from that tribe as one of the 48 Levite cities.​—Jos 21:16; 1Ch 6:59; Nu 35:6, 7; see BETH-SHEMESH No. 1.

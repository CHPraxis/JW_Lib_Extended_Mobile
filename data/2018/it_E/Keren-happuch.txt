KEREN-HAPPUCH
(Kerʹen-hapʹpuch) [possibly, Horn of the Black (Eye) Paint [that is, a receptacle for makeup]].
The third and youngest of the daughters born to Job after his great test and suffering had ended and Jehovah had blessed him. (Job 42:12-14) The name may be suggestive of beautiful eyes, or it may be indicative of her great beauty generally, as “no women were found as pretty as Job’s daughters in all the land.” (Job 42:15) The bluish-white metallic substance antimony produces a brilliant black color that was used by Oriental women of Biblical days to dye their eyelashes and perhaps their eyebrows, or it was used to color the edges of their eyelids, thus making the eyes appear large and lustrous.​—See 2Ki 9:30; Jer 4:30.

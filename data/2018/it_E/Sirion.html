<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The old Sidonian name for Mount Hermon, called Senir by the Amorites. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:3:9-5:3:9" data-bid="1-1" class="b">De 3:9</a>) The name Sirion appears in the Ugaritic texts found at Ras Shamra on the coast of northern Syria, thus corroborating the Bible’s exactness. Like Senir, Sirion perhaps also designates a particular part of Mount Hermon. (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:5:23-13:5:23" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1Ch 5:23</a>.)

For this reason it has been suggested that Sirion perhaps refers to the Anti-Lebanon Range.​—See <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200001999/">HERMON</a>.</p>

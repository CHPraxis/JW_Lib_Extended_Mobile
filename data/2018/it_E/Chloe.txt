CHLOE
(Chloʹe) [from a root meaning “green”; probably, First Green Shoot of Plants].
A woman through whose household Paul received reports concerning the dissensions existing in the Corinthian congregation. (1Co 1:11) Though Paul’s letter does not state that Chloe was a Christian residing at Corinth or at Ephesus, where the letter was penned, in view of the apostle’s reference to this household by name, evidently at least some members thereof, either family members or slaves, were Christians known to the Corinthians.

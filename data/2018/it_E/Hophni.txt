HOPHNI
(Hophʹni) [from Egyptian, meaning “Tadpole”].
One of High Priest Eli’s sons. Hophni and his brother Phinehas were “good-for-nothing men,” guilty of sacrilegious conduct and gross immorality. (1Sa 1:3; 2:12-17, 22-25) Because of unfaithfulness while serving as priest at Jehovah’s sanctuary, Jehovah judged Hophni worthy of death, which befell him at the time the Philistines captured the sacred Ark.​—1Sa 2:34; 4:4, 11, 17; see PHINEHAS No. 2.

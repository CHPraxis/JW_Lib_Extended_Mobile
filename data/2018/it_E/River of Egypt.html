<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Jehovah promised that Abraham’s seed would be given the land “from the river of Egypt” to the Euphrates River. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:15:18-1:15:18" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ge 15:18</a>) Commentators generally understand “the river of Egypt” to refer to “the torrent valley of Egypt” now identified with Wadi el-ʽArish of the Sinai Peninsula, which empties into the Mediterranean Sea about 150 km (90 mi) E of Port Said. (See <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200001266/">EGYPT, TORRENT VALLEY OF</a>.) At <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:13:5-13:13:5" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Chronicles 13:5</a> certain translations read “river [<em>shi·chohrʹ</em>] of Egypt” (<em>NW, La, AT</em>), and this reference also may be to Wadi el-ʽArish. However, another possibility is that both texts refer to a branch of the Nile.​—See <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200004032/">SHIHOR</a>.</p>

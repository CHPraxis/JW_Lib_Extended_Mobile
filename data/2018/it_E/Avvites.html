(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:17:24-12:17:24" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2Ki 17:24</a>) All these transplanted inhabitants came to be known as Samaritans. The Avvites, though learning the fear of Jehovah to some degree, nevertheless, made and worshiped the gods Nibhaz and Tartak.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:17:29-12:17:33" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2Ki 17:29-33</a>; see <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200000476/">AVVA</a>.</p>

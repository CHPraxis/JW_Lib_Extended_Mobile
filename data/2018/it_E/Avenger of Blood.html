<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">In Hebrew this expression is <em>go·ʼelʹ had·damʹ</em>.

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The avenging of blood is based on the mandate regarding the sanctity of blood and human life stated to Noah wherein Jehovah said: “Your blood of your souls shall I ask back . . . from the hand of each one who is his brother, shall I ask back the soul of man. Anyone shedding man’s blood, by man will his own blood be shed, for in God’s image he made man.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:9:5-1:9:6" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ge 9:5, 6</a>) A deliberate murderer was to be put to death by “the avenger of blood,” and no ransom was to be accepted for such a murderer.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:35:19-4:35:21" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Nu 35:19-21,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:35:31-4:35:31" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 31</a>.</p>

<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Jehovah’s just laws made a clear distinction between willful and accidental killing.

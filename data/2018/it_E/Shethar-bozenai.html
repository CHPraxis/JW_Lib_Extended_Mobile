<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">An official, perhaps a secretary, associated with Tattenai the Persian governor “beyond the River” during the reign of Darius I (Hystaspis).

However, the Jews kept working in spite of the complaints while a report was made to Darius. Tattenai and Shethar-bozenai and his colleagues wrote to the king reporting on the activities in Jerusalem and stating that the temple builders had referred to an order of authorization that had been put through by Cyrus the king. They asked that the matter be investigated. Darius’ reply acknowledged Cyrus’ unchangeable decree and not only ordered Shethar-bozenai and his comrades to ‘keep their distance’ from Jerusalem but also demanded, under severe penalty, that material support be provided from the royal treasury for the Jews so that their temple building and services could continue. Shethar-bozenai and his associates did as commanded.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/15:4:23-15:6:13" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ezr 4:23–6:13</a>.</p>

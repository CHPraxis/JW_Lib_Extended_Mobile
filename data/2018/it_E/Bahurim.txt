BAHURIM
(Ba·huʹrim) [Chosen].
A village by the Mount of Olives, situated on the N side of an ancient road leading to Jericho and the Jordan. It is generally identified with Ras et-Tmim, 2 km (c. 1 mi) NE of the Temple Mount.
Weeping Paltiel walked after Saul’s daughter Michal as far as Bahurim when she was being returned to King David. General Abner’s order: “Go, return!” sufficed to turn him back at that point. (2Sa 3:16) Later, David, when abandoning Jerusalem because of his son Absalom’s conspiracy, crossed the torrent valley of Kidron, went up “the ascent of the Olives,” crossed beyond the summit, and came to Bahurim. (2Sa 15:23, 30; 16:1, 5) Here Shimei, the Benjamite relative of Saul, began walking along the mountainside, cursing David, throwing stones, and tossing dust. (2Sa 16:5-13; 19:15-23) Bahurim was also the point at which Ahimaaz and Jonathan, the sons of Zadok and Abiathar, had to hide in the well of a certain man when they were on their way to deliver a message to King David.​—2Sa 15:27; 17:17-20.

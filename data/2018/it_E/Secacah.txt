SECACAH
(Se·caʹcah) [from a root meaning “cover; screen over”].
A city of Judah in the wilderness. (Jos 15:20, 61) Secacah is often identified with Khirbet es-Samrah, on a hill about 6 km (3.5 mi) W of the northern part of the Dead Sea. This is in the heart of el Buqeiʽa (Biqʽat Hureqanya), a barren plateau, in the northern section of the Judean Wilderness.

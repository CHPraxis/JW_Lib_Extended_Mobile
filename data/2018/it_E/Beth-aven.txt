BETH-AVEN
(Beth-aʹven) [House of Hurtfulness (Something Hurtful)].
1. A town in the territory of the tribe of Benjamin, close by the ancient city of Ai. (Jos 7:2; 18:11, 12) It was in the wilderness, located E of Bethel and W of Michmash, and became involved in an outstanding battle when Saul and Jonathan routed the Philistines from this latter city.​—1Sa 13:5; 14:23.
2. In lamenting the idolatrous conditions to which Israel had turned in his time, the prophet Hosea mentions Beth-aven together with Gibeah and Ramah, other prominent cities of Benjamin. (Ho 4:15; 5:8; 10:5, 8) It appears that the prophet applies the name in a derogatory sense to the city of Bethel, which at one time had been a ‘house of God’ but had now become a ‘house of what is hurtful’ because of the calf worship instituted there.​—1Ki 12:28-30.

TOBIAH
(To·biʹah) [Good Is Jah].
1. Forefather of some returned exiles who were unable to establish their Israelite genealogy.​—Ezr 2:1, 59, 60; Ne 7:61, 62.
2. An opponent of Nehemiah. Tobiah was “the servant,” likely some official under the Persian king. (Ne 2:19) Both he and his son Jehohanan married Jewish women, and Tobiah was also related to High Priest Eliashib. This put Tobiah in a position of advantage for undermining Nehemiah’s authority, in that many Jews looked up to and spoke highly of Tobiah.​—Ne 6:17-19; 13:4.
When Nehemiah arrived in Jerusalem, Tobiah and his associates were displeased with Israel’s brightening prospect. (Ne 2:9, 10) At first they merely derided and mocked the Jews (Ne 2:19; 4:3), but when the wall rebuilding made progress, they became very angry. However, various conspiracies​—to kill off the Jews (Ne 4:7-9, 11, 14, 15), and an attempt to get Nehemiah to violate the sanctity of the temple (Ne 6:1, 10-13)—​all failed. Even after the walls were completed, Tobiah, through correspondence with his sympathizers in Jerusalem, attempted to intimidate Nehemiah. (Ne 6:16-19) Properly, therefore, Nehemiah asked Jehovah to remember the many wicked deeds of Tobiah and his confederates. (Ne 6:14) On Nehemiah’s second arrival from Babylon, when he found a dining room in the temple court reserved for Tobiah, he promptly threw Tobiah’s things out.​—Ne 13:4-9.

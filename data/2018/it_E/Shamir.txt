SHAMIR
(Shaʹmir).
1. A Levite who was the son of Micah.​—1Ch 24:20, 24.
2. A city in the mountainous region of Judah. (Jos 15:20, 48) The ancient name appears to be preserved at Khirbet Somerah, though the actual site is thought to have been at nearby el-Bireh, about 20 km (12 mi) SW of Hebron.
3. Residence and burial site of Judge Tola in the mountainous region of Ephraim. (Jg 10:1, 2) Shamir may have been situated at or near the later location of Samaria. This view is supported somewhat by the Codex Alexandrinus (LXX), which reads Sa·ma·reiʹai (Samaria) in Judges 10:1.

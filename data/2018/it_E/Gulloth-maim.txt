GULLOTH-MAIM
(Gulʹloth-maʹim) [Basins (Bowls) of Waters].
A site requested by Caleb’s daughter at the time of her marriage to Othniel. (Jos 15:17-19; Jg 1:13-15) Many versions render Gul·lothʹ maʹyim as “springs of water,” while “Upper Gul·lothʹ and Lower Gul·lothʹ” are generally translated ‘upper springs and lower springs.’ (See JB, RS, Yg, KJ.) It may be noted, however, that Caleb’s daughter apparently did not simply desire “springs” from her father. She desired “a field,” according to Joshua 15:18. Thus Gul·lothʹ maʹyim is sometimes rendered “well-watered land.” (Kx; see also Dy.) Some scholars choose to leave it untranslated, simply employing the transliterations “Gullath-maim” (AT) or “Gulloth-maim.” (NW) The exact location of Gulloth-maim is unknown.​—See DEBIR No. 2.

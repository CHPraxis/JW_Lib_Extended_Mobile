KIN, KINSMAN
Relative, either by common ancestry or by marriage. Kinsman has special reference to a male relative. There are several words in the original Bible languages having the following meanings and usages.
Go·ʼelʹ (from Heb. ga·ʼalʹ, meaning “redeem” or “buy back”) has reference to the nearest male relative with the right of a repurchaser or an avenger of blood. Willful murderers were to be put to death by “the avenger of blood.” (Nu 35:16-19) Boaz’ relationship to Naomi and Ruth was that of “a repurchaser.” (Ru 2:20; 3:9, 12, 13; 4:1, 3, 6, 8, 14) Jehovah himself, the Great Father or Life-Giver, is both an Avenger and a Repurchaser for his servants.​—Ps 78:35; Isa 41:14; 43:14; 44:6, 24; 48:17; 54:5; 63:16; Jer 50:34.
Sheʼerʹ (Heb., meaning “organism”) has reference to a fleshly relative or blood relative. God’s laws forbade having sexual relations with a close “blood relation,” such as one’s aunt. (Le 18:6-13; 20:19) If a fellow Israelite fell into debt to an alien, then a brother, an uncle, a cousin, or any other “blood relative” could buy him back. (Le 25:47-49) Or if one died having no sons, daughters, brothers, or uncles, then the next closest “blood relation” received the inheritance.​—Nu 27:10, 11.
Qa·rohvʹ (Heb., meaning “near”) includes not only one closely related but also an intimate acquaintance. If a brother became so poor that he had to sell his possessions, then one “closely related” had to buy them back for him. (Le 25:25) Job grieved that his “intimate acquaintances” had left him, and David lamented that his “close acquaintances” also stood aloof.​—Job 19:14; Ps 38:11.
Terms related to ya·dhaʽʹ (Heb., meaning “know,” “be acquainted”) could mean a kinsman or just an acquaintance. Naomi had “a kinsman of her husband” named Boaz. Jehu executed all of Ahab’s house including his “acquaintances.”​—Ru 2:1; 2Ki 10:11.
In the Christian Greek Scriptures syg·ge·nesʹ refers to a relative by blood, but it is never used in speaking of the relation between parents and children. Following this rule, note that Jesus said to his followers: “You will be delivered up even by parents and brothers and relatives [syg·ge·nonʹ] and friends.” (Lu 21:16) When the 12-year-old Jesus was missing, his parents began looking for him among “the relatives.” (Lu 2:44) When you spread a feast, Jesus counseled, do not invite your “relatives” who could pay you back but, rather, the poor people. (Lu 14:12-14) When Peter brought the good news of salvation to Cornelius, his “relatives” were also present. (Ac 10:24) Paul, in his letter to the Romans, referred to the Israelites collectively as well as a number of individuals as his “relatives.”​—Ro 9:3; 16:7, 11, 21.

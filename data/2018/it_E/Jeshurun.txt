JESHURUN
(Jeshʹu·run) [Upright One].
An honorary title for Israel. In the Greek Septuagint “Jeshurun” becomes a term of affection, it being rendered “beloved.” The designation “Jeshurun” should have reminded Israel of its calling as Jehovah’s covenant people and therefore of its obligation to remain upright. (De 33:5, 26; Isa 44:2) At Deuteronomy 32:15 the name Jeshurun is used ironically. Instead of living up to its name Jeshurun, Israel became intractable, forsook its Maker, and despised its Savior.

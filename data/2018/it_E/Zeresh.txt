ZERESH
(Zeʹresh).
The wife of Haman. Zeresh and Haman’s friends proposed that he erect a stake to a height of 50 cubits (22 m; 73 ft) on which to hang Mordecai. (Es 5:10, 14) But when reversals set in, Zeresh, along with Haman’s wise men, said: “If it is from the seed of the Jews that Mordecai is before whom you have started to fall, you will not prevail against him, but you will without fail fall before him.”​—Es 6:13.

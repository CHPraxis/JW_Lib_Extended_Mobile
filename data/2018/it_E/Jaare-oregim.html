<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A name appearing only at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:21:19-10:21:19" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Samuel 21:19</a>. It is generally believed that scribal error has given rise to this name and that the correct reading is preserved in the parallel text at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:20:5-13:20:5" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Chronicles 20:5</a>. “Jaare” is considered to be an alteration of “Jair,” and “oregim” (<em>ʼo·reghimʹ,</em> “weavers” or “loom workers”) is thought to have been copied inadvertently from a line below in the same verse.</p>

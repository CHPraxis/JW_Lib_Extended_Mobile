KEDESH
(Keʹdesh) [Holy Place].
1. A city in southern Judah (Jos 15:21, 23), possibly the same as Kadesh-barnea.​—See KADESH, KADESH-BARNEA.
2. A city of Naphtali given to the Gershonites and set aside as a city of refuge. (Jos 20:7; 21:32, 33; 1Ch 6:71, 76) Because of its location it was also called “Kedesh-naphtali” (Jg 4:6) and “Kedesh in Galilee.” (Jos 20:7) Apparently the residence of Judge Barak, Kedesh served as the rallying point for his 10,000 men from Naphtali and Zebulun prior to their victory over the Canaanite army under Sisera. (Jg 4:6, 10) Centuries later the city was conquered by Assyrian King Tiglath-pileser III during the rule of Israel’s King Pekah (c. 778-759 B.C.E.).​—2Ki 15:29.
Kedesh has been identified with Tell Qades (Tel Qedesh), a mound overlooking a small, fertile plain about 20 km (12 mi) SW of Dan.
3. A site in Issachar assigned to “the sons of Gershom” (1Ch 6:71, 72), seemingly the same as the “Kishion” mentioned in the parallel list at Joshua 21:28. Tell Abu Qedeis (Tel Qedesh), about 4 km (2.5 mi) SE of Megiddo, has been suggested as a possible identification. This would seem to fit Joshua 12:21, 22, where Kedesh appears to be placed in the vicinity of Megiddo and Jokneam. Since Barak defeated Sisera in the Megiddo area (Jg 5:19), it may have been near this Kedesh (and not No. 2) that Jael killed Canaanite army chief Sisera in her tent.​—Jg 4:11, 17, 21.

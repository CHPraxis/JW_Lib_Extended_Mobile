<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">One of the ‘seventy souls of the house of Jacob who came into Egypt.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:46:21-1:46:21" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ge 46:21,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:46:27-1:46:27" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 27</a>) In the Genesis account he is called a son of Benjamin, but in view of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:26:40-4:26:40" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Numbers 26:40</a>, it seems likely that the meaning here is “grandson.” If this is the case, then he is also probably the same as Addar in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:8:3-13:8:3" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Chronicles 8:3</a>.</p>

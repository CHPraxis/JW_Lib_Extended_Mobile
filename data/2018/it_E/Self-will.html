<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">The Greek term rendered “self-willed” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/56:1:7-56:1:7" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Tit 1:7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:2:10-61:2:10" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 2Pe 2:10</a>, <em>AS, KJ, NW</em>) literally means “self-pleasing” and “denotes one who, dominated by self-interest, and inconsiderate of others, arrogantly asserts his own will.” (<em>Vine’s Expository Dictionary of Old and New Testament Words,</em> 1981, Vol. 3, p. 342) Self-will is therefore a quality that is out of harmony with the spirit of Christianity. Especially should it not be reflected by Christian overseers. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/56:1:5-56:1:5" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Tit 1:5,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/56:1:7-56:1:7" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 7</a>) The apostle Peter described individuals who had departed from proper Christian conduct as being “daring” and “self-willed.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:2:10-61:2:10" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2Pe 2:10</a>.</p>

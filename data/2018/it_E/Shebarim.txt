SHEBARIM
(Shebʹa·rim) [Quarries].
The place to which men of Ai chased the Israelites, when they were unable to stand before the enemy after Achan’s sin. (Jos 7:5) The site is unknown, except that it was near Ai. Certain translators prefer to render the Hebrew term as “stone-works” or “stone-quarries” rather than as “Shebarim.”​—BE; Le.

BORASHAN
(Borʹa·shan) [possibly, Pit of Smoke].
One of the places that David and his men frequented during his time as a fugitive. (1Sa 30:30, 31) Some scholars consider it to be the same as Ashan (Jos 19:7), a Simeonite enclave city in the southern part of Judah’s territory, a short distance NW of Beer-sheba.​—See ASHAN.

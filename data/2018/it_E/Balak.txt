BALAK
(Baʹlak) [He Has Laid Waste].
Baal-worshiping king of Moab in the 15th century B.C.E.; son of Zippor. Balak’s people were frightened and filled with “a sickening dread” when they saw what Israel had done to the Amorites. In league with Midian, Balak sent to the town of Pethor by the Euphrates River for Balaam to come from Mesopotamia and curse Israel with “uncanny power,” hoping thereby to gain a military advantage. (Nu 23:21) “Look!” Balak said to Balaam, “[the Israelites] have covered the earth as far as one can see, and they are dwelling right in front of me.” At first Balaam declined to go, but after Balak sent a more honorable delegation of princes and raised his offer, the greedy prophet finally accepted, with Jehovah’s allowance. Upon coming to the bank of the Arnon, Balak chided him: “Why did you not come to me [at first]? Am I not really and truly able to honor you?”​—Nu 22:2-37.
Balak took Balaam to three vantage points from which to view the host of Israel. At each point the same sacrificial procedure was followed; Balak was directed to construct seven altars upon which seven bulls and seven rams were sacrificed. However, at each place, instead of cursing Israel, Balaam blessed them.​—Nu 22:41–24:9; Mic 6:5.
At this, “Balak’s anger blazed against Balaam.” Clapping his hands in a rage, he exclaimed: “It was to execrate my enemies that I called you, and, look! you have blessed them to the limit these three times. And now run your way off to your place.” But before this prophet from Pethor departed, he foretold the Messianic “star” coming through Jacob’s seed.​—Nu 24:10-17; Jos 24:9, 10; Jg 11:25.
Subsequent events show that Balaam also “went teaching Balak to put a stumbling block before the sons of Israel, to eat things sacrificed to idols and to commit fornication.”​—Re 2:14; Nu 25:1-18.

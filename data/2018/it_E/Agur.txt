AGUR
(Aʹgur).
The son of Jakeh and writer of the 30th chapter of the book of Proverbs. (Pr 30:1) Nothing further is stated to enable further identification. He probably lived sometime during the period from Solomon’s reign (1037-998 B.C.E.) to Hezekiah’s reign (745-717 B.C.E.).
Some rabbinic scholars have considered the name Agur to be allegorical, applying to Solomon. Thus the footnote on Proverbs 30:1 in the Soncino Books of the Bible quotes from the Midrash as saying: “He was called Agur because he stored up (agar) knowledge of Torah, and the son of Jakeh because he spewed it out (hikki) in that he ignored the warning against multiplying wives.” (Edited by A. Cohen, London, 1952) Even among the Jewish commentators, however, this view was not unanimous, many holding that the change of style, language, and content indicates a different writer.

AHASBAI
(A·hasʹbai).
A Maacathite whose “son” Eliphelet was an outstanding fighter for David. (2Sa 23:34) The Maacah from which Ahasbai came could refer to Abel-beth-maacah in the territory of Naphtali or to the Syrian kingdom of Maacah. (2Sa 20:14; 10:6, 8) In the parallel list at 1 Chronicles 11:35, 36 the name Ur appears in place of Ahasbai.

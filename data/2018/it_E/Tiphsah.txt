TIPHSAH
(Tiphʹsah).
1. A place at the extreme N of Solomon’s kingdom. (1Ki 4:24) Some tentatively identify it with Dibseh on the Euphrates River, about 90 km (56 mi) ESE of Aleppo and about the same distance from the confluence of the Euphrates and Balikh rivers.
2. A place, apparently in the vicinity of Tirzah, that was struck down by Israel’s King Menahem (c. 790-781 B.C.E.). (2Ki 15:16) Its exact location is not known. Khirbet Tafsah, about 10 km (6 mi) WSW of ancient Shechem, bears a similar name but appears to be too far from the assumed site of Tirzah to be the location of this Tiphsah.

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A soft, black or dark-brown gum that exudes from the leaves and branches of several varieties of <em>Cistus,</em> or rockrose. The gum has a bitter taste but a fragrant odor. It is used in perfumes and, at one time, was also extensively employed in medicine. With reference to this substance the ancient Greek historian Herodotus (III, 112) wrote: “It is gathered from the beards of he-goats, where it is found sticking like gum, having come from the bushes on which they browse. It is used in many sorts of unguents [ointments], and is what the Arabs burn chiefly as incense.”​—Translation by G. Rawlinson.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The Hebrew word <em>nekhoʼthʹ</em> designates this item carried by a caravan of Ishmaelites to whom Joseph was sold and one of the fine products that Jacob told his sons to take as a gift to one who was ruler in Egypt.

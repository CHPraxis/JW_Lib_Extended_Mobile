<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A site near “the hill of Ammah” mentioned in describing the pursuit of Abner by Joab and Abishai. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:2:24-10:2:24" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2Sa 2:24</a>) The context suggests to some that Giah was E of Gibeon in Benjamin’s territory. Certain scholars have proposed sites based on textual emendation, but Giah’s exact location remains unknown.​—See <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200000232/">AMMAH</a>.</p>

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">King of Sodom whom Chedorlaomer and his allies defeated in the Low Plain of Siddim. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:14:1-1:14:11" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ge 14:1-11</a>) Abraham pursued the victors in order to free his nephew Lot, recovered the spoil, and returned it to the king of Sodom rather than keeping it for himself. Abraham did this, he says, in order that the king of Sodom could never boast: “It was I who made Abram rich.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:14:14-1:14:24" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ge 14:14-24</a>.</p>

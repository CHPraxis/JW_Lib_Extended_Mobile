CHELUB
(Cheʹlub) [Basket; Cage].
1. Descendant of Judah; brother of Shuhah and father of Mehir. (1Ch 4:1, 11) The rendering of the name as “Chelub” is based on the Masoretic text and appears in this form in some translations. (KJ, NW, Ro, AT) However, he is called “Caleb” in the Greek Septuagint, Syriac Peshitta, and the Latin Vulgate (Clementine recension), and therefore, this form is found in translations by Knox and Lamsa.
2. Father of Ezri, one serving under King David as overseer of those cultivating the fields.​—1Ch 27:26.

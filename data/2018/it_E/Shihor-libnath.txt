SHIHOR-LIBNATH
(Shiʹhor-libʹnath).
Eusebius and Jerome believed Shihor-libnath originally constituted the name of two sites, Shihor and Labanath. However, it is apparently a river on Asher’s boundary. (Jos 19:24-26) Some geographers connect the Shihor-libnath with the Nahr ez-Zerqa (Nahal Tanninim), which flows into the Mediterranean Sea about 10 km (6 mi) S of Dor.

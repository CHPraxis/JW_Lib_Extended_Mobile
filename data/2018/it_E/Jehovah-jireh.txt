JEHOVAH-JIREH
(Je·hoʹvah-jiʹreh) [Jehovah Will See To [It]; Jehovah Will Provide].
A place on one of the mountains in the land of Moriah where Abraham found a ram caught in a thicket and subsequently offered it instead of Isaac. Abraham viewed this ram as Jehovah’s provision and therefore named the place Jehovah-jireh. Ancient tradition links this location with the site of Solomon’s temple.​—Ge 22:2, 13, 14; see MORIAH.

VISIONARY
A man who had or claimed to have visions from God regarding concealed or future matters. The Hebrew word for “visionary” is cho·zehʹ, from cha·zahʹ, meaning “behold; vision.” Cha·zahʹ and its derivatives are employed with reference to seeing visions.​—Nu 24:4; Isa 1:1; 21:2; 22:1; Eze 13:7; Da 8:1; see SEER.
Some visionaries were false and were opposed by God. (Isa 29:10; Mic 3:7) Others were sent by Jehovah and spoke in his name. (2Ki 17:13; 2Ch 33:18) The term “visionary” is applied to several men, namely, Heman, Iddo, Hanani, Gad, Asaph, Jeduthun, and Amos. (1Ch 25:5; 2Ch 12:15; 19:2; 29:25, 30; 35:15; Am 7:12) Some, such as Gad and Iddo, recorded their visions or wrote other accounts. (1Ch 29:29; 2Ch 9:29; 33:19) Not all of Jehovah’s prophets were visionaries. However, Gad was called both a “prophet” and “David’s visionary,” apparently because at least some of the messages he received from God came by means of visions containing divine instruction or counsel for King David.​—2Sa 24:11; 1Ch 21:9.

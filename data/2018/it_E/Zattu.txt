ZATTU
(Zatʹtu).
Forefather of a large family that returned to Jerusalem with Zerubbabel in 537 B.C.E. (Ezr 2:1, 2, 8; Ne 7:13) When Ezra came to Jerusalem some of their descendants dismissed the foreign wives they had taken. (Ezr 10:10, 11, 27, 44) Shortly thereafter, a representative of this family, or someone else named Zattu, sealed the “trustworthy arrangement.”​—Ne 9:38; 10:1, 14.

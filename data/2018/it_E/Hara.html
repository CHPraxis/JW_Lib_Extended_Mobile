<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A site to which Assyrian King Tilgath-pilneser (Tiglath-pileser III) transported Israelite captives. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:5:26-13:5:26" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1Ch 5:26</a>) Similar references (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:17:6-12:17:6" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2Ki 17:6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:18:11-12:18:11" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 18:11</a>) to a later Assyrian exile tell of Israelites’ being taken to “the cities of the Medes” (Masoretic text) or “the mountains of the Medes.” (<em>LXX</em>) Many scholars feel that the <em>Septuagint</em> reading may be the correct one and suggest that at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:5:26-13:5:26" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Chronicles 5:26</a> “Hara” (<em>Ha·raʼʹ,</em> perhaps an Aramaic form of the Hebrew word for “mountain” [<em>har</em>]) became a proper name when the phrase “of the Medes” was inadvertently omitted. If this assumption is correct, “Hara” may have applied to “the mountains of the Medes” E of the Tigris River valley. However, some who consider the Gozan of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:17:6-12:17:6" data-bid="4-1" class="b">2 Kings 17:6</a> and <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:18:11-12:18:11" data-bid="5-1" class="b">18:11</a> to be a place (as in <em>JB, RS</em>) and not a river believe that “Hara” possibly was a local designation for a mountainous region in Turkey.</p>

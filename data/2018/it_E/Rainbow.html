<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A semicircular bow, or arc, exhibiting a spectrum of colors; a visible sign of Jehovah’s covenant promise that ‘no more would all flesh be cut off by waters of a deluge, and no more would there occur a deluge to bring the earth to ruin.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:9:11-1:9:16" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ge 9:11-16</a>) There is no separate Hebrew word for rainbow, so the normal word for “bow” (with which to shoot arrows) is used in the Bible.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:1:28-26:1:28" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Eze 1:28</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Complicated theories and formulas are used to explain the formation of a rainbow. Basically, it seems that as white light enters a raindrop it is refracted and dispersed into different colors, the drop acting like a tiny prism. Each color strikes the inner surface of the drop and is reflected back at a different and specific angle. Thus an observer sees a bow with all seven colors of the spectrum (from the inside of the arc outward: violet, indigo, blue, green, yellow, orange, and red), though these may blend so that only four or five are clear. Sometimes a larger and less distinct “secondary” bow is formed with the colors reversed. Scientists are still studying the rainbow. Carl B. Boyer observes: “Within a raindrop the interaction of light energy with matter is so intimate that one is led directly to quantum mechanics and the theory of relativity. . . . Although much is known about the production of the rainbow, little has been learned about its perception.”​—<em>The Rainbow, From Myth to Mathematics,</em> 1959, pp. 320, 321.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The first Biblical reference to a rainbow is in the account of the covenant God made with Noah and his offspring after the Flood survivors came out of the ark. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:9:8-1:9:17" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ge 9:8-17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:54:9-23:54:10" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Isa 54:9, 10</a>) This splendid sight of itself would have been reassuring and an indication of peace to Noah and his family.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Many opinions have been offered as to whether this was the first time humans saw a rainbow. Some commentators have held that rainbows had been seen before and that God’s ‘giving’ the rainbow at this time was really a ‘giving’ of special meaning or significance to a previously existing phenomenon. Many of those holding this view believe that the Flood was only local or did not substantially change the atmosphere.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Nevertheless, this is the first mention of a rainbow, and if a rainbow had been seen earlier, there would have been no real force in God’s making it an outstanding sign of his covenant. It would have been commonplace, and not a significant marker of a change, of something new.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">The Bible does not describe the degree of clarity of the atmosphere just prior to the Flood. But apparently atmospheric conditions were such that, until a change came about when “the floodgates of the heavens were opened” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:7:11-1:7:11" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ge 7:11</a>), no others before Noah and his family had seen a rainbow. Even today, atmospheric conditions affect whether a rainbow can be seen or not.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">The glory, beauty, and peacefulness of a rainbow that appears after a storm are drawn upon in Biblical descriptions of God and his throne. In Ezekiel’s vision of God, the prophet saw “something like the appearance of the bow that occurs in a cloud mass on the day of a pouring rain.” This emphasized <span id="page731" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="731" data-before-text="731"></span>“the glory of Jehovah.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:1:28-26:1:28" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Eze 1:28</a>) Similarly, John saw Jehovah’s throne of splendor, and ‘round about it there was a rainbow like an emerald in appearance.’ The restful emerald-green color of the rainbow would have suggested composure and serenity to John, and appropriately so since Jehovah is the master of every situation, a glorious Ruler. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:4:3-66:4:3" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Re 4:3</a>) John also saw an angel with ‘a rainbow upon his head’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:10:1-66:10:1" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Re 10:1</a>), which may suggest that he was a special representative of “the God of peace.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:4:9-50:4:9" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Php 4:9</a>.</p>

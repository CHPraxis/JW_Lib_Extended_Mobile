<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">The Hebrew word <em>nid·dahʹ</em> occurs 30 times in the Hebrew Scriptures and is possibly derived from the root word <em>na·dhahʹ,</em> which means “exclude; put out of mind (refuse to think of).” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:66:5-23:66:5" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Isa 66:5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/30:6:3-30:6:3" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Am 6:3</a>) <em>Nid·dahʹ</em> indicates impurity, something abhorrent, whether physically, as for example, from menstruation (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:12:2-3:12:2" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Le 12:2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:12:5-3:12:5" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:15:20-3:15:20" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> 15:20,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:15:24-3:15:25" data-bid="2-4" class="b"> 24, 25,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:15:33-3:15:33" data-bid="2-5" class="b"> 33</a>), or morally, as from idolatry. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/15:9:11-15:9:11" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ezr 9:11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:29:5-14:29:5" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 2Ch 29:5</a>) The same Hebrew word is used with regard to the “water for <em>cleansing”</em> (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:19:9-4:19:21" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Nu 19:9-21;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:31:23-4:31:23" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 31:23</a>, <em>NW;</em> “water used in case of menstruation,” <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:19:9-4:19:9" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Nu 19:9</a>, <em>NW,</em> ftn; “water of separation,” <em>KJ;</em> “water for impurity,” <em>RS, AT;</em> “lustral water,” <em>JB</em>), indicating water used to remove that which is impure or unclean.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Thus, at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/25:1:17-25:1:17" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Lamentations 1:17</a> Jeremiah says that Jerusalem in her desolation “has become an abhorrent thing [“as a menstruous woman,” <em>KJ; “objeto de abominación,” NC</em> (Spanish); “abhorrent,” <em>AT</em>] in among them [that is, among the surrounding nations].”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Prior to Jerusalem’s destruction by Babylon, Jehovah said of the people of Israel through his prophet Ezekiel: “The house of Israel were dwelling upon their soil, and they kept making it unclean with their way and with their dealings. Like the uncleanness of menstruation [<em>nid·dahʹ</em>] their way has become before me.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:36:17-26:36:17" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Eze 36:17</a>) Due to idolatrous practices, Israel was spiritually impure and would thus be avoided by her husbandly owner, Jehovah God, and would be reunited with him spiritually only after cleansing. Thus, at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:36:25-26:36:25" data-bid="8-1" class="b">verse 25</a>, Jehovah says: “And I will sprinkle upon you clean water, and you will become clean; from all your impurities and from all your dungy idols I shall cleanse you.”​—Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:18:6-26:18:6" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Eze 18:6</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">At <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:7:19-26:7:20" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ezekiel 7:19, 20</a> God expresses his anger against Israel for having made religious images with their silver and their gold and says that he will, therefore, cause them to throw their silver and their gold into the streets as an “abhorrent thing [<em>nid·dahʹ</em>].”​—Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:30:22-23:30:22" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Isa 30:22</a>; see <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200001193/">DISGUSTING THING, LOATHSOME THING</a>.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><strong>Abhorrence.</strong> Other Hebrew expressions having the sense of “abhorrence” are <em>quts,</em> referring to the emotional reaction and defined as “abhor; have an abhorrence of; feel a sickening dread of” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:27:46-1:27:46" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Ge 27:46;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:11:25-11:11:25" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> 1Ki 11:25;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:22:3-4:22:3" data-bid="12-3" class="b"> Nu 22:3</a>), and <em>ga·ʽalʹ,</em> also meaning “abhor,” but indicating a rejection of the object abhorred. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:26:11-3:26:11" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Le 26:11,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:26:15-3:26:15" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 15,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:26:30-3:26:30" data-bid="13-3" class="b"> 30;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:1:21-10:1:21" data-bid="13-4" class="b"> 2Sa 1:21</a>, ftn) In the Greek <em>Septuagint</em> these Hebrew words at times are rendered <em>pro·so·khthiʹzo,</em> signifying “become disgusted” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:27:46-1:27:46" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Ge 27:46;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:26:15-3:26:15" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> Le 26:15</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:3:10-58:3:10" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Heb 3:10</a>), and <em>bde·lysʹso·mai,</em> conveying the sense of “express abhorrence of; have disgust for.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:20:23-3:20:23" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Le 20:23;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:26:11-3:26:11" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> 26:11</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:2:22-45:2:22" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Ro 2:22</a>.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Because the Canaanites were guilty of sexual immorality and perversion, idolatry, and spiritistic practices, the Most High abhorred them, and this resulted in his decreeing their destruction. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:20:2-3:20:23" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Le 20:2-23</a>) The Israelites were warned that, if they became disobedient, Jehovah would also abhor them, withdrawing his protection and blessing. By reason of loyalty to his covenant made with Israel, however, he would not abhor them to the point of bringing about their complete extermination. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:26:11-3:26:45" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Le 26:11-45</a>) In the case of those who will prove to be wicked, the resurrection will turn out to be one to eternal “abhorrence” (Heb., <em>de·ra·ʼohnʹ</em>). It will be a resurrection to condemnatory judgment resulting in everlasting cutting-off.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:12:2-27:12:2" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Da 12:2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:5:28-43:5:29" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> Joh 5:28, 29</a>.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Deliberate rejection of Jehovah’s commands, reproof, and provisions constitutes an improper abhorrence. The Israelites were guilty of this when they refused to follow Jehovah’s commands, as well as when they came to abhor the manna as “contemptible bread.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:21:5-4:21:5" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Nu 21:5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:26:15-3:26:15" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> Le 26:15</a>) <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:3:11-20:3:11" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Proverbs 3:11</a> counsels against ‘abhorring Jehovah’s reproof.’</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">At <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:12:9-45:12:9" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Romans 12:9</a> Christians are admonished: “Abhor what is wicked.” The Greek term here rendered “abhor” (<em>a·po·sty·geʹo</em>) is the intensive form of the Greek verb meaning “hate,” and thus literally means “hate intensely.” A person’s failing to abhor what is wicked, no longer loathing it, can result in his becoming an object of Jehovah’s abhorrence.</p>

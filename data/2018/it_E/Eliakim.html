<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">While Shebna was still “over the house,” the prophet Isaiah foretold that he would be ripped from this position and be replaced by Eliakim, whom Jehovah calls “my servant.” The transfer was to be made by clothing Eliakim with Shebna’s official robe and sash. Also, “the key of the house of David” was to be placed upon Eliakim’s shoulder, suggesting that he would be entrusted with the oversight of the king’s chambers and the authority to decide who might be accepted into the service of the king.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:22:15-23:22:24" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Isa 22:15-24</a>.</p>

PRIESTS’ CITIES
Locations in the Promised Land that were set aside as places of residence for the Aaronic priests and their families. Of the 48 cities given to the tribe of Levi by Israel’s other tribes, 13 were assigned to the Kohathite priests of Aaron’s family. (Jos 21:1-42; 1Ch 6:54-81) The tribes of Judah and Simeon gave them nine cities and four were given by the tribe of Benjamin. Thus, “all the cities of the sons of Aaron, the priests, were thirteen cities and their pasture grounds.” (Jos 21:4, 9-19) These cities were Hebron (a city of refuge), Libnah, Jattir, Eshtemoa, Holon (apparently Hilen), Debir, Ain (Ashan), Juttah, Beth-shemesh, Gibeon, Geba, Anathoth, and Almon (Alemeth), all except Juttah and Gibeon again being named at 1 Chronicles 6:54-60.
David sent word to priests in their various cities to gather together when he was about to bring the ark of Jehovah to Jerusalem. (1Ch 13:1-5) And specific reference is made to the appointment of men to distribute contributed portions to their priestly brothers residing in priests’ cities during King Hezekiah’s reign.​—2Ch 31:11-19.

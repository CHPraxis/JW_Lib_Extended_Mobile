<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">(Aʹshan) [possibly, Smoke].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A city in the Shephelah or lowland region of Judah. Originally assigned to Judah, it was thereafter given to Simeon, because Judah’s territory was overly large. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:15:42-6:15:42" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Jos 15:42;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:19:7-6:19:7" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 19:7,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:19:9-6:19:9" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> 9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:4:32-13:4:32" data-bid="1-4" class="b"> 1Ch 4:32</a>) From them it passed to the Levite family of the Kohathites. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:6:54-13:6:54" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1Ch 6:54,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:6:59-13:6:59" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 59</a>) <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:30:30-9:30:30" data-bid="3-1" class="b">First Samuel 30:30</a> refers to “Borashan” as one of the cities in that general region to which David sent spoils after his victory over the Amalekites, and this is thought by some to be the same as Ashan. At <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:21:16-6:21:16" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Joshua 21:16</a> the list of cities given to the Kohathites, corresponding to that at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:6:59-13:6:59" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 Chronicles 6:59</a>, is presented, but “Ain” appears in the Joshua list in place of Ashan. The <em>Soncino Books of the Bible</em> (London, 1950), commenting on the text, suggests that the full name of the city may have been Ain-ashan.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Many identify Ashan with Khirbet ʽAsan, located about 2.5 km (1.5 mi) NW of modern Beer-sheba, alongside the Nahal ʽAshan. Yohanan Aharoni suggests identifying Ashan with Tel Bet Mirsham, 25 km (16 mi) NNE of Beer-sheba.</p>

NOB
A city evidently in the territory of Benjamin and close to Jerusalem. While there is some question as to the precise location of Nob, Nehemiah 11:31, 32 and Isaiah 10:28-32 indicate that it was near Anathoth and possibly close to a hill from which one could see Jerusalem. Some tentatively identify it with a spot on Ras el Mushraf (Mount Scopus), about 1.5 km (1 mi) NE of the Temple Mount in Jerusalem. That would place it just N of the Mount of Olives.
When David fled from Saul, he went to High Priest Ahimelech, who was at Nob, “the city of the priests,” and received from Ahimelech some showbread as food for his men, and Goliath’s sword, which was being kept there. Perhaps the tabernacle had been moved to Nob when Shiloh experienced God’s adverse judgment. (Compare 1Sa 14:3; Ps 78:60; Jer 7:12-14.) Later, Saul accused Ahimelech of conspiracy, in that he gave assistance to David. At Saul’s command, Doeg the Edomite put to death the high priest and 84 other priests. Then Doeg slaughtered the men, women, children, and animals of Nob. Only Abiathar, the son of Ahimelech, escaped.​—1Sa 21:1-9; 22:6-23.
Nob was one of the places mentioned in connection with the Assyrians’ move toward Jerusalem. (Isa 10:24, 32) Benjamites resettled it after the return from Babylonian exile.​—Ne 11:31, 32.

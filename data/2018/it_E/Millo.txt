MILLO
(Milʹlo) [from a root meaning “fill”].
“The house of Millo” (“Beth-millo,” AT, JB, RS) may have been a fortress or citadel and was perhaps the same as “the tower of Shechem.” Apparently the men of “the house of Millo” shared in making Abimelech king. The prophetic words of Gideon’s son Jotham pointed to disaster for “the house of Millo” at the hands of Abimelech. This was fulfilled when Abimelech set the vault of the house of El-berith on fire and all those who had sought refuge there perished.​—Jg 9:6, 20, 46-49.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">(Jeʹsus) [Lat. form of the Gr. <em>I·e·sousʹ,</em> which corresponds to the Heb. <em>Ye·shuʹaʽ</em> or <em>Yehoh·shuʹaʽ</em> and means “Jehovah Is Salvation”].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Jewish historian Josephus of the first century C.E. mentions some 12 persons, other than those in the Bible record, bearing that name. It also appears in <span id="page52" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="52" data-before-text="52"></span>the Apocryphal writings of the last centuries of the B.C.E. period. It therefore appears that it was not an uncommon name during that period.</p>

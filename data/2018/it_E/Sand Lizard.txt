SAND LIZARD
[Heb., choʹmet].
There is some uncertainty about the unclean ‘swarming creature’ designated by the Hebrew term choʹmet. (Le 11:30, 31) The renderings of the Greek Septuagint and the Latin Vulgate point to a kind of lizard, and the word has been variously translated “sand lizard” (AS, JP, NW, RS), “chameleon” (AT), and “snail” (KJ). It is possibly a skink.​—See LIZARD.

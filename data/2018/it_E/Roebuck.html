<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">[Heb., <em>yach·murʹ</em>].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The male of the roe deer, a small variety resembling a gazelle. The roebuck (<em>Capreolus capreolus</em>) stands over 0.6 m (2 ft) high at the shoulder and measures about 1.2 m (4 ft) in length. Only the males have antlers, and these are shed each year. The roebuck’s summer coat is reddish brown, and this may have been the basis for its Hebrew name <em>yach·murʹ,</em> considered to be derived from a root meaning “be red.” This animal is not generally gregarious. Small groups of three or four, the buck, the doe, and a fawn or two, may be seen feeding together. The roebuck has one mate for life.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Being a chewer of the cud and a splitter of the hoof, the roebuck was acceptable for food according to the terms of the Mosaic Law. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:14:5-5:14:6" data-bid="1-1" class="b">De 14:5, 6</a>) The flesh of this creature was one of the meats regularly provided for King Solomon’s table.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:4:22-11:4:23" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1Ki 4:22, 23</a>.</p>

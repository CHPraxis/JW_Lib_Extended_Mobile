<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">(Goʹshen).</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><strong>1.</strong> A region in Egypt where the Israelites resided for 215 years (1728-1513 B.C.E.). (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:45:10-1:45:10" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ge 45:10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:47:27-1:47:27" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 47:27</a>) While the exact location of Goshen is uncertain, it appears to have lain in the eastern part of the Nile Delta, the entrance to Egypt proper. This is indicated by the fact that Joseph, leaving his Egyptian quarters, met his father (who was traveling from Canaan) at Goshen. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:46:28-1:46:29" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ge 46:28, 29</a>) Greek <em>Septuagint</em> renderings indicate that Goshen was in the vicinity of the Wadi Tumilat.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Pharaoh kept cattle at Goshen, and the Hebrews also pastured their flocks and herds there. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:47:1-1:47:1" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ge 47:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:47:4-1:47:6" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 4-6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:50:8-1:50:8" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> 50:8</a>) The description of the region as ‘the very best of the land of Egypt’ is apparently a relative term meaning the most fertile <em>pastoral</em> land, best suited for the particular needs of Jacob’s family. Goshen may have been the same as “the land of Rameses.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:47:6-1:47:6" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ge 47:6,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:47:11-1:47:11" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 11</a>) Beginning with the fourth blow on Egypt, Jehovah specifically singled out “Goshen” to be left unharmed.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:8:22-2:8:22" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ex 8:22;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:9:26-2:9:26" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 9:26</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><strong>2.</strong> A city in the mountainous region of Judah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:15:20-6:15:20" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Jos 15:20,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:15:48-6:15:48" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 48,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:15:51-6:15:51" data-bid="6-3" class="b"> 51</a>) Some scholars tentatively identify it with Edh Dhahiriya, about 18 km (11 mi) SW of Hebron. “The land of Goshen” referred to at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:10:41-6:10:41" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Joshua 10:41</a> and <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:11:16-6:11:16" data-bid="8-1" class="b">11:16</a> was apparently a district in its vicinity. This district would take in the mountainous region between Hebron and the Negeb.</p>

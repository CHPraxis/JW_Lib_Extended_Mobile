BETH-ANATH
(Beth-aʹnath) [House of Anath].
One of the fortified cities that was assigned to the tribe of Naphtali (Jos 19:38, 39), but from which they did not drive out the Canaanite inhabitants, reducing them instead to forced labor. (Jg 1:33) It is possibly identified with Safed el-Battikh, 24 km (15 mi) ESE of Tyre. The town is mentioned in the lists of various Egyptian rulers of the “New Kingdom” period.

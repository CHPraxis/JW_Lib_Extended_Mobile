HUR
1. A descendant of Judah; son of Caleb and Ephrath; grandfather of the craftsman Bezalel. Some of Hur’s descendants may have settled in Bethlehem. (Ex 31:2; 35:30; 38:22; 1Ch 2:19, 20, 50, 51, 54; 4:1-4; 2Ch 1:5) Likely the same as No. 2.
2. A prominent associate of Moses and Aaron. When, shortly after leaving Egypt, Israel was attacked by the Amalekites, Hur accompanied Moses and Aaron to the top of a hill where he and Aaron supported Moses’ hands until Jehovah gave Israel the victory over the Amalekites. (Ex 17:8-13) On one occasion not long thereafter, Moses and Joshua went up on Mount Sinai to receive more of the Law, leaving Hur and Aaron in charge of the camp. (Ex 24:12-14) He is likely the same Hur (No. 1) as the grandfather of the tabernacle craftsman Bezalel. Josephus wrote that Hur was Miriam’s husband, but the Bible does not say anything about this.​—Jewish Antiquities, III, 54 (ii, 4).
3. A king of Midian, one of five dominated by Amorite King Sihon until Israel, moving toward the Promised Land, defeated Sihon. (Jos 13:15, 16, 21; Nu 21:21-24) Afterward, Hur and his four compatriots apparently allied themselves with Moab’s king Balak in opposition to Israel. (Nu 22:1-7) Later, as directed by Jehovah, the Israelites warred against the Midianites and killed Hur as well as his four allied Midianite kings and the greedy prophet Balaam.​—Nu 31:1-8.
4. Father of Solomon’s food deputy in the mountainous region of Ephraim.​—1Ki 4:7, 8.
5. Father of Rephaiah. Hur’s son Rephaiah helped Nehemiah rebuild Jerusalem’s wall.​—Ne 3:9.

<p id="p1" data-pid="1" class="st"><span id="page444" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="444" data-before-text="444"></span><strong>CHRONICLES, THE BOOKS OF</strong></p>
<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Two inspired books of the Hebrew Scriptures that were apparently one volume in the original Hebrew canon. The Masoretes regarded them as one single work, and they are reckoned as one book in the counts that regard the Hebrew Scriptures as made up of 22 or 24 books, and as two books in the count that regards the total number of books as 39. The division into two books seemingly originated with the translators of the Greek <em>Septuagint.</em> In Hebrew manuscripts the twofold division began in the 15th century. In the Hebrew text, Chronicles appears at the end of the section called Writings. The Hebrew name, <em>Div·rehʹ Hai</em>·<em>ya·mimʹ,</em> means “The Affairs of the Days.” Jerome suggested the name <em>Khro·ni·kon<strong>ʹ</strong>,</em> from which we get Chronicles in the English Bible. A chronicle is a record of happenings in the order in which they occurred. The Greek title (in the <em>Septuagint</em>) is <em>Pa·ra·lei·po·meʹnon,</em> meaning “Things Passed Over (Left Untold; Omitted),” that is, from the books of Samuel and Kings. However, it is to be noted that the Chronicles are by no means a mere supplement to those books.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><strong>Writer, Time, and Period Covered.</strong> The Jewish priest Ezra is recognized, for a number of reasons, as the writer. Jewish tradition has long held to this view. It is also supported by the striking resemblance between the writing style of Chronicles and the style of the book of Ezra. There is repetition at the close of Second Chronicles and at the beginning of Ezra that is virtually word for word. Moreover, the statement of Cyrus’ decree found at the end of Second Chronicles is given in full in the book of Ezra, indicating that the writer closed the book of Chronicles with the intention of writing another book (Ezra) that would deal with the decree and its execution more fully. Chronicles was completed about 460 B.C.E. Evidently, only two books of the Hebrew canon were completed after 460 B.C.E., namely, Nehemiah and Malachi.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Aside from the genealogical lists that run from Adam, the Chronicles cover the period from the death of King Saul to the carrying away of exiles to Babylon, with a conclusion telling of Cyrus’ decree at the end of the 70-year exile.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><strong>Sources.</strong> Ezra assumed that his readers were familiar with the books of Kings and therefore did not try to cover the same ground. The material he used, which in some instances reads exactly or nearly like portions of Kings, is included only in order to retain that which, by its relationship, gives meaning to the additional information in Chronicles. It may be that Ezra used the books of Samuel and Kings as well as some other parts of the Bible as sources, but it seems that in most if not all cases, he had access to writings not now known to be in existence. Some of these may have been documents of state from both Israel and Judah, genealogical records, and historical works written by prophets, also documents possessed by tribal or family heads. A portion of the sources used were no doubt the work of professional recorders.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:4:3-11:4:3" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1Ki 4:3</a>.</p>

<p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb">(There are also references in Chronicles to writings, particularly genealogies, that may designate other sources used by Ezra.)</p>
<p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sb">It is evident that Ezra was extremely careful, doing meticulous research, going through all the documentary sources accessible to him, evidently investigating every document that would shed light on the subject. He documents his writings not merely as proof of accuracy as to what he has written but also to direct the reader of that time to other sources for more detail. Ezra’s painstaking thoroughness should commend the Chronicles as worthy of our utmost confidence in their accuracy and historical authenticity. But, above all, the knowledge that Ezra wrote under inspiration (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:16-55:3:16" data-bid="23-1" class="b">2Ti 3:16</a>) and the fact that the Chronicles are included in the Hebrew canon, fully accepted by Jesus and the apostles (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:24:27-42:24:27" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Lu 24:27,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:24:44-42:24:44" data-bid="24-2" class="b"> 44</a>), ensure their reliability. Moreover, the Chronicles constitute part of the complete written Word of God, the purity of which he has guarded for the followers of his Son, Jesus Christ. These facts recommend Chronicles highly as a source of faith.</p>
<p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="sb"><strong>Purpose.</strong> Ezra’s work was not merely to fill in what was left out by the books of Samuel and Kings; rather, he discerned among the returned exiles the need of such a summary of their national history. The work was undoubtedly prepared for those recently returned from exile, as they would be greatly lacking in knowledge of their sacred history and customs. They needed to know about temple worship and the duties of Levites, and Ezra provided this information. And to the returned exiles few things would have greater interest than their ancestral genealogies, to which Ezra devoted much attention. Israel was functioning again as a nation, in their land, with temple, priesthood, and governor, even though without a king. They would continue as a nation down to the Messiah’s coming. They needed the information Chronicles provided for unity and true worship.</p>
<p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="sb">Both Samuel and Jeremiah were historical writers, but they were also Levites. Jeremiah was a prophet and a priest. Ezra was a priest. But it is a mistake to say that Jeremiah would be especially interested in the fulfillment of prophecies and not so interested in the matters of temple worship and that Ezra would be especially interested in Levitical work and not so interested in prophecies. Both <span id="page446" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="446" data-before-text="446"></span>of them were servants of God and had concern for his words, his dealings with his people, and every feature of his worship. The fact is that Ezra was inspired by Jehovah to produce the books of Chronicles and Ezra for a special purpose.</p>
<p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="sb">The Jews who returned from Babylon in 537 B.C.E. did so, not to establish political independence, but to restore true worship, the first work being to erect the altar and then to rebuild the temple. It was appropriate, therefore, that much be said by Ezra concerning worship and the services of the priesthood and the Levites. Also, the genealogies were important. <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/15:2:59-15:2:63" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Ezra 2:59-63</a> shows that some, including certain sons of the priests, were unable to find their register to establish their genealogy publicly. While in Babylon these genealogies might not have been so important, but now they were the means of regaining possession of the heritage of their fathers. This is one of the reasons for the lists of genealogies compiled by Ezra, which are also of great value to Bible students today.</p>
<p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="sb">Thus we see that Ezra in writing Chronicles wished to strengthen his contemporaries in fidelity to Jehovah. He encouraged them to fulfill their covenant duties by focusing on the past history of Israel, and particularly by the use of actual historical examples he emphasized the results of faithful adherence to true worship on the one hand and, on the other hand, the calamity of forsaking the worship of Jehovah God.</p>
<p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="sb"><strong>Value of the Books.</strong> It is a fine thing for our faith and understanding of the Bible that the books of Chronicles were written. Ezra has added much concerning the temple worship and the arrangements of the priests, Levites, doorkeepers, singers, and musicians. He has given us many details that bear on true worship: the bringing of the Ark to Jerusalem by David (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:15:1-13:15:29" data-bid="26-1" class="b">1Ch chaps 15,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:16:1-13:16:43" data-bid="26-2" class="b"> 16</a>); David’s preparations for the temple and its service (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:22:1-13:29:30" data-bid="27-1" class="b">1Ch chaps 22–29</a>); the fact that the priests stayed with Rehoboam at the time of the secession of the ten tribes (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:11:13-14:11:17" data-bid="28-1" class="b">2Ch 11:13-17</a>); the war between Abijah and Jeroboam (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:13:1-14:13:22" data-bid="29-1" class="b">2Ch 13</a>); the reforms in favor of <span id="page447" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="447" data-before-text="447"></span>true religion under Asa (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:14:1-14:14:15" data-bid="30-1" class="b">2Ch chaps 14,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:15:1-14:15:19" data-bid="30-2" class="b"> 15</a>), Jehoshaphat (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:17:1-14:17:19" data-bid="31-1" class="b">2Ch chaps 17,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:19:1-14:19:11" data-bid="31-2" class="b"> 19,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:20:1-14:20:37" data-bid="31-3" class="b"> 20</a>), Hezekiah (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:29:1-14:31:21" data-bid="32-1" class="b">2Ch chaps 29–31</a>), and Josiah (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:34:1-14:34:33" data-bid="33-1" class="b">2Ch chaps 34,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:35:1-14:35:27" data-bid="33-2" class="b"> 35</a>); Uzziah’s being stricken with leprosy for his presumptuousness (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:26:16-14:26:21" data-bid="34-1" class="b">2Ch 26:16-21</a>); and Manasseh’s repentance (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:33:10-14:33:20" data-bid="35-1" class="b">2Ch 33:10-20</a>).</p>
<p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="sb">Ezra shows that he is interested not only in priestly affairs but also in the prophets. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:20:20-14:20:20" data-bid="36-1" class="b">2Ch 20:20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:36:12-14:36:12" data-bid="36-2" class="b"> 36:12,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:36:16-14:36:16" data-bid="36-3" class="b"> 16</a>) He uses the words “prophet,” “seer,” or “visionary” about 45 times and gives added information on many prophets and persons whose names are not otherwise mentioned in the Scriptures. A few are Iddo, Eliezer the son of Dodavahu, Jahaziel the son of Zechariah, a number of people named Zechariah, and Oded of the time of King Ahaz of Judah.</p>
<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="sb">There is much information in Chronicles that helps to round out our knowledge of the history of Judah, for example, the record of the sickness and burial of Asa and of the bad conduct of Jehoash after Jehoiada the high priest died. Then there are the genealogies that are vital in establishing the lineage of Christ. The books are also of assistance in establishing an accurate chronology. Here we can see the wisdom of Jehovah, the Author of the Bible, in having his servant Ezra write these things to fill in that which is necessary so that believers in the Bible have the most complete and harmonious record of man’s history.</p>

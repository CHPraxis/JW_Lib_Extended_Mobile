SINIM, LAND OF
(Siʹnim).
A country from which, it was foretold, scattered Israelites would come when the time arrived for them to dwell in and rehabilitate their homeland. (Isa 49:12) Reference to the N and W in the same verse suggests that Sinim was S or E of the land of Israel. Instead of “Sinim,” the Greek Septuagint reads “land of the Persians,” which could include Elam, called Si-nim in Old Akkadian. (Compare Isa 11:11.) The Targums and the Latin Vulgate, on the other hand, read “[land] to the south.” Certain scholars have suggested identification with Syene (Eze 30:6) in the southern extremity of Egypt. But Sinim’s location is uncertain.

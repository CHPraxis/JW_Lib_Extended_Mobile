<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">(Shaʹa·lim) [Handfuls; Hollows of the Hand].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A “land” Saul passed through when searching for the lost she-asses belonging to his father Kish. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:9:3-9:9:4" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1Sa 9:3, 4</a>) Because of the difficulty of determining Saul’s exact route, the situation of Shaalim is not definitely known. Some scholars have equated “the land of Shaalim” with “the land of Shual” in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:13:17-9:13:17" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Samuel 13:17</a>. At any rate, a location in Ephraim seems best suited to the context.</p>

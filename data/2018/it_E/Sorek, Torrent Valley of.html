<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Location of the home of Delilah, where Samson was seduced to reveal the secret of his strength, leading to his capture, blinding, and imprisonment by the Philistines. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:16:4-7:16:21" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Jg 16:4-21</a>) It is identified with the Wadi es-Sarar (Nahal Soreq), which cuts westward across the Shephelah toward the Mediterranean Sea. The name Sorek, which means “Choice Red Vine,” seems to be preserved in Khirbet Suriq, about 25 km (16 mi) W of Jerusalem, situated on the N side of the wadi and opposite Beth-shemesh. Much of this region, as today, was probably suited for vineyards (a possible reason for its name). The Philistine wagon that returned the ark of the covenant to the Israelites evidently followed the torrent valley of Sorek from Ekron on the road to Beth-shemesh.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:5:10-9:5:10" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1Sa 5:10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:6:10-9:6:12" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 6:10-12</a>.</p>

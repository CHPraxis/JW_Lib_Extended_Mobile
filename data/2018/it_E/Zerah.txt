ZERAH
(Zeʹrah) [possibly a shortened form of Zerahiah].
1. An Edomite sheik. Zerah was the son of Reuel and grandson of Esau and Basemath, Ishmael’s daughter. (Ge 36:3, 4, 13, 17; 1Ch 1:37) Possibly the same as No. 2.
2. Father of the second Edomite king, Jobab; he was from Bozrah. (Ge 36:33; 1Ch 1:44) Possibly the same as No. 1.
3. A son of Judah and Tamar; twin brother of Perez. (Ge 38:27-30; Mt 1:3) Zerah was one of those “who came to Jacob into Egypt.” (Ge 46:12, 26) His five sons (1Ch 2:4, 6) grew into a Judean tribal family (Nu 26:20) and eventually included persons such as Achan (Jos 7:1, 17, 18, 24; 22:20), two of David’s army leaders (1Ch 27:11, 13), and some postexilic residents of Jerusalem (1Ch 9:3, 6; Ne 11:22, 24).
4. A son of Simeon and founder of a family in that tribe. (1Ch 4:24; Nu 26:12, 13) He is called Zohar at Genesis 46:10 and Exodus 6:15.
5. A descendant of Gershon (Gershom) the son of Levi. (1Ch 6:16, 20, 21; compare Ge 46:11.) In 1 Chronicles 6:41 reference may be made to the same person.
6. An Ethiopian, or Cushite, who led a huge army of a million men and 300 chariots into Judah during Asa’s reign, in 967 B.C.E. Zerah met defeat, and his fleeing forces were pursued and slaughtered “as far as Gerar.” (2Ch 14:1, 9-15) Identification of Zerah with any secularly known Egyptian or Ethiopian ruler remains uncertain.

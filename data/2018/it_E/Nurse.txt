NURSE
Two kinds of nurses were employed in ancient times. The “nursing woman” (Heb., meh·neʹqeth; Ge 24:59; 35:8; Ex 2:7; 2Ki 11:2; 2Ch 22:11; Isa 49:23) served as a mother’s substitute for breast-feeding an infant. Deborah was such a nurse to Rebekah but later served as her maid or caretaker, continuing as a family servant even after her mistress’ death. (Ge 24:59, 67; 35:8) The other type nurse could be a male (Heb., ʼo·menʹ; Nu 11:12; Isa 49:23 [‘caretaker’]) or a female (Heb., ʼo·meʹneth; 2Sa 4:4). A person of either sex might care for children, the sick, or older persons. The role of a nurse or caretaker was filled by aged Naomi toward her grandson Obed and by the beautiful virgin Abishag in connection with King David.​—Ru 4:13, 16, 17; 1Ki 1:1-4.
At 1 Thessalonians 2:7, Paul likens himself and his companions to “a nursing mother” (Gr., tro·phosʹ), thus emphasizing that they were gentle toward the Macedonian believers.

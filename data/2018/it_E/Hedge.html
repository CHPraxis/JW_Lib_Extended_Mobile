<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Orchards and vineyards were commonly surrounded by hedges, thick rows of thorny plants, to safeguard the area from thieves and the depredations of animals. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:5:5-23:5:5" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Isa 5:5</a>) The Scriptures employ the expression “put up a hedge” in a figurative sense to denote the giving of protection. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:1:10-18:1:10" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Job 1:10</a>) On the other hand, ‘hedging in’ is used to represent the rearing up of obstacles, or barriers, placing an individual or even a nation in a helpless and forsaken situation with no way out. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:3:23-18:3:23" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Job 3:23;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/28:2:6-28:2:6" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Ho 2:6</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:19:8-18:19:8" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Job 19:8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/25:3:7-25:3:9" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> La 3:7-9</a>.) With reference to the moral corruption existing among the Israelites of his day, Micah wrote that “their most upright one is worse than a thorn hedge,” that is, prickly, hurtful, and injurious.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/33:7:4-33:7:4" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Mic 7:4</a>.</p>

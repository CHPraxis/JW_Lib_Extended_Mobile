KELITA
(Ke·liʹta) [possibly from a root meaning “too short” [that is, dwarfed]].
1. One of the Levites of Ezra’s day who recognized their guilt in taking foreign wives and therefore sent them away. He is also called Kelaiah. (Ezr 10:23, 44) Possibly the same as Nos. 2 and 3.
2. A Levite who assisted Ezra in “explaining the law to the people” in 455 B.C.E.​—Ne 8:7, 8; see No. 1.
3. A Levite whose descendant, if not he himself, attested by seal the “trustworthy arrangement” of Nehemiah’s time. (Ne 9:38; 10:1, 9, 10) If Kelita himself, rather than a descendant, was present when this agreement was made, he may have been the same as No. 1 or No. 2.

BEROTHAH
(Be·roʹthah), Berothai (Be·roʹthai) [Wells].
In Ezekiel’s vision concerning the territorial inheritance of Israel, Berothah is listed as on the northern boundary between Hamath and Sibraim. (Eze 47:16) It appears to be the same as Berothai of 2 Samuel 8:8, a city belonging to Hadadezer king of Zobah, from which David carried away “copper in very great quantity.” In the parallel record at 1 Chronicles 18:8 the name Cun appears in its place. Berothah (or Berothai) is generally identified with present-day Britel (Bereitan), about 10 km (6 mi) SW of Baalbek in the valley known as the Beqaʽ, lying between the Lebanon and the Anti-Lebanon mountains.

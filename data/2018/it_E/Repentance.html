<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">The verb “repent” means “change one’s mind with regard to past (or intended) action, or conduct, on account of regret or dissatisfaction,” or “feel regret, contrition, or compunction, for what one has done or omitted to do.” In many texts this is the thought of the Hebrew <em>na·chamʹ.</em> <em>Na·chamʹ</em> can mean “feel regret, keep a period of mourning, repent” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:13:17-2:13:17" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ex 13:17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:38:12-1:38:12" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Ge 38:12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:42:6-18:42:6" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> Job 42:6</a>), as well as “comfort oneself” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:13:39-10:13:39" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2Sa 13:39;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:5:13-26:5:13" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Eze 5:13</a>), “relieve oneself (as of one’s enemies).” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:1:24-23:1:24" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Isa 1:24</a>) Whether regret or comfort, it can be seen that a change of mind or feeling is involved.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">In Greek, two verbs are used in connection with repentance: <em>me·ta·no·eʹo</em> and <em>me·ta·meʹlo·mai.</em> The first is composed of <em>me·taʹ,</em> meaning “after,” and <span id="page771" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="771" data-before-text="771"></span><em>no·eʹo</em> (related to <em>nous,</em> the mind, disposition, or moral consciousness), meaning “perceive, discern, mentally grasp, or be aware.” Hence, <em>me·ta·no·eʹo</em> literally means <em>after</em>knowing (in contrast to <em>fore</em>knowing) and signifies a change in one’s mind, attitude, or purpose. <em>Me·ta·meʹlo·mai,</em> on the other hand, comes from <em>meʹlo,</em> meaning “care for or have interest in.” The prefix <em>me·taʹ</em> (after) gives the verb the sense of ‘regretting’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:21:29-40:21:29" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Mt 21:29;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:7:8-47:7:8" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 2Co 7:8</a>), or ‘repenting.’</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Thus, <em>me·ta·no·eʹo</em> stresses the changed <em>viewpoint</em> or <em>disposition,</em> a rejecting of the past or intended course or action as undesirable (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:2:5-66:2:5" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Re 2:5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:3:3-66:3:3" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 3:3</a>), while <em>me·ta·meʹlo·mai</em> lays emphasis on the <em>feeling</em> of regret experienced by the person. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:21:29-40:21:29" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Mt 21:29</a>) As the <em>Theological Dictionary of the New Testament</em> (edited by G. Kittel, Vol. IV, p. 629) comments: “When, therefore, the N[ew] T[estament] separates the meanings of [these terms], it displays a clear awareness of the unchangeable substance of both concepts. In contrast, Hellenistic usage often effaced the boundary between the two words.”​—Translated by G. Bromiley, 1969.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Of course, a changed viewpoint often brings with it a changed feeling, or the feeling of regret may precede and lead to a definite change in viewpoint or will. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:24:5-9:24:7" data-bid="7-1" class="b">1Sa 24:5-7</a>) So the two terms, though having distinct meanings, are closely related.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><strong>Human Repentance for Sins.</strong> The cause making repentance necessary is sin, failure to meet God’s righteous requirements. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:5:17-62:5:17" data-bid="8-1" class="b">1Jo 5:17</a>) Since all mankind was sold into sin by Adam, all of his descendants have had need of repentance. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:51:5-19:51:5" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ps 51:5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:3:23-45:3:23" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> Ro 3:23;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:5:12-45:5:12" data-bid="9-3" class="b"> 5:12</a>) As shown in the article <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200003664/">RECONCILIATION</a>, repentance (followed by conversion) is a prerequisite for man’s being reconciled to God.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Repentance may be with regard to one’s whole life course, a course that has been contrary to God’s purpose and will and, instead, has been in harmony with the world under the control of God’s Adversary. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:4:3-60:4:3" data-bid="10-1" class="b">1Pe 4:3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:2:15-62:2:17" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> 1Jo 2:15-17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:5:19-62:5:19" data-bid="10-3" class="b"> 5:19</a>) Or it may be with regard to a particular aspect of one’s life, a wrong practice marring and staining an otherwise acceptable course; it may be for just a single act of wrongdoing or even a wrong tendency, inclination, or attitude. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:141:3-19:141:4" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Ps 141:3, 4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:6:16-20:6:19" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> Pr 6:16-19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:2:9-59:2:9" data-bid="11-3" class="b"> Jas 2:9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:4:13-59:4:17" data-bid="11-4" class="b"> 4:13-17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:2:1-62:2:1" data-bid="11-5" class="b"> 1Jo 2:1</a>) The range of faults may therefore be very broad or quite specific.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Similarly, the extent to which the person deviates from righteousness may be major or minor, and logically the degree of regret ought to be commensurate with the degree of deviation. The Israelites went “deep in their revolt” against Jehovah and were “rotting away” in their transgressions. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:31:6-23:31:6" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Isa 31:6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:64:5-23:64:6" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> 64:5, 6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:33:10-26:33:10" data-bid="12-3" class="b"> Eze 33:10</a>) On the other hand, the apostle Paul speaks of the “man [who] takes some false step before he is aware of it,” and counsels that those with spiritual qualifications “try to readjust such a man in a spirit of mildness.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:6:1-48:6:1" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Ga 6:1</a>) Since Jehovah mercifully considers the fleshly weakness of his servants, they need not be in a constant state of remorse due to their errors resulting from inherent imperfection. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:103:8-19:103:14" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Ps 103:8-14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:130:3-19:130:3" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> 130:3</a>) If they are conscientiously walking in God’s ways, they may be joyful.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:4:4-50:4:6" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Php 4:4-6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:3:19-62:3:22" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> 1Jo 3:19-22</a>.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Repentance may be on the part of those who already have enjoyed a favorable relationship with God but who have strayed away and suffered the loss of God’s favor and blessing. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:2:25-60:2:25" data-bid="16-1" class="b">1Pe 2:25</a>) Israel was in a covenant with God​—they were “a holy people” chosen from among all the nations (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:7:6-5:7:6" data-bid="17-1" class="b">De 7:6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:19:5-2:19:6" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> Ex 19:5, 6</a>); Christians also came into a righteous standing before God through the new covenant mediated by Christ.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:15:19-24:15:21" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Jer 15:19-21;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:4:8-59:4:10" data-bid="19-2" class="b"> Jas 4:8-10</a>) For those who have not previously enjoyed such a relationship with God, such as the pagan peoples of the non-Israelite nations during the time God’s covenant was in force with Israel (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:2:11-49:2:12" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Eph 2:11, 12</a>) and also those persons of whatever race or nationality who are outside the Christian congregation, repentance is a primary and essential step toward being brought into a right standing before God, with life everlasting in view.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:11:18-44:11:18" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Ac 11:18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:17:30-44:17:30" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> 17:30;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:20:21-44:20:21" data-bid="21-3" class="b"> 20:21</a>.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Repentance may be on a collective basis as well as an individual basis. Thus, Jonah’s preaching caused the entire city of Nineveh, from the king down to “the least one of them,” to repent, for in God’s eyes they were all sharers in the wrong. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/32:3:5-32:3:9" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Jon 3:5-9</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:18:7-24:18:8" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Jer 18:7, 8</a>.) The entire congregation of returned Israelites, under Ezra’s prompting, acknowledged community guilt before God, expressing repentance through their princely representatives.

<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">If there is faith and love for God in the person’s heart, there will be sincere regret, sadness over the wrong course.

(Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:42:1-18:42:6" data-bid="53-1" class="b">Job 42:1-6</a>.) Love for neighbor will also make them rue the harm they have done to others, the bad example set, perhaps the way in which they have sullied the reputation of God’s people among outsiders. They seek forgiveness because they desire to honor God’s name and to work for the good of their neighbor.

Without both this hatred of bad and love of righteousness, there will be no genuine force to the repentance, no following through with true conversion. Thus, King Rehoboam humbled himself under the expression of Jehovah’s anger, but afterward Rehoboam “did what was bad, for he had not firmly established his heart to search for Jehovah.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:12:12-14:12:14" data-bid="62-1" class="b">2Ch 12:12-14</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/28:6:4-28:6:6" data-bid="63-1" class="b">Ho 6:4-6</a>.</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb"><strong><em>Sadness in a godly way, not that of the world.</em></strong> The apostle Paul, in his second letter to the Corinthians, refers to the “sadness in a godly way” that they expressed as a result of the reproof given them in his first letter. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:7:8-47:7:13" data-bid="64-1" class="b">2Co 7:8-13</a>) He had ‘regretted’ (<em>me·ta·meʹlo·mai</em>) having to write them so sternly and causing them pain, but he ceased to feel any regret upon seeing that the sadness his rebuke produced was of a godly sort, leading to earnest repentance (<em>me·taʹnoi·a</em>) for their wrong attitude and course. He knew that the pain he had caused them was working to their good and would cause them “no damage.” The sadness leading to repentance was not something they should regret either, for it kept them on the way of salvation; it saved them from backsliding or apostasy and gave them hope of life everlasting. He contrasts this sadness with “the sadness of the world [that] produces death.” Such does not stem from faith and love of God and righteousness. The world’s sadness, born of failure, disappointment, loss, punishment for wrongdoing, and shame (compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:5:3-20:5:14" data-bid="65-1" class="b">Pr 5:3-14,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:5:22-20:5:23" data-bid="65-2" class="b"> 22, 23;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:25:8-20:25:10" data-bid="65-3" class="b"> 25:8-10</a>), is often accompanied by or produces bitterness, resentment, envy; and it leads to no lasting benefit, no improvement, no genuine hope.

<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">Cain’s case illustrates this, he being the first one called on by God to repent. Cain was divinely warned to “turn to doing good” so that sin should not win out over him. Rather than repent of his murderous hatred, he let it motivate him to kill his brother. Questioned by God, he gave a devious reply, and only when sentence was pronounced on him did he express any regret​—regret over the severity of the punishment, not over the wrong committed. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:4:5-1:4:14" data-bid="69-1" class="b">Ge 4:5-14</a>) He thus showed that he “originated with the wicked one.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:3:12-62:3:12" data-bid="70-1" class="b">1Jo 3:12</a>.</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">Worldly sadness was also displayed by Esau when he learned that his brother Jacob had received the blessing of firstborn (a right Esau had callously sold to Jacob).

<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">Judas, after having betrayed Jesus, “felt remorse [form of <em>me·ta·meʹlo·mai</em>],” tried to return the bribe he had bargained for, and thereafter committed suicide by hanging. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:27:3-40:27:5" data-bid="74-1" class="b">Mt 27:3-5</a>) The enormity of his crime and, likely, the awful certainty of divine judgment against him evidently overwhelmed him.

He felt the remorse of guilt, despair, even desperation, but there is nothing to show he expressed the godly sadness that leads to repentance (<em>me·taʹnoi·a</em>). He sought out, not God, but the Jewish leaders to confess his sin to them, returning the money evidently with the mistaken idea that he could thereby to some extent undo his crime. (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:5:3-59:5:4" data-bid="76-1" class="b">Jas 5:3, 4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:7:19-26:7:19" data-bid="76-2" class="b"> Eze 7:19</a>.) To the crime of treason and contributing to the death of an innocent man, he added that of self-murder. His course is in contrast with that of Peter, whose bitter weeping after having denied his Lord was due to heartfelt repentance, which led to his being restored.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:26:75-40:26:75" data-bid="77-1" class="b">Mt 26:75</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:22:31-42:22:32" data-bid="78-1" class="b">Lu 22:31, 32</a>.</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">Regret, remorse, and tears, then, are not a certain measure of genuine repentance; the heart <em>motive</em> is determinative. Hosea voices Jehovah’s denunciation of Israel, for in their distress “they did not call to [him] for aid with their heart, although they kept howling on their beds. On account of their grain and sweet wine they kept loafing about . . . And they proceeded to return, not to anything higher.” Their groaning for relief in time of calamity was selfishly motivated, and if granted relief, they did not use the opportunity to improve their relationship with God by closer adherence to his high standards (compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:55:8-23:55:11" data-bid="79-1" class="b">Isa 55:8-11</a>); they were like “a loose bow” that never hits the mark.

<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="sn"><strong><em>How can God, who is perfect, “feel regret”?</em></strong></p>
<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="sb">In the majority of cases where the Hebrew <em>na·chamʹ</em> is used in the sense of “feeling regret,” the reference is to Jehovah God. <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:6:6-1:6:7" data-bid="151-1" class="b">Genesis 6:6, 7</a> states that “Jehovah felt regrets that he had made men in the earth, and he felt hurt at his heart,” their wickedness being so great that God determined he would wipe them off the surface of the ground by means of the global Flood. This cannot mean that God felt regret in the sense of having made a mistake in his work of creation, for “perfect is his activity.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:32:4-5:32:5" data-bid="152-1" class="b">De 32:4, 5</a>) Regret is the opposite of pleasurable satisfaction and rejoicing. Hence, it must be that God regretted that after he had created mankind, their conduct became so evil that he now found himself obliged (and justly so) to destroy all mankind with the exception of Noah and his family. For God ‘takes no delight in the death of the wicked.’​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:33:11-26:33:11" data-bid="153-1" class="b">Eze 33:11</a>.</p>
<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="sb">M’Clintock and Strong’s <em>Cyclopædia</em> comments: “God himself is said to repent [<em>na·chamʹ,</em> feel regret]; but this can only be understood of his altering his conduct towards his creatures, either in the bestowing of good or infliction of evil​—which change in the divine conduct is founded on a change in his creatures; and thus, speaking after the manner of men, God is said to repent.” (1894, Vol. VIII, p. 1042) God’s righteous <em>standards</em> remain constant, stable, unchanging, free from fluctuation. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/39:3:6-39:3:6" data-bid="154-1" class="b">Mal 3:6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:1:17-59:1:17" data-bid="154-2" class="b"> Jas 1:17</a>) No circumstance can cause him to change his mind about these, to turn from them, or to abandon them. However, the attitude and reactions of his intelligent creatures toward those perfect standards and toward God’s application of them can be good or bad. If good, this is pleasing to God; if bad, it causes regret. Moreover, the creature’s attitude can change from good to bad or bad to good, and since God does not change his standards to accommodate them, his pleasure (and accompanying blessings) can accordingly change to regret (and accompanying discipline or punishment) or vice versa. His judgments and decisions, then, are totally free from caprice, fickleness, unreliability, or error; hence he is free from all erratic or eccentric conduct.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:18:21-26:18:30" data-bid="155-1" class="b">Eze 18:21-30;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:33:7-26:33:20" data-bid="155-2" class="b"> 33:7-20</a>.</p>
<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="sb">A potter may begin to make one type of vessel and then change to another style if the vessel is “spoiled by the potter’s hand.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:18:3-24:18:4" data-bid="156-1" class="b">Jer 18:3, 4</a>) By this example Jehovah illustrates, <em>not</em> that he is like a human potter in ‘spoiling by his hand,’ but rather, that he has divine <em>authority</em> over mankind, authority to adjust his dealings with them according to the way they respond or fail to respond to his righteousness and mercy. (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:45:9-23:45:9" data-bid="157-1" class="b">Isa 45:9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:9:19-45:9:21" data-bid="157-2" class="b"> Ro 9:19-21</a>.) He can thus “feel regret over the calamity that [he] had thought to execute” upon a nation, or “feel regret over the good that [he] said to [himself] to do for its good,” all depending upon the reaction of the nation to his prior dealings with it. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:18:5-24:18:10" data-bid="158-1" class="b">Jer 18:5-10</a>) Thus, it is not that the Great Potter, Jehovah, errs, but rather, that the human “clay” undergoes a “metamorphosis” (change of form or composition) as to its heart condition, producing regret, or a change of feeling, on Jehovah’s part.</p>
<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="sb">This is true of individuals as well as of nations, and the very fact that Jehovah God speaks of his ‘feeling regret’ over certain of his servants, such as King Saul, who turned away from righteousness, shows that God does not predestinate the future of such individuals. (See <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200001549/">FOREKNOWLEDGE, FOREORDINATION</a>.) God’s regret over Saul’s deviation does not mean that God’s choice of him as king had been erroneous and was to be regretted on that ground. God must rather have felt regret because Saul, as a free moral agent, had not made good use of the splendid privilege and opportunity <span id="page777" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="777" data-before-text="777"></span>God had afforded him, and because Saul’s change called for a change in God’s dealings with him.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:15:10-9:15:11" data-bid="159-1" class="b">1Sa 15:10, 11,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:15:26-9:15:26" data-bid="159-2" class="b"> 26</a>.</p>
<p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="sb">The prophet Samuel, in declaring God’s adverse decision regarding Saul, stated that “the Excellency of Israel will not prove false, and He will not feel regrets, for He is not an earthling man so as to feel regrets.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:15:28-9:15:29" data-bid="160-1" class="b">1Sa 15:28, 29</a>) Earthling men frequently prove untrue to their word, fail to make good their promises, or do not live up to the terms of their agreements; being imperfect, they commit errors in judgment, causing them regret. This is never the case with God.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:132:11-19:132:11" data-bid="161-1" class="b">Ps 132:11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:45:23-23:45:24" data-bid="161-2" class="b"> Isa 45:23, 24;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:55:10-23:55:11" data-bid="161-3" class="b"> 55:10, 11</a>.</p>
<p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="sb">God’s covenant made between God and “all flesh” after the Flood, for example, unconditionally guaranteed that God would never again bring a flood of waters over all the earth. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:9:8-1:9:17" data-bid="162-1" class="b">Ge 9:8-17</a>) There is, then, no possibility of God’s changing with regard to that covenant or ‘regretting it.’ Similarly, in his covenant with Abraham, God “stepped in with an oath” as “a legal guarantee” so as to “demonstrate more abundantly to the heirs of the promise the unchangeableness of his counsel,” his promise and his oath being “two unchangeable things in which it is impossible for God to lie.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:6:13-58:6:18" data-bid="163-1" class="b">Heb 6:13-18</a>) God’s sworn covenant with his Son for a priesthood like that of Melchizedek was likewise something over which God would “feel no regret.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:7:20-58:7:21" data-bid="164-1" class="b">Heb 7:20, 21;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:110:4-19:110:4" data-bid="164-2" class="b"> Ps 110:4</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:11:29-45:11:29" data-bid="165-1" class="b">Ro 11:29</a>.</p>
<p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="sb">However, in stating a promise or making a covenant, God may set out requirements, conditions to be met by those with whom the promise or covenant is made. He promised Israel that they would become his “special property” and “a kingdom of priests and a holy nation,” <em>if</em> they would strictly obey his voice and keep his covenant. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:19:5-2:19:6" data-bid="166-1" class="b">Ex 19:5, 6</a>) God held true to his side of the covenant, but Israel failed; they violated that covenant time and again. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/39:3:6-39:3:7" data-bid="167-1" class="b">Mal 3:6, 7</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:9:16-16:9:19" data-bid="168-1" class="b">Ne 9:16-19,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:9:26-16:9:31" data-bid="168-2" class="b"> 26-31</a>.) So, when God finally annulled that covenant he did so with complete justice, the responsibility for the nonfulfillment of his promise resting entirely with the offending Israelites.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:21:43-40:21:43" data-bid="169-1" class="b">Mt 21:43;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:8:7-58:8:9" data-bid="169-2" class="b"> Heb 8:7-9</a>.</p>
<p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="sb">In the same way God can “feel regret” and ‘turn back’ from carrying out some punishment when his warning of such action produces a change in attitude and conduct on the part of the offenders. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:13:17-5:13:17" data-bid="170-1" class="b">De 13:17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:90:13-19:90:13" data-bid="170-2" class="b"> Ps 90:13</a>) They have returned to him and he ‘returns’ to them. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/38:8:3-38:8:3" data-bid="171-1" class="b">Zec 8:3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/39:3:7-39:3:7" data-bid="171-2" class="b"> Mal 3:7</a>) Instead of being ‘pained,’ he now rejoices, for he finds no delight in bringing death to sinners. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:15:10-42:15:10" data-bid="172-1" class="b">Lu 15:10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:18:32-26:18:32" data-bid="172-2" class="b"> Eze 18:32</a>) While never shifting away from his righteous standards, God extends help so that persons can return to him; they are encouraged to do so. He kindly invites them to return, ‘spreading out his hands’ and saying by means of his representatives, “Turn back, please, . . . that I may not cause calamity to you,” “Do not do, please, this detestable sort of thing that I have hated.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:65:1-23:65:2" data-bid="173-1" class="b">Isa 65:1, 2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:25:5-24:25:6" data-bid="173-2" class="b"> Jer 25:5, 6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:44:4-24:44:5" data-bid="173-3" class="b"> 44:4, 5</a>) He gives ample time for change (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:9:30-16:9:30" data-bid="174-1" class="b">Ne 9:30</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:2:20-66:2:23" data-bid="175-1" class="b">Re 2:20-23</a>) and shows great patience and forbearance, since “he does not desire any to be destroyed but desires all to attain to repentance.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:3:8-61:3:9" data-bid="176-1" class="b">2Pe 3:8, 9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:2:4-45:2:5" data-bid="176-2" class="b"> Ro 2:4, 5</a>) On occasion he kindly saw to it that his message was accompanied by powerful works, or miracles, that established the divine commission of his messengers and helped strengthen faith in those hearing. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:9:32-44:9:35" data-bid="177-1" class="b">Ac 9:32-35</a>) When his message receives no response, he employs discipline; he withdraws his favor and protection, thereby allowing the unrepentant ones to undergo privations, famine, suffering of oppression from their enemies. This may bring them to their senses, may restore their proper fear of God, or may cause them to realize that their course was stupid and that their set of values was wrong.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:33:10-14:33:13" data-bid="178-1" class="b">2Ch 33:10-13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:9:28-16:9:29" data-bid="178-2" class="b"> Ne 9:28, 29;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/30:4:6-30:4:11" data-bid="178-3" class="b"> Am 4:6-11</a>.</p>
<p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="sb">However, his patience has its limits, and when these are reached he gets “tired of feeling regret”; then his decision to render punishment is unchangeable.

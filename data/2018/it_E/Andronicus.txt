ANDRONICUS
(An·dronʹi·cus) [Man-Conquering].
A faithful Jewish Christian in the congregation at Rome to whom Paul sent greetings. Paul calls Andronicus and Junias “my relatives.” While the Greek word used here (syg·ge·nesʹ) in its broader sense can mean “fellow-countrymen,” the primary meaning is “blood relatives of the same generation.” The context indicates that Andronicus likely was so related to Paul. Like Paul, Andronicus had suffered imprisonment, was now a ‘man of note’ among the apostles, and had become a Christian prior to Paul.​—Ro 16:7.

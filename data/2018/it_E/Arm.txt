ARM
A limb of the human body. The Hebrew and Greek terms for “arm” (zerohʹaʽ; bra·khiʹon) are often used figuratively in the Bible to represent the ability to exert strength or power. (Ge 49:24, ftn; Job 22:8, ftn; compare Lu 1:51.) The “arm” of Jehovah God is immeasurably powerful, able to do marvelous creative works. (Jer 27:5; 32:17) By his “arm” Jehovah also rules (Isa 40:10; Eze 20:33), saves those in distress (Ps 44:3; Isa 52:10), delivers his people (Ex 6:6; Isa 63:12; Ac 13:17), supports and cares for them (De 33:27; Isa 40:11; Ho 11:3), judges (Isa 51:5), and scatters his enemies (Ps 89:10; Lu 1:51). Breaking the arm represents shattering one’s might. (Job 38:15; Ps 10:15; Jer 48:25) Through Jesus Christ, clothed with authority and power and acting as Judge and Executioner, Jehovah manifests His might, represented by His “arm.”​—Isa 53:1; Joh 12:37, 38.
The arm of flesh, representing human power, is described in the Bible as unreliable and failing the one trusting in it. Jehovah warns his people of the fallacy and disaster of trusting in the human arm. (2Ch 32:8; Jer 17:5) He will break the arm of the wicked, which is described as resting oppressively on their victims.​—Job 35:9; 38:15; Ps 10:15.
In King Nebuchadnezzar’s dream image, the breasts and arms of silver represent Medo-Persia, the kingdom succeeding Babylon, the head of gold, as world power.​—Da 2:32, 39.

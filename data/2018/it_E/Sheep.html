I asked my man if it was usual in Greece to give names to the sheep. He informed me that it was, and that the sheep obeyed the shepherd when he called them by their names. This morning I had an opportunity of verifying the truth of this remark. Passing by a flock of sheep, I asked the shepherd the same question which I had put to my servant, and he gave me the same answer. I then bade him to call one of his sheep. He did so, and it instantly left its pasturage and its companions, and ran up to the hand of the shepherd, with signs of pleasure, and with a prompt obedience which I had never before observed in any other animal. It is also true of the sheep in this country, that <em>a stranger will they not follow, but will flee from him</em> . . . The shepherd told me, that many of his sheep are still wild; that they had not yet learned their names; but that, by teaching, they would all learn them.”​—See <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200004016/">SHEPHERD</a>.</p>

<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">The Medo-Persian World Power was depicted under the figure of a ram with two horns of unequal height. The taller horn evidently signified the ascendancy of the Persian kings.

<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb"><strong>Wild Sheep.</strong> The Hebrew word <em>teʼohʹ</em> has been variously translated “wild bull” (<em>KJ</em>), “antelope” (<em>AS</em>), and “gazelle” (<em>Ro</em>). However, <em>Lexicon in Veteris Testamenti Libros,</em> by Koehler and Baumgartner (Leiden, 1958, p. 1016), gives “wild sheep” as a possible rendering, and it is thus translated at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:14:5-5:14:5" data-bid="60-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 14:5</a> and <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:51:20-23:51:20" data-bid="61-1" class="b">Isaiah 51:20</a>.</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">Wild sheep are distinguished from domestic sheep by their outer coat, which is of coarse hair rather than wool. The variety of wild sheep that is now geographically closest to Palestine is the Armenian wild sheep (<em>Ovis gmelini</em>), found in the mountain ridges of Asia Minor and eastern Iran. The ram of this variety measures less than 0.9 m (3 ft) high at the shoulder.</p>

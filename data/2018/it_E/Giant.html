<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">The Bible gives accounts of men of extraordinary size. There was Og, king of Bashan, one of the Rephaim, whose bier was nine cubits (4 m; 13.1 ft) in length and four cubits (1.8 m; 5.8 ft) in width. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:3:11-5:3:11" data-bid="1-1" class="b">De 3:11</a>) Goliath of Gath, whom David killed, was six cubits and a span (2.9 m; 9.5 ft) in height. Indicative of Goliath’s size and strength was the weight of his armor. His copper coat of mail weighed 5,000 shekels (57 kg; 126 lb); the iron blade of his spear weighed 600 shekels (6.8 kg; 15 lb).​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:17:4-9:17:7" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1Sa 17:4-7</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Besides Og and Goliath, there were other unusually large men of the Rephaim, among them being Ishbi-benob, the weight of whose spear <span id="page929" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="929" data-before-text="929"></span>was 300 shekels of copper (3.4 kg; 7.5 lb) (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:21:16-10:21:16" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2Sa 21:16</a>); Saph, or Sippai (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:21:18-10:21:18" data-bid="4-1" class="b">2Sa 21:18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:20:4-13:20:4" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 1Ch 20:4</a>); Lahmi, Goliath’s brother, “the shaft of whose spear was like the beam of loom workers” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:20:5-13:20:5" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1Ch 20:5</a>); and a man of extraordinary size whose fingers and toes were in sixes, totaling 24 (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:21:20-10:21:20" data-bid="6-1" class="b">2Sa 21:20</a>).</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The faithless spies reported to the Israelites that in Canaan they “saw the Nephilim, the sons of Anak, who are from the Nephilim; so that we became in our own eyes like grasshoppers, and the same way we became in their eyes.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:13:33-4:13:33" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Nu 13:33</a>) These men of extraordinary size, called the sons of Anak (probably meaning “Long-Necked [that is, of tall stature]”), were not actually Nephilim, as reported, but were only unusually tall men, for the Nephilim, the offspring of angels and women (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:6:4-1:6:4" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Ge 6:4</a>), perished in the Flood.</p>

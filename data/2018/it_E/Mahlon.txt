MAHLON
(Mahʹlon) [possibly from a root meaning “grow weak; fall sick”].
Son of Elimelech and Naomi. During a famine in the days of the Judges, he moved with his parents from Bethlehem in Judah to Moab. There Mahlon married the Moabitess Ruth, but he died childless. (Ru 1:1-5; 4:10) Ruth returned to Judah with her mother-in-law and, complying with the law of levirate marriage, married Boaz. (Ru 4:9, 10; De 25:5, 6) The resulting family line produced David and led to Jesus Christ.​—Ru 4:22; Mt 1:5, 6, 16.

JOKMEAM
(Jokʹme·am) [Let the People Raise (or, Rise) Up].
1. An Ephraimite city given to the Kohathites. (1Ch 6:66, 68) At Joshua 21:22, Jokmeam is evidently called “Kibzaim,” perhaps another or earlier name for the same site. Its location is today unknown.
2. A region bordering on the territory under the jurisdiction of Ahilud’s son Baana, one of Solomon’s 12 deputies. (1Ki 4:12) It may be the same as Jokneam.

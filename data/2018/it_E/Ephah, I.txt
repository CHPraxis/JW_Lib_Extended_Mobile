EPHAH, I
(eʹphah).
A dry measure equal to ten omers (Ex 16:36) or to one tenth of a homer. The ephah corresponded to the liquid bath measure and is therefore reckoned at 22 L (20 dry qt). (Eze 45:11) In the Scriptures, “ephah” is used with reference to an amount of flour (Le 5:11), barley (Ru 2:17), roasted grain (1Sa 17:17), and wheat (Eze 45:13). The term also refers to the container used for measuring an ephah. (Le 19:36; Am 8:5) Zechariah 5:6-11 tells of an ephah measure that was covered with a circular lid of lead, in which the woman “Wickedness” was confined.

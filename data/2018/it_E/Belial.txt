BELIAL
(Beʹli·al) [from Heb., meaning “Good for Nothing”; a compound of beliʹ, “not, without,” and ya·ʽalʹ, “be of benefit; be beneficial”].
The quality or state of being useless, base, good for nothing. The Hebrew term beli·yaʹʽal is applied to ideas, words, and counsel (De 15:9; Ps 101:3; Na 1:11), to calamitous circumstances (Ps 41:8), and most frequently, to good-for-nothing men of the lowest sort​—for example, men who would induce worship of other gods (De 13:13); those of Benjamin who committed the sex crime at Gibeah (Jg 19:22-27; 20:13); the wicked sons of Eli (1Sa 2:12); insolent Nabal (1Sa 25:17, 25); opposers of God’s anointed, David (2Sa 20:1; 22:5; 23:6; Ps 18:4); Jeroboam’s worthless associates (2Ch 13:7); Jezebel’s conspirators against Naboth (1Ki 21:10, 13); and men in general who stir up contention (Pr 6:12-14; 16:27; 19:28). Indicating that the enemy power would no longer interfere with the carrying out of true worship by his people in their land, Jehovah declared through his prophet: “No more will any good-for-nothing person pass again through you. In his entirety he will certainly be cut off.”​—Na 1:15; see also 1Sa 1:16; 10:27; 30:22; Job 34:18.
By the time Bible writing resumed in the first century, “Belial” was used as a name for Satan. So when Paul wrote at 2 Corinthians 6:15 in his series of parallel contrasts, “What harmony is there between Christ and Belial?” the conclusion usually drawn is that “Belial” is Satan. The Syriac Peshitta here reads “Satan.”

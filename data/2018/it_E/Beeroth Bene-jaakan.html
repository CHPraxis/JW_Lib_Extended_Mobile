<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A place at which the Israelites camped perhaps more than once during their wanderings in the wilderness, the last time being shortly before Aaron’s death on Mount Hor. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:10:6-5:10:6" data-bid="1-1" class="b">De 10:6</a>) It is tentatively identified with el-Birein, about 62 km (38 mi) SW of Beer-sheba and near modern ʽEzuz. There are wells here, and the probable location of Kadesh-barnea is but a few miles south. Nelson Glueck comments: “There is a strikingly large number of antiquity sites in this district.” (<em>Rivers in the Desert,</em> 1960, p. 97) Beeroth Bene-jaakan is evidently referred to as simply Bene-jaakan at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:33:31-4:33:31" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Numbers 33:31</a>.​—See <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200000635/">BENE-JAAKAN</a>.</p>

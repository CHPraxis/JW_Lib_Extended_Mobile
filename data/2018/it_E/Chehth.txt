CHEHTH
[ח].
The eighth letter in the Hebrew alphabet. This letter is the harshest of the guttural sounds and is similar to the sound of “ch,” as in the Scottish word loch or the German ach. In the Hebrew, in the eighth section of Psalm 119 (vss 57-64) every verse begins with this letter.
In this work it is transliterated as ch to denote strong aspiration.

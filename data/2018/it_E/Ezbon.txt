EZBON
(Ezʹbon).
1. A son of Gad and the grandson of Jacob. (Ge 46:16) The parallel account in Numbers 26:16 lists Ozni the forefather of the Oznites instead of Ezbon, suggesting that both names apply to the same person.
2. A son of Bela and a descendant of Benjamin. Ezbon is called one of the “heads of the house of their forefathers, valiant, mighty men.”​—1Ch 7:6, 7.

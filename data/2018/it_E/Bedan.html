<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">(Beʹdan).</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><strong>1.</strong> Listed with Gideon (Jerubbaal), Jephthah, and Samuel as delivering Israel from enemies. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:12:11-9:12:11" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1Sa 12:11</a>) However, nowhere else in the Bible nor in secular history is mention made of such a Bedan. Regarding this text, C. F. Keil and F. Delitzsch remark: “It is extremely improbable that Samuel should have mentioned a judge here, who had been passed over in the book of Judges on account of his comparative insignificance.”​—<em>Commentary on the Old Testament,</em> 1973, Vol. II, 1 Samuel, p. 118.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Bedan is by some understood to refer to Barak. The context of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:12:11-9:12:11" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Samuel 12:11</a> denotes a major deliverer <span id="page275" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="275" data-before-text="275"></span>and recalls the oppression by Sisera and the deliverance that followed, a deliverance in which Jehovah used Barak. Barak is named along with Gideon and Jephthah in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:11:32-58:11:32" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Hebrews 11:32</a>. The Greek <em>Septuagint</em> and Syriac <em>Peshitta</em> read “Barak” at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:12:11-9:12:11" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 Samuel 12:11</a>. Others believe Bedan refers to Judge Abdon.​—See <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200000559/">BARAK</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><strong>2.</strong> A descendant of Manasseh.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:7:17-13:7:17" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1Ch 7:17</a>.</p>

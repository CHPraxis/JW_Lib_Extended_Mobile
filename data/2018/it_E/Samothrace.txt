SAMOTHRACE
(Samʹo·thrace) [possibly, Samos of Thrace].
A mountainous island located in the NE Aegean Sea, having a city of the same name on its N side. Likely in the spring of 50 C.E., during Paul’s second missionary journey, the ship on which he was traveling came “with a straight run” to the island of Samothrace from Troas in NW Asia Minor. There is, however, no indication that he went ashore. (Ac 16:11) The modern-day island (Samothraki) lacks a good harbor, though it offers a number of places for safe anchorage.

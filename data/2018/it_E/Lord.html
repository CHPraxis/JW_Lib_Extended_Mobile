<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><strong>Jesus Christ.</strong> While on earth, Jesus Christ referred to himself as “Lord of the sabbath.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:12:8-40:12:8" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Mt 12:8</a>) Appropriately, he used the Sabbath for <span id="page266" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="266" data-before-text="266"></span>doing the work commanded by his heavenly Father. That work included healing the sick. (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:8:16-40:8:17" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Mt 8:16, 17</a>.) Jesus knew that the Mosaic Law, with its Sabbath requirement, was “a shadow of the good things to come.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:10:1-58:10:1" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Heb 10:1</a>) In connection with those “good things to come,” there is a sabbath of which he is to be the Lord.​—See <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200003778/">SABBATH DAY</a> (“Lord of the Sabbath”).</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">While Jesus Christ was on earth, persons besides his disciples called him “Lord,” or “Sir.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:8:2-40:8:2" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Mt 8:2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:4:11-43:4:11" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> Joh 4:11</a>) In these cases the designation was primarily a title of respect or courtesy. However, to his apostles Jesus showed that calling him “Lord” involved more than this. Said he: “You address me, ‘Teacher,’ and, ‘Lord,’ and you speak rightly, for I am such.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:13:13-43:13:13" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Joh 13:13</a>) As his disciples, these apostles were his learners, or pupils. Thus he was their Lord, or Master.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Especially after Jesus’ death and resurrection did his title Lord take on great significance. By means of his sacrificial death, he purchased his followers, this making him their Owner. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:15:13-43:15:14" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Joh 15:13, 14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:7:23-46:7:23" data-bid="23-2" class="b"> 1Co 7:23;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:2:1-61:2:1" data-bid="23-3" class="b"> 2Pe 2:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/65:1:4-65:1:4" data-bid="23-4" class="b"> Jude 4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:5:9-66:5:10" data-bid="23-5" class="b"> Re 5:9, 10</a>) He was also their King and Bridegroom to whom they were subject as their Lord.

When Jehovah rewarded his Son for faithfulness to the point of dying a shameful death on a stake, he “exalted him to a superior position and kindly gave him the name that is above every other name, so that in the name of Jesus every knee should bend of those in heaven and those on earth and those under the ground, and every tongue should openly acknowledge that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:2:9-50:2:11" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Php 2:9-11</a>) Acknowledgment of Jesus Christ as Lord means more than simply calling him “Lord.” It requires that an individual recognize Jesus’ position and follow a course of obedience. (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:14:21-43:14:21" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Joh 14:21</a>.)

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Jehovah God also granted immortality to his faithful Son.

<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb"><strong>The Greek “Kyrios.”</strong> This Greek word is an adjective, signifying the possessing of power (<em>kyʹros</em>) or authority, and it is also used as a noun. It appears in each book of the Christian Greek Scriptures except Titus and the letters of John. The term corresponds to the Hebrew <em>ʼA·dhohnʹ.</em> As God’s created Son and Servant, Jesus Christ properly addresses his Father and God (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:20:17-43:20:17" data-bid="38-1" class="b">Joh 20:17</a>) as “Lord” (<em>ʼAdho·naiʹ</em> or <em>Kyʹri·os</em>), the One having superior power and authority, his Head.

<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb"><strong><em>Its use in place of the divine name.</em></strong> During the second or third century of the Common Era, the scribes substituted the words <em>Kyʹri·os</em> (Lord) and <em>The·osʹ</em> (God) for the divine name, Jehovah, in copies of the Greek <em>Septuagint</em> translation of the Hebrew Scriptures. Other translations, such as the Latin <em>Vulgate,</em> the <em>Douay Version</em> (based on the <em>Vulgate</em>), and the <em>King James Version,</em> as well as numerous modern translations (<em>NE, AT, RS, NIV, TEV, NAB</em>), followed a similar practice. The divine name was replaced by the terms “God” and “Lord,” generally in all-capital letters in English to indicate the substitution for the Tetragrammaton, or divine name.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">In departing from this practice, the translation committee of the <em>American Standard Version</em> of 1901 stated: “The American Revisers, after a careful consideration, were brought to the unanimous conviction that a Jewish superstition, which regarded the Divine Name as too sacred to be uttered, ought no longer to dominate in the English or any other version of the Old Testament, as it fortunately does not in the numerous versions made by modern missionaries. . . . This personal name [Jehovah], with its wealth of sacred associations, is now restored to the place in the sacred <span id="page267" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="267" data-before-text="267"></span>text to which it has an unquestionable claim.”​—<em>AS</em> preface, p. iv.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">A number of translations since then (<em>An, JB</em> [English and French], <em>NC, BC</em> [both in Spanish], and others) have consistently rendered the Tetragrammaton as “Yahweh” or have used a similar form.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Under the heading <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200002391/">JEHOVAH</a> (In the Christian Greek Scriptures), evidence is also presented to show that the divine name, Jehovah, was used in the original writings of the Christian Greek Scriptures, from Matthew to Revelation. On this basis, the <em>New World Translation,</em> used throughout this work, has restored the divine name in its translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures, doing so a total of 237 times. Other translations had made similar restorations, particularly when translating the Christian Greek Scriptures into Hebrew.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">When discussing “Restoring the Divine Name,” the New World Bible Translation Committee states: “To know where the divine name was replaced by the Greek words Κύριος and Θεός, we have determined where the inspired Christian writers have quoted verses, passages and expressions from the Hebrew Scriptures and then we have referred back to the Hebrew text to ascertain whether the divine name appears there. In this way we determined the identity to give <em>Kyʹri·os</em> and <em>The·osʹ</em> and the personality with which to clothe them.” Explaining further, the Committee said: “To avoid overstepping the bounds of a translator into the field of exegesis, we have been most cautious about rendering the divine name in the Christian Greek Scriptures, always carefully considering the Hebrew Scriptures as a background. We have looked for agreement from the Hebrew versions to confirm our rendering.” Such agreement from Hebrew versions exists in all the 237 places that the New World Bible Translation Committee has rendered the divine name in the body of its translation.​—<em>NW</em> appendix, pp. 1564-1566.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb"><strong>The Hebrew “Adhohn” and “Adhonai.”</strong> The Hebrew word <em>ʼa·dhohnʹ</em> occurs 334 times in the Hebrew Scriptures.

<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">The ending <em>ai</em> added to the Hebrew word <em>ʼa·dhohnʹ</em> is a different form of the plural of excellence. When <em>ʼAdho·naiʹ</em> appears without an additional suffix in Hebrew, it is used exclusively of Jehovah and indicates that he is the Sovereign Lord. According to <em>The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia</em> (1986, Vol. 3, p. 157), “the form highlights the power and sovereignty of Yahweh as ‘Lord.’” Its use by men in addressing him suggests submissive acknowledgment of that great fact.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:15:2-1:15:2" data-bid="50-1" class="b">Ge 15:2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:15:8-1:15:8" data-bid="50-2" class="b"> 8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:3:24-5:3:24" data-bid="50-3" class="b"> De 3:24;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:7:7-6:7:7" data-bid="50-4" class="b"> Jos 7:7</a>.</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">Evidently by early in the Common Era the divine name, <em>YHWH,</em> had come to be regarded by the Jewish rabbis as too sacred to be pronounced. Instead, they substituted <em>ʼAdho·naiʹ</em> (sometimes <em>ʼElo·himʹ</em>) when reading the Scriptures aloud. The Sopherim, or scribes, went even further by replacing the divine name in the written text with <em>ʼAdho·naiʹ</em> 134 times (133 in <em>Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia</em>). From about the fifth to the ninth centuries of our Common Era, the Masoretes copied the text with great care. They noted in the Masora (their notes on the text) where the Sopherim had made such changes. Hence, these 134 changes are known. (For a list see <em>NW</em> appendix, p. 1562.) Taking this into account, there remain 306 places where <em>ʼAdho·naiʹ</em> did originally appear in the text.</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">The title <em>ʼAdho·naiʹ</em> is used mostly by the prophets, and much more frequently by Ezekiel than by any other. Nearly every time, he combines it with the divine name to form <em>ʼAdho·naiʹ Yehwihʹ,</em> “Sovereign Lord Jehovah.” Another combination title, appearing 16 times, is <em>ʼAdho·naiʹ Yehwihʹ tseva·ʼohthʹ,</em> “Sovereign Lord, Jehovah of armies,” and all but two of its occurrences (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:69:6-19:69:6" data-bid="51-1" class="b">Ps 69:6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/30:9:5-30:9:5" data-bid="51-2" class="b"> Am 9:5</a>) are in Isaiah and Jeremiah. The title is used to reveal Jehovah as the one with the power and determination not only to avenge his oppressed people but also to punish them for their unfaithfulness.</p>

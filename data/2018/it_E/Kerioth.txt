KERIOTH
(Keʹri·oth) [Towns].
A place mentioned in two prophecies against Moab. (Jer 48:24; Am 2:2) The meaning of its name may indicate that the city was comprised of several smaller towns. Kerioth’s exact location is uncertain. Some scholars tentatively suggest Saliya, a site about 16 km (10 mi) ESE of Dibon and N of the Arnon. Others believe that Kerioth is perhaps the same as Ar, S of Arnon. This view seems to find some support in the fact that Ar and Kerioth, although figuring as principal cities (compare Am 2:1-3; De 2:9, 18), do not appear together in lists of Moabite towns.​—Compare Isa 15 and 16; Jer 48.
The Moabite Stone, although giving no hint as to the location of Kerioth, does indicate that the god Chemosh had a sanctuary there.

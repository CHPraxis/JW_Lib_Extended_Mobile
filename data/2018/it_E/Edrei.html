<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><strong>1.</strong> A royal city of Og, king of Bashan. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:12:4-6:12:4" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Jos 12:4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:13:12-6:13:12" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 13:12</a>) After defeating Sihon the Amorite, the Israelite forces under Moses’ direction “went up,” that is, went northward, until they encountered Og’s military force in “the battle of Edrei,” at what was apparently Bashan’s southern frontier. Though Og was the last of the giantlike Rephaim and may have presented a formidable army, the Israelites, advised by Jehovah to be fearless, wiped out Og, his sons, and people, taking possession of his territory.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:13:31-6:13:31" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Jos 13:31</a>) Edrei is generally identified with the present-day city of Derʽa about 50 km (31 mi) ESE of the southern end of the Sea of Galilee, near the Yarmuk. Ruins there include a partially excavated subterranean city, cut in the rock beneath the ground-level city.</p>

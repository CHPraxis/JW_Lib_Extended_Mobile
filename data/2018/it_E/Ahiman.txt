AHIMAN
(A·hiʹman).
1. Brother of Sheshai and Talmai. Likely Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai are to be understood as representing three families of Anakim residing in Hebron when Canaan was spied out by the Israelites in 1512 B.C.E. (Nu 13:22, 28, 33) Many years later these Anakim were dispossessed by Caleb and the conquering Judeans.​—Jos 14:10-15; 15:13, 14; Jg 1:10.
2. A Levite and one of the trusted gatekeepers of Jerusalem after the return from Babylonian exile.​—1Ch 9:17, 18.

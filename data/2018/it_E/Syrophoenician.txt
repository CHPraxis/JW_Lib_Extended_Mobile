SYROPHOENICIAN
(Sy·ro·phoe·niʹcian).
The designation applied in Mark 7:26 to a non-Israelite woman from the regions of Tyre and Sidon. Being a combination of “Syrian” and “Phoenician,” the expression “Syrophoenician” probably had its origin in the circumstance that Phoenicia was part of the Roman province of Syria. The Syrophoenician woman is also called Kha·na·naiʹa (literally, Canaanite; translated “Phoenician” in NW), for the early inhabitants of Phoenicia descended from Canaan, and in time, “Canaan” came to refer primarily to Phoenicia. (Mt 15:22, ftn) Her being termed “Grecian” likely means that she was of Greek descent.​—Mr 7:26.
Not long after Passover of 32 C.E., this Syrophoenician woman approached Jesus Christ, repeatedly requesting that he expel a demon from her daughter. At first Jesus declined, saying: “It is not right to take the bread of the children and throw it to little dogs.” To the Jews dogs were unclean animals. But, in likening the non-Jews to “little dogs,” which might be kept in a home, and not to wild dogs of the street, Jesus softened the comparison. Nevertheless, what Jesus said apparently served to test the woman. Humbly, she acknowledged: “Yes, Lord; but really the little dogs do eat of the crumbs falling from the table of their masters.” Her words reflected great faith, and therefore, her daughter was healed.​—Mt 15:21-28; Mr 7:24-30.

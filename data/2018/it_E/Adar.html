<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">By a royal decree of King Ahasuerus of Persia the 13th day of Adar was to mark the destruction of all the Jews in the jurisdictional districts of his domain, this at the instigation of his prime minister, Haman. A new decree, issued through Queen Esther’s mediation, enabled the Jews to gain a victory over their would-be assassins, and thereafter Mordecai ordered the 14th and 15th days of Adar to be celebrated in commemoration of their deliverance.

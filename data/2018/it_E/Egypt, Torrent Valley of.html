<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A long wadi (or ravine) marking the God-ordained SW boundary of the Promised Land, that is, “the land of Canaan.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:34:2-4:34:2" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Nu 34:2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:34:5-4:34:5" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:8:65-11:8:65" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> 1Ki 8:65;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:27:12-23:27:12" data-bid="1-4" class="b"> Isa 27:12</a>) While this torrent valley was not actually in Egypt, that nation’s domain apparently extended, at least in <span id="page700" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="700" data-before-text="700"></span>certain periods, up to that point. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:24:7-12:24:7" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2Ki 24:7</a>) The abbreviated expression “the torrent valley,” used in defining the borders of the land of Israel in Ezekiel’s vision, apparently refers to this same ravine.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:47:19-26:47:19" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Eze 47:19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:48:28-26:48:28" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 48:28</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The torrent valley of Egypt is usually identified with Wadi el-ʽArish, which starts over 200 km (125 mi) inland on the Sinai Peninsula, near Jebel et-Tih. It runs N until meeting the Mediterranean Sea at the town of el-ʽArish (Rhinocolura), about 150 km (90 mi) E of Port Said. In the summer it is nothing more than a dry bed. During the rainy season, however, when numerous tributaries pour into it, the Wadi el-ʽArish becomes a swollen torrent that tears at its banks, even uprooting trees and sweeping them down its turbulent course. This might allow for its identification as “the <em>river</em> of Egypt” in the boundary listing of the Promised Land at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:15:18-1:15:18" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Genesis 15:18</a>.​—See, however, <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200004032/">SHIHOR</a>.</p>

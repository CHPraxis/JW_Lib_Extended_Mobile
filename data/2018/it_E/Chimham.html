<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">(Chimʹham) [Grown Faint [with longing]].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Presumably a son of Barzillai. When the aged Barzillai declined the invitation to become part of King David’s court and recommended that Chimham go in his place, David replied: “With me Chimham will go across [the Jordan], and I myself shall do to him what is good in your eyes; and all that you may choose to lay upon me I shall do for you.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:19:33-10:19:33" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2Sa 19:33,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:19:37-10:19:40" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 37-40</a>) Apparently Chimham remained in the royal court, as is indicated by David’s final instructions to Solomon. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:2:7-11:2:7" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1Ki 2:7</a>) Reference is made at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:41:17-24:41:17" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Jeremiah 41:17</a> to “the lodging <span id="page437" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="437" data-before-text="437"></span>place of Chimham” near Bethlehem. It is not known whether this refers to the Chimham of David’s time or to a later man by the same name. Some commentators say that Chimham may have been given a tract of land for his services to David, or that it was a place where Chimham had built a lodging place for travelers.</p>

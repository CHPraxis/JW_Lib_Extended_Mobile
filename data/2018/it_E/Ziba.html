<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">(Ziʹba).</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The servant of Saul’s household from whom David, on inquiry, learned of Jonathan’s lame son Mephibosheth. David brought Mephibosheth to Jerusalem and assigned Ziba, his 15 sons, and his 20 servants to care for Mephibosheth’s inheritance. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:9:2-10:9:12" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2Sa 9:2-12</a> [The reference to “my table” in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:9:11-10:9:11" data-bid="2-1" class="b">verse 11</a> is generally thought to be a scribal error for “David’s table”; another possibility is that Ziba may have been <em>repeating</em> David’s exact words.]) When David fled from Jerusalem on account of Absalom’s rebellion, Ziba brought him much needed supplies of food and animals. However, he left Mephibosheth behind, even though he wanted to come, and told David that Mephibosheth deliberately stayed in Jerusalem, expecting to recover the kingdom for Saul’s house. In response, without further investigation of the matter David transferred Mephibosheth’s property to Ziba.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:16:1-10:16:4" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2Sa 16:1-4</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">When David returned after the rebellion was crushed, Ziba was among the early ones to greet the king. Then Mephibosheth met David, welcomed him back, and informed him of Ziba’s trickery and slander. In the light of these new developments, David now decided that the property should be divided between Mephibosheth and Ziba. Mephibosheth, however, declared: “Let him [Ziba] even take the whole, now that my lord the king has come in peace to his house.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:19:17-10:19:17" data-bid="4-1" class="b">2Sa 19:17,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:19:24-10:19:30" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 24-30</a>.</p>

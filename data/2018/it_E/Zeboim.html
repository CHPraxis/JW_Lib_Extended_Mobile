<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><strong>1.</strong> A valley in the territory of Benjamin, near Michmash. In King Saul’s day, a band of Philistine pillagers would sally forth from Michmash and “turn to the road to the boundary that looks toward the valley of Zeboim, toward the wilderness.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:13:16-9:13:18" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1Sa 13:16-18</a>) Though there is uncertainty about its location, the valley of Zeboim may be the Wadi Abu Dabaʽ (meaning, “Valley of the Father of Hyenas”) about 10 km (6 mi) ESE of Michmash and about 13 km (8 mi) ENE of Jerusalem.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><strong>2.</strong> A town inhabited by Benjamites after their return from Babylonian exile. It is mentioned between Hadid and Neballat and with Lod (Lydda).

PISTACHIO NUT
[Heb., bot·nahʹ].
The fruit of the Pistacia vera tree. This deciduous tree thrives in dry areas and seldom reaches a height in excess of 9 m (30 ft). The nuts measure 1.5 to 2 cm (0.6 to 0.8 in.) in length and grow in large clusters. The thin, but hard, light-colored shell of ripe pistachio nuts is covered with a somewhat wrinkly husk. Each nut contains one yellow-green kernel surrounded by thin reddish skin. The kernel has a mild, sweet flavor and is commonly eaten raw or fried. Sometimes kernels are pressed for oil, and ground kernels are used for confectionery items.
Pistachio nuts were among “the finest products of the land” of Canaan that were brought as a gift by Jacob’s sons to one who was a ruler in Egypt. (Ge 43:11) Even in modern times large quantities of pistachio nuts have been exported from parts of the Middle East.
The city of Betonim, situated E of the Jordan in the territory of Gad, appears to have been named after pistachio nuts.​—Jos 13:24, 26.

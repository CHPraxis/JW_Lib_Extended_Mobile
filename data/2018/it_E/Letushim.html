<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">(Le·tuʹshim) [possibly from a root meaning “sharpen; hammer; forge”].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A name appearing among the descendants of Abraham and Keturah through Dedan. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:25:3-1:25:3" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ge 25:3</a>) This name has the plural Hebrew ending <em>im,</em> as do the names Asshurim and Leummim appearing in the same text. Because of this, many scholars believe that a tribe or people is meant. In view of their relationship to Dedan, this tribe likely located in the Arabian Peninsula, but precise identification is impossible.​—See <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200003094/">MIZRAIM</a>.</p>

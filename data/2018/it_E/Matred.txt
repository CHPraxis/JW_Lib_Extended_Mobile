MATRED
(Maʹtred) [from a root that means “drive [one] away”].
Mother of Mehetabel, the wife of Edomite King Hadar (Hadad). (Ge 36:31, 39; 1Ch 1:50) At Genesis 36:39 the Syriac Peshitta and the Greek Septuagint present Matred as the son of Mezahab, but according to the Masoretic text, Matred was Mezahab’s daughter.

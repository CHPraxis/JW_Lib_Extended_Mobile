SCARECROW
An object such as a pole or pile of stones, usually in a form suggesting a human figure, arranged in a field in such a way as to frighten away birds or other animals. Jeremiah likened the idols of the nations to “a scarecrow [Heb., toʹmer] of a cucumber field.” (Jer 10:5) The word toʹmer is elsewhere rendered “palm tree.” (Jg 4:5) Truly the idols of the nations amounted to no more than a scarecrow, a falsity.​—AT, Mo, NE, NW, RS.

ESHAN
(Eʹshan) [possibly, One Supporting Himself [On]].
A city in the mountainous region of Judah. (Jos 15:20, 48, 52) Though its exact location is unknown, the Greek Septuagint (Vatican MS. 1209) rendering of “Soma” has led some scholars to identify it with Khirbet Samʽa (Horvat ʼesh-Shamʽah), about 15 km (9 mi) SSW of Jerusalem.

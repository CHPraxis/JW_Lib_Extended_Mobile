KENATH
(Keʹnath).
A site E of the Jordan captured by Nobah, probably a Manassite, who thereafter called it by his own name. (Nu 32:42) But the designation “Nobah” perhaps did not stick, for later “Kenath” is reported to have been taken by Geshur and Syria. (1Ch 2:23) Later renamed Canatha, it was one of the original ten cities of the Decapolis. Kenath is identified with the ruins at Qanawat, about 90 km (60 mi) SSE of Damascus and 7 km (4.5 mi) NW of modern Soueida.

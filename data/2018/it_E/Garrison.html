<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">The Hebrew term <em>netsivʹ</em> may denote a rather permanent contingent of soldiers stationed at a military installation. The related Hebrew word <em>mats·tsavʹ</em> (outpost) carries a similar idea.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:13:23-9:13:23" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1Sa 13:23;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:14:1-9:14:1" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 14:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:14:4-9:14:4" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> 4,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:14:6-9:14:6" data-bid="1-4" class="b"> 6,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:14:11-9:14:12" data-bid="1-5" class="b"> 11, 12,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:14:15-9:14:15" data-bid="1-6" class="b"> 15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:23:14-10:23:14" data-bid="1-7" class="b"> 2Sa 23:14</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The Philistines had garrisons in Israelite territory during the reigns of Saul and David. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:10:5-9:10:5" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1Sa 10:5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:13:3-9:13:4" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 13:3, 4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:11:16-13:11:16" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> 1Ch 11:16</a>) After David defeated Syria and Edom, he maintained garrisons in their territory to prevent rebellion. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:8:6-10:8:6" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2Sa 8:6,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:8:14-10:8:14" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:18:13-13:18:13" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> 1Ch 18:13</a>) For the peace and security of the land, Jehoshaphat installed garrisons in Judah and in the cities of Ephraim that Asa had captured. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:17:1-14:17:2" data-bid="4-1" class="b">2Ch 17:1, 2</a>) The presence of such a military body did much to maintain order and protect royal interests in territories where the native inhabitants were likely to rebel.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">A Roman garrison was maintained at Jerusalem during the first century C.E. Their quarters were in the high Tower of Antonia adjoining the temple grounds. When a crowd of Jews dragged Paul outside the temple and sought to kill him, soldiers of the garrison were able to come down quickly enough to rescue him. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:21:31-44:21:32" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ac 21:31, 32</a>) During Jewish festival seasons, extra troops were brought in to strengthen this garrison.​—See <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200000295/">ANTONIA, TOWER OF</a>.</p>

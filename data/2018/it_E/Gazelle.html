<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Any of a variety of swift and graceful small antelope. The <em>Gazella dorcas,</em> encountered in Arabia, Egypt, Palestine, and Syria, likely was familiar to the ancient Hebrews. This animal is about 1 m (3.5 ft) long and stands approximately 0.6 m (2 ft) high at the shoulder. Both male and female have lyre-shaped, ringed horns that may measure as much as 0.3 m (1 ft) in length. The general coloration of this gazelle is pale fawn, with dark and light stripes on the face and with white underparts and hindquarters. The hair is short and smooth. Another variety of gazelle <span id="page902" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="902" data-before-text="902"></span>with which the Israelites may have been acquainted is the somewhat larger, darker, fawn-colored <em>Gazella arabica.</em>​—PICTURE, Vol. 2, p. 955.</p>

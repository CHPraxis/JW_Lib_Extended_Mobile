RECHAB
(Reʹchab) [Charioteer].
1. A Benjamite son of Rimmon the Beerothite. Rechab and his brother Baanah, both captains of marauding bands, murdered Ish-bosheth, the son and successor of Saul, and presented his head to David, expecting to win favor, but David had them both executed for their wicked deed against a righteous man.​—2Sa 4:2, 5-12.
2. A Kenite father or ancestor of Jehu’s companion Jehonadab and forefather of the Rechabites.​—1Ch 2:55; 2Ki 10:15, 23; Jer 35:6, 8, 14, 16, 18, 19; see RECHABITES.
3. Father or ancestor of the Malchijah who helped Nehemiah repair a gate of Jerusalem’s wall. (Ne 3:14) If he is the same Rechab as No. 2, Malchijah’s presence confirms the fulfillment of Jehovah’s promise to the Rechabites as found at Jeremiah 35:19.

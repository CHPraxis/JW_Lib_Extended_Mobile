<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">In Greek, <em>pan·do·kheiʹon,</em> literally meaning “a place where all are received or taken in,” that is, where travelers could find accommodations for themselves and their animals. Perhaps ancient Middle Eastern inns resembled those built there in more recent times. These commonly consist of a walled square with only one entrance. Along the walls on a raised platform there are unfurnished rooms for sheltering travelers and goods, entrance being gained from the inner courtyard. The animals are left in the large court, which often has a centrally situated well. Innkeepers of ancient times furnished a few necessary provisions to travelers and cared for persons left in their charge, receiving compensation for their services.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:10:33-42:10:35" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Lu 10:33-35</a>.</p>

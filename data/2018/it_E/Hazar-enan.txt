HAZAR-ENAN
(Haʹzar-eʹnan), Hazar-enon (Haʹzar-eʹnon) [Courtyard (Settlement) of the Fountain (Spring)].
A site on the northern boundary of “the land of Canaan.” (Nu 34:2, 7-10) Ezekiel referred to Hazar-enon (Hazar-enan), along with Damascus and Hamath, in his forevision of the territory of Israel. (Eze 47:13, 17; 48:1) A positive identification of the site cannot be made at this time. However, most scholars tentatively locate it at Qaryatein, about 120 km (75 mi) NE of Damascus on the road to Palmyra.

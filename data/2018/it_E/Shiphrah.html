<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The Greek <em>Septuagint</em> reads Sepphora in both <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:1:15-2:1:15" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Exodus 1:15</a> and <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:2:21-2:2:21" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2:21</a>; the Masoretic text, however, reads Shiphrah and Zipporah respectively. The Aramaic form of the name is Sapphira.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Shiphrah was one of the Hebrew midwives who, together with Puah, was commanded by Pharaoh to kill all the Hebrew male babies immediately at birth. Being a God-fearing woman, however, and having respect for the sanctity of human life (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:9:6-1:9:6" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ge 9:6</a>), she preserved the boy babies alive and was blessed by Jehovah with a family of her own.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:1:15-2:1:21" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ex 1:15-21</a>; see <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200003042/">MIDWIFE</a>.</p>

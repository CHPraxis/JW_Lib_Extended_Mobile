KENAN
(Keʹnan) [from a root meaning “produce; acquire; buy”].
The son of Enosh, grandson of Seth, and great-grandson of Adam. He was the father of Mahalalel and lived 910 years. (Ge 5:3-14; 1Ch 1:1, 2) Kenan is evidently referred to as “Cainan, son of Enosh,” in Luke’s listing of Jesus’ genealogy.​—Lu 3:37, 38.

UZ
1. A son of Aram and great-grandson of Noah through Shem.​—Ge 10:22, 23; 1Ch 1:17.
2. Firstborn son of Nahor and Milcah; nephew of Abraham.​—Ge 22:20, 21.
3. Son of Dishan and descendant of Seir the Horite.​—Ge 36:20, 21, 28.
4. Homeland of Job (Job 1:1), settled by Uz, but it cannot be stated with certainty whether that Uz was Aram’s son or Nahor’s son. (Ge 10:22, 23; 22:20, 21) Its exact location is unknown. Uz seemingly was near Edom, allowing for a later extension of Edomite domain into Uz, or for some later Edomites to be dwelling in the “land of Uz,” as is indicated at Lamentations 4:21. Jeremiah was commissioned to pass the cup of God’s wrath to “all the kings of the land of Uz,” and the immediate context includes references to Philistia, Edom, Moab, and Ammon. (Jer 25:15, 17, 20, 21) Job’s homeland was vulnerable to attack by Sabeans (from the S) and Chaldeans (from the E). (Job 1:15, 17) Taken together, these factors would indicate a location E of the Promised Land and near Edom, somewhere in N Arabia.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A unit for measuring the depth of water. The fathom is commonly viewed as being four cubits (c. 1.8 m; 6 ft) and approximately corresponds to the distance between the fingertips of a man’s two hands when his arms are stretched in opposite directions. Appropriately, the Greek word for “fathom” (<em>or·gui·aʹ</em>) comes from a root meaning “stretch out; reach.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:27:28-44:27:28" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ac 27:28</a>, ftn.</p>

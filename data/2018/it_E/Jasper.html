<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Modern jasper is an opaque variety of quartz containing an admixture of iron oxide. Its colors, often arranged in layers, are white, red, yellow, brown, or black. Jasper is harder than glass and is found in metamorphic rocks in mass or as distinct crystals. The best grades are used for gemstones and can be highly polished. Some scholars, however, believe that, since the jasper (Gr., <em>iʹa·spis</em>) at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:11-66:21:11" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Revelation 21:11</a> is called “a most precious stone . . . shining crystal-clear,” the ancient stone may have been of greater rarity and value than the comparatively inexpensive modern jasper, and brilliantly translucent rather than opaque. Some scholars have suggested that the Greek term in reality refers to the diamond.</p>

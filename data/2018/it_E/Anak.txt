ANAK
(Aʹnak) [probably, Long-Necked [that is, of tall stature]].
The name applied to a tribe of unusually tall men and perhaps to their progenitor. At Numbers 13:22 and 28 the article is used with the name in Hebrew (ha·ʽAnaqʹ). If it is the personal name of the son of “Arba . . . the father of Anak” (Jos 15:13), the name thereafter was also applied to his progeny. (Compare Jos 15:14 with 14:15, where Arba is called “the great man among the Anakim.”)​—See ANAKIM.

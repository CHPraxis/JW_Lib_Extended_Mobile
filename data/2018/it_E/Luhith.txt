LUHITH
(Luʹhith) [from a root meaning “tablet; plank”].
A place mentioned in prophecies of doom against Moab. (Isa 15:1, 5; Jer 48:5) Some scholars believe that Luhith was a Moabite city located at the top of an ascent. Identified by Eusebius and Jerome with a place called Loueitha, Luhith has been linked with either Rujm Madinat er Ras, about 20 km (12 mi) SW of Karak, or nearby Khirbet Fas. Another view is that Luhith was not a city but merely the name of the ascent or slope to be used by the fleeing and weeping Moabite refugees.​—Compare Nu 34:4.

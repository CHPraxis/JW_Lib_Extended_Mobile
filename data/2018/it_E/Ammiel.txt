AMMIEL
(Amʹmi·el) [People of God].
1. Son of Gemalli of the tribe of Dan. One of 12 sent out by Moses to spy out the land of Canaan. (Nu 13:12) He was among the ten spies who gave a bad report of the Promised Land; he died by the scourge from Jehovah.​—Nu 14:36, 37.
2. Father of Machir of Lo-debar, E of the Jordan. It was in the house of Machir that Mephibosheth, son of Jonathan, was lodging when David desired to extend loving-kindness to him.​—2Sa 9:4, 5, 7; 17:27.
3. Father of Bath-sheba, Uriah’s wife later taken by David. (1Ch 3:5) At 2 Samuel 11:3, he is called Eliam, which is simply a transposition of the components of the name Ammiel and means “God of the People.” He was possibly the son of Ahithophel, the Gilonite, who was David’s counselor but who turned traitor.​—2Sa 23:34; 15:31.
4. A Levite, the sixth son of Obed-edom. He was a gatekeeper who shared responsibility for the storehouses of the house of Jehovah during David’s time.​—1Ch 26:4, 5, 12-15.

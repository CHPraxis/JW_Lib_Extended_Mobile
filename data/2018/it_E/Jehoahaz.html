<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><strong>1.</strong> Variant spelling of the name of Ahaziah, who succeeded his father Jehoram as king of Judah in the late tenth century B.C.E.

<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><strong>2.</strong> Son and successor of King Jehu as king of Israel. For 17 years Jehoahaz reigned, from 876 to about 860 B.C.E.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:10:32-12:10:34" data-bid="5-1" class="b">2Ki 10:32-34</a>) And because Jehoahaz did what was bad in Jehovah’s eyes, God allowed Hazael to continue to oppress Israel all the days of Jehoahaz, reducing his fighting force to a mere 50 horsemen, 10 chariots, and 10,000 foot soldiers. Finally, Jehoahaz sought Jehovah’s favor, and because of the covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, Jehovah did not allow Syria to bring Israel completely to ruin.

<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><strong>3.</strong> Son and successor of Josiah as king of Judah. His mother’s name was Hamutal. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:23:31-12:23:31" data-bid="9-1" class="b">2Ki 23:31</a>) Ezra and Jeremiah, according to certain manuscripts, call him Shallum, which some suggest may have been his name prior to his accession to the throne.

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Jehoahaz was 23 years old when made king, and he ruled badly for three months in the early part of the year 628 B.C.E., until he was imprisoned at Riblah by Pharaoh.

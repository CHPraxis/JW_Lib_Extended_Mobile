TOB
A “land” to which Jephthah fled from his half brothers. In Tob he gathered a force of men before his half brothers asked him to be their commander in fighting against the Ammonites. (Jg 11:3-11) There is possibly another Biblical reference to Tob if the name Ishtob is rather to be translated “men of Tob” at 2 Samuel 10:6-8. (See AS, JP, RS, NW ftn.) Tob’s location is not definitely known. However, it is often identified with the region centering around Taiyiba, about 60 km (37 mi) ESE of the Sea of Galilee.

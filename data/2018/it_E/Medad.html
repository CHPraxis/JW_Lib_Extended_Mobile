<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">One of the 70 older men of Israel selected to assist Moses during the wilderness trek. While Medad and Eldad had not gone to the tent of meeting with the others, “they were among those written down.” Hence, when Jehovah took away some of the spirit that was upon Moses, putting it upon each of the 70 older men, these too received it and began acting as prophets in the camp.

No, I wish that all of Jehovah’s people were prophets, because Jehovah would put his spirit upon them!”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:11:27-4:11:29" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Nu 11:27-29</a>.</p>

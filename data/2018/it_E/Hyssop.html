<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">[Heb., <em>ʼe·zohvʹ;</em> Gr., <em>hysʹso·pos</em>].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The exact identification of hyssop is uncertain. The Hebrew and Greek terms may, in fact, embrace several different kinds of plants.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Some modern scholars say that the hyssop of the Hebrew Scriptures is probably marjoram (<em>Origanum maru</em>). This plant of the mint family is common in Palestine. Under favorable conditions it attains a height of 0.5 to 0.9 m (1.5 to 3 ft). Its branches and thick leaves are hairy, and as indicated at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:4:33-11:4:33" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Kings 4:33</a>, it can be found growing in rock crevices and on walls.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Hyssop was used by the Israelites in Egypt to splash the blood of the Passover victim on the two doorposts and the upper part of the doorway of their houses. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:12:21-2:12:22" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ex 12:21, 22</a>) At the inauguration of the Law covenant, Moses employed hyssop in sprinkling the book of the Law and the people. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:9:19-58:9:19" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Heb 9:19</a>) Hyssop also figured in the cleansing ceremony for persons or houses previously infected with leprosy (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:14:2-3:14:7" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Le 14:2-7,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:14:48-3:14:53" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 48-53</a>; see <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200000990/">CLEAN, CLEANNESS</a> [Leprosy]) and in the preparation of the ashes to be used in “the water for cleansing,” as well as in the spattering of this water on certain things and persons. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:19:6-4:19:6" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Nu 19:6,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:19:9-4:19:9" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 9,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:19:18-4:19:18" data-bid="5-3" class="b"> 18</a>) David thus appropriately prayed to be purified from sin with hyssop.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:51:7-19:51:7" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ps 51:7</a>.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">The hyssop mentioned in connection with Jesus Christ’s impalement (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:19:29-43:19:29" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Joh 19:29</a>) is thought by some to refer to durra, or Indian millet, a variety of common sorghum (<em>Sorghum vulgare</em>). It is a tall, small-grained plant with long, broad leaves. Since this plant commonly attains a height of at least 1.8 m (6 ft) in Palestine, it could have provided a stalk, or “reed,” of sufficient length to convey the sponge of sour wine to Jesus’ mouth. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:27:48-40:27:48" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Mt 27:48;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:15:36-41:15:36" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> Mr 15:36</a>) Others think that even in this case hyssop may be marjoram and suggest that a bunch of marjoram may have been attached to the “reed” mentioned by Matthew and Mark. Still another view is that <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:19:29-43:19:29" data-bid="9-1" class="b">John 19:29</a> originally read <em>hys·soiʹ</em> (pike, javelin), not <em>hys·soʹpoi</em> (hyssop); hence the renderings “on a pike” (<em>AT</em>) and “on a spear” (<em>Mo</em>).</p>

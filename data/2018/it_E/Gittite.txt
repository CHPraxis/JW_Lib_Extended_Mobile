GITTITE
(Gitʹtite) [Of (Belonging to) Gath].
A term often applied to an inhabitant or native of the Philistine city of Gath. (Jos 13:2, 3) Giant Goliath was a Gittite. (2Sa 21:19; 1Ch 20:5) Gittites, including Ittai (called “a foreigner” and “an exile” from his home), faithfully stuck with David during his flight at the time of Absalom’s rebellion.​—2Sa 15:13, 18-22; 18:2; see GATH; ITTAI No. 1.
The term “Gittite,” however, is also applied to Obed-edom, in whose home the ark of the covenant temporarily rested. (2Sa 6:10, 11; 1Ch 13:13) Some scholars believe he similarly was from Philistine Gath. It seems more likely, however, that Obed-edom was a Levite and may have been called a Gittite because he came from the Levite city of Gath-rimmon.​—Jos 21:20, 23, 24; see OBED-EDOM No. 1.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">The Hebrew word <em>mena·ʽan·ʽimʹ</em> (sistrums) occurs but once in Scripture and seems to be derived from a root meaning “quiver,” that is, move back and forth. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:6:5-10:6:5" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2Sa 6:5</a>) Since the sistrum is characteristically played in this manner, being, as it were, a musical rattle, many lexicographers and music historians favor this rendering, one that has also been adopted by a number of Bible translators.​—<em>Da; NW; Ro; Vg.</em></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The sistrum generally consisted of a small oval metal frame attached to a handle. The complete <span id="page976" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="976" data-before-text="976"></span>instrument varied from about 20 to 46 cm (8 to 18 in.) in length, according to extant ancient specimens as well as Egyptian and other monumental representations. The frame loosely held a small number of metal crossbars that, when shaken, produced sharp, ringing sounds. The horizontal bars may have been of differing lengths so as to produce a series of tones. Another type of sistrum was equipped with rings on the bars, and these rings jingled when agitated. Although its single Biblical appearance is in the description of a great celebration, traditional Jewish sources state that the sistrum was played on sad occasions as well.</p>

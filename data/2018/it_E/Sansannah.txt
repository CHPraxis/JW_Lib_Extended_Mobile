SANSANNAH
(San·sanʹnah) [possibly, Fruit Stalk of Dates].
A town in the southern portion of the territory of the tribe of Judah. (Jos 15:21, 31) It is identified with Khirbet esh-Shamsaniyat (Horvat Sansanna), about 12 km (7.5 mi) NNE of Beer-sheba. A comparison of Joshua 15:31 with parallel lists of cities at Joshua 19:5 and 1 Chronicles 4:31 indicates that it may be the same as Hazar-susah (or Hazar-susim).​—See HAZAR-SUSAH.

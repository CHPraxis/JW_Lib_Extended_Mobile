<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">(To·biʹah) [Good Is Jah].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><strong>1.</strong> Forefather of some returned exiles who were unable to establish their Israelite genealogy.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/15:2:1-15:2:1" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ezr 2:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/15:2:59-15:2:60" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 59, 60;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:7:61-16:7:62" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> Ne 7:61, 62</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><strong>2.</strong> An opponent of Nehemiah. Tobiah was “the servant,” likely some official under the Persian king. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:2:19-16:2:19" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ne 2:19</a>) Both he and his son Jehohanan married Jewish women, and Tobiah was also related to High Priest Eliashib. This put Tobiah in a position of advantage for undermining Nehemiah’s authority, in that many Jews looked up to and spoke highly of Tobiah.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:6:17-16:6:19" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ne 6:17-19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:13:4-16:13:4" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 13:4</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">When Nehemiah arrived in Jerusalem, Tobiah and his associates were displeased with Israel’s brightening prospect. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:2:9-16:2:10" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ne 2:9, 10</a>) At first they merely derided and mocked the Jews (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:2:19-16:2:19" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ne 2:19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:4:3-16:4:3" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 4:3</a>), but when the wall rebuilding made progress, they became very angry. However, various conspiracies​—to kill off the Jews (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:4:7-16:4:9" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ne 4:7-9,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:4:11-16:4:11" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 11,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:4:14-16:4:15" data-bid="6-3" class="b"> 14, 15</a>), and an attempt to get Nehemiah to violate the sanctity of the temple (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:6:1-16:6:1" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ne 6:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:6:10-16:6:13" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 10-13</a>)—​all failed. Even after the walls were completed, Tobiah, through correspondence with his sympathizers in Jerusalem, attempted to intimidate Nehemiah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:6:16-16:6:19" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Ne 6:16-19</a>) Properly, therefore, Nehemiah asked Jehovah to remember the many wicked deeds of Tobiah and his confederates. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:6:14-16:6:14" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ne 6:14</a>) On Nehemiah’s second arrival from Babylon, when he found a dining room in the temple court reserved for Tobiah, he promptly threw Tobiah’s things out.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:13:4-16:13:9" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ne 13:4-9</a>.</p>

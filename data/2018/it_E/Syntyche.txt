SYNTYCHE
(Synʹty·che) [With Fortune (Success)].
A Christian woman at Philippi whom Paul commended for her integrity and whom he exhorted to “be of the same mind in the Lord” with a Christian sister named Euodia. (Php 4:2, 3) The apostle gave this counsel apparently because of some disagreement between these two, a conclusion supported by several modern translations.​—AB, JB, NE, Ph, TEV.

APRON
The Greek word si·mi·kinʹthi·on denotes a thing girded around half the body, a half-girding and a narrow covering. (Ac 19:12) It seems to have been tied around the waist to cover part of the body for a distance below the waist. It may have been worn to protect other garments, perhaps by tradesmen such as fishermen, potters, water carriers, grocers, bakers, and carpenters. The ephod of the priests was considerably different, being an apronlike garment that hung from the shoulders, having front and back sections.​—Ex 28:6-8; see HIGH PRIEST.
The Greek word translated “put on an apron” in Luke 17:8 (pe·ri·zonʹny·mai) literally means “gird oneself about.”​—Compare Eph 6:14.

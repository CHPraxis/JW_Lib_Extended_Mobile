SHEVA
(Sheʹva).
1. [from a root meaning “make equal; smooth out”]. Father of Machbenah and Gibea. As these are possibly names of towns, however, Sheva was perhaps the father of those who settled there or was himself the founder of these towns. Sheva’s father Caleb (Chelubai) headed one of the three major divisions of Judah’s descendants through Hezron.​—1Ch 2:9, 48-50.
2. David’s secretary.​—2Sa 20:25; see SERAIAH No. 2.

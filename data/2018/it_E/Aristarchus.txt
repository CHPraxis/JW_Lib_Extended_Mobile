ARISTARCHUS
(Ar·is·tarʹchus) [Best (Noblest) Ruler].
One of Paul’s close associates, a traveling companion and fellow prisoner, a Macedonian from Thessalonica. (Ac 20:4; 27:2) He is introduced in the account of Paul’s third missionary journey; at the height of the Ephesian riot Aristarchus and Gaius were forcibly dragged into the theater. (Ac 19:29) He could have been “the brother” who assisted Paul with the contribution for the Judeans that was collected in Macedonia and Greece.​—2Co 8:18-20.
Aristarchus accompanied Paul on the voyage to Rome, but how he secured passage is uncertain, perhaps as a slave for Paul. (Ac 27:2) While in Rome he further assisted and encouraged Paul and for a time shared his prison bonds. Greetings from Aristarchus are conveyed in Paul’s letters to the Colossians (4:10) and Philemon (23, 24).

MAON
(Maʹon).
1. A descendant of Caleb through Shammai. Maon may have been the father of Beth-zur’s inhabitants or the principal man or founder of that city.​—1Ch 2:42, 45.
2. A city in the mountainous region of Judah. (Jos 15:20, 48, 55) Israel’s King Saul pursued David and his men into the wilderness area surrounding Maon. But news of a Philistine raid forced Saul to abandon the chase. (1Sa 23:24-28) Later, David’s men were treated inhospitably by Nabal, a rich landowner apparently residing at Maon. (1Sa 25:2-11) This city is identified with Tell Maʽin (Horvat Maʽon [Bi-Yehuda]) atop a high hill about 13 km (8 mi) SSE of Hebron.

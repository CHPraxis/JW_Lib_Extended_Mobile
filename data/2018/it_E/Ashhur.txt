ASHHUR
(Ashʹhur) [possibly, Blackness].
According to the Masoretic text, the son of Hezron, born after his father’s death; the great-grandson of Judah. (1Ch 2:4, 5, 24; see HEZRON No. 2.) By his two wives he fathered seven sons. (1Ch 4:5-7) He is also said to be the father of Tekoa, which appears to mean that he was the founder of the town by that name.

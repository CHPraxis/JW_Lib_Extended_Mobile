NAPHTUHIM
(Naph·tuʹhim).
Listed as among the descendants of Mizraim, the son of Ham. (Ge 10:6, 13, 14; 1Ch 1:11, 12) As with the other names in this list, scholars usually take the apparent plural form to indicate a tribe or people. Assuming the name to derive from some geographic relationship, scholars often associate Naphtuhim with an Egyptian phrase meaning “those of the Delta,” and on this basis the Naphtuhim are included among the inhabitants of Lower (northern) Egypt. The correctness of these views is not as yet conclusive.

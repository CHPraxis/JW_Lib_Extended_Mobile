KEZIAH
(Ke·ziʹah) [possibly, Cassia].
The second of the three daughters of Job born after his severe trial and subsequent restoration and blessing by Jehovah. (Job 42:14) The Hebrew word for “cassia” was used as a feminine name, likely because of the fragrance of cassia, and may have been given to this girl as an indication of her beauty.​—Job 42:15.

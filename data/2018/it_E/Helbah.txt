HELBAH
(Helʹbah).
A city in the territory of the tribe of Asher. It is mentioned as being one of the towns from which the tribe of Asher did not drive out the Canaanite inhabitants. (Jg 1:31, 32) Some scholars consider it to be the same as Ahlab and identify it with Khirbet el-Mahalib, about 6 km (3.5 mi) NE of Tyre. However, its exact location is not certain.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">(He·roʹdi·on).</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">One to whom Paul sent personal greetings in his letter to the Christian congregation at Rome. Paul refers to Herodion as “my relative.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:16:11-45:16:11" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ro 16:11</a>) Some suggest that this may simply mean that Herodion was a fellow Jew rather than an immediate member of Paul’s family, in view of the apostle’s use of the designation “relatives” at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:9:3-45:9:3" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Romans 9:3</a>. However, since Paul does not refer to all the Jews to whom he sent greetings as “my relatives” (compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:18:2-44:18:2" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ac 18:2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:16:3-45:16:3" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Ro 16:3</a>), likely a closer relative is meant.​—See <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200000274/">ANDRONICUS</a>.</p>

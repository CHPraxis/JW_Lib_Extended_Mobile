SHAMGAR
(Shamʹgar).
A deliverer of Israel between the judgeships of Ehud and Barak. Only one heroic deed of Shamgar is recorded, the slaying of 600 Philistines with a cattle goad, but he is accredited thereby with ‘saving Israel.’ (Jg 3:31) According to Josephus, Shamgar died in his first year of judgeship. (Jewish Antiquities, V, 197 [iv, 3]) His being a “son of Anath” may refer to the Naphtalite city of Beth-anath.​—Jg 1:33.

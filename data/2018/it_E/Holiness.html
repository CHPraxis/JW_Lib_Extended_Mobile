<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">The state or character of being holy. Holiness means “religious cleanness or purity; sacredness.” Also, the original Hebrew <em>qoʹdhesh</em> conveys the thought of separateness, exclusiveness, or sanctification to God, who is holy; a state of being set aside to the service of God. In the Christian Greek Scriptures, the words rendered “holy” (<em>haʹgi·os</em>) and “holiness” (<em>ha·gi·a·smosʹ</em> [also, “sanctification”]; <em>ha·gi·oʹtes; ha·gi·o·syʹne</em>) likewise denote separation to God; they also are used to refer to holiness as a quality of God and to purity or perfection in one’s personal conduct.</p>

<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><strong><em>Holy spirit.</em></strong> Jehovah’s active force, or spirit, is subject to his control and always accomplishes his purpose. It is clean, pure, sacred, and set apart for God’s good use.

<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><strong>Other Persons.</strong> The entire nation of Israel was counted holy because of God’s choosing and sanctifying of it, bringing the people exclusively into covenant relationship with him as a special property.

<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Although Israel as a nation was holy, certain individuals within the nation were considered holy in a special way. The priests, and particularly the high priest, were set aside for service at the sanctuary and represented the people before God. In such capacity they were holy and had to maintain sanctification in order to be able to carry out their service and to continue to be viewed as holy by God.

<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">The tabernacle courtyard was holy ground.

<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb"><strong>Periods of Time.</strong> Certain days or periods of time were set apart for Israel as holy. This was not because of any holiness intrinsic, or inherent, in the time periods themselves. It was because they were to be seasons of special observance in the worship of Jehovah. In setting aside these periods, God had in mind the people’s welfare and their spiritual upbuilding. There were the weekly Sabbaths. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:20:8-2:20:11" data-bid="46-1" class="b">Ex 20:8-11</a>) On these days the people could concentrate their attention on God’s law and on teaching it to their children.

<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">In addition, every seventh year was a sabbath year, a full year of holiness. During a sabbath year the land was to lie uncultivated; this provision, like the weekly Sabbath, gave the Israelites even more time to study Jehovah’s law, to meditate on it, and to teach it to their children. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:23:10-2:23:11" data-bid="53-1" class="b">Ex 23:10, 11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:25:2-3:25:7" data-bid="53-2" class="b"> Le 25:2-7</a>) Finally, every 50th year was called a Jubilee, likewise counted as holy.

It was a holy year of freedom, rest, and refreshment.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:25:8-3:25:12" data-bid="54-1" class="b">Le 25:8-12</a>.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">Jehovah commanded that his people ‘afflict their souls’ on the Day of Atonement, a day of “holy convention.” This meant that they should fast and should recognize and confess their sins as well as feel godly sorrow for them.

<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb"><strong><em>Jehovah’s holy rest day.</em></strong> The Bible shows us that God proceeded to rest from his creative works some 6,000 years ago, declaring the seventh “day” sacred, or holy. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:2:2-1:2:3" data-bid="57-1" class="b">Ge 2:2, 3</a>) The apostle Paul shows that Jehovah’s great rest day is a long period of time, when he speaks of the day as still being open so that by faith and obedience Christians can enter into its rest.

<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb"><strong>Objects.</strong> Certain things were set aside for use in worship. Here also holiness came to them by reason of their sanctification for Jehovah’s service; not that they had holiness of themselves, to be used as a charm or fetish. For example, one of the primary holy objects, the ark of the covenant, proved to be no charm when Eli’s two wicked sons <span id="page1130" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="1130" data-before-text="1130"></span>accompanied it into battle against the Philistines.

Many of these items are listed at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:7:47-11:7:51" data-bid="65-1" class="b">1 Kings 7:47-51</a>. These things were holy also in a greater sense in that they were patterns of heavenly things and served in a typical way for the benefit of those who are going to inherit salvation.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:8:4-58:8:5" data-bid="66-1" class="b">Heb 8:4, 5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:9:23-58:9:28" data-bid="66-2" class="b"> 9:23-28</a>.</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">The written Word of God is called “the holy Scriptures,” or “holy writings.” It was written under the influence of the holy spirit and has the power of sanctifying, or making holy, those who obey its commands.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:1:2-45:1:2" data-bid="67-1" class="b">Ro 1:2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:15-55:3:15" data-bid="67-2" class="b"> 2Ti 3:15</a>.</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb"><strong>Animals and Produce.</strong> The firstborn males of cattle, sheep, and goats were counted as holy to Jehovah and were not to be redeemed.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:18:17-4:18:19" data-bid="68-1" class="b">Nu 18:17-19</a>) The firstfruits and the tithe were holy, as were all sacrifices and all gifts sanctified to the service of the sanctuary. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:28:38-2:28:38" data-bid="69-1" class="b">Ex 28:38</a>) All things holy to Jehovah were sacred and could not be considered lightly or used in a common, or profane, way. An example is the law regarding the tithe. If a man set aside the portion to be tithed, say, of his wheat crop, and then he or one of his household unintentionally took some of it for home use, such as cooking, the man was guilty of violating God’s law respecting holy things. The Law required that he make compensation to the sanctuary of an equal amount plus 20 percent, besides offering up a sound ram of the flock as a sacrifice. Thus, great respect was engendered for the holy things belonging to Jehovah.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:5:14-3:5:16" data-bid="70-1" class="b">Le 5:14-16</a>.</p>

<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">The many Scriptural references to living members of the congregation as “holy ones,” or “saints” (<em>Dy, KJ</em>), make it clear that a person is not made a holy one, or “saint,” by men or by an organization, nor does such a one have to wait until after death to be made a “saint.” He is a “holy one” by virtue of God’s calling of him to joint heirship with Christ. He is holy in the eyes of God while he is on earth, with the hope of heavenly life in the spirit realm, wherein dwell Jehovah God and his Son, along with the holy angels.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:1:3-60:1:4" data-bid="77-1" class="b">1Pe 1:3, 4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:6:30-14:6:30" data-bid="77-2" class="b"> 2Ch 6:30;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:12:25-41:12:25" data-bid="77-3" class="b"> Mr 12:25;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:7:56-44:7:56" data-bid="77-4" class="b"> Ac 7:56</a>.</p>

<p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb"><strong><em>Holiness blessed by Jehovah.</em></strong> Holiness on a person’s part carries with it merit from God in the individual’s family relationship. Thus, if a married person is a Christian, holy to God, this one’s mate and the children of the union, if not themselves dedicated servants of God, benefit from the merit of the one who is holy. For this reason the apostle recommends: “If any brother has an unbelieving wife, and yet she is agreeable to dwelling with him, let him not leave her; and a woman who has an unbelieving husband, and yet he is agreeable to dwelling with her, let her not leave her husband. For the unbelieving husband is sanctified in relation to his wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified in relation to the brother; otherwise, your children would really be unclean, but now they are holy.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:7:12-46:7:14" data-bid="96-1" class="b">1Co 7:12-14</a>) The clean, believing mate is therefore not unclean by relations with the unbelieving mate, and the family as a unit is not viewed by God as unclean.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">(bulʹbul) [Heb., <em>ʽa·ghurʹ</em>].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The name of a number of types of medium-sized thrushlike birds found in Africa and southern Asia, including Palestine. The bulbul characteristically has a short neck, short wings, and a long tail. While many translations render <em>ʽa·ghurʹ</em> as “crane,” Hezekiah’s reference to the bird’s “chirping” would hardly describe the deep trumpeting sound made by that large bird. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:38:14-23:38:14" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Isa 38:14</a>) <em>Lexicon in Veteris Testamenti Libros</em> (by L. Koehler and W. Baumgartner, Leiden, 1958, p. 679) identified <em>ʽa·ghurʹ</em> as the bulbul (<em>Pycnonotus Reichenovi</em>). Ludwig Koehler says the Hebrew <em>ʽa·ghurʹ</em> describes a bird that ‘ruffles or bristles its feathers’ and says concerning the bulbul that “during the pauses (of its song) it lifts . . . from time to time the extended crestlike feathers of the back of the head.” (<em>Kleine Lichter</em> [German], Zurich, 1945, pp. 38, 39) Unlike the somewhat bellowing sound of the crane, the song of the bulbul is rather flutelike in tone and is described as a combination chirp and warble.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:8:7-24:8:7" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Jeremiah (8:7</a>) evidently refers to the seasonal arrival of migratory birds in his censuring the Israelites for not discerning the time of God’s judgment on them.</p>

PUTEOLI
(Pu·teʹo·li).
In the first century C.E., a chief port SE of Rome. Paul arrived at Puteoli on his way to stand before Caesar in Rome about the year 59 C.E. (Ac 28:13) With the help of a S wind, his ship arrived “on the second day” at Puteoli from Rhegium, a place some 320 km (200 mi) to the SSE.
Christian brothers of Puteoli entreated Paul and those accompanying him to spend a week with them. (Ac 28:14) This indicates he enjoyed some freedom, though a prisoner. Earlier, while in custody at Caesarea and Sidon, Paul had similarly benefited from limited freedom.​—Ac 24:23; 27:3.
Puteoli is generally identified with modern Pozzuoli, on the bay of the same name, about 10 km (6 mi) WSW of Naples. Extensive ruins of an ancient mole still are visible. Josephus calls the site by its older name, Dicaearchia, and says a Jewish colony was located there.​—Jewish Antiquities, XVII, 328 (xii, 1).

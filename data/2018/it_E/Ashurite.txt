ASHURITE
(Ashʹur·ite).
A people subject to the kingship of Ish-bosheth, Saul’s son. At 2 Samuel 2:9 they are listed between Gilead and Jezreel. The Latin Vulgate and Syriac Peshitta here read “Geshurites,” while the Targums say “Asherites.” (Compare Jg 1:32.) The name Asshurim is used at Genesis 25:3, but there refers to Arabian descendants of Abraham through Dedan.​—See CYPRESS.

HAROSHETH
(Ha·roʹsheth).
A site, called fully “Harosheth of the nations,” that served as military headquarters for Sisera, the army chief of the Canaanite king Jabin, who ruled in Hazor. (Jg 4:2, 13) Judge Barak pressed his victory over these enemy forces to this same point. (Jg 4:16) The name Harosheth (meaning “Woodland; Woody Thicket”) seems to be preserved at el-Harithiyeh, near the western exit of the Plain of Jezreel and about 16 km (10 mi) NNW of Megiddo. However, scholars usually hold that the actual ancient site was at nearby Tell ʽAmr (Tel Meʽammer).

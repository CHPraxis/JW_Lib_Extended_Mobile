<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">(Jaʹbal).</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A descendant of Cain; son of Lamech and his first wife Adah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:4:17-1:4:17" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ge 4:17,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:4:19-1:4:20" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 19, 20</a>) Jabal is called “the founder of those who dwell in tents and have livestock.” Jabal was not the first shepherd, for Abel had been one previously; but Jabal evidently began or was predominant in nomadic livestock raising as a way of life. He perhaps invented tents, which would be much easier to move than permanent dwellings when a certain pasturage gave out.</p>

Events in Jacob’s Life









JACOB was favored by God because he demonstrated deep appreciation for sacred things. (Heb 12:16, 17) Jehovah assured Jacob that his offspring would inherit the land promised to Abraham, and he added: “By means of your seed all the families of the ground will certainly bless themselves.”​—Ge 28:4, 10-15.
Though he was blessed with material wealth and 12 sons, Jacob’s life was not without difficulties. Yet Jacob never lost his faith in Jehovah and the reliability of his word. Even on his deathbed, he expressed faith in the Messianic promise. (Ge 49:10) Among Jacob’s offspring was born Jesus Christ, through whom God will eternally bless mankind.

1. The king of Lachish who joined forces with four other Amorite kings to punish Gibeon for making peace with Israel. (Jos 10:3-5) Gibeon’s call for help brought Joshua’s forces on a rescue mission from Gilgal. During the ensuing battle, the Israelites trapped Japhia and his allied kings in a cave at Makkedah. Later he and the others were executed and their dead bodies hung on stakes until sunset, after which they were thrown into the cave where they had sought refuge.​—Jos 10:6-27.
2. A son of David born at Jerusalem.​—2Sa 5:14, 15; 1Ch 3:7; 14:6.
3. A boundary site of Zebulun. (Jos 19:10, 12) It is identified with modern Yafa (Yafia), less than 3 km (2 mi) SW of Nazareth.

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A wilderness encampment of the Israelites; probably the same as Hor-haggidgad. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:10:6-5:10:7" data-bid="1-1" class="b">De 10:6, 7</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:33:33-4:33:33" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Nu 33:33</a>.) Some, believing the name “Gudgodah” to be preserved in Wadi Khadakhid, suggest that this place may have been located on Wadi Khadakhid, about 65 km (40 mi) NNW of the Gulf of ʽAqaba. But this has been questioned, since the Hebrew consonants of Gudgodah do not actually correspond to those of Khadakhid. Concerning the order in which the Israelite camping sites are listed in Numbers and Deuteronomy, see <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200000635/">BENE-JAAKAN</a>.</p>

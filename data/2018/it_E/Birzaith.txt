BIRZAITH
(Birʹza·ith).
A name in the genealogy of Asher of the family of Malchiel. (1Ch 7:30, 31) Because Birzaith is the only name of those listed in 1 Chronicles 7:30, 31 that is not found in the parallel genealogical record of Genesis 46:17, some consider Birzaith to refer to a site around which the descendants of Malchiel settled, or they think it was an area in which Malchiel was a chief inhabitant, even as Shobal is spoken of as “the father of Kiriath-jearim” and Salma as “the father of Bethlehem.” (1Ch 2:51, 52) Supposing Birzaith to have been the name of a place, some would identify it with Birzeit, about 21 km (13 mi) NNW of Jerusalem; but, despite the similarity of the names, Birzeit’s location near the southern border of Ephraim (instead of in the territory of Asher) does not lend support to such an identification.

JETHER
(Jeʹther) [from a root meaning “more than enough; overflow”].
1. Moses’ father-in-law Jethro is called Jether in the Masoretic text at Exodus 4:18.​—See JETHRO.
2. A descendant of Judah through Perez. Jether died without sons.​—1Ch 2:4, 5, 25, 26, 28, 32.
3. The first-named son of Ezrah; descendant of Judah.​—1Ch 4:17.
4. A descendant of Asher. (1Ch 7:30, 38) He is likely the same as Ithran in verse 37; the names are quite similar in Hebrew.
5. The firstborn son of Gideon. Jether apparently accompanied his father in the pursuit and capture of the Midianite kings Zebah and Zalmunna, but when ordered to slay them, the young Jether feared to draw his sword. (Jg 8:20) After Gideon died, Jether was killed by his half brother Abimelech.​—Jg 9:5, 18.
6. Father of David’s onetime army chief Amasa. (1Ki 2:5, 32) Second Samuel 17:25 in the Masoretic text calls him Ithra and says that he was an Israelite, but 1 Chronicles 2:17 calls him an Ishmaelite, possibly because he lived for a time among the Ishmaelites.

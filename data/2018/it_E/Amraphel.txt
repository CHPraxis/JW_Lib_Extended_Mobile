AMRAPHEL
(Amʹra·phel).
King of Shinar in southern Mesopotamia, and an ally and supporter of King Chedorlaomer of Elam in the invasion and victory over five kings at the Low Plain of Siddim. Amraphel and his allies were later overtaken by Abram, in his rescue of Lot, and were completely routed. (Ge 14:1-16) There have been attempts to identify Amraphel with Hammurabi, but the identification is not certain.

JABAL
(Jaʹbal).
A descendant of Cain; son of Lamech and his first wife Adah. (Ge 4:17, 19, 20) Jabal is called “the founder of those who dwell in tents and have livestock.” Jabal was not the first shepherd, for Abel had been one previously; but Jabal evidently began or was predominant in nomadic livestock raising as a way of life. He perhaps invented tents, which would be much easier to move than permanent dwellings when a certain pasturage gave out.

MOUND
A geographic or structural feature of ancient Jerusalem. (2Sa 5:9; 1Ki 9:15, 24; 11:27; 2Ki 12:20; 1Ch 11:8; 2Ch 32:5) At Judges 9:6, 20 the same Hebrew word translated “Mound” (mil·lohʼʹ) is rendered “Millo.”​—See MILLO.
The exact nature of the Mound is today unknown. At 2 Kings 12:20 reference is made to “the house of the Mound,” which may indicate that it was a citadellike structure. As to its location, 2 Samuel 5:9 and 2 Chronicles 32:5 associate it with the City of David, indicating that it was either in or at the edge of the City of David.

HAZEROTH
(Ha·zeʹroth) [Courtyards; Settlements].
Israel’s last camping site before entering the wilderness of Paran. (Nu 11:35; 12:16; 33:17, 18; De 1:1) At Hazeroth, Miriam was stricken with leprosy after she and Aaron questioned Moses’ authority and his taking of a Cushite wife. (Nu 11:35; 12:1-16) Most scholars connect Biblical Hazeroth with the oasis ʽAin Khadra, about 60 km (37 mi) NE of the traditional site of Mount Sinai.

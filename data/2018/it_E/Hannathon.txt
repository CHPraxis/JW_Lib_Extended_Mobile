HANNATHON
(Hanʹna·thon) [possibly from a root meaning “show favor; be gracious”].
A boundary city of Zebulun. (Jos 19:10, 14) Most scholars tentatively identify Hannathon with Tell el-Bedeiwiyeh (Tel Hannaton), about 10 km (6 mi) NNW of Nazareth. Hannathon appears in the records of Assyrian King Tiglath-pileser III and also in the Amarna Tablets.

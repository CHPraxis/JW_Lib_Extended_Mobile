CHIDON
(Chiʹdon).
The name of the owner of the threshing floor or the threshing floor itself where Uzzah was struck down by Jehovah when an attempt was made to move the ark of the testimony in an improper manner from Kiriath-jearim to the City of David. The threshing floor was apparently located between these two points and near the house of Obed-edom. (1Ch 13:6-14) Its precise location is unknown. The parallel narrative at 2 Samuel 6:6 says “Nacon,” which possibly indicates that one account uses the name of the location of the threshing floor, while the other uses the name of its owner. After the above incident the place came to be called Perez-uzzah, meaning “Rupture Against Uzzah.”

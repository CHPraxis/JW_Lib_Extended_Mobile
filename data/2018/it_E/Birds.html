<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Birds are warm-blooded, feathered vertebrates and are oviparous, that is, egg laying. There are some 300 references to birds in the Bible, with about 30 different varieties being specifically named. Reference is made to their flight, often in escaping their enemies (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:11:1-19:11:1" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ps 11:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:26:2-20:26:2" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Pr 26:2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:27:8-20:27:8" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> 27:8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:31:5-23:31:5" data-bid="1-4" class="b"> Isa 31:5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/28:9:11-28:9:11" data-bid="1-5" class="b"> Ho 9:11</a>); their roosting in trees (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:104:12-19:104:12" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ps 104:12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:13:32-40:13:32" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Mt 13:32</a>); their nesting (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:84:3-19:84:3" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ps 84:3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:31:6-26:31:6" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Eze 31:6</a>); their uses, particularly young pigeons and turtledoves, in sacrifice (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:1:14-3:1:14" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Le 1:14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:14:4-3:14:7" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 14:4-7,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:14:49-3:14:53" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> 49-53</a>) and as food (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:5:18-16:5:18" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ne 5:18</a>), including their eggs (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:10:14-23:10:14" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Isa 10:14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:11:11-42:11:12" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> Lu 11:11, 12</a>); and God’s provision and care for them (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:26-40:6:26" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Mt 6:26;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:10:29-40:10:29" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 10:29</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:22:6-5:22:7" data-bid="8-1" class="b">De 22:6, 7</a>).</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Birds were among the earliest living souls on earth, coming into existence on the fifth creative “day” along with the marine creatures. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:20-1:1:23" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ge 1:20-23</a>) Of the general terms used in the Bible that apply to birds, the most frequent Hebrew word is <em>ʽohph,</em> basically meaning “flying creature” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:20-1:1:20" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ge 1:20</a>), which may include not only birds but also winged insects. (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:11:13-3:11:13" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Le 11:13,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:11:21-3:11:23" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 21-23</a>.) The Hebrew <em>tsip·pohrʹ</em> also occurs in a large number of texts and is a generic term applying to birds in general. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:7:14-1:7:14" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Ge 7:14</a>) A third Hebrew term, <em>ʽaʹyit,</em> is applied solely to the birds of prey.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The following terms are found in the Greek Scriptures: <em>orʹne·on,</em> meaning simply “bird” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:18:2-66:18:2" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Re 18:2</a>); <em>pe·tei·nonʹ</em> and <em>pte·nosʹ,</em> both literally meaning “flier.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:1:23-45:1:23" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Ro 1:23;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:15:39-46:15:39" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> 1Co 15:39</a>; compare <em>Int.</em>) At <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:17:18-44:17:18" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Acts 17:18</a> Athenian philosophers referred to the apostle Paul as a “chatterer.” The Greek word here (<em>sper·mo·loʹgos</em>) was applied to a bird that picks up seeds, while figuratively it was used of a person who picks up scraps by begging or stealing, or, as in the case cited, one who repeats scraps of knowledge, an idle babbler.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">A thoughtful study of birds gives convincing proof of the Biblical teaching that they are of divine creation. While birds and reptiles are both oviparous, reptiles are cold-blooded, often sluggish, whereas birds are warm-blooded and among the most active of all earth’s creatures; they also have an unusually rapid heartbeat. The evolutionary view that reptilian scales and front limbs eventually developed into feathered wings is both fanciful and baseless. The fossils of birds called by scientists <em>Archaeopteryx</em> (or, ancient wing) and <em>Archaeornis</em> (or, ancient bird), though showing teeth and a long vertebrated tail, also show that they were completely feathered, had feet equipped for perching, and had fully developed wings. No intermediate specimens, exhibiting scales developing into feathers or front legs into wings, exist to give any semblance of support to the evolution theory. As expressed by the apostle Paul, birds are of a distinct “flesh” from others of earth’s creatures.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:15:39-46:15:39" data-bid="16-1" class="b">1Co 15:39</a>.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">The psalmist called upon the “winged birds” to praise Jehovah (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:148:1-19:148:1" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Ps 148:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:148:10-19:148:10" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> 10</a>), and birds do this by their very structure and their complex design. A single bird may have from 1,000 to over 20,000 feathers. Yet each feather is composed of a shaft from which branch out hundreds of barbs forming <span id="page317" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="317" data-before-text="317"></span>an inner web, each barb containing several hundred smaller barbules and each barbule having hundreds of barbicels and hooklets. A single six-inch wing feather of a pigeon is thus estimated to contain some hundreds of thousands of barbules and literally millions of barbicels. The aerodynamic principles built into birds’ wings and body design surpass in complexity and efficiency that of modern-day aircraft. A bird’s hollow bones contribute to its lightness, and thus the skeleton of a frigate bird with a 2-m (7 ft) wingspan may weigh only about 110 g (4 oz). Certain wing bones of large soaring birds even have trusslike supports, like the struts inside airplane wings, within the hollow portions.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">At the time of the Flood, Noah introduced into the ark for preservation pairs of birds “according to their kinds.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:6:7-1:6:7" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Ge 6:7,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:6:20-1:6:20" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> 20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:7:3-1:7:3" data-bid="18-3" class="b"> 7:3,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:7:23-1:7:23" data-bid="18-4" class="b"> 23</a>) There is no certain way of knowing how many different “kinds” of birds then existed, some types of birds having become extinct even in recent times. However, it is of interest to note that the listing of birds according to present-day scientific classification presented in <em>The New Encyclopædia Britannica</em> (1985, Vol. 15, pp. 14-106) gives a total of only 221 bird “families,” including some that are now extinct or known only in fossil form. There are, of course, thousands of varieties included within these “families.”​—See <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200000367/">ARK</a> No. 1.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Following the global Flood, Noah offered up “clean flying creatures” along with animals as a sacrifice. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:8:18-1:8:20" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Ge 8:18-20</a>) Birds were thereafter made allowable by God for inclusion in man’s diet, as long as the blood was not eaten. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:9:1-1:9:4" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Ge 9:1-4</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:7:26-3:7:26" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Le 7:26;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:17:13-3:17:13" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> 17:13</a>.) The ‘cleanness’ of certain birds at that time therefore evidently relates to some divine indication of acceptableness for sacrifice; the Biblical record shows that, as regards their being used as food, none of the birds were designated as “unclean” until the introduction of the Mosaic Law. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:11:13-3:11:19" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Le 11:13-19,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:11:46-3:11:47" data-bid="22-2" class="b"> 46, 47;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:20:25-3:20:25" data-bid="22-3" class="b"> 20:25;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:14:11-5:14:20" data-bid="22-4" class="b"> De 14:11-20</a>) The factors determining which birds were designated ceremonially “unclean” are not expressly stated in the Bible. Thus, while most of those so designated were birds of prey or scavengers, not all of them were. (See <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200002067/">HOOPOE</a>.) This prohibition was lifted following the establishment of the new covenant, as God made evident to Peter by a vision.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:10:9-44:10:15" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Ac 10:9-15</a>.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">The identification of the birds specifically named in the Bible presents a difficult problem in some cases. Lexicographers generally are guided by the root meaning of the name, since this is usually descriptive, by indications in the context as to the bird’s habits and habitat, and by observation of the birds known to be found in the Bible lands. In many cases the names are believed to be onomatopoeic, that is, imitating the sound produced by the bird.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">The diverse topography of Palestine, ranging from cool mountain peaks to deep sweltering valleys and from arid deserts to maritime plains, all together near the SE corner of the Mediterranean Sea, makes it a focal point for a great variety of bird types. Mount Hermon, in the N, is snowcapped for much of the year, while the region about 200 km (125 mi) to the S along the lower Jordan Valley and near the Dead Sea is hot and tropical. Each of these zones contains birds peculiar to its own environment, either alpine or tropical, as do also the temperate zones and the desert regions. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:102:6-19:102:6" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Ps 102:6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:104:16-19:104:17" data-bid="24-2" class="b"> 104:16, 17</a>) Additionally, Palestine is on one of the major migrational routes followed annually by birds (storks, turtledoves, quail, swifts, swallows, bulbuls, cuckoos, and others) traveling N from Africa in the spring or S from Europe and Asia in the fall. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/22:2:11-22:2:12" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Ca 2:11, 12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:8:7-24:8:7" data-bid="25-2" class="b"> Jer 8:7</a>) Thus it is estimated that about 470 varieties of birds may be found in Palestine at some time during the course of a year. In view of the deterioration of Palestinian forests and vegetation over the centuries, it is likely that in Biblical times the bird population was even greater.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Particularly notable are the great numbers of birds of prey (Heb., <em>ʽaʹyit</em>) found in Palestine, including eagles, hawks, falcons, kites, and vultures. Back in Abraham’s time, birds of prey tried to descend upon Abraham’s sacrifice of certain animals and birds, obliging him to drive them off until the sun began to set. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:15:9-1:15:12" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Ge 15:9-12</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:21:10-10:21:10" data-bid="27-1" class="b">2Sa 21:10</a>.) In their search for food these birds rely on their powerful telescopic sight, rather than on their relatively weak sense of smell.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">The well-known sight of a cluster of scavenger birds gathered around a carcass often served as the basis for an ominous warning to an enemy (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:17:44-9:17:44" data-bid="28-1" class="b">1Sa 17:44,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:17:46-9:17:46" data-bid="28-2" class="b"> 46</a>), and repeatedly formed part of divinely inspired prophetic warnings to the nation of Israel and its rulers (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:28:26-5:28:26" data-bid="29-1" class="b">De 28:26;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:14:11-11:14:11" data-bid="29-2" class="b"> 1Ki 14:11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:21:24-11:21:24" data-bid="29-3" class="b"> 21:24;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:7:33-24:7:33" data-bid="29-4" class="b"> Jer 7:33;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:15:3-24:15:3" data-bid="29-5" class="b"> 15:3</a>) as well as to foreign nations.

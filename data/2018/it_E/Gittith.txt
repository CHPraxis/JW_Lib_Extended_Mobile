GITTITH
(Gitʹtith).
A musical expression of uncertain meaning, appearing in the superscriptions of Psalms 8, 81, and 84. The term seems to be derived from the Hebrew word gath, which is also the name of a town located on the border of Judah and Philistia. Some have suggested that “Gittith” denotes a tune associated with vintage songs, since gath refers to a winepress. The Greek Septuagint and the Latin Vulgate, therefore, render “Gittith” as “winepresses.”

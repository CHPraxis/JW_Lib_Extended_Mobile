PRISCA
(Prisʹca) [Old Woman]; Priscilla (Pris·cilʹla) [Little Old Woman].
The shorter form of the name is found in Paul’s writings, the longer form in Luke’s. Such a variation was common in Roman names.
Priscilla was the wife of Aquila, with whom she is always mentioned. The two showed fine Christian works and hospitality not only to individuals but also to the congregation by having congregation meetings in their home in both Rome and Ephesus.
Because of Emperor Claudius’ decree, Aquila and his wife left Rome and went to Corinth in about 50 C.E. Not long after their arrival Paul joined them in tentmaking. (Ac 18:2, 3) They traveled on with Paul to Ephesus, remained there for a time, and were instrumental in ‘expounding the way of God more correctly’ to the eloquent Apollos. (Ac 18:18, 19, 24-28; 1Co 16:19) Returning to Rome for a time (Ro 16:3-5), they later traveled back to Ephesus. (2Ti 4:19; 1Ti 1:3) Their personal contact with Paul extended from about 50 C.E. to Paul’s death, some 15 years later, during which association they “risked their own necks” for the apostle’s soul.​—Ro 16:3, 4; see AQUILA.

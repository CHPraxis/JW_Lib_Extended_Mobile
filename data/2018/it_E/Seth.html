<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The son of Adam and Eve born when Adam was 130 years old. Eve named him Seth because, as she said, “God has appointed another seed in place of Abel, because Cain killed him.” Seth may not have been the third child of Adam and Eve. According to <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:5:4-1:5:4" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Genesis 5:4</a>, Adam had “sons and <em>daughters,”</em> some of whom may have been born before Seth. Seth is worthy of note because Noah, and through him the present-day race of mankind, descended from him, not from the murderous Cain. At the age of 105 years Seth became father to Enosh. Seth died at the age of 912 years (3896-2984 B.C.E.).​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:4:17-1:4:17" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ge 4:17,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:4:25-1:4:26" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 25, 26;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:5:3-1:5:8" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> 5:3-8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:1:1-13:1:4" data-bid="2-4" class="b"> 1Ch 1:1-4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:3:38-42:3:38" data-bid="2-5" class="b"> Lu 3:38</a>.</p>

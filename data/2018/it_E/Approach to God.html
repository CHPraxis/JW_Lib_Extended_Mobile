<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">In an ancient Oriental court any approach to the presence of the monarch by an individual could be made only in accord with established regulations and with the monarch’s permission. In most cases an intermediary acted for petitioners desiring an audience with the ruler, introducing them and vouching for the genuineness of their credentials. To enter the inner courtyard of Persian King Ahasuerus without being called meant death; but Queen Esther, when risking her life to gain access to the king’s presence, was favored with approval.

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><strong>Sanctity of God’s Presence.</strong> Although Paul stated in Athens that God “is not far off from each one of us” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:17:27-44:17:27" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ac 17:27</a>), and his accessibility is presented throughout his Word the Bible, the one approaching Him must also meet definite requirements and have His divine permission or approval. Daniel’s vision of the majestic heavenly court of “the Ancient of Days” to whom the “son of man” “gained access” and was “brought . . . up close even before that One,” illustrates the dignity, respect, and order associated with the presence of the Sovereign Ruler of the universe.

<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Man, having been made in his Creator’s image and likeness by being endowed with a measure of the divine attributes and having the responsibility of caring for the planet Earth and the animal creation on it, would need to be in communication with his God and Father.

<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb"><strong>Basis for Approach Under New Covenant.</strong> The Law covenant arrangement with its animal sacrifices, as a pictorial legal basis, pointed toward a superior basis for approach to God.

<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">The Christian’s approach to God involves sacrifices and offerings of a spiritual kind.

In the Sovereign Lord Jehovah I have placed my refuge, to declare all your works.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:73:27-19:73:28" data-bid="68-1" class="b">Ps 73:27, 28</a>; see <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200003543/">PRAYER</a>.</p>

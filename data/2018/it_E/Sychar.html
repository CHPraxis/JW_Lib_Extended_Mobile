<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A city of Samaria and the site of Jacob’s fountain. It was “near the field that Jacob gave to Joseph his son” in the vicinity of Shechem. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:4:5-43:4:6" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Joh 4:5, 6</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:24:32-6:24:32" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Jos 24:32</a>.) The Syriac Sinaitic codex has “Sychem” instead of “Sychar.” However, the best Greek manuscripts support the reading “Sychar.” Certain early non-Biblical writers distinguish between Shechem and Sychar; others do not. Recent excavations have led some to identify Sychar tentatively with the village of ʽAskar, 0.7 km (0.4 mi) NNE of Jacob’s fountain and about 1 km (0.6 mi) NE of Shechem.</p>

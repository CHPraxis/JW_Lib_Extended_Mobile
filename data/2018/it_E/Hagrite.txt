HAGRITE
(Hagʹrite) [possibly, Of (Belonging to) Hagar].
Apparently a pastoral people residing in tents E of Gilead. In the days of King Saul, the Israelites living E of the Jordan defeated the Hagrites, taking 100,000 captives, as well as thousands of camels, asses, and sheep. (1Ch 5:10, 18-22) The psalmist listed the Hagrites among other enemies of Israel, such as the Edomites, Moabites, Ammonites, and Amalekites. (Ps 83:2-7) However, during David’s rule, Jaziz the Hagrite was in charge of the royal flocks.​—1Ch 27:31.
Many scholars believe that the Hagrites are probably the same as the A·graiʹoi mentioned by the ancient geographers Strabo, Ptolemy, and Pliny. Whether they were descendants of Hagar cannot be definitely established.

JEKUTHIEL
(Je·kuʹthi·el).
A descendant of Judah and “father of Zanoah.” (1Ch 4:1, 18) Zanoah is the name of a city rather than a person in its other occurrence (Jos 15:56, 57), so Jekuthiel as its “father” was likely the father of those who settled there, or was himself its founder or chief settler.

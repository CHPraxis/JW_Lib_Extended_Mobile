5. Son of Azzur; a false prophet from the Benjamite city of Gibeon who opposed Jehovah’s prophet Jeremiah. During the reign of King Zedekiah of Judah, while Jeremiah encouraged the people to bring their necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon and thus keep living (Jer 27:12-14), Hananiah prophesied that Babylon’s power would be broken within two years, that the Jewish exiles there would be released, and that all the confiscated utensils of the temple would be returned. To illustrate his point, Hananiah removed the wooden yoke from off Jeremiah’s neck and broke it. Jehovah then commanded Jeremiah to inform Hananiah that the yoke bar of wood was to be replaced by an iron yoke and that Hananiah’s death would occur within that year. True to the prophecy, the false prophet died in that year.​—Jer 28.

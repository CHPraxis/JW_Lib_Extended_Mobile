HALAH
(Haʹlah).
A place to which Assyrian monarchs transported Israelite captives. (2Ki 17:6; 18:11; 1Ch 5:26) Certain scholars believe that Obadiah 20 should perhaps read “exiles in Halah” rather than “exiles of this [“army,” JB; “force,” Ro, Yg; “host,” AS, KJ] rampart.” (NW) Whereas various identifications have been suggested, Halah’s exact location remains unknown. Some associate it with the Hallahu mentioned in Akkadian texts.

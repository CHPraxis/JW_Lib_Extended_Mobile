<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">(Maʹhol) [from a root meaning “dance; whirl”; or, possibly from a root meaning “play the flute”].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">One whose sons’ wisdom, though great, was not equal to King Solomon’s. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:4:31-11:4:31" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1Ki 4:31</a>) Some view the designation “sons of Mahol” to mean an association of musicians or dancers.​—Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:150:4-19:150:4" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ps 150:4</a>, where the same Hebrew word is rendered “circle dance.”</p>

LESHEM STONE
(leshʹem).
An unidentified precious stone that was placed first in the third row of gems on the high priest’s “breastpiece of judgment.”​—Ex 28:15, 19; 39:12.
Various stones, such as amber, hyacinth, opal, and tourmaline, have been suggested as being identical with “leshem stone,” but none of these identifications can be substantiated. The New World Translation therefore leaves the Hebrew word untranslated as leshem stone.

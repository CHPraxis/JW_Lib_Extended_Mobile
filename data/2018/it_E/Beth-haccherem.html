<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">(Beth-hac·cheʹrem) [House of the Vineyard].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A place near Jerusalem mentioned by Jeremiah as a place suitable for raising a fire signal to warn of advancing enemy forces out of the N. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:6:1-24:6:1" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Jer 6:1</a>) In postexilic times a district of Judah bore this name, with Malchijah as “prince” over it. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:3:14-16:3:14" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ne 3:14</a>) Because of the mention of Tekoa together with Beth-haccherem at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:6:1-24:6:1" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Jeremiah 6:1</a>, some consider Beth-haccherem to <span id="page298" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="298" data-before-text="298"></span>have been situated to the S of Jerusalem, between that city and Tekoa. Jerome, of the fourth century C.E., referred to it at such location under the name of Bethacharma. In harmony with such views, the site of Khirbet Salih (Ramat Rahel), 4.5 km (3 mi) SSW of the Temple Mount, has been proposed. Others, however, do not consider the mention of Tekoa as necessarily indicating a geographic proximity of Beth-haccherem and hold to the site of ʽAin Karim (ʽEn Kerem) (meaning “Spring of the Vineyard”) 7.5 km (4.5 mi) WSW of the Temple Mount. This is in a fertile section with olive groves and vineyards, and it lies at the foot of Jebel ʽAli, from which height may be seen the Mount of Olives, part of Jerusalem, and, to the W, the Mediterranean Sea. Large stone mounds found on the summit are suggested by some to have been used for lighting signal fires such as those mentioned by Jeremiah.​—See <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200000678/">BETH-CAR</a>.</p>

ISHBI-BENOB
(Ishʹbi-beʹnob).
One of four Rephaim (the giant race of Canaanites) who were prominent during the last wars with Israel in David’s reign. Ishbi-benob carried a copper spear weighing 300 shekels (3.4 kg; 7.5 lb) and was on the verge of killing David when fast-acting Abishai himself put the giant to death.​—2Sa 21:15-17, 22.

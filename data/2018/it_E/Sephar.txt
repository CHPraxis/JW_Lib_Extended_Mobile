SEPHAR
(Seʹphar).
One limit of the territory in which descendants of Joktan resided. The Bible says: “And their place of dwelling came to extend from Mesha as far as Sephar, the mountainous region of the East.” (Ge 10:29, 30) One suggested location is Zafar (once the capital of the Himyarite kings) in Yemen, about 160 km (100 mi) NE of the southern end of the Red Sea. Another is a coastal city in Mahra, on the Arabian Sea. But the exact location of ancient Sephar remains uncertain.

ZAANAN
(Zaʹa·nan).
A town mentioned by the prophet Micah as among places due to experience the foretold invasion of Judah. (Mic 1:11) Many scholars consider it to be the same as Zenan at Joshua 15:37. It is tentatively identified with ʽAraq el-Kharba, in the Shephelah region of Judah, about 6 km (3.5 mi) NW of Lachish.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">(Abi-eʹzer) [(My) Father Is a Helper].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><strong>1.</strong> One of “the sons of Gilead” the grandson of Manasseh, Joseph’s firstborn. A comparison of the accounts at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:26:28-4:26:30" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Numbers 26:28-30</a> and <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:17:1-6:17:2" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Joshua 17:1, 2</a> shows that he is also called Iezer (Jeezer, <em>KJ</em>), which is a shortened form of Abi-ezer, the prefix “Ab” (father) being removed.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Abi-ezer was a family head and an ancestor of Judge Gideon. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:6:11-7:6:11" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Jg 6:11,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:6:24-7:6:24" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 24,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:6:34-7:6:34" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> 34;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:8:2-7:8:2" data-bid="3-4" class="b"> 8:2</a>) It appears that after the division of land among the tribes of Israel, Abi-ezer’s family either originally or at a later time settled in the area of Ophrah, in the territory of Manasseh W of the Jordan.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The name is also used to stand for the house of Abi-ezer in a collective sense.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:8:2-7:8:2" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Jg 8:2</a>; see <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200000036/">ABI-EZRITE</a>.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><strong>2.</strong> A son of Hammolecheth, who was sister of Manasseh’s grandson Gilead. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:7:18-13:7:18" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1Ch 7:18</a>) Some commentators view this Abi-ezer as being the same as No. 1.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><strong>3.</strong> A Benjamite from Anathoth, one of King David’s 37 most valiant fighters. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:23:27-10:23:27" data-bid="6-1" class="b">2Sa 23:27,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:23:39-10:23:39" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 39</a>) He was head of a paternal house and divisional head over a force of 24,000 men, serving the king during the ninth month of each year.

His town of Anathoth lay a few miles NNE of Jerusalem, within the territory of Benjamin.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:6:60-13:6:60" data-bid="9-1" class="b">1Ch 6:60</a>.</p>

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Apparently a star-god, as indicated by the fact that the name Kaiwan is put in a parallelism with “the star of your god.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/30:5:26-30:5:26" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Am 5:26</a>) Evidently the Akkadian star <em>kaimanu</em> or <em>kaiwanu</em> is meant, since this occurs in Akkadian inscriptions as the name of Saturn (a star-god). In the Masoretic text the name was intentionally vowel pointed to correspond with the Hebrew word <em>shiq·qutsʹ</em> (disgusting thing). In the Greek <em>Septuagint,</em> “Kaiwan” is rendered <em>Rhai·phanʹ,</em> presumably the Egyptian designation for Saturn; and in Stephen’s quotation, at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:7:43-44:7:43" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Acts 7:43</a>, <em>Rhom·phaʹ</em> appears in the Westcott and Hort Greek text.​—See <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200000448/">ASTROLOGERS</a>; <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200003697/">REPHAN</a>.</p>

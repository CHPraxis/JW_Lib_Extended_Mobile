<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">(Baʹal-beʹrith) [Owner of a Covenant; once, at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:9:46-7:9:46" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Jg 9:46</a>, El-berith, God of a Covenant].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The Baal of Shechem, whom the Israelites began worshiping after the death of Judge Gideon. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:8:33-7:8:33" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Jg 8:33</a>) The designation “Baal-berith” may denote that this particular Baal was believed to watch the keeping of covenants.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">A kind of treasury was evidently attached to the house or temple of Baal-berith at Shechem. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:9:4-7:9:4" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Jg 9:4</a>) In connection with the grape harvest, the Shechemites apparently held a festival in honor of Baal-berith, climaxed by a kind of sacrificial meal in the temple of their god. It was in the temple of Baal-berith on the occasion of their eating and drinking and cursing Abimelech, likely under the influence of wine, that Gaal incited the Shechemites to revolt against King Abimelech. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:9:27-7:9:29" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Jg 9:27-29</a>) Later, when threatened by Abimelech, the landowners of the tower of Shechem (Migdal-Shechem, <em>AT</em>) sought refuge in the vault of the house of El-berith (Baal-berith), only to perish in the conflagration when Abimelech and his men set the vault on fire.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:9:46-7:9:49" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Jg 9:46-49</a>.</p>

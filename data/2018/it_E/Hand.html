<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">The terminal part of the arm. The “hand,” as used in the Scriptures, at times includes the wrist, as at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:24:22-1:24:22" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Genesis 24:22,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:24:30-1:24:30" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 30,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:24:47-1:24:47" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> 47</a> and <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:16:11-26:16:11" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ezekiel 16:11</a>, where bracelets are said to be worn on the “hands,” and at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:15:14-7:15:14" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Judges 15:14</a>, where mention is made of the fetters on Samson’s “hands.” The hand applies the power of the arm and directs it, so, in many cases where it appears in figurative speech, the idea of “applied power” can be associated with the word “hand.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:7:4-2:7:4" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ex 7:4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:13:3-2:13:3" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 13:3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:2:15-5:2:15" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> De 2:15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:1:66-42:1:66" data-bid="4-4" class="b"> Lu 1:66</a>) Since the human hand is very dexterous and versatile and a part of the body with which work is done, it is used symbolically in many Bible texts to denote a wide range of actions.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The common Hebrew term for “hand” is <em>yadh;</em> at times, the word <em>kaph</em> is rendered “hand,” but it literally means “palm.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:22:30-18:22:30" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Job 22:30</a>, ftn) The usual Greek term for “hand” is <em>kheir.</em></p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><strong>Manual Gestures and Their Significance.</strong> The hands were employed in gestures to express various things.

<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><strong>Figurative and Symbolic Usages.</strong> The hand was sometimes used to represent the person himself, as in David’s appeal to Nabal for food: “Just give, please, whatever your hand may find.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:25:8-9:25:8" data-bid="15-1" class="b">1Sa 25:8</a>) It also referred to one’s general disposition or activity (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:16:12-1:16:12" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Ge 16:12</a>), or it denoted his responsibility to account for his actions.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:9:5-1:9:5" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Ge 9:5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:3:18-26:3:18" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> Eze 3:18,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:3:20-26:3:20" data-bid="17-3" class="b"> 20</a>.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">The hands of the priests were filled with sacrifices by Moses at the time of their installation as part of the ceremony symbolically equipping them, ‘filling their hands’ with authority and power for the priesthood.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:8:25-3:8:27" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Le 8:25-27,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:8:33-3:8:33" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> 33</a>; see <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200001520/">FILL HAND WITH POWER</a>.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Jehovah assured Jacob that his son Joseph would “lay his hand upon your eyes,” that is, close Jacob’s eyes after he had died. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:46:4-1:46:4" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Ge 46:4</a>) This privilege would ordinarily have been that of the firstborn. Hence these words not only assured Jacob that his beloved son Joseph would remain near him during the remaining years of the aged patriarch’s life but also apparently foretold that the right of firstborn, lost by Reuben, would go to Joseph.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">God is symbolically spoken of as using his “hand,” that is, his applied power, in accomplishing work; a few of such instances are: creation (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:8:6-19:8:6" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Ps 8:6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:102:25-19:102:25" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> 102:25</a>); destroying his enemies (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:25:10-23:25:11" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Isa 25:10, 11</a>); delivering his people (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:7:4-2:7:5" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Ex 7:4, 5</a>); exercising favor and power toward those seeking him (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/15:8:22-15:8:22" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Ezr 8:22</a>); making provision (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:104:28-19:104:28" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Ps 104:28;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:145:16-19:145:16" data-bid="24-2" class="b"> 145:16</a>); and offering help (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:11:11-23:11:11" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Isa 11:11</a>).

Joseph was displeased when Jacob crossed his hands in order to lay his right hand on Ephraim, Joseph’s younger son. But Jacob did this purposely, to give Ephraim the superior blessing. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:48:13-1:48:20" data-bid="71-1" class="b">Ge 48:13-20</a>) To be on the right hand of a ruler was to have the most important position, next to the ruler himself (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:110:1-19:110:1" data-bid="72-1" class="b">Ps 110:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:7:55-44:7:56" data-bid="72-2" class="b"> Ac 7:55, 56;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:8:34-45:8:34" data-bid="72-3" class="b"> Ro 8:34;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:3:22-60:3:22" data-bid="72-4" class="b"> 1Pe 3:22</a>), or a position in his favor. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:25:33-40:25:33" data-bid="73-1" class="b">Mt 25:33</a>) Jesus is spoken of in the vision of Revelation as having the seven stars of the seven congregations in his right hand.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:73:23-19:73:23" data-bid="75-1" class="b">Ps 73:23</a>) Usually the right hand of a warrior was his sword-wielding hand, and it was unprotected by the shield in the left hand. Therefore, a friend would stand or fight at his right hand as an upholder and protector. This circumstance is used metaphorically with regard to God’s help and protection to those serving him.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:16:8-19:16:8" data-bid="76-1" class="b">Ps 16:8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:109:30-19:109:31" data-bid="76-2" class="b"> 109:30, 31;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:110:5-19:110:5" data-bid="76-3" class="b"> 110:5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:121:5-19:121:5" data-bid="76-4" class="b"> 121:5</a>.</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">The writer of Ecclesiastes says: “The heart of the wise is at his right hand, but the heart of the stupid at his left hand.” In other words, the wise one inclines toward a good, favorable path, but the stupid one inclines toward a bad course.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:10:2-21:10:2" data-bid="77-1" class="b">Ec 10:2</a>.</p>

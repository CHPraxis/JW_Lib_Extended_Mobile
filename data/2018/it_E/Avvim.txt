AVVIM
(Avʹvim).
1. Early settlers in that part of the land of Canaan that lay westward toward Gaza. Forty years after the Exodus, Moses told how, for the most part, these Avvim had been dispossessed by the Caphtorim. (De 2:23) Shortly before Joshua’s death, in about the middle of the 15th century B.C.E., a remnant of the Avvim still remained.​—Jos 13:1, 3.
2. A city of Benjamin, listed between Bethel and Parah at Joshua 18:21-23. It may have been populated by remaining members of the tribe of the Avvim. It is identified with Khirbet Haiyan (Horvat Hayan), about 4 km (2.5 mi) ESE of Bethel (Beitin), according to F.-M. Abel.​—Géographie de la Palestine, Paris, 1938, Vol. II, p. 257.

ELEALEH
(E·le·aʹleh).
A site regularly mentioned with Heshbon and located in the pastoral country E of the Jordan. The tribe of Reuben “built” (or rebuilt) the city soon after its conquest. (Nu 32:3-5, 37) Centuries later, when it was under Moab’s control, Isaiah and Jeremiah prophesied that Elealeh was due to “cry out” at that nation’s collapse. (Isa 15:4; 16:9; Jer 48:34) It is usually thought to be located on a hill at el-ʽAl, about 3 km (2 mi) NE of Heshbon.

IZHAR
(Izʹhar).
Two names, spelled similarly in Hebrew, are rendered the same in English.
1. Yits·harʹ. The second listed of Kohath’s four sons; therefore a grandson of Levi. (Ex 6:16, 18; Nu 3:17, 19; 1Ch 6:2, 18) One of Izhar’s three sons, Korah, was executed in the wilderness for rebellion.​—Ex 6:21; Nu 16:1, 32.
Izhar founded the Levite family of Izharites. (Nu 3:27) Under King David, some of the Izharites, whose headman was Shelomith, were appointed singers, officers, and judges, while others performed regular Levitical duties.​—1Ch 6:31-38; 23:12, 18; 24:20-22; 26:23, 29; see AMMINADAB No. 2.
2. Yits·charʹ (in agreement with Vg). A descendant of Judah; a son of Ashhur and Helah. (1Ch 4:1, 5, 7) In the margin of the Masoretic text the name is spelled Zohar.

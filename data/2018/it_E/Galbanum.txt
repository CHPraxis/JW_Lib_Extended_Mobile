GALBANUM
(galʹba·num).
A yellowish or brownish gum resin procured from certain Asian plants of the carrot, or parsley, family. There is uncertainty as to the precise kind of plant providing the galbanum used by the Israelites.
The milky fluid that hardens into galbanum exudes from the plant stem naturally or its flow is induced by means of an incision. Galbanum was one of the ingredients of the incense specified for exclusive use at the sanctuary. (Ex 30:34-38) When burned alone it is said to give off an offensive odor, but when combined with other aromatic substances, galbanum increases their fragrance and makes the fragrance last longer.

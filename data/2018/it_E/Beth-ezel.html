<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">(Beth-eʹzel).</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A town, evidently in Judah, mentioned only in Micah’s prophecy foretelling the disaster due to come upon unfaithful Samaria and Jerusalem. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/33:1:11-33:1:11" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Mic 1:11</a>) The prophet repeatedly makes a play on words in the use of the names of several towns in this portion of the prophecy, so that in reality he says: “In the house of Aphrah [probably meaning “Dust”] wallow in the very dust. Make your way across, O inhabitress of Shaphir [meaning “Elegant; Polished; Agreeable”], in shameful nudity. The inhabitress of Zaanan has not gone forth. The wailing of Beth-ezel [meaning “House Nearby (Alongside)”] will take from you people its standing place. For the inhabitress of Maroth [from a root meaning “be bitter”] has waited for good, but what is bad has come down from Jehovah to the gate of Jerusalem.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/33:1:10-33:1:12" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Mic 1:10-12</a>) The prophet’s warning, directed to those due to experience the disaster, thus in effect tells them that the wailing will spread to as far as Jerusalem.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Though the identification is only tentative, Beth-ezel has been located at the site of present-day Deir el-ʽAsal, about 16 km (10 mi) WSW of Hebron.</p>

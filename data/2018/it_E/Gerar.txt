GERAR
(Geʹrar).
A site near Gaza mentioned in the earliest record of the boundaries of Canaanite territory. (Ge 10:19) In the past Gerar was commonly linked with Tell Jemmeh (Tel Gamma), about 12 km (7.5 mi) S of modern Gaza. But currently it is identified by numerous geographers with Tell Abu Hureirah (Tel Haror), located in the foothills of the mountains of Judea, about 19 km (12 mi) SE of modern Gaza. Many earthenware fragments believed to date from the time of the patriarchs have been found at the site. Abraham and, later, Isaac resided for a time as aliens at Gerar and dealt with its king Abimelech (possibly two different rulers that bore this name or official title).​—Ge 20:1-18; 21:22-34; 26:1-31; see ABIMELECH Nos. 1 and 2.
After Jehovah brought about the defeat of the impressive army of Zerah the Ethiopian, King Asa’s forces pursued the fleeing enemy as far as Gerar. Thereafter the Judeans struck and plundered “all the cities round about Gerar” (probably because of their being allied with the Ethiopians); “even the tents with livestock they struck so that they took captive flocks in great number and camels.”​—2Ch 14:8-15.
Some scholars suggest altering 1 Chronicles 4:39, 40 to read “Gerar” (as does LXX) instead of “Gedor.” This passage connects Gedor with a region originally inhabited by the Hamites and having good pasturage, and this description would fit the Biblical references to the area around Gerar.

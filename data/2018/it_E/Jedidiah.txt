JEDIDIAH
(Jed·i·diʹah) [Beloved of Jah].
The name given by Jehovah’s prophet Nathan to the second child of David and Bath-sheba. (2Sa 12:24, 25) The name reflected Jehovah’s love and acceptance of the newborn infant, in contrast with His rejection of their earlier adulterine child, which died soon after birth. (2Sa 12:13-19) In usage the name Jedidiah did not, however, supersede the name Solomon.​—See SOLOMON.

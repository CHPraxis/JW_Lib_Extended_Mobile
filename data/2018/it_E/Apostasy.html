<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">This term in Greek (<em>a·po·sta·siʹa</em>) comes from the verb <em>a·phiʹste·mi,</em> literally meaning “stand away from.” The noun has the sense of “desertion, abandonment or rebellion.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:21:21-44:21:21" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ac 21:21</a>, ftn) In classical Greek the noun was used to refer to political defection, and the verb is evidently employed in this sense at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:5:37-44:5:37" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Acts 5:37</a>, concerning Judas the Galilean who “drew off” (<em>a·peʹste·se,</em> form of <em>a·phiʹste·mi</em>) followers. The Greek <em>Septuagint</em> uses the term at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:14:4-1:14:4" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Genesis 14:4</a> with reference to such a rebellion. However, in the Christian Greek Scriptures it is used primarily with regard to religious defection; a withdrawal or abandonment of the true cause, worship, and service of God, and hence an abandonment of what one has previously professed and a total desertion of principles or faith. The religious leaders of Jerusalem charged Paul with such an apostasy against the Mosaic Law.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">It may properly be said that God’s Adversary was the first apostate, as is indicated by the name Satan. He caused the first human pair to apostatize. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:3:1-1:3:15" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ge 3:1-15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:8:44-43:8:44" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Joh 8:44</a>) Following the Flood, there was a rebellion against the words of the God of Noah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:11:1-1:11:9" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ge 11:1-9</a>) Job later found it necessary to defend himself against the charge of apostasy on the part of his three supposed comforters. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:8:13-18:8:13" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Job 8:13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:15:34-18:15:34" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 15:34;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:20:5-18:20:5" data-bid="6-3" class="b"> 20:5</a>) In his defense Job showed that God grants no audience to the apostate (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:13:16-18:13:16" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Job 13:16</a>), and he also showed the hopeless state of one cut off in apostasy. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:27:8-18:27:8" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Job 27:8</a>; compare also Elihu’s statement at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:34:30-18:34:30" data-bid="9-1" class="b">34:30;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:36:13-18:36:13" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 36:13</a>.) In these cases the Hebrew noun <em>cha·nephʹ</em> is used, meaning “[one] alienated from God,” that is, an apostate. The related verb <em>cha·nephʹ</em> means “be inclined away from the right relation to God,” or “pollute, lead to apostasy.”​—<em>Lexicon in Veteris Testamenti Libros,</em> by L. Koehler and W. Baumgartner, Leiden, 1958, p. 317.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><strong>Apostasy in Israel.</strong> The first two commandments of the Law condemned all apostasy. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:20:3-2:20:6" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ex 20:3-6</a>) And before Israel’s entry into the Promised Land, they were warned against the grave danger of apostasy resulting from marriages with the people of the land. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:7:3-5:7:4" data-bid="11-1" class="b">De 7:3, 4</a>) Even though a person who was inciting others to apostasy was a close relative or a marriage mate, he was to be put to death for having “spoken of revolt against Jehovah your God.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:13:1-5:13:15" data-bid="12-1" class="b">De 13:1-15</a>) The tribes of Reuben, Gad, and Manasseh were quick to exonerate themselves of a charge of apostasy that arose because of their construction of an altar.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:22:21-6:22:29" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Jos 22:21-29</a>.</p>

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">An apostasy among professed Christians was foretold by the apostle Paul at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/53:2:3-53:2:3" data-bid="25-1" class="b">2 Thessalonians 2:3</a>. He specifically mentioned certain apostates, such as Hymenaeus, Alexander, and Philetus.

While still making profession of faith in God’s Word, apostates may forsake his service by treating lightly the preaching and teaching work that he assigned to followers of Jesus Christ.

<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">During the period of persecution that the early Christian congregation experienced at the hands of the Roman Empire, professed Christians were at times induced to deny their Christian discipleship, and those who did so were required to signify their apostasy by making an incense offering before some pagan god or by openly blaspheming the name of Christ.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">It is evident that there is a distinction between a ‘falling’ due to weakness and the ‘falling away’ that constitutes apostasy.

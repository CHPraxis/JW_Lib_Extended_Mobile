<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">One of the cities of King Hadadezer of Zobah from which David took large amounts of copper, later used in the temple construction. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:18:8-13:18:8" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1Ch 18:8</a>) In the parallel account at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:8:8-10:8:8" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Samuel 8:8</a> the name Berothai appears in its place and may refer to the same place. Others suggest that Kuna at Ras Baʽalbek, 43 km (27 mi) NE of Bereitan, the suggested location of Berothai, is possibly to be identified with the Biblical Cun.​—See <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200000658/">BEROTHAH, BEROTHAI</a>.</p>

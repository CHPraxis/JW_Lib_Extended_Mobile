GEDEROTHAIM
(Ged·e·ro·thaʹim).
A name that means “Two Stone Pens.” It appears among cities of Judah in the Shephelah, but its location is today unknown. (Jos 15:20, 33, 36) Instead of Gederothaim, the Greek Septuagint reads “and her sheepfolds,” that is, ‘the sheepfolds’ of the previously listed site, Gederah. This reading would drop the total number of cities in the list from 15 to the stated 14. (Jos 15:33-36) Since such an expression would be unusual in such lists, some suggest that the text could be rendered “Gederah or Gederothaim” rather than “Gederah and Gederothaim.”

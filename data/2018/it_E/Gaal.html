<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The son of Ebed who, along with his brothers, came to Shechem and gained the confidence of the landowners there. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:9:26-7:9:26" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Jg 9:26</a>) These landowners had previously strengthened the hand of Abimelech to kill the sons of Jerubbaal (Gideon) and then proceeded to make him king over them. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:9:1-7:9:6" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Jg 9:1-6</a>) Apparently Abimelech constituted Zebul as resident prince of Shechem, while he himself personally lived in Arumah. In time, a bad spirit developed between Abimelech and the landowners of Shechem. So Gaal and his brothers now incited the city to revolt against Abimelech. When Zebul heard of this, he at once sent word to Abimelech, with a recommendation on how to cope with the situation that was developing. Gaal and those with him were defeated in the ensuing battle with King Abimelech and fled back to the city. Finally Zebul drove Gaal and his brothers out of Shechem.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:9:22-7:9:41" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Jg 9:22-41</a>.</p>

DEUEL
(Deuʹel) [God’s Knowledge; God Knows].
One whose son Eliasaph served as the chieftain of the tribe of Gad during Israel’s wilderness wanderings. (Nu 1:14; 7:42, 47; 10:20) In the Masoretic text and the Syriac Peshitta, he is called “Reuel” at Numbers 2:14. This may be due to a scribal error, since the Hebrew letters for “D” and “R” are very similar and the name “Deuel” does, in fact, appear at Numbers 2:14 in the Samaritan Pentateuch, the Latin Vulgate, and over a hundred Hebrew manuscripts.

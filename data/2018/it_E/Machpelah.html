<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">(Mach·peʹlah) [from a root meaning “double,” possibly indicating that the cave had a double entrance or two recesses or receptacles].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The name used with reference to a field and a cave in the vicinity of Hebron, purchased by Abraham from Ephron the Hittite for 400 silver shekels (c. $880). The cave served as a burial place for Abraham’s wife Sarah and for at least five others: Abraham, Isaac, Rebekah, Jacob, and Leah.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:23:14-1:23:19" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ge 23:14-19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:25:9-1:25:9" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 25:9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:49:30-1:49:31" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> 49:30, 31;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:50:13-1:50:13" data-bid="1-4" class="b"> 50:13</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The burial cave is generally identified with Meʽarat HaMakhpela, located in modern Hebron beneath a Moslem mosque within an enclosure called Haram el-Khalil.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">At <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:23:17-1:23:17" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Genesis 23:17</a> the Hebrew-language term indicating the position of the cave of Machpelah in relation to Mamre has been variously rendered “east of” (<em>RS</em>), “before” (<em>AS</em>), “near” (<em>BE</em>), “opposite” (<em>JB</em>), and “in front of Mamre” (<em>NW</em>). If the traditional location of Mamre (er-Ramat el-Khalil) is correct, the rendering “east of Mamre” would not be appropriate, since this site lies about 3 km (2 mi) N of modern Hebron. The phrase “Mamre, that is to say, Hebron” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:23:19-1:23:19" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ge 23:19</a>), may mean that Mamre was in the district of Hebron.</p>

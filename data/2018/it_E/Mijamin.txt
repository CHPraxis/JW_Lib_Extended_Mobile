MIJAMIN
(Mijʹa·min) [From the Right Hand].
1. Descendant of Aaron selected by lot to head the sixth division of priestly service in King David’s day.​—1Ch 24:1, 3, 5, 9.
2. One of the heads of the priests who returned from Babylon with Zerubbabel. (Ne 12:1, 5, 7) He may have founded the paternal house of Miniamin mentioned at Nehemiah 12:17 (where the name of the head of that house appears to have been an inadvertent scribal omission in the Hebrew text).
3. One of “the sons of Parosh” who sent away foreign “wives along with sons” as Ezra counseled.​—Ezr 10:25, 44.
4. A priest (or possibly the ancestor of a priest) listed among those attesting by seal the “trustworthy arrangement” of Nehemiah’s time. (Ne 9:38; 10:1, 7, 8) He seems to be identical with the Miniamin of Nehemiah 12:41.
In Hebrew, Mijamin seems to be a contraction of the name Miniamin.

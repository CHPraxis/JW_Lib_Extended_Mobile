SHEAR-JASHUB
(Sheʹar-jaʹshub) [A Mere Remnant (Those Remaining Over) Will Return].
The first son of Isaiah. Shear-jashub went along when Isaiah delivered a prophetic message to King Ahaz at the time of Israelite King Pekah’s invasion of Judah. (Isa 7:1, 3) Isaiah and his sons were to serve as signs and miracles from Jehovah in Israel; hence Shear-jashub’s name foretold that ‘a mere remnant would return’ from Babylonian exile.​—Isa 8:18; 10:21.

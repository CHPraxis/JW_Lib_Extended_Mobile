HERES
(Heʹres) [Sun].
1. A mount (Heb., har) where Amorites kept dwelling despite Israel’s conquest of Canaan. It is associated with the territory of the tribe of Dan. (Jg 1:34, 35) Most scholars consider it the equivalent of Ir-shemesh (which is evidently the same as Beth-shemesh on the boundary of Judah and Dan) mentioned at Joshua 19:41.​—See BETH-SHEMESH No. 1.
2. Gideon returned from warring against the Midianites by “the pass that goes up to Heres.” This place is unknown outside the Biblical reference at Judges 8:13. Some scholars therefore suggest that the Hebrew text may have originally read “before the sun [ha·cheʹres] was up,” or “from up in the mountains,” instead of “the pass that goes up to Heres.”

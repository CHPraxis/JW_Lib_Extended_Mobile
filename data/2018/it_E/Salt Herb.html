<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">[Heb., <em>mal·luʹach</em>].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">This term is mentioned only once in Scripture as a food eaten by those of little account. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:30:4-18:30:4" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Job 30:4</a>) The original-language word is considered to be derived from a root meaning “salt,” and it has also been translated “salt-wort” (<em>AS, AT, Da</em>), “cress” (<em>Fn</em>), “grass” (<em>Dy</em>), and “mallow(s)” (<em>KJ, Le, RS</em>). The rendering “mallows” appears to have resulted from the similarity between the Hebrew word <em>mal·luʹach</em> and the Greek word <em>mo·loʹkhe,</em> which is believed to be related to the English designation “mallow.” However, at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:30:4-18:30:4" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Job 30:4</a> the translators of the Greek <em>Septuagint</em> did not use <em>mo·loʹkhe</em> but <em>haʹli·ma</em> (“salt herbs,” <em>LXX,</em> Bagster), and <em>haʹli·ma,</em> like <em>mal·luʹach,</em> is thought to refer either to the salty taste of the plant or to the region where it grows.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The plant most frequently suggested as corresponding to the <em>mal·luʹach</em> of the Bible is sea purslane or shrubby orache (<em>Atriplex halimus</em>). Ordinarily this bushy shrub grows 1 to 2 m (3 to 6.5 ft) high. The plant has small, thick, sour-tasting leaves, and in the spring, it bears tiny purple flowers. It grows in saline soil.</p>

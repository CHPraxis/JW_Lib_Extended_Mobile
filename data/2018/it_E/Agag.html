<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The name or title applied to more than one king of the Amalekites.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><strong>1.</strong> Balaam, in his third prophetic utterance, foretold that a king of Israel would be “higher than Agag, and his kingdom will be lifted up.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:24:7-4:24:7" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Nu 24:7</a>) These words were spoken about 1473 B.C.E., and no subsequent reference is made to Agag until the reign of King Saul (1117-1078 B.C.E.). Because of this some scholars suggest that “Agag” was a title used by the kings of the Amalekites similar to the title of Pharaoh used by the kings of Egypt. It may also be simply a case of the repeated use of a personal name. At any rate the manner of Balaam’s reference to Agag indicates that his kingdom was at that time a powerful one.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:24:20-4:24:20" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Nu 24:20</a>; see <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200000216/">AMALEK, AMALEKITES</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><strong>2.</strong> The king of Amalek who was defeated by King Saul in fulfillment of Jehovah’s decree. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:17:14-2:17:14" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ex 17:14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:25:17-5:25:19" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> De 25:17-19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:15:1-9:15:7" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> 1Sa 15:1-7</a>) However, Saul failed to execute Agag and allowed the people to keep some of the spoil, and this resulted in Samuel’s pronouncement of God’s rejection of Saul as king. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:15:8-9:15:29" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1Sa 15:8-29</a>) Agag was then executed by Samuel, who told him: “Just as your sword has bereaved women of children, in that way your mother will be most bereaved of children among women.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:15:32-9:15:33" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1Sa 15:32, 33</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:1:5-7:1:7" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Jg 1:5-7</a>.</p>

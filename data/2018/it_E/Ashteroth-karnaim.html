<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The site of the defeat of the Rephaim by Chedorlaomer, king of Elam. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:14:5-1:14:5" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ge 14:5</a>) Some have supposed it to be the full name for Ashtaroth and that the addition of “karnaim” (horns) refers to the two horns of the crescent moon symbolizing the goddess Astarte or to twin peaks adjacent to the town. However, it is also suggested that the name means “Ashteroth Near Karnaim” and that it thus refers to the city of Ashtaroth with Karnaim being mentioned as a separate but adjacent town. Karnaim is considered to be located at Sheikh Saʽad, which lies in the vicinity of the generally accepted site of Ashtaroth (Tell ʽAshtarah).​—See <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200000426/">ASHTAROTH</a>.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">In its general meaning the Hebrew noun <em>ger</em> refers to anyone who is residing as an alien outside his native land and who is restricted in civil rights. He may or may not have religious connections with the natives of the land in which he resides. Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their descendants were referred to as such before they were given legal title to the Promised Land.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:15:13-1:15:13" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ge 15:13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:17:8-1:17:8" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 17:8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:23:7-5:23:7" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> De 23:7</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">When the Bible refers to a person of non-Israelite origin in relation to the Israelite commonwealth, the designation “alien resident” sometimes applies to one of these who had become a proselyte or a full worshiper of Jehovah. At times it refers to a settler in the land of Palestine who was content to live among the Israelites, obeying the fundamental laws of the land but not fully accepting the worship of Jehovah. The context determines to which class the term applies.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The Greek <em>Septuagint</em> translates <em>ger</em> as proselyte (Gr., <em>pro·seʹly·tos</em>) more than 70 times. Some suggest that often the alien resident attached himself to a Hebrew household for protection and was somewhat of a dependent but still distinguished from a slave. This is inferred from the expression “your alien resident.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:5:14-5:5:14" data-bid="2-1" class="b">De 5:14</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:1:16-5:1:16" data-bid="3-1" class="b">De 1:16</a>; also <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:22:10-3:22:10" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Le 22:10</a>, where the term <em>toh·shavʹ,</em> meaning “settler,” is used.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">When the Law covenant was transmitted at Mount Sinai, special legislation was embodied governing, in a very loving spirit, the relationship of the alien resident to the natural Israelite. Being at a disadvantage because of not being a natural-born Israelite, the alien resident was given special consideration and protection under the Law covenant, which had many provisions for the weak and vulnerable. Regularly Jehovah called Israel’s attention to the fact that they themselves knew the afflictions that beset an alien resident in a land not his own and hence should extend to the alien residents among themselves the generous and protective spirit that they had not received. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:22:21-2:22:21" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ex 22:21;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:23:9-2:23:9" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 23:9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:10:18-5:10:18" data-bid="5-3" class="b"> De 10:18</a>) Basically, the alien resident, especially the proselyte, was to be treated as a brother.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:19:33-3:19:34" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Le 19:33, 34</a>.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Although the terms of the Law covenant allowed for persons of all national backgrounds to come into membership of the congregation of Israel by accepting the true worship of Jehovah and becoming circumcised, there were exceptions and <span id="page73" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="73" data-before-text="73"></span>restrictions. The Egyptians and Edomites could not enter into the congregation until the third generation, that is, the third generation living in the land of Israel. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:23:7-5:23:8" data-bid="7-1" class="b">De 23:7, 8</a>) Illegitimate sons and their descendants were denied entry into the congregation “to the tenth generation.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:23:2-5:23:2" data-bid="8-1" class="b">De 23:2</a>) Ammonites and Moabites were prohibited “to the tenth generation . . . to time indefinite . . . You must not work for their peace and their prosperity all your days to time indefinite.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:23:3-5:23:6" data-bid="9-1" class="b">De 23:3-6</a>) These restrictions all applied to males of these nations.

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">The alien resident who had become a circumcised worshiper was bound to one law with the Israelites, that is, to obey all the terms of the Law covenant.

<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Alien residents, not having any land inheritance, might be merchants or hired laborers. Some were slaves.

<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">During the period of the kings the alien residents continued to enjoy favorable relations.

<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">The prophet Ezekiel foretold a time when the alien resident would receive an inheritance in the land like a native among the sons of Israel.

Then, in the time of Cornelius (36 C.E.), an uncircumcised Gentile and his household were accepted by Jehovah, receiving gifts of the spirit. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:10:1-44:10:48" data-bid="44-1" class="b">Ac 10</a>) From that time on, uncircumcised Gentiles, upon accepting Christ, were admitted into the Christian congregation, “where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, foreigner, Scythian, slave, freeman, but Christ is all things and in all.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:3:11-51:3:11" data-bid="45-1" class="b">Col 3:11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:3:28-48:3:28" data-bid="45-2" class="b"> Ga 3:28</a>) <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:7:2-66:7:8" data-bid="46-1" class="b">Revelation 7:2-8</a> describes spiritual Israel as made up of 12 tribes of 12,000 each.

<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb"><strong>Settler.</strong> A settler was an inhabitant of a land or country not his own. The Hebrew word for settler (<em>toh·shavʹ</em>) comes from the root verb <em>ya·shavʹ,</em> meaning “dwell.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:20:15-1:20:15" data-bid="48-1" class="b">Ge 20:15</a>) Evidently some of the settlers in Israel became proselytes; others were content to dwell with the Israelites and to obey the fundamental laws of the land but did not become worshipers of Jehovah as did circumcised proselytes. The settler was distinguished from the foreigner, who was generally a transient and was only extended the hospitality that is usually accorded guests in the Orient.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">The settler who was an uncircumcised dweller in the land did not eat of the Passover or of anything holy.

<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb"><strong>Stranger.</strong> The Hebrew word for stranger (<em>zar</em>) evidently comes from the root <em>zur,</em> meaning “turn aside; become estranged” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:78:30-19:78:30" data-bid="54-1" class="b">Ps 78:30;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:69:8-19:69:8" data-bid="54-2" class="b"> 69:8</a>) and thus has the basic meaning “one who distances or removes himself.”​<em>—Theological Dictionary of the Old Testament,</em> edited by G. Botterweck and H. Ringgren, 1980, Vol. 4, p. 53.</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">The considering of persons as strangers was done in matters pertaining to the Aaronic family and the tribe of Levi, and it affected the natural Israelite and the alien resident, as well as all other persons.

<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">Strangers in the sense of persons with whom one is unacquainted, or foreigners, are also referred to in the Hebrew Scriptures.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:3:18-11:3:18" data-bid="68-1" class="b">1Ki 3:18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:19:15-18:19:15" data-bid="68-2" class="b"> Job 19:15</a>.</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb"><strong><em>Christian principles regarding strangers.</em></strong> In the Christian Greek Scriptures love toward the stranger (Gr., <em>xeʹnos</em>) is strongly emphasized as a quality the Christian must exercise. The apostle Paul says: “Do not forget hospitality [Gr., <em>phi·lo·xe·niʹas,</em> “fondness for strangers”], for through it <span id="page75" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="75" data-before-text="75"></span>some, unknown to themselves, entertained angels.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:13:2-58:13:2" data-bid="69-1" class="b">Heb 13:2</a>) Jesus showed that he counts hospitality extended to his brothers, strangers or unacquainted though they may be at the time, as having been extended toward him. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:25:34-40:25:46" data-bid="70-1" class="b">Mt 25:34-46</a>) The apostle John wrote commending Gaius for his good works toward Christian men, strangers to Gaius, sent to visit the congregation of which Gaius was a member, and he condemns Diotrephes, who showed them no respect.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/64:1:5-64:1:10" data-bid="71-1" class="b">3Jo 5-10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:5:10-54:5:10" data-bid="71-2" class="b"> 1Ti 5:10</a>.</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">Christians are termed “aliens” and “temporary residents” in the sense that they are no part of this world.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:2:11-60:2:11" data-bid="73-1" class="b">1Pe 2:11</a>) Those of the Gentile nations, once “strangers to the covenants of the promise,” without hope and “without God in the world,” are, through Christ, “no longer strangers and alien residents,” but “fellow citizens of the holy ones and are members of the household of God.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:2:11-49:2:12" data-bid="74-1" class="b">Eph 2:11, 12,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:2:19-49:2:19" data-bid="74-2" class="b"> 19</a>) The “other sheep” that Jesus said he would gather into the “one flock” likewise take a position separate from the world, with favor of God and hope of life.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:10:16-43:10:16" data-bid="75-1" class="b">Joh 10:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:25:33-40:25:34" data-bid="75-2" class="b"> Mt 25:33, 34,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:25:46-40:25:46" data-bid="75-3" class="b"> 46</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:7:9-66:7:17" data-bid="76-1" class="b">Re 7:9-17</a>.</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">One who attempts to gather religious followers to himself is termed by Christ as “a thief” and “a stranger,” one dangerous to Christ’s “sheep,” and is considered a false shepherd. Jesus’ true “sheep” will give no recognition to a false shepherd’s voice, just as the faithful Israelites kept themselves separate from the foreigner who advocated strange gods.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:10:1-43:10:1" data-bid="77-1" class="b">Joh 10:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:10:5-43:10:5" data-bid="77-2" class="b"> 5</a>; see <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200001548/">FOREIGNER</a>.</p>

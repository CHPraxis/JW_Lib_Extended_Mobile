<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">(Doʹeg) [possibly, Anxious; In Fright].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">An Edomite serving as King Saul’s principal shepherd, a responsible position of oversight. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:21:7-9:21:7" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1Sa 21:7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:22:9-9:22:9" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 22:9</a>) Doeg evidently was a proselyte. Because of being “detained before Jehovah” at Nob, possibly on account of a vow, some uncleanness, or suspected leprosy, Doeg witnessed High Priest Ahimelech’s providing David with showbread and the sword of Goliath. Later, when Saul, in addressing his servants, voiced the opinion that they were conspiring against him, Doeg revealed what he had seen at Nob. After summoning the high priest as well as the other priests of Nob and then questioning Ahimelech, Saul ordered the runners to put the priests to death. When these refused, Doeg, at Saul’s command, unhesitatingly killed a total of 85 priests. After this wicked act, Doeg devoted Nob to destruction, slaughtering all of its inhabitants, young and old, as well as the livestock.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:22:6-9:22:20" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1Sa 22:6-20</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">As indicated by the <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:52:0-19:52:0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">superscription of Psalm 52</a>, David wrote concerning Doeg: “Adversities your tongue schemes up, sharpened like a razor, working deceitfully. You have loved what is bad more than what is good, falsehood more than speaking righteousness. You have loved all devouring words, O you deceitful tongue.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:52:2-19:52:4" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ps 52:2-4</a>.</p>

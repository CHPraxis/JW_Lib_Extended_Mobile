<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Cities of a particular people or tribe that are enclosed within the territory of a different tribe. Modern-day examples of enclaves have included West Berlin, surrounded by the territory of East Germany, and the property given to the United Nations, totally enclosed within New York City. A part of ancient Jerusalem remained a Jebusite enclave within Israel’s territory <span id="page724" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="724" data-before-text="724"></span>for four centuries until David finally captured it.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:15:63-6:15:63" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Jos 15:63;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:1:21-7:1:21" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Jg 1:21;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:19:11-7:19:12" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> 19:11, 12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:5:6-10:5:9" data-bid="1-4" class="b"> 2Sa 5:6-9</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">In the division of the Promised Land among the 12 tribes, there were cities within the general territory of one tribe that were held by another tribe. According to <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:16:9-6:16:9" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Joshua 16:9</a>, “the sons of Ephraim had enclave [or, “separated; isolated”] cities in the midst of the inheritance of the sons of Manasseh” (<em>NW,</em> ftn), that is, “towns set apart for the Ephraimites inside the inheritance of the sons of Manasseh.” (<em>JB;</em> see also <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:17:8-6:17:9" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Jos 17:8, 9</a>.) Some of the sons of Manasseh resided in towns within the boundaries of Issachar and Asher.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:17:11-6:17:11" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Jos 17:11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:7:29-13:7:29" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 1Ch 7:29</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Simeon’s inheritance consisted of cities that were located within Judah’s territory, because the latter’s allotment “proved to be too large for them.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:19:1-6:19:9" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Jos 19:1-9</a>; MAPS, Vol. 1 pp. 744, 947) The 48 cities administered by the Levites, including the 6 cities of refuge, were all enclaves in the territory of other tribes. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:21:3-6:21:41" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Jos 21:3-41</a>) In this manner Jacob’s deathbed prophecy concerning Simeon and Levi was fulfilled, that ‘they shall have a portion in Jacob, but will be scattered in Israel.’​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:49:7-1:49:7" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ge 49:7</a>.</p>

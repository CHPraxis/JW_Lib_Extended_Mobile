EPHRATHITE
(Ephʹrath·ite).
1. An inhabitant of Bethlehem, or Ephrathah.​—Ru 1:2; 1Sa 17:12.
2. In Hebrew the same term is applied to a member of the tribe of Ephraim (Jg 12:5; 1Ki 11:26) or to one residing in Ephraim, as in the genealogy of the Levite Elkanah. (1Sa 1:1) The King James Version renders the Hebrew term as “Ephrathite” in two of these texts.

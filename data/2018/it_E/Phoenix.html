<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“A harbor of Crete.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:27:12-44:27:12" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ac 27:12</a>) The grain boat on which Paul was traveling as a prisoner to Rome attempted to sail from Fair Havens to Phoenix for winter anchorage. Seized by a storm, it was subsequently wrecked on the island of Malta.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:27:13-44:28:1" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ac 27:13–28:1</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">As to the location of Phoenix, the Acts narrative indicates only that it was W of Fair Havens, on the S side of Crete, and that it provided safe winter anchorage. Two sites have therefore been proposed. One is Loutro, on the E side of a cape, about 65 km (40 mi) W of Fair Havens, and the other Phineka, on the opposite side of this cape. The literal Greek text describes the harbor at Phoenix as “looking down [<em>ka·taʹ</em>] the southwest wind and down [<em>ka·taʹ</em>] the northwest wind.” Scholars favoring Loutro interpret this to mean looking “along” or “toward” (<em>ka·taʹ</em>) the direction in which the SW and NW winds are blowing. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:27:12-44:27:12" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ac 27:12</a>, ftn) By this understanding the harbor is said to open ‘toward the NE and the SE’ (<em>RS, NW</em>), a description that could fit the large semicircular entrance to the harbor at Loutro. Phineka, because of its structure, is not used as a harbor today, though geologic changes in the vicinity may have affected its formation. However, Phineka does have two inlets, one <em>facing</em> SW and the other NW. Thus, those favoring this site understand the expression “looking down” to mean facing the direction from which the winds <em>originate</em> rather than that in which they blow.</p>

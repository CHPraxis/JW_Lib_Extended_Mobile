<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The disciple selected by lot to replace Judas Iscariot as an apostle. After Jesus’ ascension to heaven, Peter, noting that not only had the psalmist David foretold Judas’ deflection (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:41:9-19:41:9" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ps 41:9</a>) but David had also written (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:109:8-19:109:8" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ps 109:8</a>) “his office of oversight let someone else take,” proposed to the approximately 120 disciples gathered together that the vacancy of office be filled. Joseph Barsabbas and Matthias were put up for selection; after prayer, lots were cast, and Matthias was chosen.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:10:1-42:10:1" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Lu 10:1</a>) After his selection, he was “reckoned along with the eleven apostles” by the congregation (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:1:26-44:1:26" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ac 1:26</a>), and when the book of Acts immediately thereafter speaks of “the apostles” or “the twelve,” Matthias was included.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:2:37-44:2:37" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ac 2:37,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:2:43-44:2:43" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 43;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:4:33-44:4:33" data-bid="7-3" class="b"> 4:33,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:4:36-44:4:36" data-bid="7-4" class="b"> 36;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:5:12-44:5:12" data-bid="7-5" class="b"> 5:12,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:5:29-44:5:29" data-bid="7-6" class="b"> 29;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:6:2-44:6:2" data-bid="7-7" class="b"> 6:2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:6:6-44:6:6" data-bid="7-8" class="b"> 6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:8:1-44:8:1" data-bid="7-9" class="b"> 8:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:8:14-44:8:14" data-bid="7-10" class="b"> 14</a>; see <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200003406/">PAUL</a>.</p>

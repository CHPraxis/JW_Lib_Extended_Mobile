ENCLAVE CITIES
Cities of a particular people or tribe that are enclosed within the territory of a different tribe. Modern-day examples of enclaves have included West Berlin, surrounded by the territory of East Germany, and the property given to the United Nations, totally enclosed within New York City. A part of ancient Jerusalem remained a Jebusite enclave within Israel’s territory for four centuries until David finally captured it.​—Jos 15:63; Jg 1:21; 19:11, 12; 2Sa 5:6-9.
In the division of the Promised Land among the 12 tribes, there were cities within the general territory of one tribe that were held by another tribe. According to Joshua 16:9, “the sons of Ephraim had enclave [or, “separated; isolated”] cities in the midst of the inheritance of the sons of Manasseh” (NW, ftn), that is, “towns set apart for the Ephraimites inside the inheritance of the sons of Manasseh.” (JB; see also Jos 17:8, 9.) Some of the sons of Manasseh resided in towns within the boundaries of Issachar and Asher.​—Jos 17:11; 1Ch 7:29.
Simeon’s inheritance consisted of cities that were located within Judah’s territory, because the latter’s allotment “proved to be too large for them.” (Jos 19:1-9; MAPS, Vol. 1 pp. 744, 947) The 48 cities administered by the Levites, including the 6 cities of refuge, were all enclaves in the territory of other tribes. (Jos 21:3-41) In this manner Jacob’s deathbed prophecy concerning Simeon and Levi was fulfilled, that ‘they shall have a portion in Jacob, but will be scattered in Israel.’​—Ge 49:7.

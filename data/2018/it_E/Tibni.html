<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">(Tibʹni).</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A contender for the kingship of the ten-tribe kingdom of Israel following the seven-day rule of Israel’s fifth king Zimri in about 951 B.C.E. The populace was divided over whether Tibni or Omri should now be king. Four years later, during which time civil war presumably raged, the issue was finally settled; Tibni lost to Omri’s supporters and met death. He was a son of Ginath.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:16:15-11:16:15" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1Ki 16:15,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:16:21-11:16:23" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 21-23</a>.</p>

The Tabernacle




AT Jehovah’s direction, the tabernacle was first set up in 1512 B.C.E. in the wilderness at Mount Sinai. It was the center for true worship for Israel; it was also at the center of the Israelite camp. The apostle Paul explains that the tabernacle was a prophetic illustration of “the greater and more perfect tent,” God’s great place of worship.​—Heb 9:9, 11.

The high priest foreshadowed Jesus Christ (Heb 4:14; 9:11)







The high priest sprinkling blood of animal sacrifices in front of the ark of the covenant. This foreshadowed Jesus’ presenting the value of his perfect human sacrifice in heaven, before the presence of God (Heb 9:13, 14, 24)







Animal sacrifices commanded by God pointed forward to the sacrificial death of Jesus Christ as a ransom for mankind (Mt 20:28; Heb 10:5-10)

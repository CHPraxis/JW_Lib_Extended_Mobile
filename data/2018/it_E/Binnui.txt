BINNUI
(Binʹnu·i) [shortened form of Benaiah, meaning “Jehovah Has Built”].
1. A forefather in Israel whose descendants, over 600 in number, returned to Jerusalem in 537 B.C.E. (Ne 7:6, 7, 15) He is called Bani at Ezra 2:10.
2. A Levite who returned with Zerubbabel, 537 B.C.E. (Ne 12:1, 8) Apparently it was his son Noadiah who helped care for the additional temple utensils when Ezra delivered them to the temple in Jerusalem in 468 B.C.E.​—Ezr 8:33.
3. One of “the sons of Pahath-moab” who, at Ezra’s encouragement, sent away their foreign wives and sons.​—Ezr 10:30, 44.
4. An Israelite, several of whose “sons” dismissed their foreign wives.​—Ezr 10:38, 44.
5. An Israelite who assisted Nehemiah with rebuilding Jerusalem’s wall. (Ne 3:24) This son of Henadad may have been the same as No. 6.
6. One of the Levitical sons of Henadad. Possibly the forefather of one who concurred in the “trustworthy arrangement” in the days of Nehemiah; in which case he could be the same as No. 2. (Ne 9:38; 10:1, 9) If, on the other hand, Binnui himself sealed this agreement, instead of one of his descendants, he could have been the same as No. 5. Or he may have simply been another person with that name.

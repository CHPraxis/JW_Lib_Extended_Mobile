<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The Perizzites were one of the seven populous and mighty nations that Jehovah repeatedly commanded Israel to exterminate upon entering the Promised Land. No covenant or marriage alliance was to be made with them, nor was favor to be granted them. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:23:23-2:23:24" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ex 23:23, 24;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:33:2-2:33:2" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 33:2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:34:11-2:34:13" data-bid="7-3" class="b"> 34:11-13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:7:1-5:7:3" data-bid="7-4" class="b"> De 7:1-3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:3:10-6:3:10" data-bid="7-5" class="b"> Jos 3:10</a>) However, the Israelites failed to exterminate them, and as foretold, the Perizzites became a snare to Israel.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:7:4-5:7:4" data-bid="8-1" class="b">De 7:4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:20:17-5:20:18" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 20:17, 18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:3:5-7:3:6" data-bid="8-3" class="b"> Jg 3:5, 6</a>.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">In Solomon’s time some remaining Perizzites were conscripted for forced labor. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:9:20-11:9:21" data-bid="9-1" class="b">1Ki 9:20, 21;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:8:7-14:8:8" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 2Ch 8:7, 8</a>) Ezra found that the Jews who had returned from Babylonian exile had entered into marriage alliances with them. However, on his counsel they put away such foreign wives.

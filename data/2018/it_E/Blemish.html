<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A physical or moral defect, imperfection; unsoundness; “anything bad.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:17:1-5:17:1" data-bid="1-1" class="b">De 17:1</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The Hebrew word for a physical or moral “defect” is <em>mum.</em> (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:21:17-3:21:17" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Le 21:17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:31:7-18:31:7" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Job 31:7</a>) The Greek <em>moʹmos</em> means “blemish,” while the related <em>aʹmo·mos</em> means “without blemish.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:2:13-61:2:13" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2Pe 2:13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:1:4-49:1:4" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Eph 1:4</a>) Both are related to the root <em>mo·maʹo·mai,</em> meaning “find fault with.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:6:3-47:6:3" data-bid="4-1" class="b">2Co 6:3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:8:20-47:8:20" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 8:20</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">In contrast with Jehovah, who is ‘perfect in his activity [“without blemish (spotless) are his works,” <em>Sy</em>],’ of Israel God said: “They have acted ruinously on their own part; they are not his children, the defect is their own.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:32:4-5:32:5" data-bid="5-1" class="b">De 32:4, 5</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">A Levitical priest ministering before the God of perfection, therefore, had to be free from such physical blemishes as blindness, lameness, a slit nose, abnormalities such as an elongated hand, a hunched back, fractured hand, consumptive thinness, eye or skin diseases, a broken hand or foot, and broken or crushed testicles. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:21:18-3:21:20" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Le 21:18-20</a>) Free from such defects, Israel’s high priest well represented the Great High Priest Jesus Christ, who is “guileless, undefiled.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:7:26-58:7:26" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Heb 7:26</a>.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Soundness, freedom from blemish, was required of the sacrificial animals under the Mosaic Law. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:12:5-2:12:5" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Ex 12:5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:4:3-3:4:3" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> Le 4:3,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:4:28-3:4:28" data-bid="8-3" class="b"> 28;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:15:21-5:15:21" data-bid="8-4" class="b"> De 15:21</a>) The same was also true of the sacrifices in connection with the pictorial temple envisioned by Ezekiel. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:43:22-26:43:23" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Eze 43:22, 23</a>) In like manner, Christ, “an unblemished and spotless lamb,” “offered himself without blemish to God.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:1:19-60:1:19" data-bid="10-1" class="b">1Pe 1:19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:9:14-58:9:14" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> Heb 9:14</a>.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Among persons whose physical appearance is described as having “no defect” were Absalom, the Shulammite girl, and certain sons of Israel in Babylon. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:14:25-10:14:25" data-bid="11-1" class="b">2Sa 14:25;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/22:4:7-22:4:7" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> Ca 4:7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:1:4-27:1:4" data-bid="11-3" class="b"> Da 1:4</a>) Everyone under the Law was encouraged to watch out for and protect one another, lest they become blemished in any way. “In case a man should cause a defect in his associate, then just as he has done, so it should be done to him. Fracture for fracture, eye <span id="page340" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="340" data-before-text="340"></span>for eye, tooth for tooth; the same sort of defect he may cause in the man, that is what should be caused in him.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:24:19-3:24:20" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Le 24:19, 20</a>) The apostle expressed concern over keeping the Christian congregation free from blemishes in a spiritual sense.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:1:4-49:1:4" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Eph 1:4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:5:27-49:5:27" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 5:27;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:1:22-51:1:22" data-bid="13-3" class="b"> Col 1:22</a>; see also <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/65:1:24-65:1:24" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Jude 24</a>.</p>

RABBI
The designation “Rabbi” was used in a de facto sense as “teacher.” (Joh 1:38) But among the Jews, shortly before the birth of Jesus, it came to be used also as a form of address and as a title of respect and honor meaning “my great one; my excellent one.” The title was demanded by some of the learned men, scribes, teachers of the Law. They delighted to be called “Rabbi” as an honorary title. Jesus Christ condemned such title-seeking and forbade his followers to be called “Rabbi,” as he was their teacher.​—Mt 23:6-8.
In the Bible the term “Rabbi” is used only in the Christian Greek Scriptures. It is employed 12 times in connection with Jesus, in the de facto sense of “Teacher”: twice by Peter (Mr 9:5; 11:21), once by two disciples of John (Joh 1:38), once by Nathanael (Joh 1:49), once by Nicodemus (Joh 3:2), three times by disciples of Jesus whose names are not specified (Joh 4:31; 9:2; 11:8), once by the crowds (Joh 6:25), and two times by Judas (one instance is repeated) (Mt 26:25, 49; Mr 14:45). Jesus is addressed by Mary Magdalene as “Rabboni” (My Teacher), also by a blind man whom he healed. The personal pronoun “my” is a suffix here, but because of usage it seems to have lost its significance, as in Monsieur, originally meaning “my lord.” (Joh 20:16; Mr 10:51) John the Baptizer is once addressed as Rabbi.​—Joh 3:26.

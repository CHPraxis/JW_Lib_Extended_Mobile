Early Human Life of Jesus




THE Bible’s record of Jesus’ early life is brief but specific. It is not a fanciful story but is historical fact. It involves places that can be visited even now​—Bethlehem, Egypt, Nazareth, and Jerusalem. The Bible’s dating and explanation of events involves such prominent persons as Caesar Augustus, Governor Quirinius, King Herod the Great, and Archelaus​—all of whom are known from secular history.

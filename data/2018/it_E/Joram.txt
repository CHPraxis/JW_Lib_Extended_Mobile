JORAM
(Joʹram) [shortened form of Jehoram, meaning “Jehovah Is High (Exalted)”].
1. Son of King Toi of Hamath. Joram was sent with costly gifts made of gold, silver, and copper, along with his father’s congratulations, to King David when the latter defeated Hadadezer the king of Zobah. David, in turn, accepted and sanctified the gifts to Jehovah. (2Sa 8:5, 9-11) In a parallel account Joram’s name is spelled Hadoram.​—1Ch 18:9-11.
2. A descendant of Levite Eliezer, Moses’ son; he apparently lived when David was king.​—1Ch 26:24, 25; Ex 18:2-4.
3. King of Israel for 12 years; son of Ahab. Usually he is identified by the longer form of his name, Jehoram. (2Ki 3:1) Only in three chapters do we find the short form in the Masoretic text.​—2Ki 8:16, ftn, 17-29; 9:14, ftn, 15-29; 2Ch 22:5, ftn, 6, 7; see JEHORAM No. 2.
4. King of Judah for eight years; son of Jehoshaphat. The Masoretic text has his name at times in the short form. (2Ki 8:21, 23, 24; 11:2; 1Ch 3:11, ftn) The shortened form is also found in the Westcott and Hort Greek Text, but a few translations give assistance in understanding by rendering the full name.​—Mt 1:8, NW, Sawyer, TC, We; see JEHORAM No. 3.

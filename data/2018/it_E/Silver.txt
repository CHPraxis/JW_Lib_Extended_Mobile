SILVER
A valuable white metallic element that takes a high polish. Since silver is seldom found in the native state, the base ore has to be smelted and purified to release the silver and separate it from the gangue, dross, and scummy foreign matter, as well as to free it from other metals such as lead. (Ps 12:6; Pr 27:21; Eze 22:20-22; Mal 3:3) At times, the Hebrew term for silver (keʹseph) is rendered “money” and the Greek term for silver (ar·gyʹri·on) is rendered “silver money” or “silver pieces.”​—Ge 17:12, ftn; Mt 25:18; 26:15; see MONEY.
Refined silver had two principal uses. (1) It was used as a measure of wealth and a medium of exchange. Abraham, using this medium of exchange, bought a family burial plot. (Ge 13:2; 23:15-18) Payment was made by weight, since coinage was not devised until centuries later. (2) Objects of beauty and ornamentation were fashioned of this metal from the days of the patriarchs. (Ge 24:53; 44:2; Ex 11:2; 12:35) Silver was employed for Israel’s two trumpets (Nu 10:2), in the construction of the tabernacle (Ex 26:19, 21, 25, 32; 27:10, 11, 17), and in Solomon’s temple (1Ch 28:15-17). It was also used in making idols.​—Ex 20:23; Ho 13:2; Hab 2:19; Ac 19:24.
Silver was treasured by all nations of the past. (2Sa 8:10, 11; 2Ch 9:14) Under Solomon’s rule, not only silver but also gold became so abundant in Jerusalem that silver was counted “as nothing at all,” “like the stones.” (1Ki 10:21, 27; 2Ch 9:20; compare Da 2:32.) Once every three years ships brought cargoes of silver from Tarshish (apparently Spain, which is still a producer of silver).​—1Ki 10:22; 2Ch 9:21; Jer 10:9; Eze 27:12.
In contrast with the transient value of silver, and to be more highly estimated, are the wisdom, discipline, and understanding that come from Jehovah. (Pr 3:13, 14; 8:10, 19; 16:16) Also, the Scriptures use silver in a number of symbolic senses.​—Ec 12:6; Isa 60:17; Da 2:32; 1Co 3:12.

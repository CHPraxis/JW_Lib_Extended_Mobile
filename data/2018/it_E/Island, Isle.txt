ISLAND, ISLE
The Hebrew term ʼi (plural, ʼi·yimʹ) is not restricted to a body of land smaller than a continent and completely surrounded by water (Isa 11:11; 24:15) but also designates dry land (Isa 42:15) or coastland(s). (Isa 20:6; 23:2, 6; Jer 2:10) Figuratively, the word ʼi applies to the inhabitants of such islands or coastlands. (Ge 10:5, ftn; Isa 49:1, ftn; 59:18, ftn) Sometimes “islands” represent the most distant places and their inhabitants. (Isa 41:5; 66:19; Eze 39:6; see MAGOG No. 2.) Thus nothing will be too remote or isolated, like islands in the sea, to escape the effects of the symbolic earthquake on Babylon the Great. (Re 16:18-21; compare Re 6:12-14.) From Jehovah’s standpoint, all the islands are as “mere fine dust.”​—Isa 40:15.
Among the islands specifically named in the Bible are Cyprus (Ac 13:4-6), Cos, Rhodes (Ac 21:1), Crete (Ac 27:7), Cauda (Ac 27:16), Malta (Ac 28:1), and Patmos (Re 1:9).

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><strong>1.</strong> Father of Terah and grandfather of Abraham. Nahor was a son of Serug and descendant of Shem. He lived 148 years (2177 to 2029 B.C.E.).​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:11:22-1:11:26" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ge 11:22-26;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:1:24-13:1:27" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 1Ch 1:24-27;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:3:34-42:3:36" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> Lu 3:34-36</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><strong>2.</strong> Son of Terah; grandson of Nahor (No. 1); and brother of Abraham.

By her he had 8 sons, and by his concubine Reumah he had 4 more sons, totaling 12, some of whom became tribal heads.

<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The Genesis account of Terah and Abraham leaving Ur of the Chaldeans does not include Nahor’s name in the list of travelers. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:11:31-1:11:31" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ge 11:31</a>) It does seem, however, that he may have come later, for Abraham’s servant, seeking a wife for Isaac, traveled to Haran, where Terah took up dwelling and where he died, and where Nahor’s grandson Laban lived when Jacob went to him.

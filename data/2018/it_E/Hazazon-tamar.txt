HAZAZON-TAMAR
(Hazʹa·zon-taʹmar) [Gravel [Slope] of the Palm Tree].
A city inhabited by Amorites and apparently located in the vicinity of the Low Plain of Siddim. King Chedorlaomer and his allies defeated the Amorites dwelling in Hazazon-tamar. (Ge 14:5-8) Centuries later the combined forces of Moab, Ammon, and the mountainous region of Seir came against Judah by way of “Hazazon-tamar, that is to say, En-gedi.” (2Ch 20:2, 10, 11) Many scholars believe that the Genesis reference points to a location some distance S of En-gedi and therefore regard the words “that is to say, En-gedi,” as a late addition. The name “Hazazon-tamar,” however, appears to be preserved in the Wadi Hasasa (Nahal Hazezon) about 10 km (6 mi) N of the suggested site of En-gedi. Also, the meaning of Hazazon-tamar would fit the En-gedi region, described by Josephus as a place where “the finest palm-trees” are grown. (Jewish Antiquities, IX, 7 [i, 2]) So if the Genesis passage refers to a more southerly location, possibly there were two places called Hazazon-tamar: the one linked with En-gedi; the other perhaps the site SW of the Dead Sea that is called simply Tamar.​—Eze 47:19; 48:28.

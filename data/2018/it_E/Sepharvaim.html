<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A city from which the king of Assyria brought people to dwell in Samaria after the Israelites had been taken into exile. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:17:24-12:17:24" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2Ki 17:24</a>) Earlier, Sepharvaim and its king appear to have experienced defeat at the hands of the Assyrians.

ASCENTS
The Hebrew expression Shir ham·ma·ʽalohthʹ, forming the superscription for 15 psalms (Ps 120-134), is variously translated as “A Song of degrees” (KJ), “A gradual canticle” (Dy, Ps 119-133), “A Song of the Stairsteps” (NW ftn on Ps 120:Sup), “A Song of [or, “for the”] Ascents” (AT, RS). Four of these psalms are attributed to David and one to Solomon. The exact meaning of the superscription is a subject of discussion.
At one time Jewish tradition (Mishnah, Middot 2:5) held that these 15 songs were sung by the Levites in ascending the 15 steps from the Court of Women to the Court of Israel at the temple in Jerusalem, but this view is generally discounted today. Some suggest that the phrase refers to the exalted contents of these psalms, though there seems to be little reason thus to elevate them above the other inspired psalms. Most commentators believe the title derives from the use of these psalms by the Israelite worshipers when traveling or ascending to the lofty city of Jerusalem situated high in the mountains of Judah as they joyfully attended the three great annual festivals there. (De 12:5-7; 16:16; Ps 42:4; Isa 30:29) The word ma·ʽalahʹ is used in a similar way at Ezra 7:9 when referring to the “going up” of the Israelites from Babylon to Jerusalem after the exile. The expressions in Psalm 122:1-4 lend themselves well to this view, while the content of the other psalms of this group is of such varied nature as to leave the matter still uncertain.

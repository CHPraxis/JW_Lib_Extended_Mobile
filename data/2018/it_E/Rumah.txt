RUMAH
(Ruʹmah) [Height; Exalted Place].
Home of Zebidah (and her father Pedaiah), a wife of King Josiah of Judah and the mother of Jehoiakim. (2Ki 23:34, 36) Its location is uncertain. It is tentatively identified with Khirbet er-Rumeh, which bears a similar name. Today called Horvat Ruma, it is situated about 10 km (6 mi) N of Nazareth. But some connect Rumah with the Biblical town of Arumah, mentioned at Judges 9:41 and thought to have been located near Shechem.​—See ARUMAH.

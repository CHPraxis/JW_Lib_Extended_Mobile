REPHAN
(Reʹphan).
An astral deity mentioned by Stephen in his defense before the Sanhedrin. (Ac 7:43) Stephen likely quoted from the Greek Septuagint the words of Amos 5:26, 27, to show that Israel’s exile resulted from their worship of foreign deities, such as Rephan (Kaiwan). The translators of the Septuagint rendered “Kaiwan” as Rhai·phanʹ, but in Stephen’s quotation the designation Rhom·phaʹ appears in the Westcott and Hort Greek text. In a note on Acts 7:43, F. J. A. Hort remarked: “In the LXX of Am v 26 the form used is [Rhai·phanʹ] or [Rhe·phanʹ], which is similar to Repa or Repha, one of the names of the Egyptian Saturn (Seb).”​—The New Testament in the Original Greek, by Westcott and Hort, Graz, 1974, Vol. II, appendix, p. 92; see ASTROLOGERS (Molech and Astrology in Israel); KAIWAN.

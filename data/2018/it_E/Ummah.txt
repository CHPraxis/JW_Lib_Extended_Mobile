UMMAH
(Umʹmah).
A city of undetermined location on the boundary of Asher’s territory. (Jos 19:29-31) Some scholars think that “Ummah” resulted from a textual alteration of “Acco” (the latter name appearing here in some manuscripts of the Greek Septuagint and in the list at Jg 1:31), but this is not certain.

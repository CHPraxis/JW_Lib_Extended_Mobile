ATHARIM
(Athʹa·rim).
The Israelites are reported to have traveled “by the way of Atharim” when journeying to the Promised Land from Kadesh-barnea by way of Mount Hor. (Nu 21:1) They were thereupon attacked by the king of Arad in the Negeb region. Atharim may refer to a place or to a particular route.

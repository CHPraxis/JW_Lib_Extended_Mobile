NEHILOTH
(Neʹhi·loth).
A transliteration of nechi·lohthʹ, a Hebrew term of uncertain derivation and meaning, occurring only in the superscription of Psalm 5. Nehiloth appears to be a musical expression, and many believe that it refers to a wind instrument, linking it with a Hebrew root related to cha·lilʹ (flute). However, the phrase “for Nehiloth” may designate a melody. The Greek Septuagint and the Latin Vulgate render the term “[for] her who inherits.”

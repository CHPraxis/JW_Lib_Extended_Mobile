<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><strong>1.</strong> Jacob’s third son by his wife Leah, born in Paddan-aram. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:35:23-1:35:23" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ge 35:23,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:35:26-1:35:26" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 26</a>) At his birth Leah said: “Now this time my husband will join himself to me, because I have borne him three sons.” The boy was therefore called Levi, the meaning of this name evidently being linked with Leah’s hope for a new bond of affection between her and Jacob. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:29:34-1:29:34" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ge 29:34</a>) Levi became the father of Gershon (Gershom), Kohath, and Merari, founders of the three principal divisions of the Levites.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:46:11-1:46:11" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ge 46:11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:6:1-13:6:1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 1Ch 6:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:6:16-13:6:16" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> 16</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Levi, along with his brother Simeon, took drastic action against the defilers of their sister Dinah.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:49:7-1:49:7" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ge 49:7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:21:41-6:21:41" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Jos 21:41</a>) Levi accompanied Jacob into Egypt and died there at 137 years of age.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:1:1-2:1:2" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ex 1:1, 2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:6:16-2:6:16" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 6:16</a>; see <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200002731/">LEVITES</a>.</p>

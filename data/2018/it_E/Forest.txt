FOREST
The Hebrew term for a wooded tract is yaʹʽar, rendered “woods” (De 19:5; 1Sa 14:25) and “forest.” (Jos 17:15) At one time the land of Palestine had abundant forests with trees of many types. The Scriptural references to forests and woodlands and to the use of wood materials make it evident that trees were then much more common there than at present, despite the reforestation efforts in recent years. (2Ch 27:4; Jg 9:48, 49) This is also made certain from the description of wild animal life, showing that the forests were able to provide adequate cover and habitation for bears (2Ki 2:23, 24), lions (1Sa 17:34; 1Ch 11:22), and other forms of animal life (Eze 34:25).
But deforestation of large areas has come about because of the devastation of war, the extensive use of timber with no accompanying effort to replenish the forests, and uncontrolled grazing in which the young shoots of new trees have been eaten by goats and other animals. Denis Baly, in his book The Geography of the Bible (1974, pp. 77, 115, 116), speaks of centuries of neglect, which has resulted in the disappearance of many woodlands and the loss of as much as 2 m (6.5 ft) of fertile soil, leaving much of the land rocky and barren.
Certain forests are specifically mentioned in the Bible. The forests of Lebanon, now reduced to a few small groves, were outstanding for their splendid tree growth (1Ki 5:2-10, 13-18; 2Ki 19:23), with great quantities of cedar, juniper, cypress, and other trees. The “forest of Ephraim” (perhaps “forest of Mahanaim”), in which Absalom met disaster, may have been located E of the Jordan River near Mahanaim, and appears to have been of considerable density. (2Sa 18:6, ftn, 8, 17) “The forest of Hereth” was in Judah. (1Sa 22:5) Additionally, the region of Gilead was famous for its woodlands and balsam trees, while Bashan to the N was noted for its “massive trees,” apparently including the oak. (Isa 2:13; Zec 11:2) In the days of David and Solomon, sycamore trees grew in abundance in the Shephelah lowland. (1Ki 10:27; 1Ch 27:28; 2Ch 1:15; 9:27) The Jordan Valley had a thick growth of tamarisks and willows, where lions lurked.​—Jer 12:5; Zec 11:3.
Symbolic Use. Even as trees are used to symbolize individual persons and rulers, so the Bible uses forests symbolically for peoples or nations and their rulers. The wickedness of apostate Judah was like a flame to burn up her people (Isa 9:18); Jehovah’s anger would burn up the southern kingdom (Judah) with an inextinguishable flame. (Eze 20:46-48) Similar prophecies are given against pagan nations, enemies of God’s people. The Assyrian warriors would be cut down and thinned out like trees of a forest.​—Ps 83:14, 15; Jer 46:22, 23; Isa 10:19, 34.

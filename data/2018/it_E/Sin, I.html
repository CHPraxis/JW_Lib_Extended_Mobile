<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Anything not in harmony with, hence contrary to, God’s personality, standards, ways, and will; anything marring one’s relationship with God. It may be in word (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:2:10-18:2:10" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Job 2:10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:39:1-19:39:1" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Ps 39:1</a>), in deed (doing wrong acts [<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:20:20-3:20:20" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Le 20:20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:12:21-47:12:21" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 2Co 12:21</a>] or failing to do what should be done [<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:9:13-4:9:13" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Nu 9:13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:4:17-59:4:17" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Jas 4:17</a>]), or in mind or heart attitude (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:21:4-20:21:4" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Pr 21:4</a>; compare also <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:3:9-45:3:18" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ro 3:9-18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:2:12-61:2:15" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 2Pe 2:12-15</a>). Lack of faith in God is a major sin, showing, as it does, distrust of him or lack of confidence in his ability to perform. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:3:12-58:3:13" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Heb 3:12, 13,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:3:18-58:3:19" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 18, 19</a>) A consideration of the use of the original-language terms and examples associated with them illustrates this.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The common Hebrew term translated “sin” is <em>chat·taʼthʹ;</em> in Greek the usual word is <em>ha·mar·tiʹa.</em> In both languages the verb forms (Heb., <em>cha·taʼʹ;</em> Gr., <em>ha·mar·taʹno</em>) mean “miss,” in the sense of missing or not reaching a goal, way, mark, or right point. At <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:20:16-7:20:16" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Judges 20:16</a> <em>cha·taʼʹ</em> is used, with a negative, to describe the Benjamites who were ‘slingers of stones to a hairbreadth and would not miss.’ Greek writers often used <em>ha·mar·taʹno</em> with regard to a spearman missing his target. Both of these words were used to mean missing or failing to reach not merely physical objects or goals (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:5:24-18:5:24" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Job 5:24</a>) but also moral or intellectual goals or marks. <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:8:35-20:8:36" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Proverbs 8:35, 36</a> says the one finding godly wisdom finds life, but the ‘one missing [from Heb., <em>cha·taʼʹ</em>] wisdom is doing violence to his soul,’ leading to death. In the Scriptures both the Hebrew and Greek terms refer mainly to sinning on the part of God’s intelligent creatures, their missing the mark with regard to their Creator.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><strong>Man’s Place in God’s Purpose.</strong> Man was created in “God’s image.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:26-1:1:27" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ge 1:26, 27</a>) He, like all other created things, existed and was created because of God’s will. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:4:11-66:4:11" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Re 4:11</a>) God’s assigning work to him showed that man was to serve God’s purpose on earth. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:28-1:1:28" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Ge 1:28;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:2:8-1:2:8" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> 2:8,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:2:15-1:2:15" data-bid="12-3" class="b"> 15</a>) According to the inspired apostle, man was created to be both “God’s image and glory” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:11:7-46:11:7" data-bid="13-1" class="b">1Co 11:7</a>), hence to reflect the qualities of his Creator, conducting himself so as to reflect the glory of God. As God’s earthly son, man should resemble, or be like, his heavenly Father. To be otherwise would be to contradict and reproach the divine parenthood of God.​—Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/39:1:6-39:1:6" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Mal 1:6</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Jesus showed this when encouraging his disciples to manifest goodness and love in a way surpassing that done by “sinners,” persons known to practice sinful acts. He stated that only by following God’s example in mercy and love could his disciples ‘prove themselves sons of their Father who is in the heavens.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:5:43-40:5:48" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Mt 5:43-48;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:6:32-42:6:36" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> Lu 6:32-36</a>) Paul ties in God’s glory with the matter of human sin in saying that “all have sinned and <em>fall short of the glory of God.”</em> (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:3:23-45:3:23" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Ro 3:23</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:1:21-45:1:23" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Ro 1:21-23;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/28:4:7-28:4:7" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> Ho 4:7</a>.) At <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:3:16-47:3:18" data-bid="18-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 3:16-18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:4:1-47:4:6" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> 4:1-6</a> the apostle shows that those turning from sin to Jehovah “with unveiled faces reflect like mirrors the glory of Jehovah, [and] are transformed into the same image from glory to glory,” because the glorious good news about the Christ, who is the image of God, shines through to them. (Compare also <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:10:31-46:10:31" data-bid="19-1" class="b">1Co 10:31</a>.) The apostle Peter quotes from the Hebrew Scriptures in stating God’s express will for his earthly servants, saying: “In accord with the Holy One who called you, do you also become holy yourselves in all your conduct, because it is written: ‘You must be holy, because I am holy.’”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:1:15-60:1:16" data-bid="20-1" class="b">1Pe 1:15, 16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:19:2-3:19:2" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> Le 19:2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:18:13-5:18:13" data-bid="20-3" class="b"> De 18:13</a>.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Sin, therefore, mars man’s reflection of God’s likeness and glory; it makes man unholy, that is, unclean, impure, tarnished in a spiritual and moral sense.​—Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:6:5-23:6:7" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Isa 6:5-7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:51:1-19:51:2" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> Ps 51:1, 2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:37:23-26:37:23" data-bid="21-3" class="b"> Eze 37:23</a>; see <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200002055/">HOLINESS</a>.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">All these texts, then, stress God’s original purpose that man should be in harmony with God’s personality, be like his Creator, similar to the way a human father who loves his son desires the son to be like him as to outlook on life, standards of conduct, qualities of heart. (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:3:11-20:3:12" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Pr 3:11, 12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:23:15-20:23:16" data-bid="22-2" class="b"> 23:15, 16,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:23:26-20:23:26" data-bid="22-3" class="b"> 26;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:5:1-49:5:1" data-bid="22-4" class="b"> Eph 5:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:12:4-58:12:6" data-bid="22-5" class="b"> Heb 12:4-6,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:12:9-58:12:11" data-bid="22-6" class="b"> 9-11</a>.) This, of necessity, requires man’s obedience and submission <span id="page963" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="963" data-before-text="963"></span>to the divine will, whether that will is conveyed in the form of an express commandment or not. Sin, thus, involves a moral <em>failure,</em> a missing of the mark, in all these aspects.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><strong>The Introduction of Sin.</strong> Sin occurred first in the spirit realm before its introduction on earth. For unknown ages full harmony with God prevailed in the universe. Disruption came through a spirit creature referred to simply as the Resister, Adversary (Heb., <em>Sa·tanʹ;</em> Gr., <em>Sa·ta·nasʹ;</em> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:1:6-18:1:6" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Job 1:6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:16:20-45:16:20" data-bid="23-2" class="b"> Ro 16:20</a>), the principal False Accuser or Slanderer (Gr., <em>Di·aʹbo·los</em>) of God. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:2:14-58:2:14" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Heb 2:14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:12:9-66:12:9" data-bid="24-2" class="b"> Re 12:9</a>) Hence, the apostle John says: “He who carries on sin originates with the Devil, because the Devil has been sinning from the beginning.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:3:8-62:3:8" data-bid="25-1" class="b">1Jo 3:8</a>.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">By “the beginning” John clearly means the beginning of Satan’s career of opposition, even as “beginning” is used to refer to the start of the discipleship of Christians at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:2:7-62:2:7" data-bid="26-1" class="b">1 John 2:7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:3:11-62:3:11" data-bid="26-2" class="b"> 3:11</a>. John’s words show that, once having introduced sin, Satan continued his sinful course. Hence, any person that “makes sin his business or practice” reveals himself to be a ‘child’ of the Adversary, spiritual offspring reflecting the qualities of his “father.”​—<em>The Expositor’s Greek Testament,</em> edited by W. R. Nicoll, 1967, Vol. V, p. 185; <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:8:44-43:8:44" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Joh 8:44;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:3:10-62:3:12" data-bid="27-2" class="b"> 1Jo 3:10-12</a>.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Since cultivation of wrong desire to the point of fertility precedes the ‘birth of sin’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:1:14-59:1:15" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Jas 1:14, 15</a>), the spirit creature who turned opposer had already begun to deviate from righteousness, had experienced disaffection toward God, prior to the actual <em>manifestation</em> of sin.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb"><strong><em>Revolt in Eden.</em></strong> God’s will as expressed to Adam and his wife was primarily positive, setting forth things they were to do. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:26-1:1:29" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Ge 1:26-29;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:2:15-1:2:15" data-bid="29-2" class="b"> 2:15</a>) One prohibitive command was given to Adam, that forbidding eating of (or even touching) the tree of the knowledge of good and bad. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:2:16-1:2:17" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Ge 2:16, 17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:3:2-1:3:3" data-bid="30-2" class="b"> 3:2, 3</a>) God’s test of man’s obedience and devotion is notable for the respect it showed for man’s dignity. By it God attributed nothing bad to Adam; he did not use as a test the prohibition of, for example, bestiality, murder, or some similar vile or base act, thereby implying that God felt Adam might have some despicable inclinations residing within him. Eating was normal, proper, and Adam had been told to “eat to satisfaction” of what God had given him. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:2:16-1:2:16" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Ge 2:16</a>) But God now tested Adam by restricting his eating of the fruit of this one tree, God thus causing the eating of that fruit to symbolize that the eater comes to a knowledge that enables him to decide for himself what is “good” or what is “bad” for man. Thus, God neither imposed a hardship on the man nor did He attribute to Adam anything beneath his dignity as a human son of God.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">The woman was the first human sinner. Her temptation by God’s Adversary, who employed a serpent as a medium of communication (see <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200003440/">PERFECTION</a> [The first sinner and the king of Tyre]), was not through an open appeal to immorality of a sensual nature. Rather, it paraded as an appeal to the desire for supposed intellectual elevation and freedom. After first getting Eve to restate God’s law, which she evidently had received through her husband, the Tempter then made an assault on God’s truthfulness and goodness. He asserted that eating fruit from the prescribed tree would result, not in death, but in enlightenment and godlike ability to determine for oneself whether a thing was good or bad. This statement reveals that the Tempter was by now thoroughly alienated in heart from his Creator, his words constituting open contradiction plus veiled slander of God. He did not accuse God of unknowing error but of deliberate misrepresentation of matters, saying, “For God knows . . .” The gravity of sin, the detestable nature of such disaffection, is seen in the means to which this spirit son stooped to achieve his ends, becoming a deceitful liar and an ambition-driven murderer, since he obviously knew the fatal consequences of what he now suggested to his human listener.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:3:1-1:3:5" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Ge 3:1-5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:8:44-43:8:44" data-bid="32-2" class="b"> Joh 8:44</a>.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">As the account reveals, improper desire began to work in the woman. Instead of reacting in utter disgust and righteous indignation on hearing the righteousness of God’s law thus called into question, she now came to look upon the tree as desirable. She coveted what rightly belonged to Jehovah God as her Sovereign​—his ability and prerogative to determine what is good and what is bad for his creatures. Hence, she was now starting to conform herself to the ways, standards, and will of the opposer, who contradicted her Creator as well as her God-appointed head, her husband. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:11:3-46:11:3" data-bid="33-1" class="b">1Co 11:3</a>) Putting trust in the Tempter’s words, she let herself be seduced, ate of the fruit, and thus revealed the sin that had been born in her heart and mind.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:3:6-1:3:6" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Ge 3:6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:11:3-47:11:3" data-bid="34-2" class="b"> 2Co 11:3</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:1:14-59:1:15" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Jas 1:14, 15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:5:27-40:5:28" data-bid="35-2" class="b"> Mt 5:27, 28</a>.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Adam later partook of the fruit when it was offered to him by his wife. The apostle shows that the man’s sinning differed from that of his wife in that Adam was not deceived by the Tempter’s propaganda, hence he put no stock in the claim that eating the fruit from the tree could be done with impunity. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:2:14-54:2:14" data-bid="36-1" class="b">1Ti 2:14</a>) Adam’s eating, therefore, must have been due to desire for his wife, and he ‘listened to her voice’ rather than to that of <span id="page964" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="964" data-before-text="964"></span>his God. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:3:6-1:3:6" data-bid="37-1" class="b">Ge 3:6,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:3:17-1:3:17" data-bid="37-2" class="b"> 17</a>) He thus conformed to her ways and will, and through her, to those of God’s Adversary. He therefore ‘missed the mark,’ failed to act in God’s image and likeness, did not reflect God’s glory, and, in fact, insulted his heavenly Father.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb"><strong>Effects of Sin.</strong> Sin put man out of harmony with his Creator. It thereby damaged not only his relations with God but also his relations with the rest of God’s creation, including damage to man’s own self, to his mind, heart, and body. It brought consequences of enormous evil upon the human race.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">The conduct of the human pair immediately revealed this disharmony. Their covering portions of their divinely made bodies and thereafter their attempting to hide themselves from God were clear evidences of the alienation that had taken place within their minds and hearts. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:3:7-1:3:8" data-bid="38-1" class="b">Ge 3:7, 8</a>) Sin thus caused them to feel guilt, anxiety, insecurity, shame. This illustrates the point made by the apostle at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:2:15-45:2:15" data-bid="39-1" class="b">Romans 2:15</a>, that God’s law was ‘written on man’s heart’; hence a violation of that law now produced an internal upheaval within man, his conscience accusing him of wrongdoing. In effect, man had a built-in lie detector that made impossible his concealing his sinful state from his Creator; and God, responding to the man’s excuse for his changed attitude toward his heavenly Father, promptly inquired: “From the tree from which I commanded you not to eat have you eaten?”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:3:9-1:3:11" data-bid="40-1" class="b">Ge 3:9-11</a>.</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">To be true to himself, as well as for the good of the rest of his universal family, Jehovah God could not countenance such a sinful course, on the part of either his human creatures or the spirit son turned rebel. Maintaining his holiness, he justly imposed the sentence of death on them all. The human pair were then expelled from God’s garden in Eden, hence cut off from access to that other tree designated by God as “the tree of life.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:3:14-1:3:24" data-bid="41-1" class="b">Ge 3:14-24</a>.</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb"><strong><em>Results to mankind as a whole.</em></strong> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:5:12-45:5:12" data-bid="42-1" class="b">Romans 5:12</a> states that “through one man sin entered into the world and death through sin, and thus death spread to all men because they had all sinned.” (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:1:8-62:1:10" data-bid="43-1" class="b">1Jo 1:8-10</a>.) Some have explained this as meaning that all of Adam’s future offspring shared in Adam’s initial act of sin because, as their family head, he represented them and thereby made them, in effect, participants with him in his sin. The apostle, however, speaks of death as ‘spreading’ to all men, which implies a progressive rather than a simultaneous effect on Adam’s descendants.</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">Additionally, the apostle goes on to speak of death as ruling as king “from Adam down to Moses, <em>even over those who had not sinned after the likeness of the transgression by Adam.”</em> (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:5:14-45:5:14" data-bid="44-1" class="b">Ro 5:14</a>) Adam’s sin is rightly called a “transgression” since it was an overstepping of a stated law, an express command of God to him. Also, when Adam sinned, it was of his own free choice, as a perfect human who was free from disabilities. Clearly, his offspring have never enjoyed that state of perfection. So, these factors seem out of harmony with the view that ‘when Adam sinned, all of his as yet unborn descendants sinned with him.’ For all of Adam’s descendants to be held accountable as participants in Adam’s personal sin would require some expression of <em>will</em> on their part as to having him as their family head. Yet none of them in reality willed to be born of him, their birth into the Adamic line resulting from the fleshly will of their parents.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:1:13-43:1:13" data-bid="45-1" class="b">Joh 1:13</a>.</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">The evidence, then, points to a passing on of sin from Adam to succeeding generations as a result of the recognized law of heredity. This is evidently what the psalmist refers to in saying: “With error I was brought forth with birth pains, and in sin my mother conceived me.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:51:5-19:51:5" data-bid="46-1" class="b">Ps 51:5</a>) Sin, along with its consequences, entered and spread to all the human race not merely because Adam was the family <em>head</em> of the race but because he, not Eve, was its <em>progenitor,</em> or human life source. From him, as well as from Eve, his offspring would inescapably inherit not merely physical characteristics but also personality traits, including the inclination toward sin.​—Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:15:22-46:15:22" data-bid="47-1" class="b">1Co 15:22,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:15:48-46:15:49" data-bid="47-2" class="b"> 48, 49</a>.</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">Paul’s words also point to this conclusion when he says that “just as through the disobedience of the one man [Adam] many were constituted sinners, likewise also through the obedience of the one person [Christ Jesus] many will be constituted righteous.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:5:19-45:5:19" data-bid="48-1" class="b">Ro 5:19</a>) Those to be “constituted righteous” by Christ’s obedience were not all immediately so constituted at the moment of his presenting his ransom sacrifice to God, but they progressively come under the benefits of that sacrifice as they come to exercise faith in that provision and become reconciled to God.

Nevertheless, death ruled as king from Adam down to Moses, even over those who had not sinned after the likeness of the transgression by Adam.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:2:12-45:2:12" data-bid="67-1" class="b">Ro 2:12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:5:13-45:5:14" data-bid="67-2" class="b"> 5:13, 14</a>) Paul’s words are to be understood in context; his earlier statements in this letter to the Romans show that he was comparing those under the Law covenant with those outside that covenant, hence not under its law code, while he demonstrated that both classes were sinful.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:3:9-45:3:9" data-bid="68-1" class="b">Ro 3:9</a>.</p>
<p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb">During the approximately 2,500 years between Adam’s deflection and the giving of the Law covenant in 1513 B.C.E., God had not given mankind any comprehensive code or systematically arranged law that specifically defined sin in all its ramifications and forms. True, he had given certain decrees, such as those given to Noah following the global Flood (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:9:1-1:9:7" data-bid="69-1" class="b">Ge 9:1-7</a>) as well as the covenant of circumcision given to Abraham and his household, including his foreign slaves.

He has not done that way to any other nation; and as for his judicial decisions, they have not known them.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:147:19-19:147:20" data-bid="71-1" class="b">Ps 147:19, 20</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:19:5-2:19:6" data-bid="72-1" class="b">Ex 19:5, 6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:4:8-5:4:8" data-bid="72-2" class="b"> De 4:8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:7:6-5:7:6" data-bid="72-3" class="b"> 7:6,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:7:11-5:7:11" data-bid="72-4" class="b"> 11</a>.) Of the Law covenant given Israel it could be said, “The man that has done the righteousness of the Law will live by it,” for perfect adherence to and compliance with that Law could be accomplished only by a sinless man, as was the case with Christ Jesus.

<p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb"><strong><em>‘Doing by nature the things of the law.’</em></strong> This did not mean that, since there was no comprehensive law code against which to measure their conduct, men during that period between Adam and Moses were free from sin. At <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:2:14-45:2:15" data-bid="74-1" class="b">Romans 2:14, 15</a>, Paul states: “For whenever people of the nations that do not have law do by nature the things of the law, these people, although not having law, are a law to themselves. They are the very ones who demonstrate the matter of the law to be written in their hearts, while their conscience is bearing witness with them and, between their own thoughts, they are being accused or even excused.” Having been originally made in God’s image and likeness, man has a moral nature, which produces the faculty of conscience. Even imperfect, sinful men retain a measure of this, as Paul’s words indicate. (See <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200001024/">CONSCIENCE</a>.) Since law is basically a ‘rule of conduct,’ this moral nature operates in their hearts as a law. However, set over against this law of their moral nature is another <span id="page966" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="966" data-before-text="966"></span>inherited law, the ‘law of sin,’ which wars against righteous tendencies, making slaves of those who do not resist its dominance.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:6:12-45:6:12" data-bid="75-1" class="b">Ro 6:12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:7:22-45:7:23" data-bid="75-2" class="b"> 7:22, 23</a>.</p>
<p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sb">This moral nature and associated conscience can be seen even in Cain’s case. Although God had given no law regarding homicide, by the evasive way Cain responded to God’s inquiry, he showed that his conscience condemned him after he murdered Abel. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:4:8-1:4:9" data-bid="76-1" class="b">Ge 4:8, 9</a>) Joseph the Hebrew showed God’s ‘law in his heart’ when he responded to the seductive request of Potiphar’s wife, saying: “How could I commit this great badness and actually sin against God?” Though God had not specifically condemned adultery, yet Joseph recognized it as wrong, violating God’s will for humans as expressed in Eden.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:39:7-1:39:9" data-bid="77-1" class="b">Ge 39:7-9</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:2:24-1:2:24" data-bid="78-1" class="b">Ge 2:24</a>.</p>
<p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="sb">Thus, during the patriarchal period from Abraham through the 12 sons of Jacob, the Scriptures show men of many races and nations speaking of “sin” (<em>chat·taʼthʹ</em>), such as sins against an employer (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:31:36-1:31:36" data-bid="79-1" class="b">Ge 31:36</a>), against the ruler to whom one is subject (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:40:1-1:40:1" data-bid="80-1" class="b">Ge 40:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:41:9-1:41:9" data-bid="80-2" class="b"> 41:9</a>), against a relative (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:42:22-1:42:22" data-bid="81-1" class="b">Ge 42:22;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:43:9-1:43:9" data-bid="81-2" class="b"> 43:9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:50:17-1:50:17" data-bid="81-3" class="b"> 50:17</a>), or simply against a fellow human (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:20:9-1:20:9" data-bid="82-1" class="b">Ge 20:9</a>). In any case, the one using the term acknowledged thereby a certain relationship with the person against whom the sin was or might be committed and recognized an accompanying responsibility to respect that one’s interests or his will and authority, as in the case of a ruler, and not go contrary to them. They thereby showed evidence of moral nature. With the passing of time, nonetheless, sin’s mastery over those not serving God grew, so that Paul could speak of the people of the nations as walking in “darkness mentally, and alienated from the life that belongs to God . . . past all moral sense.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:4:17-49:4:19" data-bid="83-1" class="b">Eph 4:17-19</a>.</p>
<p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="sb"><strong><em>How the Law made sin “abound.”</em></strong> While man’s measure of conscience gave him a certain natural sense of right and wrong, God, by making the Law covenant with Israel, now specifically identified sin in its multiple aspects. The mouth of any person descended from God’s friends Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob who might voice the claim that he was innocent from sin was thereby “stopped and all the world [became] liable to God for punishment.” This was so because the imperfect flesh they inherited from Adam made it impossible for them to be declared righteous before God by works of law, “for by law is the accurate knowledge of sin.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:3:19-45:3:20" data-bid="84-1" class="b">Ro 3:19, 20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:2:16-48:2:16" data-bid="84-2" class="b"> Ga 2:16</a>) The Law spelled out clearly what the full range and scope of sin was, so that, in effect, it caused trespassing and sin to “abound,” in that so many acts and even attitudes were now identified as sinful. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:5:20-45:5:20" data-bid="85-1" class="b">Ro 5:20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:7:7-45:7:8" data-bid="85-2" class="b"> 7:7, 8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:3:19-48:3:19" data-bid="85-3" class="b"> Ga 3:19</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:40:12-19:40:12" data-bid="86-1" class="b">Ps 40:12</a>.) Its sacrifices continually served to remind those under the Law of their sinful state. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:10:1-58:10:4" data-bid="87-1" class="b">Heb 10:1-4,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:10:11-58:10:11" data-bid="87-2" class="b"> 11</a>) The Law by these means acted as a tutor to lead them to Christ, that they “might be declared righteous due to faith.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:3:22-48:3:25" data-bid="88-1" class="b">Ga 3:22-25</a>.</p>
<p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="sn"><strong><em>How could sin ‘receive an inducement’ through God’s commandment to Israel?</em></strong></p>
<p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="sb">In pointing out that the Mosaic Law is not the means for humans to gain a righteous standing before Jehovah God, the apostle Paul wrote: “When we were in accord with the flesh, the sinful passions that were excited by the Law were at work in our members that we should bring forth fruit to death. . . . What, then, shall we say? Is the Law sin? Never may that become so! Really I would not have come to know sin if it had not been for the Law; and, for example, I would not have known covetousness if the Law had not said: ‘You must not covet.’ But sin, receiving an inducement through the commandment, worked out in me covetousness of every sort, for apart from law sin was dead.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:7:5-45:7:8" data-bid="89-1" class="b">Ro 7:5-8</a>.</p>
<p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="sb">Without the Law, the apostle Paul would not have known or discerned the full range or scope of sin, for example, the sinfulness of covetousness. As the apostle notes, the Law “excited” sinful passion, and the commandment against coveting provided an “inducement” for sin. This is to be understood in the light of Paul’s statement that “apart from law sin was dead.” As long as sin had not been defined specifically, a person could not be accused of committing sins that were not legally identified as such. Before the Law came, Paul and others of his nation lived uncondemned for sins that were not specified. With the introduction of the Law, however, Paul and his fellow countrymen were designated as sinners under condemnation of death. The Law made them more conscious of being sinners. This does not mean that the Mosaic Law prompted them to sin, but it exposed them as sinners. Thus sin received an inducement through the Law and worked out sin in Paul and his people. The Law provided the basis for condemning more people as sinners and on many more legal counts.</p>
<p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="sb">The answer to the question “Is the Law sin?” is therefore definitely ‘No!’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:7:7-45:7:7" data-bid="90-1" class="b">Ro 7:7</a>) The Law did not ‘miss the mark’ by failing the purpose for which God gave it but, rather, scored a ‘bull’s-eye,’ not only in being good and beneficial as a protective guide but also in legally establishing that all persons, <span id="page967" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="967" data-before-text="967"></span>the Israelites not excepted, were sinners in need of redemption by God. It also pointed the Israelites to Christ as the needed Redeemer.</p>
<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="sb"><strong>Errors, Transgressions, Trespasses.</strong> The Scriptures frequently link “error” (Heb., <em>ʽa·wonʹ</em>), “transgression” (Heb., <em>peʹshaʽ;</em> Gr., <em>pa·raʹba·sis</em>), “trespass” (Gr., <em>pa·raʹpto·ma</em>), and other such terms with “sin” (Heb., <em>chat·taʼthʹ;</em> Gr., <em>ha·mar·tiʹa</em>). All such related terms present specific aspects of sin, forms that it takes.</p>
<p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="sb"><strong><em>Errors, mistakes, and foolishness.</em></strong> Thus, <em>ʽa·wonʹ</em> basically relates to erring, acting crookedly or wrongly. The Hebrew term refers to a moral error or wrong, a distortion of what is right.

Matthew uses the verb form (<em>pa·ra·baiʹno</em>) in recounting the question of the Pharisees and scribes as to why Jesus’ disciples ‘overstepped the tradition of men of former times,’ and Jesus’ counterquestion as to why these opposers ‘overstepped the commandment of God because of their tradition,’ by which they made God’s word invalid.

<p id="p62" data-pid="62" class="sb">Since Jesus Christ’s sacrifice contains no provision for covering the sins of spirit creatures, there is no reason to believe that the sins of those disobedient angels were forgivable.

It is the wise course to avoid association with those practicing false worship and immorally inclined persons, for these entrap one in sin and spoil useful habits.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:23:33-2:23:33" data-bid="221-1" class="b">Ex 23:33;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:13:25-16:13:26" data-bid="221-2" class="b"> Ne 13:25, 26;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:26:9-19:26:11" data-bid="221-3" class="b"> Ps 26:9-11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:1:10-20:1:19" data-bid="221-4" class="b"> Pr 1:10-19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:7:26-21:7:26" data-bid="221-5" class="b"> Ec 7:26;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:15:33-46:15:34" data-bid="221-6" class="b"> 1Co 15:33, 34</a>.</p>
<p id="p67" data-pid="67" class="sb">There are, of course, many things that can be done or not done, or that can be done one way or another, without any condemnation of sin. (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:7:27-46:7:28" data-bid="222-1" class="b">1Co 7:27, 28</a>.) God did not hem man in with multitudinous instructions governing minute details as to how things were to be done. Clearly, man was to use his intelligence, and he was also given ample latitude to display his individual personality and preferences. The Law covenant contained many statutes; yet even this did not rob men of their freedom of personal expression. Christianity, with its strong emphasis on love of God and neighbor as the guiding rule, similarly allows men the widest possible freedom that persons with righteously inclined hearts could desire.​—Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:22:37-40:22:40" data-bid="223-1" class="b">Mt 22:37-40;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:8:21-45:8:21" data-bid="223-2" class="b"> Ro 8:21</a>; see <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200001568/">FREEDOM</a>; <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200002391/">JEHOVAH</a> (A God of moral standards).</p>

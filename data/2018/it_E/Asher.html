<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">(Ashʹer) [Happy; Happiness].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><strong>1.</strong> The eighth son of Jacob and second of two sons through Zilpah, Leah’s maidservant. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:35:26-1:35:26" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ge 35:26</a>) Thus Asher’s only full brother was Gad. Asher’s four sons and one daughter are listed at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:7:30-13:7:30" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Chronicles 7:30</a>, though his wife is not named. He was not prominent among the 12 sons of Jacob. However, in his father’s deathbed prophecy, Asher was promised a life blessed with an abundance of rich foods (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:49:20-1:49:20" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ge 49:20</a>), and the history of his descendants demonstrates the fulfillment of this prediction.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><strong>2.</strong> The name applies as well to the tribe descended from Asher. A year after the Exodus from Egypt the tribe’s adult male descendants numbered 41,500 (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:1:41-4:1:41" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Nu 1:41</a>) and, about 39 years later, had increased to 53,400, making it the fifth most populous tribe. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:26:47-4:26:47" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Nu 26:47</a>) In the camp of Israel, Asher occupied a position N of the tabernacle, with the tribes of Dan and Naphtali.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:2:25-4:2:30" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Nu 2:25-30</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Prior to entry into Canaan, Moses’ prophetic blessing again predicted a prosperous portion for Asher. The tribe was figuratively to ‘dip its foot in oil.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:33:24-5:33:25" data-bid="7-1" class="b">De 33:24, 25</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:29:6-18:29:6" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Job 29:6</a>.) Their allotment of territory stretched along the Mediterranean coastal plains from below the town of Dor, S of Mount Carmel, on up to the N boundary of Palestine at Sidon. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:17:7-6:17:11" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Jos 17:7-11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:19:24-6:19:31" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 19:24-31</a>) This included some of the most fertile land in all Israel, where olive trees would provide abundant oil, while other fruits would provide dainties fit to grace a royal table. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:49:20-1:49:20" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ge 49:20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:33:24-5:33:24" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> De 33:24</a>) The territories of Zebulun and Naphtali lay along Asher’s <span id="page191" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="191" data-before-text="191"></span>E boundary, with Manasseh and Issachar to the S and SE.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Asher is named in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:17:7-6:17:7" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Joshua 17:7</a> as being on the boundary of the tribe of Manasseh. Asher is also referred to in this same account at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:17:10-6:17:10" data-bid="12-1" class="b">verse 10</a>, where it clearly refers to the tribal territory of Asher.</p>

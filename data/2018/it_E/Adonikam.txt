ADONIKAM
(Ad·o·niʹkam) [(My) Lord Has Raised Himself Up [that is, to help]].
A founder of one of the paternal houses of Israel. More than 600 members of this family returned to Jerusalem with Zerubbabel after the exile at Babylon. (Ezr 2:13; Ne 7:18) An additional 63 members of this paternal house accompanied Ezra to Jerusalem in 468 B.C.E. (Ezr 8:13) When the representatives of the paternal houses attested to the “trustworthy arrangement,” or resolution drawn up in Nehemiah’s day, this family was apparently listed by the name Adonijah.​—Ne 9:38; 10:16.

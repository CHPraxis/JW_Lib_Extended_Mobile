JUDGE
Men raised up by Jehovah to deliver his people prior to the period of Israel’s human kings were known as judges. (Jg 2:16) Moses, as mediator of the Law covenant and God-appointed leader, judged Israel for 40 years. But the period of Judges, as usually viewed, began with Othniel, sometime after the death of Joshua, and extended until Samuel the prophet. Samuel is not usually counted among the Judges. So the period of the Judges extended about 300 years.​—Jg 2:16; Ac 13:20.
The judges were selected and appointed by Jehovah from various tribes of Israel. Between Joshua and Samuel, 12 judges (not including Deborah) are named, as follows:
Judge
Tribe
Othniel
Judah
Ehud
Benjamin
Shamgar
(?)
Barak
Naphtali (?)
Gideon
Manasseh
Tola
Issachar
Jair
Manasseh
Jephthah
Manasseh
Ibzan
Zebulun (?)
Elon
Zebulun
Abdon
Ephraim
Samson
Dan
The exact area over which each of the judges exercised jurisdiction and the dates of their judgeships cannot in every case be determined. Some may have judged contemporaneously in different sections of Israel, and there were periods of oppression intervening.​—See MAP, Vol. 1, p. 743; COURT, JUDICIAL; JUDGMENT DAY; also judges of Israel under individual names.

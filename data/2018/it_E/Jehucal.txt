JEHUCAL
(Je·huʹcal) [Jehovah Is Able; Jehovah Prevails], Jucal (Juʹcal) [shortened form of Jehucal].
A prince sent by King Zedekiah to ask Jeremiah to pray for Judah. (Jer 37:3) This son of Shelemiah and three other influential princes had Jeremiah put into the miry cistern because his preaching was, as they put it, “weakening the hands of the men of war,” as well as the hands of the people in general.​—Jer 38:1-6.

BAALATH
(Baʹal·ath) [Place of the Mistress].
A border town of the original territory of Dan, mentioned at Joshua 19:44, 45 as being between Gibbethon and Jehud. It is evidently the same place that Solomon later included in his rebuilding program. (2Ch 8:5, 6) Its identification geographically is uncertain; Josephus (Jewish Antiquities, VIII, 152 [vi, 1]) refers to it along with Beth-horon as not far from Gezer, another fortified city.​—1Ki 9:17, 18.

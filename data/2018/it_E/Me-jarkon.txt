ME-JARKON
(Me-jarʹkon) [Waters of the Jarkon].
Some scholars believe that Me-jarkon in the territory of Dan (Jos 19:40, 41, 46) is the Nahr el-ʽAuja (Nahal Yarqon), which enters the Mediterranean Sea about 6 km (3.5 mi) NNE of Joppa. Its headwaters, among the largest springs in Palestine, surface about 20 km (12 mi) inland near the suggested site of Aphek (No. 3).
Another view is that the original Hebrew text, like the Greek Septuagint, may have read ‘and on the west [or, on the sea] Jarkon.’ Tell Qasileh (Tel Qasila), situated within the limits of Tel Aviv-Yafo (Joppa), has been presented as a possible identification for Jarkon.

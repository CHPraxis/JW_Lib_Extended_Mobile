<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Basically, a royal government; also the territory and peoples under the rule of a king or, less frequently, under a female monarch or queen. Often the kingship was hereditary. The sovereign ruler might bear other titles such as Pharaoh or Caesar.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Kingdoms of ancient times, as today, had various symbols of royalty. There was generally a capital city or place of the king’s residence, a royal court, a standing army (though perhaps quite reduced in size in times of peace). The word “kingdom,” as used in the Bible, does not of itself reveal anything definite as to the governmental structure, the territorial extent, or the authority of the monarch. Kingdoms ranged in size and influence from the mighty world powers such as Egypt, Assyria, Babylon, Medo-Persia, Greece, and Rome, on down to small city-kingdoms such as those in Canaan at the time of the Israelite conquest. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:12:7-6:12:24" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Jos 12:7-24</a>) The governmental structure also might vary considerably from kingdom to kingdom.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The first kingdom of human history, that of Nimrod, seems to have been initially a city-kingdom, later extending its realm to include other cities, its base remaining at Babel. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:10:9-1:10:11" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ge 10:9-11</a>) Salem, over which King-Priest Melchizedek ruled in the first kingdom with divine approval, was also apparently a city-kingdom. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:14:18-1:14:20" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ge 14:18-20</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:7:1-58:7:17" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Heb 7:1-17</a>.) Larger kingdoms embraced an entire region, such as the kingdoms of Edom, Moab, and Ammon. The great empires, ruling vast areas and having other kingdoms tributary to them, generally seem to have arisen or grown out of small city-states or tribal groups that eventually combined under a dominant leader. Such coalitions were sometimes of a temporary nature, often formed for war against a common foe. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:14:1-1:14:5" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ge 14:1-5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:9:1-6:9:2" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Jos 9:1, 2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:10:5-6:10:5" data-bid="5-3" class="b"> 10:5</a>) Vassal kingdoms frequently enjoyed a considerable degree of autonomy, or self-rule, though subject to the will and demands of the suzerain power.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:17:3-12:17:4" data-bid="6-1" class="b">2Ki 17:3, 4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:36:4-14:36:4" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 2Ch 36:4,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:36:10-14:36:10" data-bid="6-3" class="b"> 10</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><strong>Broad Usage.</strong> In Scriptural use the term “kingdom” may refer to specific aspects of a royal government. It can refer to the realm or geographic area over which sovereignty is exercised. The royal realm thus included not merely the capital city but the entire domain, embracing any subordinate or tributary kingdoms.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:4:21-11:4:21" data-bid="7-1" class="b">1Ki 4:21;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/17:3:6-17:3:6" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> Es 3:6,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/17:3:8-17:3:8" data-bid="7-3" class="b"> 8</a>.</p>

<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><strong>The Israelite Kingdom.</strong> The Law covenant given through Moses to the nation of Israel made provision for a kingdom rule. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:17:14-5:17:15" data-bid="12-1" class="b">De 17:14, 15</a>) The individual heading the kingdom was empowered and given royal dignity, not for personal exaltation, but to serve for the honor of God and the good of his Israelite brothers.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:8:1-9:8:22" data-bid="15-1" class="b">1Sa 8</a>) The kings of Israel seem to have been more approachable and more accessible to their subjects than were the monarchs of most ancient Oriental kingdoms.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:19:8-10:19:8" data-bid="16-1" class="b">2Sa 19:8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:20:39-11:20:39" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> 1Ki 20:39;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:15:25-13:15:29" data-bid="16-3" class="b"> 1Ch 15:25-29</a>.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Though the kingdom of Israel began with a king from the line of Benjamin, Judah thereafter became the royal tribe, in keeping with Jacob’s deathbed prophecy.

<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">A royal organization developed in Israel to administer the interests of the kingdom.

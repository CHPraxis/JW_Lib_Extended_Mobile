<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">(Zeʹphath) [possibly from a root meaning “keep watch”].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A royal Canaanite city in the southern part of Judah’s territory, apparently S of Arad, captured by the combined forces of Judah and Simeon. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:1:16-7:1:17" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Jg 1:16, 17</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:15:30-6:15:30" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Jos 15:30;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:19:4-6:19:4" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 19:4</a>.) The city was renamed “Hormah,” meaning “A Devoting to Destruction.” This city, like the other cities of the Canaanites, had been placed ‘under ban’ by Jehovah and was to be devoted to destruction. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:7:1-5:7:4" data-bid="3-1" class="b">De 7:1-4</a>) The tribes of Judah and Simeon were now applying the terms of that ban to Zephath. Zephath may have been the principal Canaanite city of that district or area.​—See <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200002079/">HORMAH</a>.</p>

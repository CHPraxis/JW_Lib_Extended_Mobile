JOTBATHAH
(Jotʹba·thah) [from a root that means “go well; prove satisfactory; do good”].
A well-watered wilderness encampment of the Israelites. (Nu 33:33, 34; De 10:7) Its exact location cannot be determined. However, ʽAin Tabah (ʽEn Yotvata), located in a swampy depression about 40 km (25 mi) N of Ezion-geber, has been suggested as a possible identification.

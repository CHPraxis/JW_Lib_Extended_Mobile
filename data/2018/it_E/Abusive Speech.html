<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">The original Greek word <em>bla·sphe·miʹa</em> and the verb <em>bla·sphe·meʹo</em> basically indicate defamatory, calumnious, abusive language. As noted under the heading <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200000769/">BLASPHEMY</a>, the Greek word <em>bla·sphe·miʹa</em> has a broader meaning than the present English word “blasphemy.” In English, only when such speech is directed against God, not against his creatures, is it properly termed “blasphemy.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:12:31-40:12:31" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Mt 12:31</a>) Concerning this, <em>The Popular and Critical Bible Encyclopædia and Scriptural Dictionary</em> says: “Our English translators [that is, primarily those of the <em>KJ</em>] have not adhered to the right use of the term. They employ it with the same latitude as the Greek; but it is generally easy to perceive, from the connection and subject of a passage, whether <em>blasphemy,</em> properly so called, be meant, or only defamation.”​—Edited by S. Fallows, 1912, Vol. I, p. 291.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Thus, while the <em>King James Version</em> uses “blasphemy” and “blasphemed” in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:18:6-44:18:6" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Acts 18:6,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:3:8-51:3:8" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Colossians 3:8,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:6:1-54:6:1" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> 1 Timothy 6:1</a>, and <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/56:2:5-56:2:5" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Titus 2:5</a>, later translations say “slander,” “abusive talk [or “speech”],” “reviled,” “defamed,” “abused,” “spoken of abusively,” and similar expressions. (See <em>RS, AT, NW,</em> and others.) However, the <em>King James Version</em> does recognize this distinction elsewhere in the Greek Scriptures.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">As the following texts and surrounding verses show, at the time of his impalement abusive speech was directed against Christ by passersby, who said, “Bah! You would-be thrower-down of the temple and builder of it in three days’ time, save yourself by coming down off the torture stake.” Similar words came from one of the evildoers alongside. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:15:29-41:15:30" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Mr 15:29, 30;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:27:39-40:27:40" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Mt 27:39, 40;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:23:39-42:23:39" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> Lu 23:39</a>) Paul and his fellow Christians were objects of such speech by those who falsely construed their purpose, message, and Christian conscience (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:18:6-44:18:6" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ac 18:6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:3:8-45:3:8" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Ro 3:8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:14:16-45:14:16" data-bid="5-3" class="b"> 14:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:10:30-46:10:30" data-bid="5-4" class="b"> 1Co 10:30;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:4:4-60:4:4" data-bid="5-5" class="b"> 1Pe 4:4</a>), yet they themselves were to “speak injuriously of no one,” and by their conduct gave no true grounds for their work or message to be spoken of abusively. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:4:31-49:4:31" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Eph 4:31;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:3:8-51:3:8" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> Col 3:8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:6:1-54:6:1" data-bid="6-3" class="b"> 1Ti 6:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/56:2:5-56:2:5" data-bid="6-4" class="b"> Tit 2:5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/56:3:2-56:3:2" data-bid="6-5" class="b"> 3:2</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:2:2-61:2:2" data-bid="7-1" class="b">2Pe 2:2</a>.) Even the angels “do not bring . . . an accusation in abusive terms, not doing so out of respect for Jehovah.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:2:11-61:2:11" data-bid="8-1" class="b">2Pe 2:11</a>) But such talk <em>can</em> be expected from those who indulge in loose conduct, those who are proud and mentally diseased over questionings and debates, and those who disregard or disrespect God’s appointments.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:6:4-54:6:4" data-bid="9-1" class="b">1Ti 6:4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:2:10-61:2:12" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 2Pe 2:10-12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/65:1:8-65:1:10" data-bid="9-3" class="b"> Jude 8-10</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The word <em>ga·dhaphʹ</em> is used in a corresponding way in the Hebrew Scriptures. Evidently originally referring to inflicting violent physical injury, it is used figuratively to mean “speak abusively,” that is, harm with reproachful words. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:15:30-4:15:30" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Nu 15:30;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:19:6-12:19:6" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> 2Ki 19:6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:20:27-26:20:27" data-bid="10-3" class="b"> Eze 20:27</a>) The Hebrew word <em>na·qavʹ,</em> basically meaning “pierce; bore” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:12:9-12:12:9" data-bid="11-1" class="b">2Ki 12:9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:18:21-12:18:21" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 18:21</a>), has the sense of blaspheming in the account where the son of an Israelite woman was said to have ‘abused’ Jehovah’s name. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:24:11-3:24:11" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Le 24:11,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:24:16-3:24:16" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> 16</a>) In these cases harsh or coarse speech is indicated, directed against either Jehovah God himself or his people. A study of the context makes clear the nature of such “abusive speech.”​—See <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200001455/">EXECRATION</a>; <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200002870/">MALEDICTION</a>; <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200003719/">REVILING</a>.</p>

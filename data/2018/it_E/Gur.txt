GUR
Ahaziah, king of Judah, was riding “on the way up to Gur, which is by Ibleam,” when he was struck down at Jehu’s orders. (2Ki 9:27) The location of Gur is now unknown.
The wounding of Ahaziah at Gur is not mentioned in the parallel account of his death at 2 Chronicles 22:8, 9, but it appears that the two accounts complement each other and must be combined to gain the full picture of the events.​—See AHAZIAH No. 2.

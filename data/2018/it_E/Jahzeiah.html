<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">One who perhaps opposed Ezra’s proposal that the sons of Israel send away their foreign wives and the children born to them; son of Tikvah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/15:10:3-15:10:3" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ezr 10:3,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/15:10:10-15:10:11" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 10, 11,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/15:10:15-15:10:15" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> 15</a>) However, it has been suggested that this opposition of Jahzeiah and Jonathan was not against Ezra’s suggestion but against the procedure adopted for carrying it out. According to the Greek <em>Septuagint</em> and Latin <em>Vulgate,</em> Jahzeiah and the others assisted rather than opposed Ezra. Hence, an alternate rendering of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/15:10:15-15:10:15" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ezra 10:15</a> says that Jonathan and Jahzeiah “were the ones that acted representatively in this behalf.”​—<em>NW</em> ftn; see also <em>KJ; AS,</em> ftn; <em>Dy; Kx.</em></p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">(Maʹher-shalʹal-hash-baz) [Hurry, O Spoil! He Has Made Haste to the Plunder; or, Hurrying to the Spoil, He Has Made Haste to the Plunder].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The name given to Isaiah’s second son at Jehovah’s direction.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Jehovah commanded Isaiah to write these prophetic words on a large tablet and have it attested to by reliable witnesses. Thereafter, he instructed the prophet to give this same expression as a name to his newborn son, declaring that before the child could say, “My father!” and “My mother!” the king of Assyria would subjugate Judah’s enemies​—Damascus and Samaria. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:8:1-23:8:4" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Isa 8:1-4</a>) The prophetic meaning of this name given to Isaiah’s second son was fulfilled within the designated time period. During the reign of Israel’s King Pekah, the Assyrian monarch Tiglath-pileser III invaded Israel, took many cities, plundered the land, and carried numerous inhabitants into captivity. Thereafter, Pekah was murdered. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:15:29-12:15:30" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2Ki 15:29, 30</a>) The king of Assyria also captured Syria’s capital city Damascus, took its people into exile, and put Syrian King Rezin to death. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:16:9-12:16:9" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2Ki 16:9</a>) In this way both of these kings who had conspired against Judah met their end. Later, in 740 B.C.E., the Assyrians <span id="page297" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="297" data-before-text="297"></span>overthrew Samaria, removing the apostate Israelites from that city and from the rest of the domain of the northern kingdom of Israel. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:17:1-12:17:6" data-bid="4-1" class="b">2Ki 17:1-6</a>) Thus, this boy born to Isaiah by his wife (whom he terms “the prophetess”) proved to be in Israel a truthful and reliable ‘sign and miracle’ from Jehovah.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:8:3-23:8:3" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Isa 8:3,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:8:18-23:8:18" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 18</a>.</p>

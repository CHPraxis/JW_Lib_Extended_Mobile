ZEMARAIM
(Zem·a·raʹim).
1. An unidentified Benjamite city mentioned with Bethel. (Jos 18:21, 22) It has been suggested that it was a site NE of Bethel.
2. An eminence in the mountainous region of Ephraim. From this mountain, King Abijah of Judah spoke, pointing out that Jeroboam and the ten tribes of Israel had rejected Jehovah’s kingdom covenant with David. Apparently, Bethel was in the same neighborhood. (2Ch 13:4, 19) Possibly Mount Zemaraim was named for the Benjamite city of Zemaraim, but the mountain’s precise location remains undetermined.

NEEDLE
A slender tool with a sharp point at one end and a hole, or eye, at the other; used for sewing with thread (or sometimes with leather strips) and for embroidering. (Ex 28:6; 35:34, 35; Ec 3:7; Lu 5:36) While bone needles and some made of ivory have been discovered at ancient sites, bronze needles were generally used. They are very similar to present-day needles. Bronze needles varying in length from approximately 4 to 14 cm (1.5 to 5.5 in.) have been found in Palestine. Some Egyptian bronze needles were from 8 to 9 cm (3 to 3.5 in.) long.

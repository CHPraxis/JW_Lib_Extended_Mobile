BETH-LEBAOTH
(Beth-le·baʹoth) [House of Lionesses].
A city listed among the places given to the tribe of Simeon as enclave cities within the territory of Judah. (Jos 19:1, 6) It is named between Hazar-susah and Sharuhen, and this indicates a location in the Negeb region, apparently to the W or SW of Beer-sheba. At Joshua 15:32 it evidently appears simply as Lebaoth, while at 1 Chronicles 4:31 Beth-lebaoth is replaced by the name “Beth-biri.” This latter name could be a postexilic name for the same location.​—See BETH-BIRI.

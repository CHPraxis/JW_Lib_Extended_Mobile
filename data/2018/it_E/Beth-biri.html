<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A town in the Negeb region of Judah but assigned to the sons of Simeon. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:4:24-13:4:24" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1Ch 4:24,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:4:31-13:4:31" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 31</a>) In the parallel list of towns at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:19:6-6:19:6" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Joshua 19:6</a> it appears as Beth-lebaoth, and some suggest that Beth-biri may be a postexilic name for the same place, used by Ezra as the writer of the Chronicles. Evidence of the name may remain <span id="page294" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="294" data-before-text="294"></span>in that of Jebel el-Biri, a mountain about 40 km (25 mi) SW of Beer-sheba. On this basis, some propose that Beth-biri was on or near this mountain.​—See <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200000693/">BETH-LEBAOTH</a>.</p>

TIMNAH
(Timʹnah).
1. A location at the boundary of Judah and Dan. (Jos 15:1, 10; 19:40-43) Some have identified it with a place preserving some similarity to the ancient name, Khirbet Tibnah, about 6 km (3.5 mi) W of Beth-shemesh, but no archaeological remains earlier than Roman times have been found on the site. Many favor Tell el-Batashi (Tel Batash), about 7 km (4.5 mi) WNW of Beth-shemesh, situated on the S bank of the torrent valley of Sorek.
Samson selected a Philistine woman of Timnah for marriage when “looking for an opportunity against the Philistines,” who then ruled over Israel. En route to the city, he killed a lion bare-handed at the vineyards of Timnah. (Jg 14:1-6) In the time of King Ahaz, the Philistines captured Timnah and its dependent towns.​—2Ch 28:16-19.
2. A city in the mountainous region of Judah. Scholars identify this Timnah with Khirbet et-Tabbana (Horvat Tibnah), about 3 km (2 mi) NW of Gibeah (El Jabʽa). (Jos 15:20, 48, 57) Apparently, near this Timnah, Judah planned to shear his sheep, and at Enaim (which was on the road to Timnah) he had relations with Tamar, mistaking her for a harlot.​—Ge 38:12-18.

ELI, II
(Eʹli).
As Jesus was dying on the torture stake, about the ninth hour, or about 3:00 p.m., he called out: “Eʹli, Eʹli, laʹma sa·bach·thaʹni?” (“My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?”) (Mt 27:46; Mr 15:34) Bystanders thought that he was calling for Elijah. Perhaps they misunderstood Jesus’ words because his speech was indistinct as a result of his intense suffering or because his dialect differed from theirs. (Mt 27:47; Mr 15:35) In calling out to his heavenly Father, acknowledging him as his God, Jesus fulfilled Psalm 22:1.

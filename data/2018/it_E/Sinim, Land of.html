<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">(Siʹnim).</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A country from which, it was foretold, scattered Israelites would come when the time arrived for them to dwell in and rehabilitate their homeland. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:49:12-23:49:12" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Isa 49:12</a>) Reference to the N and W in the same verse suggests that Sinim was S or E of the land of Israel. Instead of “Sinim,” the Greek <em>Septuagint</em> reads “land of the Persians,” which could include Elam, called Si-nim in Old Akkadian. (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:11:11-23:11:11" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Isa 11:11</a>.) The Targums and the Latin <em>Vulgate,</em> on the other hand, read “[land] to the south.” Certain scholars have suggested identification with Syene (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:30:6-26:30:6" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Eze 30:6</a>) in the southern extremity of Egypt. But Sinim’s location is uncertain.</p>

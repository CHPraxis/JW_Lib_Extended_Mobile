<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">(Aʹin) [Fountain; Spring].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The word literally means “eye” but by analogy is used to mean a natural spring or fountain as distinguished from a man-made well or tank, which latter water source is expressed by the Hebrew terms <em>beʼerʹ</em> and <em>bohr.</em> (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:49:22-1:49:22" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ge 49:22;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:8:7-5:8:7" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> De 8:7</a>; see <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200000978/">CISTERN</a>; <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200004597/">WELL</a>.) It is often written “En-” when used in compounds, as En-rimmon, En-gedi, En-gannim.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><strong>1.</strong> A place mentioned by Jehovah when setting out the E boundary of Israel to Moses. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:34:11-4:34:11" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Nu 34:11</a>) The “Riblah” mentioned in this text as being “on the east of Ain” evidently does not refer to the Riblah in the land of Hamath considerably to the N of Damascus, inasmuch as Ain is named in relation to the Sea of Chinnereth (Galilee). It lay to the N of that sea, but its exact location is uncertain.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><strong>2.</strong> One of the southernmost cities originally assigned to the tribe of Judah (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:15:32-6:15:32" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Jos 15:32</a>), then assigned to the tribe of Simeon when Simeon’s allotment was taken out from Judah’s overly large territory. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:19:1-6:19:1" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Jos 19:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:19:7-6:19:7" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 7,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:19:9-6:19:9" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> 9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:4:24-13:4:24" data-bid="4-4" class="b"> 1Ch 4:24,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:4:32-13:4:32" data-bid="4-5" class="b"> 32</a>) Ain was near the city of Rimmon, and it appears that when it was resettled following the exile in Babylon, the names of the two places were combined as one: En-rimmon. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:11:29-16:11:29" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ne 11:29</a>) As such, it is usually identified with Khirbet Umm er-Ramamin (Horvat Remalya), lying about 15 km (9 mi) N of Beer-sheba.​—See <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200003734/">RIMMON</a> No. 2.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><strong>3.</strong> At <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:21:16-6:21:16" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Joshua 21:16</a> Ain is listed as one of the cities given to the Levites.

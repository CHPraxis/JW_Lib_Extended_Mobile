<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">JEHOVAH​—the name of the Sovereign Lord of the universe. It is the name by which he himself chose to be identified. The Tetragrammaton (as the four Hebrew letters of God’s name are known) occurs in the Hebrew text of the Bible nearly 7,000 times​—far more often than does any descriptive title for God. That name is no mere label. It distinguishes the true God from all other gods, including man-made gods. It is the name that all intelligent creatures should know, honor, and sanctify.</p>

<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Surprisingly, many Bible translations today do not contain the divine name at all. Why? A superstitious idea arose among the Jews that it was wrong to pronounce that name. This resulted first in avoiding spoken use of the divine name among the Jews, then in removal of God’s personal name from Greek manuscripts of the Holy Scriptures. Eventually, in most translations of the Bible the divine name was completely replaced by expressions such as “Lord” and “God.” It is noteworthy that only the most vital name of all​—Jehovah—​was tampered with; other Bible names were not.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Yet, it is vital for all mankind to know the divine name. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:10:13-45:10:13" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ro 10:13</a>) This involves much more than just knowing what God’s personal name is. It includes knowing also the person represented by the name and living in a way consistent with the purposes connected with that name. It is the responsibility of all who worship the true God to be diligent in making his name known to others, as Jesus did. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:6-43:17:6" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Joh 17:6,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:26-43:17:26" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 26</a>) Jehovah God promises to bless those who know, use, and honor his great name.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:91:14-19:91:14" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ps 91:14</a>.</p>

The Greek <em>Septuagint</em> translation (P. Fouad Inv. 266, center) of the same passage also contains the divine name in Hebrew characters. But notice that the name does not appear in those verses in the Codex Alexandrinus (right), of the fifth century C.E. The divine name was removed. It was not translated into a Greek equivalent but was replaced with an abbreviated form of the Greek word <em>Kyʹri·os</em> (Lord)</p>

<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sc">These papyrus fragments of the Greek <em>Septuagint</em> (Fouad Inv. 266), from the first century B.C.E., show the Tetragrammaton in portions of Deuteronomy. The use of these four Hebrew letters representing the divine name continued in some copies of the <em>Septuagint</em> for centuries thereafter. Thus, in addition to having the Hebrew text of the Scriptures, Jesus Christ and his disciples had the Greek <em>Septuagint;</em> both of these contained the divine name. Undoubtedly, then, the original writers of the Christian Greek Scriptures used the divine name, especially when they quoted passages from the Hebrew Scriptures that contained the Tetragrammaton</p>

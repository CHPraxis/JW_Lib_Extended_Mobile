KOHATHITE
(Koʹhath·ite) [Of (Belonging to) Kohath].
A descendant of the family head Kohath, who was one of the three sons of Levi. (Ge 46:11; Nu 26:57) The “Kohathites” or “sons of Kohath” were divided into four families, these being descendants of the four sons of Kohath: the Amramites, the Izharites, the Hebronites, and the Uzzielites. (Nu 3:19, 27) Their chieftain at the time of Israel’s encampment at Mount Sinai (1513 B.C.E.) was Elizaphan the son of Uzziel.​—Nu 3:30.
Moses and Aaron were Kohathites of the Amramite family (Ex 6:18, 20); rebellious Korah was a Kohathite of the family of the Izharites (Nu 16:1), as was the faithful prophet Samuel.​—1Sa 1:1, 19, 20; 1Ch 6:33-38.
The census taken in the Wilderness of Sinai revealed that there were 8,600 males a month old and upward belonging to the families of the Kohathites. (Nu 3:27, 28) According to some manuscripts of the Greek Septuagint, the figure is 8,300. When the smaller number is added to the 7,500 and the 6,200 of Numbers 3:22, 34, the sum total is 22,000​—the very figure found in Numbers 3:39. Their males between 30 and 50 years of age “who entered into the service group for the service in the tent of meeting” numbered 2,750.​—Nu 4:34-37.
During the wilderness trek, the Kohathites were assigned to camp on the S side of the tabernacle (Nu 3:29), between it and the encampment of the tribes of Reuben, Simeon, and Gad. (Nu 2:10, 12, 14) The Kohathites had the privilege and responsibility of transporting the ark of the covenant, the table of showbread, the lampstand, the altars, and the utensils of the holy place, as well as the screen of the Most Holy (Nu 3:30, 31), after these items were packed and covered by Aaron and his sons, who were also Kohathites. The Kohathites other than Aaron and his sons were not allowed to see the utensils even for a moment or to touch the holy place, for doing so would mean death. (Nu 4:4-15, 20) Though Israel provided the Levites with cattle and wagons for transporting the tabernacle equipment, the Kohathites were not given any. Doubtless because of the sacredness of their burdens, they carried their loads on the shoulder. (Nu 7:2-9) They were the last of the Levites to pull away from an encampment.​—Nu 10:17-21.
After the conquest of Canaan, when the Levites were assigned certain cities, the Kohathites received 23; the “sons” of Aaron (that is, the Kohathites) were assigned 13 cities out of the territories of Judah, Simeon, and Benjamin, and the rest of the Kohathites were assigned 10 other cities from the territories of Ephraim, Dan, and the half tribe of Manasseh.​—Jos 21:1-5, 9-26; 1Ch 6:54-61, 66-70.
Heman, a Kohathite of the family of Izhar, was given a position by David in connection with the singing at Jehovah’s sanctuary. (1Ch 6:31-38) One hundred and twenty Kohathites under Uriel their chief were among those whom David appointed to bring the ark of Jehovah from the house of Obed-edom to Jerusalem, on which occasion Heman figured prominently in the music and singing. (1Ch 15:4, 5, 11-17, 19, 25) According to First Chronicles, when David divided the Levites into courses, or divisions, some Kohathites were singers (25:1, 4-6) and gatekeepers (26:1-9); others were in charge of the stores and things made holy (26:23-28); and some acted as officers, judges, and administrators. (26:29-32) Certain Kohathites looked after baking and the preparation of layer bread for the Sabbath.​—1Ch 9:31, 32.
The Kohathites praised Jehovah upon learning that he would give Judah under Jehoshaphat victory over the combined forces of Ammon, Moab, and Seir. (2Ch 20:14-19) Kohathite Levites participated in cleansing the house of Jehovah in King Hezekiah’s day. (2Ch 29:12-17) Also, Kohathites Zechariah and Meshullam were among those acting as overseers when King Josiah repaired the temple.​—2Ch 34:8-13.

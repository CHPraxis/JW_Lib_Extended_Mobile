BEEROTH BENE-JAAKAN
(Be·erʹoth Benʹe-jaʹa·kan) [Wells of the Sons of Jaakan].
A place at which the Israelites camped perhaps more than once during their wanderings in the wilderness, the last time being shortly before Aaron’s death on Mount Hor. (De 10:6) It is tentatively identified with el-Birein, about 62 km (38 mi) SW of Beer-sheba and near modern ʽEzuz. There are wells here, and the probable location of Kadesh-barnea is but a few miles south. Nelson Glueck comments: “There is a strikingly large number of antiquity sites in this district.” (Rivers in the Desert, 1960, p. 97) Beeroth Bene-jaakan is evidently referred to as simply Bene-jaakan at Numbers 33:31.​—See BENE-JAAKAN.

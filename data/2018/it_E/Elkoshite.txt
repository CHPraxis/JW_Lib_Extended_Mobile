ELKOSHITE
(Elʹkosh·ite) [Of (Belonging to) Elkosh].
A resident of Elkosh. “Elkoshite” is applied only to the prophet Nahum. (Na 1:1) Some would place Elkosh in Galilee. However, Nahum may have been in Judah at the time he wrote the book bearing his name. (Na 1:15) If so, this would make the suggested identity with Judean site Beit Jibrin (Bet Guvrin), about 6 km (3.5 mi) NE of Lachish, the most likely proposal. The identification, however, remains tentative.

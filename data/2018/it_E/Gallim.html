<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">(Galʹlim) [Heaps].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The home of Palti, to whom Saul gave his daughter Michal as his wife after David was outlawed. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:25:44-9:25:44" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1Sa 25:44</a>) It is possibly the same as the Gallim whose inhabitants, centuries later, cried out in lamentation over the approaching Assyrian army under Sennacherib. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:10:24-23:10:24" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Isa 10:24,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:10:30-23:10:30" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 30</a>) Some scholars place Gallim at Khirbet Kakul (Horvat Kaʽkul), about 4.5 km (3 mi) NNE of the Temple Mount.</p>

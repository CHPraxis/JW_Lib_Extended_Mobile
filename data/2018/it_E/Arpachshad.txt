ARPACHSHAD
(Ar·pachʹshad).
A son of Shem. He was born two years after the Flood, that is, about 2368 B.C.E., and died 438 years later. He was an ancestor of the Hebrews through his grandson Eber. (Ge 10:22, 24; 11:10-13; 1Ch 1:17-27) He is shown to be the father of Shelah, although Luke’s account (3:35, 36), by the inclusion of Cainan, apparently would make him Shelah’s grandfather; but see CAINAN No. 2.​—Ge 10:24; 11:12; 1Ch 1:24.

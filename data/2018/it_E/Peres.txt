PERES
(Peʹres).
Daniel used this Aramaic word when interpreting the handwriting on the wall, “MENE, MENE, TEKEL and PARSIN.” (Da 5:25, 28) Dr. Judah Slotki points out that the handwriting means “a maneh, a maneh, a shekel and half shekels.” (Soncino Books of the Bible, edited by A. Cohen, London, 1951; see also Peake’s Commentary on the Bible, edited by M. Black and H. H. Rowley, London, 1964, p. 596.) Since “Peres” is the singular number of “Parsin,” it would mean “a half shekel.”
In the prophet’s interpretation of “Peres,” he employed two other Aramaic words spelled with the same three consonants but vocalized differently. “PERES [Peresʹ], your kingdom has been divided [peri·sathʹ] and given to the Medes and the Persians [u·Pha·rasʹ].” Thus the inspired explanation included a double play on the word “Peres” and the root meaning “divide.” The subsequent events of that night proved the accuracy of the interpretation.​—See PARSIN.

CHRYSOPRASE
(chrysʹo·prase).
A semiprecious, translucent gemstone, an apple-green variety of chalcedony. The color is caused by traces of nickel in the mineral. The only Biblical reference to chrysoprase (Gr., khry·soʹpra·sos) is in Revelation, where it is mentioned as constituting the tenth foundation of the wall of “the holy city, New Jerusalem.”​—Re 21:2, 20.

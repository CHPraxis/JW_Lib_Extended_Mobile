SEAH
(seʹah).
A dry measure that, according to rabbinic sources, is equal to one third of an ephah. (Ge 18:6; 1Sa 25:18; 1Ki 18:32; 2Ki 7:1, 16, 18) Since, on the basis of archaeological evidence regarding the capacity of the corresponding liquid bath measure (compare Eze 45:11), the ephah measure is reckoned at 22 L (20 dry qt), the seah measure would equal 7.33 L (6.66 dry qt).

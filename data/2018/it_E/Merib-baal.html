<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">(Merʹib-baʹal) [possibly, Contender Against Baal; or, Baal Makes a Legal Defense].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Grandson of King Saul, son of Jonathan, and the father of Micah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:8:33-13:8:34" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1Ch 8:33, 34</a>) This is apparently another name for Mephibosheth. Other persons also had two names, such as Eshbaal, also called Ish-bosheth.​—Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:2:8-10:2:8" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2Sa 2:8</a> with <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:8:33-13:8:33" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1Ch 8:33</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The name Merib-baal is found in two somewhat different Hebrew forms (<em>Merivʹ baʹʽal</em> and <em>Meri-vaʹʽal</em>) at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:9:40-13:9:40" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 Chronicles 9:40</a>. The first form is also used at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:8:34-13:8:34" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 Chronicles 8:34</a>. Indicating similar identity is the fact that Mephibosheth had a boy named Mica and Merib-baal had a son named Micah. (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:9:12-10:9:12" data-bid="6-1" class="b">2Sa 9:12</a> with <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:9:40-13:9:40" data-bid="7-1" class="b">1Ch 9:40</a>.) The forms “Mica” and “Micah” are due merely to a slight variation in the Hebrew spelling of these names.</p>

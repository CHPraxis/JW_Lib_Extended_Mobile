<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">The original-language words rendered “understanding” can refer to comprehension of a rather simple kind or can describe a full and profound realization of the inner nature, underlying reasons, and significance of complex matters. Insight, discernment, and perception are all closely connected to understanding.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The Hebrew verb <em>bin</em> and the noun <em>bi·nahʹ</em> are most frequently related to understanding.

Professor R. C. Dentan, writing in <em>The Interpreter’s Dictionary of the Bible</em> (edited by G. Buttrick, 1962, Vol. 4, p. 733), says: “The root בין [<em>bin</em>] means primarily ‘to discern with the senses,’ ‘to perceive distinctions,’ then ‘to give close attention to,’ and finally​—particularly in the derived stems—​‘to gain comprehension’ or ‘give’ it to others.” Hebrew scholar Gesenius gives the basic sense as <em>“to separate, to distinguish;</em> . . . hence <em>to discern, to mark, to understand,</em> all [of] which depend on the power of separating, distinguishing, discriminating.” (<em>A Hebrew and English Lexicon of the Old Testament,</em> translated by E. Robinson, 1836, p. 140) Another noun, <em>tevu·nahʹ,</em> comes from the same root as <em>bi·nahʹ</em> and may be appropriately rendered “discernment” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:10:23-20:10:23" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Pr 10:23;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:11:12-20:11:12" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 11:12</a>) or “understanding” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:31:3-2:31:3" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ex 31:3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:32:28-5:32:28" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> De 32:28</a>), according to the context.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The basic meaning of these terms reveals the understanding person to be one able to see into a matter and discern its composition by separating the individual factors or features that compose or act together to form the whole, then to perceive the relationship between them and thus comprehend, or grasp, the significance or meaning of the matter. This may be illustrated with a language. If a person is to understand what is spoken in a certain tongue, he must be able to distinguish the individual words composing the sentences, know their meaning, and see how they relate to one another. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:28:49-5:28:49" data-bid="6-1" class="b">De 28:49</a>) However, even though a person may basically comprehend what is said to him, understanding can also go beyond such simple comprehension; it means that he gets the real significance and sense of the message, then is able to evaluate it, benefit by it, and know what action it calls for. When Ezra the priest read the Law before the people in Jerusalem, “all intelligent [from Heb., <em>bin</em>] enough to listen” were gathered. Even though these had mature minds able to understand all the words, the Levites “were explaining the law to the people [instructing the people in the law, or giving understanding (form of <em>bin</em>)], . . . reading aloud from the book, from the law of the true God, it being expounded, and there being a putting of meaning into it; and they continued giving understanding in the reading.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:8:2-16:8:3" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ne 8:2, 3,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:8:7-16:8:8" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 7, 8</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">In the Greek Scriptures, “understanding,” as signifying perception, getting the sense of a matter, is represented especially by the verb <em>sy·niʹe·mi</em> (literally, put together) and the related noun <em>syʹne·sis.</em> Other terms are <em>e·piʹsta·mai,</em> meaning, basically, “know well,” and <em>gi·noʹsko,</em> meaning “know.”</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><strong>Source of Understanding.</strong> Jehovah God is both the Source of understanding and the Supreme Example of its use. The splendid coordination and functioning of the universe, in which each creation serves a particular and harmonious purpose, with no clashes or problems resulting from a lack of discernment on their Creator’s part, manifest God’s understanding. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:38:36-18:38:36" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Job 38:36;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:136:5-19:136:9" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> Ps 136:5-9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:3:19-20:3:20" data-bid="8-3" class="b"> Pr 3:19, 20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:10:12-24:10:13" data-bid="8-4" class="b"> Jer 10:12, 13</a>) God has given the animals instinctive understanding, each according to its kind. Men may spend years gaining understanding of aerodynamics, but the falcon instinctively knows just how to “read” and utilize the different types of air currents. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:39:26-18:39:26" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Job 39:26</a>) Animals, however, do not have certain other aspects of understanding that are peculiar to man.​—Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:32:9-19:32:9" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ps 32:9</a>.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Despite intensive research over centuries, many features and cycles operating according to divine laws still elude man’s full comprehension.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:26:7-18:26:14" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Job 26:7-14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:92:5-19:92:6" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> Ps 92:5, 6</a>) Consideration of the divine wisdom and understanding manifest in the material creation, however, enabled Job to discern his proper relationship to the <span id="page1139" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="1139" data-before-text="1139"></span>Creator and humbly recognize his own lack of understanding.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:42:1-18:42:6" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Job 42:1-6</a>.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">As regards man, Jehovah can exercise insight into the thoughts and doings of all mankind (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:28:9-13:28:9" data-bid="14-1" class="b">1Ch 28:9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:139:1-19:139:6" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> Ps 139:1-6</a>), and as he chooses, he ‘gives thoughtful consideration’ (Heb., <em>bin</em>) or attention to individuals and classes.

<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Knowledge of Jehovah God and discernment of his will combined with faith and trust therefore form the foundation of all true understanding on the part of his intelligent creatures. “Knowledge of the Most Holy One is what understanding is,” and this includes understanding “righteousness and judgment and uprightness, <em>the entire course of what is good.”</em> (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:9:10-20:9:10" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Pr 9:10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:2:6-20:2:9" data-bid="19-2" class="b"> 2:6-9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:16:20-20:16:20" data-bid="19-3" class="b"> 16:20</a>) No matter of real importance can be fully understood unless all the factors are viewed from Jehovah’s standpoint and seen in relation to his standards, qualities, and eternal purpose.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb"><strong><em>Those turning from the Source.</em></strong> The person who turns to transgression begins to discount God as a factor to be considered when making decisions and plans. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:34:27-18:34:27" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Job 34:27</a>) Such a person allows his heart to blind him to the wrongness of his ways and he loses insight. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:36:1-19:36:4" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Ps 36:1-4</a>) Even if claiming to worship God, he puts men’s precepts above God’s; he prefers them.

<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb"><strong>Fields of Human Understanding.</strong> Understanding may relate to knowledge and skill in mechanical activities, such as construction and designing of buildings or the making of articles of wood, metal, stone, or cloth. The Tyrian worker Hiram was “a skillful man, experienced in understanding” as a craftsman working with a wide range of materials. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:2:13-14:2:14" data-bid="27-1" class="b">2Ch 2:13, 14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:7:13-11:7:14" data-bid="27-2" class="b"> 1Ki 7:13, 14</a>) Such understanding contributes to effective work, resulting in products of enduring quality.</p>

<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Some may have keen discernment of human nature, being observant and able to ‘put two and two together.’ David, noting the way his servants were whispering, ‘discerned’ that his child by Bath-sheba had died.

<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Similarly, men or communities of men may show considerable discernment in business operations, a factor in their successfully enriching themselves, as did “the leader” of Tyre.

<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">It can be seen, then, that the Scriptures refer to understanding obtainable by natural means. Yet any such “comprehension” (<em>syʹne·sis</em>) of worldly ‘intellectual men’ (<em>sy·ne·toiʹ</em>) becomes foolishness, in vain, when God’s purposes are not considered.

<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb"><strong>Relationship to Knowledge and Wisdom.</strong> Understanding must be based on knowledge, and it works with knowledge, though it is itself more than mere knowledge. The extent and worth of one’s understanding is measurably affected <span id="page1140" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="1140" data-before-text="1140"></span>by the quantity and quality of one’s knowledge. Knowledge is acquaintance with facts, and the greatest and most fundamental facts relate to God, his existence, his invincible purpose, his ways. Understanding enables the person to relate the knowledge he acquires to God’s purpose and standards, and thereby he can assess or evaluate such knowledge. The “understanding heart is one that searches for knowledge”; it is not satisfied with a mere superficial view but seeks to get the full picture. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:15:14-20:15:14" data-bid="39-1" class="b">Pr 15:14</a>) Knowledge must become ‘pleasant to one’s very soul’ if discernment is to safeguard one from perversion and deception.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:2:10-20:2:11" data-bid="40-1" class="b">Pr 2:10, 11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:18:15-20:18:15" data-bid="40-2" class="b"> 18:15</a>; see <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200002643/">KNOWLEDGE</a>.</p>

(Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:49:3-19:49:4" data-bid="42-1" class="b">Ps 49:3, 4</a>.) Knowledge and understanding together bring wisdom, which is “the prime thing,” the ability to bring a fund of knowledge and keen understanding to bear on problems with successful results.

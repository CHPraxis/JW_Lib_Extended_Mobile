FORTUNATUS
(For·tu·naʹtus) [from Lat., Fortunate; Prosperous].
One of the mature members of the congregation in Corinth who, together with Stephanas and Achaicus, visited Paul at Ephesus. (1Co 16:8, 17, 18) From these men Paul may have learned of the disturbing conditions about which he wrote, and they were possibly the ones who delivered Paul’s first canonical letter to the Corinthians.​—1Co 1:11; 5:1; 11:18.

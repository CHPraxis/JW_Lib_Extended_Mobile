CUSHAN
(Cuʹshan).
Cushan appears at Habakkuk 3:7 as paralleling “the land of Midian” and hence evidently is another name for Midian or relates to a neighboring country. As shown in the article CUSH (No. 2), some descendants of Cush appear to have settled on the Arabian Peninsula; and the name Kusi or Kushim was anciently used to describe certain Arabic peoples of that region.

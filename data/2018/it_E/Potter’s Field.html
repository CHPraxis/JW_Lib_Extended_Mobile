<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">After remorseful Judas threw into the temple the betrayal price of 30 pieces of silver (if shekels, $66), the chief priests used the money to buy “the potter’s field to bury strangers.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:27:3-40:27:10" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Mt 27:3-10</a>) The field came to be known as Akeldama, or “Field of Blood.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:1:18-44:1:19" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ac 1:18, 19</a>; see <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200000185/">AKELDAMA</a>.) Since the fourth century C.E. this field has been identified with a location on the S slope of the Hinnom Valley, just before it joins the Kidron Valley.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The expression “the potter’s field” does not specifically indicate whether the field was one simply owned by a potter or was called that because, at some point in its history, it was an area where potters pursued their craft. The latter, though, <span id="page659" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="659" data-before-text="659"></span>seems probable if the traditional site is correct. It would be near the Gate of the Potsherds (or “Gate of the Potters,” according to J. Simons in his footnote in <em>Jerusalem in the Old Testament,</em> Leiden, 1952, p. 230; “Gate of the Ash-heaps” in Nehemiah), mentioned in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:19:1-24:19:2" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Jeremiah 19:1, 2</a>. (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:18:2-24:18:2" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Jer 18:2</a>.) The necessary raw material, clay, was available in the vicinity. Also, making pottery required a good water supply, and the site was close to the spring at En-rogel and the Pool of Siloam as well as near such water as might be in the Hinnom Valley in the winter.</p>

ADMAH
(Adʹmah) [Ground].
One of the five cities in the region of “the Low Plain of Siddim” inhabited by Canaanites. (Ge 10:19; 14:1-3) This low plain, or vale, was probably near the southern end of the Salt Sea.
Along with the neighboring cities of Sodom, Gomorrah, Zeboiim, and Bela (Zoar), Admah and its king, Shinab, suffered defeat at the time of the invasion by four eastern kings. (Ge 14:8-11) Deuteronomy 29:23 shows that Admah was later destroyed along with Sodom, Gomorrah, and Zeboiim when Jehovah caused a rain of fire and sulfur to descend upon the entire basin. (Ge 19:25) At Hosea 11:8 it is referred to, along with Zeboiim, as a warning example.
Many scholars believe that the original sites of Admah and the other “cities of the District” now lie submerged beneath the waters of the Salt Sea, though some others recently have claimed that the ruins of the cities may be identified with sites along wadis to the E and SE of the Dead Sea.​—Ge 13:12.

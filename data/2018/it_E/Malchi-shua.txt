(Malʹchi-shuʹa) [My King [Hears My] Cry for Help].
One of King Saul’s sons. (1Sa 14:49; 1Ch 8:33; 9:39) He was struck down in battle by the Philistines at Mount Gilboa (1Sa 31:2; 1Ch 10:2), and his corpse (along with those of his brothers Jonathan and Abinadab and that of his father Saul) was fastened by the Philistines on the wall of Beth-shan. However, valiant men of Israel retrieved the bodies, burned them in Jabesh, and buried their bones there.​—1Sa 31:8-13.

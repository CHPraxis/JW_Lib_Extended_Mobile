ALLAMMELECH
(Al·lamʹme·lech) [Massive Tree of the King].
A town in the territory allotted the tribe of Asher (Jos 19:26), N of the torrent valley of Kishon. The exact site is unknown but was probably in the S part of the Plain of Acco, perhaps on the Wadi el-Melek (Nahal Zippori), which empties into the Kishon.

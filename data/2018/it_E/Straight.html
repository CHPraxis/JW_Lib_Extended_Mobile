<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A street in Damascus, Syria. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:9:10-44:9:11" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ac 9:10, 11</a>; PICTURE, Vol. 2, p. 748) During the Roman period, it was a major thoroughfare running from east to west through the city for approximately 1.5 km (1 mi). The center lane for vehicular traffic was about 15 m (50 ft) wide, with colonnaded walkways on either side for pedestrians, creating a grand avenue about 26 m (85 ft) in width. Still bearing an Arabic equivalent of the former name (Darb al-Mustaqim), but no longer completely straight, it runs W from the city’s East Gate. On this ancient street, at the house of a man named Judas, Saul of Tarsus stayed for a time after the glorified Jesus Christ appeared to him. In a vision, Jesus directed the disciple Ananias to this home on “the street called Straight” to restore Saul’s sight.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:9:3-44:9:12" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ac 9:3-12,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:9:17-44:9:19" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 17-19</a>.</p>

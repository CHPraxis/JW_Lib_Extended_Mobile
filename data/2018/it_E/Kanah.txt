KANAH
(Kaʹnah) [Reed; Cane].
1. A torrent valley that served as a boundary between Ephraim and Manasseh. (Jos 16:8; 17:9) Today it is usually linked with the Wadi Qanah (Nahal Qana). This small stream rises in the hill country a few kilometers SW of Nablus and, as the Wadi Ishkar, flows in a southwesterly direction and then joins the Wadi Yarkon (Nahal Yarqon), which empties into the Mediterranean Sea N of Tel Aviv-Yafo. However, some scholars believe that in Joshua’s day the lower course of the Wadi Qanah perhaps flowed directly into the Mediterranean at a point about 10 km (6 mi) farther N.
2. A boundary city of Asher. (Jos 19:24, 28) It is generally identified with modern Qana, about 12 km (7.5 mi) ESE of Tyre.

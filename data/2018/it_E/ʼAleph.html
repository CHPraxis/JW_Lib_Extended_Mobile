<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">[א] (ʼAʹleph).</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The first letter of the Hebrew alphabet. The name assigned to this letter is the same as the Hebrew word for “ox; cow.”​—Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:8:7-19:8:7" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ps 8:7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:7:13-5:7:13" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> De 7:13</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">In Hebrew <em>ʼaʹleph</em> is not a vowel but a consonant and has no true equivalent in English. It is <span id="page70" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="70" data-before-text="70"></span>transliterated in writing by a raised comma (ʼ). As pronounced in Hebrew it is the softest of guttural sounds (that is, sounds pronounced in the throat) and is like the slight guttural sound given to the silent “h” at the beginning of the English word “hour,” or like with the second “o” in “cooperate.”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">In the Hebrew, the first eight verses in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:119:1-19:119:8" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Psalm 119</a> begin with <em>ʼaʹleph.</em></p>

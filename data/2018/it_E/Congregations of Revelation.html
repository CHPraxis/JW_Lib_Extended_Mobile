<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">TOWARD the end of the first century C.E., the resurrected Jesus Christ in a very touching way showed keen interest in his anointed followers still on earth. How? By directing the aged apostle John to write letters to “the seven congregations that [were] in the district of Asia.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:1:1-66:1:4" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Re 1:1-4</a>) Those letters contained much needed encouragement, counsel, and warning.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Today, only ruins are found on the sites of most of the cities where those congregations were located. Yet, these give evidence that what was written deals with real places, actual situations, and people who truly lived. Of even greater interest, however, is the fact that these messages pointed to conditions that would exist at a future time in the Christian congregation.</p>

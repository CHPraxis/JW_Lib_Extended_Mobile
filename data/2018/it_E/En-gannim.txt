EN-GANNIM
(En-ganʹnim) [Fountain (or, Spring) of Gardens].
1. A Judean city in the Shephelah, or lowland, mentioned in the same group as Adullam at Joshua 15:33-35. Its site is possibly at modern Beit Jimal about 2.5 km (1.5 mi) S of Beth-shemesh, or a site nearby. Umm Jina, which lies about 1 km (0.5 mi) W of Beth-shemesh, has been suggested by some as the site, but it is less probable, because no fountain is found there.
2. A city located in the tribe of Issachar’s inheritance. (Jos 19:17, 21) It may be the city that Josephus called Ginae. Today it is identified with Jenin, a town on the S edge of the Valley of Jezreel, lying about 18 km (11 mi) SE of Megiddo and 8 km (5 mi) NE of Dothan, on the main road from Jerusalem to Nazareth. Jenin is surrounded by orchards and gardens and has a spring, which characteristics would harmonize with the meaning of the name En-gannim.
En-gannim, with its pasture ground, was allotted to the sons of Gershon as a Levite city. (Jos 21:27-29) In 1 Chronicles 6:73 it is evidently called Anem.

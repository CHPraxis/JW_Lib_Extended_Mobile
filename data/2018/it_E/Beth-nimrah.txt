BETH-NIMRAH
(Beth-nimʹrah) [House of the Leopard].
A town assigned to the tribe of Gad on the E side of the Jordan, also called simply Nimrah. (Nu 32:3, 34, 36) It is described as in “the low plain” and as previously forming part of the realm of King Sihon. (Jos 13:27) The ancient name seems to be preserved in modern Tell Nimrin, situated on the S side of the Wadi Nimrin, but the original site is evidently at Tell Bleibil, about 2.5 km (1.5 mi) to the NE, on the N side of the wadi, where investigations show evidence of occupation during the Israelite period followed by abandonment. It thus lay about 19 km (12 mi) ENE of Jericho.

JOANNA
(Jo·anʹna) [shortened feminine form of Jehohanan, meaning “Jehovah Has Shown Favor; Jehovah Has Been Gracious”].
One of several women whom Jesus Christ cured of infirmities and who then became his followers, ministering to him and his apostles from their own possessions. (Lu 8:1-3) Joanna was apparently with the women present at Jesus’ impalement. Having prepared spices and oil to take to his tomb, these women were among the first to find that he had been resurrected. The 11 apostles, however, found their report difficult to believe. (Lu 23:49, 55, 56; 24:1-11) Joanna’s husband Chuza was steward of Herod Antipas.​—Lu 8:3.

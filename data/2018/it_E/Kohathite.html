(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:3:19-4:3:19" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Nu 3:19,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:3:27-4:3:27" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 27</a>) Their chieftain at the time of Israel’s encampment at Mount Sinai (1513 B.C.E.) was Elizaphan the son of Uzziel.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:3:30-4:3:30" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Nu 3:30</a>.</p>

When the smaller number is added to the 7,500 and the 6,200 of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:3:22-4:3:22" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Numbers 3:22,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:3:34-4:3:34" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 34</a>, the sum total is 22,000​—the very figure found in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:3:39-4:3:39" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Numbers 3:39</a>.

<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">During the wilderness trek, the Kohathites were assigned to camp on the S side of the tabernacle (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:3:29-4:3:29" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Nu 3:29</a>), between it and the encampment of the tribes of Reuben, Simeon, and Gad.

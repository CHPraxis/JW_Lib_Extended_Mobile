<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">(Shamʹgar).</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A deliverer of Israel between the judgeships of Ehud and Barak. Only one heroic deed of Shamgar is recorded, the slaying of 600 Philistines with a cattle goad, but he is accredited thereby with ‘saving Israel.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:3:31-7:3:31" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Jg 3:31</a>) According to Josephus, Shamgar died in his first year of judgeship. (<em>Jewish Antiquities,</em> V, 197 [iv, 3]) His being a “son of Anath” may refer to the Naphtalite city of Beth-anath.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:1:33-7:1:33" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Jg 1:33</a>.</p>

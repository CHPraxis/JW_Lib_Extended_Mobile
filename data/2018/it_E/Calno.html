<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">(Calʹno).</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A city listed in Isaiah’s prophecy concerning the boasting of the Assyrians as to their conquests and the futility of trying to withstand their might. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:10:5-23:10:5" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Isa 10:5,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:10:9-23:10:11" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 9-11</a>) Most scholars consider Calno to be an alternate spelling of Calneh. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/30:6:2-30:6:2" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Am 6:2</a>) Calno’s mention in connection with Carchemish would harmonize with the identification of Calneh with Kullani of the Assyrian texts, located between Carchemish and Aleppo. Kullani was conquered by Tiglath-pileser III, a contemporary of King Menahem of Israel.</p>

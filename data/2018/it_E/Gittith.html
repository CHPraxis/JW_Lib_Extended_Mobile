<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">(Gitʹtith).</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A musical expression of uncertain meaning, appearing in the superscriptions of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:8:0-19:8:0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalms 8,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:81:0-19:81:0" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 81</a>, and <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:84:0-19:84:0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">84</a>. The term seems to be derived from the Hebrew word <em>gath,</em> which is also the name of a town located on the border of Judah and Philistia. Some have suggested that “Gittith” denotes a tune associated with vintage songs, since <em>gath</em> refers to a winepress. The Greek <em>Septuagint</em> and the Latin <em>Vulgate,</em> therefore, render “Gittith” as “winepresses.”</p>

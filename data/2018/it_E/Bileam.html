<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">(Bilʹe·am) [possibly, One Swallowing Down].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A town assigned to the Levites of the family of Kohath, given to them from the territory of the half tribe of Manasseh located W of the Jordan River. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:6:70-13:6:70" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1Ch 6:70</a>; <em>LXX,</em> “Ieblaam”) The listing of Levite cities at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:21:11-6:21:39" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Joshua 21:11-39</a> does not include Bileam, but many scholars believe that a scribal error caused Gath-rimmon to be repeated in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:21:25-6:21:25" data-bid="3-1" class="b">verse 25</a> in place of Bileam. Bileam appears to be a variant spelling of Ibleam, this latter form being more frequently used.</p>

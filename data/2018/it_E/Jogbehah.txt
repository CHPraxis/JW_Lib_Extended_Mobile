JOGBEHAH
(Jogʹbe·hah).
One of the fortified cities with stone flock pens that were built or rebuilt by the Gadites before their crossing the Jordan to assist in the conquest of Canaan. (Nu 32:34-36) At a later period Judge Gideon’s forces passed Jogbehah prior to their surprise attack on the Midianite camp at Karkor. (Jg 8:10, 11) Jogbehah is identified with el-Jubeihat, situated about 1,050 m (3,440 ft) above sea level and some 10 km (6 mi) NW of modern ʽAmman (Rabbah).

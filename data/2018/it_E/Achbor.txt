ACHBOR
(Achʹbor) [Jerboa; Jumping Rodent].
1. The father of Baal-hanan, who is listed as the seventh king of Edom.​—Ge 36:38, 39; 1Ch 1:49.
2. The son of Micaiah and a trusted official of King Josiah’s court. (2Ki 22:12) He is called “Abdon the son of Micah” at 2 Chronicles 34:20. Upon learning of Jehovah’s burning rage expressed in the ancient book of the Law, only recently discovered, Josiah sent Achbor as one of a committee of five to the prophetess Huldah to learn what should be done. (2Ki 22:8-14) Achbor was the father of Elnathan, a prince of the court of King Jehoiakim, and very likely the great-grandfather of King Jehoiachin.​—Jer 26:22; 36:12; 2Ki 24:8.

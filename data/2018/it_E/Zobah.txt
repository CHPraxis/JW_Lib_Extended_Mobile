ZOBAH
(Zoʹbah).
A Syrian (Aramaean) kingdom otherwise known as Aram-Zobah. (Ps 60:Sup) One of its kings was Hadadezer. (1Ki 11:23) The compound form “Hamath-zobah” may designate adjoining kingdoms named Hamath and Zobah. (2Ch 8:3) Zobah seems to have been located N of Damascus with a domain extending to the region of Hamath on the N and to the river Euphrates on the E.​—2Sa 8:3.
King Saul warred against the kings of Zobah. (1Sa 14:47) The Ammonites later hired Syrians of Zobah and other troops to fight against David, but all were defeated by his army. (2Sa 10:6-19; 1Ch 19:6-19) It was likely in this war that David vanquished and took spoil from Zobah’s King Hadadezer, including much copper (eventually used in temple construction) from his cities Betah (apparently also named Tibhath) and Berothai (Cun?). (2Sa 8:3-12; 1Ch 18:3-9) One of the mighty men of David’s military forces was Igal the son of Nathan of Zobah.​—2Sa 23:8, 36; see ARAM No. 5; HADADEZER.

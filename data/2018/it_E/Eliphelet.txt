ELIPHELET
(E·liphʹe·let) [My God Is Escape; God of Escape].
1. Son of Ahasbai; one of David’s mighty men. (2Sa 23:34) Eliphelet possibly is the Eliphal of 1 Chronicles 11:35.
2. A son born to David in Jerusalem (1Ch 3:5, 6), also called Elpelet at 1 Chronicles 14:5.
3. The last-named son of David to be born in Jerusalem. (2Sa 5:16; 1Ch 3:8; 14:7) Commentators who do not view the repetition of the name in the Chronicles account to be a scribal error suggest that this second Eliphelet was born after the death of the first son by that name.
4. The third son of Eshek, a descendant of King Saul.​—1Ch 8:33, 39.
5. A descendant of Adonikam who returned to Jerusalem from Babylon with Ezra.​—Ezr 8:1, 13.
6. A man listed among those having taken foreign wives but who, in compliance with Ezra’s exhortation, sent them away.​—Ezr 10:33, 44.

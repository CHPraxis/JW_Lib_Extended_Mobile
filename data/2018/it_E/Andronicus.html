<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A faithful Jewish Christian in the congregation at Rome to whom Paul sent greetings. Paul calls Andronicus and Junias “my relatives.” While the Greek word used here (<em>syg·ge·nesʹ</em>) in its broader sense can mean “fellow-countrymen,” the primary meaning is “blood relatives of the same generation.” The context indicates that Andronicus likely was so related to Paul. Like Paul, <span id="page106" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="106" data-before-text="106"></span>Andronicus had suffered imprisonment, was now a ‘man of note’ among the apostles, and had become a Christian prior to Paul.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:16:7-45:16:7" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ro 16:7</a>.</p>

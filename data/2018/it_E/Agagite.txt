AGAGITE
(Agʹag·ite) [Of (Belonging to) Agag].
A term applied to Haman and to his father, Hammedatha, at Esther 3:1, 10; 8:3, 5; 9:24. It apparently designates them as descendants of Agag and hence of Amalekite descent. The Jews traditionally have understood the expression in this way and take the Agag to be the monarch mentioned at 1 Samuel 15:8-33. Josephus refers to Haman as “of Amalekite descent.” (Jewish Antiquities, XI, 209 [vi, 5]) Mordecai was a descendant of Kish of the tribe of Benjamin, thus making him and Haman, in a sense, traditional enemies.​—Es 2:5.

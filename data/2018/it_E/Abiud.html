<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">(A·biʹud) [possibly, Father Is Dignity].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The Grecized or Anglicized form of the Hebrew name Abihud. A descendant of Zerubbabel and an ancestor of Christ Jesus. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:1:13-40:1:13" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Mt 1:13</a>) The term “father” as used by Matthew may have the meaning of “forefather.” Some scholars suggest that he may be the same as “Joda” at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:3:26-42:3:26" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Luke 3:26</a>. However, it is not necessary to relate these persons as being the same individual, since the genealogical lines given by Matthew and Luke are only parallel, not identical, while those at First Chronicles are more comprehensive. Abiud’s son, Eliakim, is also included in the line of descent of the Messiah.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:1:13-40:1:13" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Mt 1:13</a>.</p>

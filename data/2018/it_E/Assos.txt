ASSOS
(Asʹsos).
A seaport town in Mysia on the N shore of the Gulf of Adramyttium, hence within the Roman province of Asia. The site is today known as Behramkale (previously, Behramköy).
On his third missionary tour, the apostle Paul was heading back to Jerusalem and had stopped at Troas. From there he sent Luke and others by boat to Assos, where he planned to join them. The boat had to travel around Cape Baba (Lectum) to get to Assos (on the other side of the promontory from Troas), and this enabled Paul to walk the shorter distance (c. 32 km; 20 mi) on foot and still arrive at Assos in time to board the ship, which then traveled to Mitylene on the island of Lesbos, S of Assos.​—Ac 20:6, 13, 14.

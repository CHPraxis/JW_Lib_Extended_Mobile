(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:1:8-12:1:8" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2Ki 1:8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:3:4-40:3:4" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Mt 3:4</a>) Doubtless the tanning operation was performed in the past as it has been recently in the Middle East​—in a one- or two-room tannery, housing tools and vats for preparing the hides. The basic process of preparing leather involved (1) loosening the hair, usually with a lime solution; (2) removing the hair, bits of flesh, and fat adhering to the hide; and (3) tanning the hide with a liquor made from such things as the bark of sumac or of oak, or from other kinds of plants.</p>

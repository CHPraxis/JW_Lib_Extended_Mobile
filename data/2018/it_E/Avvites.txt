AVVITES
(Avʹvites).
Inhabitants of Avva, who were among the peoples whom the Assyrians used to replace exiled Israelites after capturing Samaria in 740 B.C.E. (2Ki 17:24) All these transplanted inhabitants came to be known as Samaritans. The Avvites, though learning the fear of Jehovah to some degree, nevertheless, made and worshiped the gods Nibhaz and Tartak.​—2Ki 17:29-33; see AVVA.

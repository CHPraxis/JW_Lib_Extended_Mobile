NERI
(Neʹri) [from Heb., a shortened form of Neriah].
A descendant of King David through Nathan in the royal lineage of Jesus. According to Luke, Shealtiel was the son of Neri, yet Matthew says Jeconiah was the father of Shealtiel. (Mt 1:12; Lu 3:27) Perhaps Shealtiel married Neri’s daughter, thus becoming his son-in-law. It was not uncommon in Hebrew genealogical listings to speak of a son-in-law as a son. Hence, both accounts are correct.

BETH-JESHIMOTH
(Beth-jeshʹi·moth) [House of the Desolations].
The southernmost point to which the encampment of the Israelites reached as they camped on the Plains of Moab before crossing the Jordan into Canaan. (Nu 33:48, 49) The camp reached from Beth-jeshimoth to Abel-shittim, a distance of about 8 km (5 mi) according to the suggested sites for these places. Beth-jeshimoth is presently identified with Tell el-ʽAzeimeh near the NE corner of the Dead Sea and 19 km (12 mi) SE of Jericho. Nearby is Khirbet Sweimeh, which, as a Roman settlement, was known by the Greek name of Besimoth. A strong spring is also found in the vicinity. Tell el-ʽAzeimeh is situated on a platform of land overlooking the plains below, and it is in position to guard the exit from one of the torrent valleys leading down from the mountains to the E.
Beth-jeshimoth formed part of the realm of King Sihon of the Amorites and, after the Israelite conquest of that region, was assigned to the tribe of Reuben. (Jos 12:1-3; 13:15-21; compare Jg 11:13-27.) In the time of the prophet Ezekiel, it is included with certain cities of Moab located on the slope of his frontier and described as “the decoration of the land.” (Eze 25:8-10) The prophecy indicates that Jehovah would cause these frontier cities to be opened up, exposing Moab to attack by the “Orientals,” or “sons of the East,” the nomadic tribes living in the Arabian Desert. (Compare Jg 6:3, ftn; 8:10.) If not earlier, Moab likely took over Beth-jeshimoth and other cities of Reuben following the deportation of that tribe to Assyria.​—1Ch 5:26.

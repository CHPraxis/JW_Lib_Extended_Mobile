EN-ROGEL
(En-roʹgel) [Fountain (Spring) of Rogel (Foot)].
A spring or well near Jerusalem that marked the boundary between Judah and Benjamin. (Jos 15:7; 18:16) David’s spies Jonathan and Ahimaaz waited at En-rogel for intelligence concerning Absalom’s rebellion. (2Sa 17:17) Near here David’s other rebellious son Adonijah later held a feast to enlist support for his usurpation of the throne.​—1Ki 1:9.
It is generally agreed that En-rogel corresponds to the modern Bir Ayyub, or Job’s well. It is located S of the SE corner of Jerusalem’s wall, at the foot of the western bank of the Kidron Valley about 100 m (330 ft) S of the junction with the Valley of Hinnom. The well reaches an underground stream or spring, which, after a rain, sometimes flows so abundantly that it raises the level of water to the surface.

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A town in Moab to which Balak, the king of Moab, conducted the prophet Balaam so that he might see the camp of Israel and call down a curse upon it. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:22:41-4:22:41" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Nu 22:41</a>) Balak’s selection of this location for the enacting of the curse and the accompanying sacrifices may indicate that it was a center for Baal worship, evidently situated in an elevated place. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:23:1-4:23:9" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Nu 23:1-9</a>) Thereafter, Bamoth-baal and other towns “on the tableland” were assigned to the tribe of Reuben as an inheritance. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:13:15-6:13:15" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Jos 13:15,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:13:17-6:13:17" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 17</a>) In the early part of the ninth century B.C.E., King Mesha of Moab states that he rebuilt “Beth-bamoth, for it had been destroyed.” (Line 27 of the Moabite Stone) It seems likely that Bamoth, Bamoth-baal, and Beth-bamoth were all names of the same place.​—Compare Baal-meon, Beon, Beth-baal-meon in the article on <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200000517/">BAAL-MEON</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The description given in the Bible account indicates a place on the plateau region toward the NE corner of the Dead Sea. While the identification is only tentative, a suggested location is that of Khirbet Quweijiya, about 14 km (9 mi) E of the Dead Sea, near the probable location of Mount Nebo.</p>

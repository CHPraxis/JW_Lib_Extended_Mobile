ARUMAH
(A·ruʹmah) [Height; Exalted Place].
A town in the territory of Ephraim in which Abimelech, the son of Jerubbaal, resided and from which he launched his attack on the Shechemites. (Jg 9:41) It is tentatively identified with Khirbet el-ʽOrmah (Horvat ʼel-ʽUrmeh), about 8 km (5 mi) SE of Shechem. Some suggest that it is the same as the Rumah referred to at 2 Kings 23:36.​—See RUMAH.

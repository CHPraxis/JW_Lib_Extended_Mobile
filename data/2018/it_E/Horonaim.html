<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">(Hor·o·naʹim) [possibly, Two Holes [that is, caves]].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A place in Moab included among those against which Jehovah’s judgment was directed. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:15:1-23:15:1" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Isa 15:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:15:5-23:15:5" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:48:1-24:48:1" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> Jer 48:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:48:3-24:48:3" data-bid="1-4" class="b"> 3,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:48:5-24:48:5" data-bid="1-5" class="b"> 5,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:48:34-24:48:34" data-bid="1-6" class="b"> 34</a>) Its exact location is uncertain. However, the possible meaning of its name has led some to identify Horonaim tentatively with el-ʽIraq (meaning “Cave”), situated about 490 m (1,600 ft) below the level of the Moabite plateau and about 18 km (11 mi) E of the southern end of the Dead Sea. Horonaim may be the same as the “Hauronen” mentioned in the Moabite Stone as having been taken in battle by Mesha the king of Moab.</p>

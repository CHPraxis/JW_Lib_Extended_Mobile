<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">(Mazʹza·roth).</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The Aramaic Targum equates Mazzaroth with the <em>maz·za·lohthʹ</em> of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:23:5-12:23:5" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Kings 23:5</a>, “constellations of the zodiac,” or “twelve signs, or, constellations.” (<em>NW; KJ</em> margin) Some believe that the word is derived from a root meaning “engird” and that Mazzaroth refers to the zodiacal circle. However, at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:38:32-18:38:32" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Job 38:32</a> a singular pronoun is used in Hebrew in the expression “in its appointed time,” whereas the reference in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:23:5-12:23:5" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2 Kings 23:5</a> is in the plural. Hence, Mazzaroth appears to refer to a particular constellation rather than to the entire zodiacal circle, but no positive identification is possible at present.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">At <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:38:32-18:38:32" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Job 38:32</a> Jehovah asks Job: “Can you bring forth the Mazzaroth constellation in its appointed time? And as for the Ash constellation alongside <span id="page356" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="356" data-before-text="356"></span>its sons, can you conduct them?” Thus, whatever the identification of these particular constellations may be, God puts the question to Job whether he can control the visible celestial bodies, bringing forth a certain group at its proper season or guiding another constellation in its prescribed heavenly course.</p>

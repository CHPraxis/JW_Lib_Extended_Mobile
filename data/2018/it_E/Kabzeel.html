<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">(Kabʹze·el) [God Has Collected].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A city in the southern part of Judah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:15:21-6:15:21" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Jos 15:21</a>) It is tentatively identified with Khirbet Hora (Horvat Hur), about 10 km (6 mi) ENE of Beer-sheba. The Hebrew text of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:23:20-10:23:20" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Samuel 23:20</a> and <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:11:22-13:11:22" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Chronicles 11:22</a> has been variously understood to mean that Kabzeel was (1) the home of the distinguished warrior Benaiah, (2) the home of one of his progenitors or the place where such a one performed notable deeds, or (3) the scene for Benaiah’s many deeds. (Compare <em>AS; KJ; JB; Le; NW; RS.</em>) An alternate form, “Jekabzeel,” appears at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:11:25-16:11:25" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Nehemiah 11:25</a> in a listing of postexilic settlements in Judah.</p>

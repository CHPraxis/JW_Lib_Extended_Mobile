NOBAH
(Noʹbah).
1. [from a root verb meaning “bark”]. An Israelite, probably of the tribe of Manasseh, who captured Kenath and its dependent towns. Thereafter he named the city after himself.​—Nu 32:42.
2. A city E of the Jordan, captured by Nobah. (Nu 32:39, 42) Evidently the name Nobah did not stick, because later it is called by its original name, Kenath. (1Ch 2:23) The ruins at Qanawat, about 90 km (60 mi) SSE of Damascus are commonly identified with the ancient site.
3. A place situated E of the Jordan and near Jogbehah in Gad. (Nu 32:34, 35; Jg 8:11) Its precise location is not known today.

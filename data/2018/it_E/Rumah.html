It is tentatively identified with Khirbet er-Rumeh, which bears a similar name. Today called Horvat Ruma, it is situated about 10 km (6 mi) N of Nazareth. But some connect Rumah with the Biblical town of Arumah, mentioned at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:9:41-7:9:41" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Judges 9:41</a> and thought to have been located near Shechem.​—See <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200000393/">ARUMAH</a>.</p>

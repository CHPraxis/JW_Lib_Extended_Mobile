LAISHAH
(Laʹi·shah) [Lion].
A town in the territory of Benjamin identified by F.-M. Abel (Géographie de la Palestine, Paris, 1938, Vol. II, p. 368) with ʽIsawiya, about 2.5 km (1.5 mi) NNE of the Temple Mount in Jerusalem. Isaiah’s prophetic foreview of the rampaging Assyrian, as he advances village by village, calls on Laishah to “pay attention” to the coming attack.​—Isa 10:30.

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A geographic point used to define or give the situation of the camping site of the Israelites at Pihahiroth prior to their crossing the Red Sea.

<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The location of Baal-zephon is uncertain. It was evidently a familiar place at that time. The major factor is, of course, the Israelite’s crossing of the Red Sea, the account of which shows that they went through a body of water of considerable depth. Such situation is found only when reaching as far S as the northern end of the Gulf of Suez. On this basis some scholars associate Baal-zephon with the mountains in that region. <em>A Hebrew and English Lexicon of the Old Testament,</em> by Brown, Driver, and Briggs (1980, p. 128), says: “near Red Sea in Egypt, prob[ably] Mt. <em>ʽAtaka.”</em> This mountain lies near the head of the Gulf of Suez, a short distance to the SW of the present city of Suez. Others suggest Jebel el Galala, some 40 km (25 mi) or so farther S. Those favoring this site believe that Migdol, mentioned along with Baal-zephon in the accounts, was a watchtower located strategically on Jebel (Mount) <em>ʽ</em>Ataqah.​—See <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200001458/">EXODUS</a>; <a href="jwpub://p/E:1200003484/">PIHAHIROTH</a>.</p>

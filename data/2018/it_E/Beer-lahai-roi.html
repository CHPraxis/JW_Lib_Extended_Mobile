<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Hagar, Sarai’s Egyptian maidservant, when fleeing from her mistress’ wrath followed “the way to Shur,” leading through the Negeb down to Egypt. Reaching a certain fountain (Heb., <em>ʽaʹyin</em>), however, she was reassured by an angel, instructed to return to her mistress, and told of the birth and future of Ishmael (whose name means “God Hears (Listens)”). Therefore, the well there was called “Beer-lahai-roi,” Hagar saying of Jehovah, “You are a God of sight.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:16:7-1:16:14" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ge 16:7-14</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Later, Isaac was coming from “the way that goes to Beer-lahai-roi” in the Negeb when he caught sight of the camel caravan bringing his future bride, Rebekah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:24:62-1:24:63" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ge 24:62, 63</a>) Following Abraham’s death, Isaac resided “close by Beer-lahai-roi.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:25:11-1:25:11" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ge 25:11</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Beer-lahai-roi is stated to have been “between Kadesh and Bered.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:16:14-1:16:14" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ge 16:14</a>) A Bedouin tradition places it at ʽAin Muweilih, about 19 km (12 mi) NW of ʽAin Qedeis (the probable site of Kadesh-barnea). But the absence of any clear identification of Bered leaves the identification uncertain.</p>

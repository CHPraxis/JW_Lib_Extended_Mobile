SPIDER
[Heb., ʽak·ka·vishʹ].
A small, eight-legged, wingless animal that, according to strict biologic definition, is not an insect but an arachnid.
Most spiders spin webs to catch their prey. Spiders generally have three pairs of spinnerets, or spinning organs, located on the rear underside of the abdomen. These are linked with the silk glands inside the creature’s body by means of many minute tubes. As the liquid silk is forced through the spinnerets, it proceeds to harden and comes out as a delicate strand of silk. By keeping its spinnerets together, the spider can produce one thick thread. A band of fine threads results when the spinning organs are held apart.
The web, differing according to the variety of spider making it, is beautiful in symmetry and complex in design. At equidistant intervals on the silken strands are drops of glue, likewise made by the spider. After having laid a line between two spokes and smeared it with glue, the spider pulls down the thread and then lets it snap back. This results in the equidistant spacing of the tiny glue droplets. The sticky thread serves to trap the spider’s prey.
In its two occurrences in Scripture, the spider figures in illustrative settings. Bildad, in speaking to Job, referred to an apostate as one who trusts in or leans upon a “spider’s house,” or web, something that would be too frail to keep him standing. (Job 8:14, 15) The hurtful and violent works of unfaithful Israelites are likened to the weaving of a spider’s web. However, such unfaithful ones could not cover themselves with their works, any more than a cobweb would be suitable for a garment.​—Isa 59:5, 6.

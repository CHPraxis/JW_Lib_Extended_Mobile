SIRAH, CISTERN OF
(Siʹrah).
Abner was at the cistern of Sirah when Joab’s messengers had him return to Hebron, where he was subsequently murdered. (2Sa 3:26, 27) Sirah may correspond to ʽAin Sarah, a spring or well about 2.5 km (1.5 mi) NW of Hebron. Josephus claims that Sirah, which he calls Besera, was 20 furlongs (c. 4 km; 2.5 mi) from Hebron.​—Jewish Antiquities, VII, 34 (i, 5).

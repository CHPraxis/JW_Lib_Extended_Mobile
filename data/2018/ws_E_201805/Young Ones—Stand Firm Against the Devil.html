<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb">THE apostle Paul compared Christians to soldiers. We are in a war, and our enemies are real! But our war is not against humans; it is against Satan and the demons. They have been warriors for thousands of years and are very good at fighting. So it may seem that we cannot possibly win this war, especially if we are young. Can young people win a war against such powerful enemies? Yes they can, and they are winning! Why? Because they receive power from Jehovah. Also, like well-trained soldiers, they “put on the complete suit of armor from God” so that they will be prepared for battle.​—<strong>Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:6:10-49:6:12" data-bid="2-1" class="b"><strong>Ephesians 6:10-12</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>

<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu"> <strong>5. </strong>Why should we always tell the truth?</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>Since the truths from God’s Word are important to us, we obey what the Bible says and we always tell the truth. Lies are one of Satan’s most successful weapons. Lies hurt the person who tells them and the person who believes them. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:8:44-43:8:44" data-bid="8-1" class="b">John 8:44</a>) So even though we are not perfect, we try our best never to lie. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:4:25-49:4:25" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ephesians 4:25</a>) This can be difficult. Abigail, age 18, says: “Speaking the truth may not always seem worth it, especially when telling a lie can get you out of a difficult situation.” So why does she always try to tell the truth? She says: “When I’m truthful, I have a clean conscience before Jehovah. And my parents and my friends know that they can trust me.” Victoria, age 23, says: “When you tell the truth and stand up for your beliefs, you might get bullied. But you always get outstanding benefits: You gain confidence, you feel closer to Jehovah, and you earn the respect of those who love you.” Do you see why it is important to wear “the belt of truth” at all times?</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu"><strong>6, 7. </strong>Why is righteousness compared to a breastplate?</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>The breastplate of a Roman soldier was often made of horizontal strips of iron that were bent to fit around his chest. The iron strips were attached to leather straps with metal hooks and buckles. His shoulders were covered in more strips of iron that were also attached to leather. The breastplate limited his movement, and it required him to check regularly that the plates were in place. But that breastplate protected his heart and other organs against the <span id="page23" class="pageNum" data-no="23" data-before-text="23"></span>edge of a sword or the point of an arrow!</p>
<div class="stdPullQuote floatEast"><p id="p51" data-pid="51" class="sc">We are simply not wise enough to protect our own heart</p>
</div>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>Jehovah’s righteous standards, which protect our “heart,” or the person we are inside, can be compared to that breastplate. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:4:23-20:4:23" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Proverbs 4:23</a>) A soldier would never exchange his iron breastplate for one made of a weaker metal. In the same way, we would never exchange Jehovah’s standards of what is right for our own ideas of what is right. We are simply not wise enough to protect our own heart. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:3:5-20:3:6" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Proverbs 3:5, 6</a>) That is why we must regularly check that our “breastplate” is still protecting our heart.</p>
<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu"> <strong>8. </strong>Why should we obey Jehovah’s standards?</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>Do you sometimes feel that Jehovah’s standards take away your freedom or prevent you from doing things you want to do? Daniel, age 21, says: “Teachers and fellow students made fun of me because I live by Bible standards. For a while, I lost my confidence and felt depressed.” But how does he feel now? He says: “Eventually, I saw the benefits of living by Jehovah’s standards. Some of my ‘friends’ began taking drugs; others dropped out of school. It was sad to see how their lives turned out. Jehovah really protects us.” Madison, age 15, says: “It’s a struggle for me to stick to Jehovah’s standards and not go along with what my peers think is cool or fun.” So, what does she do? “I remind myself that I bear Jehovah’s name and that temptation is just Satan’s way of shooting at me. When I win a struggle, I feel better about myself.”</p>

<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>While the shoes that Roman soldiers wore helped them to succeed in <strong>war, </strong>the symbolic shoes we wear help us “to declare the good news of <strong>peace.” </strong>(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:52:7-23:52:7" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Isaiah 52:7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:10:15-45:10:15" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> Romans 10:15</a>) Still, sometimes it takes a lot of courage to preach. Bo, age 20, says: “I was afraid to witness to my classmates. I think I was embarrassed. Looking back, I don’t know why I should have been. Now I’m happy to witness to my peers.”</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>Many young Christians have found that they feel more comfortable when they preach if they have prepared <span id="page24" class="pageNum" data-no="24" data-before-text="24"></span>ahead of time. What can you do to prepare? Julia, age 16, says: “I keep literature in my schoolbag, and I listen to the opinions and beliefs expressed by my classmates. Then I’m able to think of what will help them. When I am prepared, I can talk to them about what will specifically benefit them.” Makenzie, age 23, says: “If you are kind and are a good listener, you’ll get an idea of what your peers are dealing with. I make sure that I’ve read all the material published for young people. That way I can direct my peers to something in the Bible or on jw.org that will help them.” Being well-prepared to preach is like wearing “shoes” that fit you well.</p>

Perhaps he attacks you with lies about Jehovah. Satan wants you to feel that Jehovah does not love you and that no one cares about you. Ida, age 19, says: “I have often felt that Jehovah isn’t close to me and that he doesn’t want to be my Friend.” What does she do when she feels this way? “The meetings are a giant boost to my faith. I used to sit there and never comment, thinking that nobody would want to hear what I had to say. Now, though, I prepare for the meetings and try to answer two or three times. It’s difficult, but I feel much better when I do. And the brothers and sisters are so encouraging. I always come away from the meetings knowing that Jehovah loves me.”</p>

Sometimes the helmet had a handle so that a soldier could carry it in his hand.</p>
<p id="p28" data-pid="28" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><strong><sup>16 </sup></strong>Just as a helmet protects a soldier’s brain, our “hope of salvation” protects our thinking.

Satan knew that Jesus would become the ruler of mankind. But first, Jesus would have to suffer and die. And then he would have to wait to become King until it was Jehovah’s time. So Satan offered him the chance to rule sooner. Satan promised that if Jesus would do just one act of worship, he could become the ruler of the world immediately. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:4:5-42:4:7" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Luke 4:5-7</a>) Satan also knows that Jehovah has promised to give us wonderful things in the new world. But we have to wait for this promise to become a reality, and in the meantime we may have many problems. So Satan offers us a chance to have a comfortable life now. He wants us to put our own comfort first and God’s Kingdom second.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:31-40:6:33" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Matthew 6:31-33</a>.</p>

<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[32]" class="sb">ROBERT got baptized when he was a teenager, but the truth was not the most important thing in his life. He says: “I never did anything wrong, but I was just going through the motions. I looked spiritually strong, being at all the meetings and serving as an auxiliary pioneer a few times a year. But something was missing.”</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[32]" class="sb"><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>Robert did not understand what was missing until after he got married. As a game, he and his wife sometimes asked each other Bible questions. His wife knew the Bible well and could answer the questions easily. But Robert often did not know the answers and felt embarrassed. He says: “It was as if I knew nothing. I thought to myself, ‘If I am going to be my wife’s spiritual head, I have to do something.’” So he did. He says: “I studied the Bible and studied and studied some more, and the pieces started to fit together. I got understanding and, most important, developed a close relationship with Jehovah.”</p>

We may have some Bible knowledge and be regular at meetings and in the ministry, but this does not make us spiritually-minded. Or we may have already worked to become more spiritually-minded, but when we examine ourselves, we see ways that we can improve. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:3:16-50:3:16" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Philippians 3:16</a>) In this article, we will answer three important questions: (1) What will help us to know if we are spiritually-minded?

<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>When we began to serve God, we made changes that affected every part of our life. This process did not end when we got baptized. The Bible tells us: <strong><em>“</em>Continue </strong>to be made new in your dominant mental attitude.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:4:23-49:4:24" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ephesians 4:23, 24</a>) Because we are not perfect, we need to keep making changes.

<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>Whether we are young or old, we need to examine ourselves honestly. We can ask ourselves: ‘Do I notice that I am becoming more spiritually-minded? Am I becoming more like Christ? What do my attitude and the way I behave at meetings reveal? What do my conversations show about what I really want in life? What do my study habits, dress and grooming, and the way I react to counsel reveal about me? How do I react when I am tempted to do something wrong? Have I become a mature Christian?’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:4:13-49:4:13" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ephesians 4:13</a>) These questions can help us to find out how much we have grown spiritually.</p>
<p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="qu"> <strong>6. </strong>What else can help us know if we are spiritually-minded?</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>Sometimes we need others to help us find out if we are spiritually-minded. The apostle Paul explained that a physical, or fleshly, person does not understand that his way of life does not make God happy. But a spiritually-minded person understands how God sees matters. He knows that Jehovah does not approve of a fleshly way of life. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:2:14-46:2:16" data-bid="6-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 2:14-16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:3:1-46:3:3" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 3:1-3</a>) Elders who have the mind of Christ quickly notice <span id="page24" class="pageNum" data-no="24" data-before-text="24"></span>when brothers start to behave in a fleshly way, and they try to help them. If the elders try to help us, will we accept their help and make necessary changes? If we do, we will show that we really want to become spiritually stronger.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:7:5-21:7:5" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 7:5,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:7:9-21:7:9" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 9</a>.</p>

<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>Bible knowledge is not enough to make us spiritually-minded. King Solomon knew much about Jehovah, and some of Solomon’s wise words even became part of the Bible. But later on, his relationship with Jehovah became weak, and he did not stay faithful. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:4:29-11:4:30" data-bid="8-1" class="b">1 Kings 4:29, 30;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:11:4-11:11:6" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 11:4-6</a>) So, what do we need in addition to Bible knowledge? We need to continue to strengthen our faith. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:2:6-51:2:7" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Colossians 2:6, 7</a>) How do we do this?</p>
<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu"><strong>8, 9. </strong>(a) What will help us to strengthen our faith? (b) What is our goal when we study and meditate? (See opening picture.)</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>In the first century, Paul encouraged Christians to “press on to maturity.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:6:1-58:6:1" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Hebrews 6:1</a>) How can we apply this counsel today? One important way is to study the book <em>How to Remain in God’s Love</em><em>. </em>This will help you understand how to use Bible principles in your life. If you have already studied that book, there are other publications that you can study to help you make your faith strong. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:1:23-51:1:23" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Colossians 1:23</a>) We also need to meditate on what we learn and ask Jehovah to help us see how to apply it.</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>When we study and meditate, our goal should be to develop a deep desire to please and obey Jehovah.

<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>If you are a young person, do you have spiritual goals? One brother <span id="page25" class="pageNum" data-no="25" data-before-text="25"></span>who serves at Bethel often speaks with young people who are about to get baptized at circuit assemblies and asks them about their spiritual goals. He can see that many have thought carefully about how they want to serve Jehovah in the future. Some plan to serve Jehovah full-time or to move to a place where more publishers are needed. But some young ones do not know how to answer his question. Could that mean that they feel they do not need to have spiritual goals? If you are a young person, ask yourself: ‘Do I go to meetings and in the field ministry just because my parents want me to? Or do I have my own friendship with God?’ Of course, we should all have spiritual goals, whether we are young or old. These goals will help us to become spiritually stronger.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:12:1-21:12:1" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 12:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:12:13-21:12:13" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> 13</a>.</p>

<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>After we see where we can improve, we need to start making changes.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:8:6-45:8:8" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Romans 8:6-8</a>) Jehovah does not expect us to be perfect, and he gives us his holy spirit to help us. But we still need to work hard ourselves.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:32:26-1:32:28" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Genesis 32:26-28</a>) Although Bible study can be enjoyable, we should not expect the Bible to be entertaining as a novel might be.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:15:5-45:15:5" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Romans 15:5</a>) Holy spirit can help us get rid of wrong desires and develop qualities that please God.

He did not always think like Christ. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:16:22-40:16:23" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Matthew 16:22, 23;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:22:34-42:22:34" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> Luke 22:34,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:22:54-42:22:62" data-bid="21-3" class="b"> 54-62;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:2:11-48:2:14" data-bid="21-4" class="b"> Galatians 2:11-14</a>) But he did not give up, and Jehovah helped him.

Our decisions will show that we are trying to imitate Christ. Because we are spiritually-minded, we do not want anything to damage our relationship with Jehovah. When we are tempted to do something wrong, our spirituality will help us resist the temptation. Before we make a decision, we will stop and ask ourselves: ‘What Bible principles can help me? What would Christ do in this situation? What will please Jehovah?’ We need to make it a habit to think this way. So let us discuss some possible situations. For each one, we will look at a Bible principle that can help us to make a wise decision.</p>
<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu"><strong>15, 16. </strong>How can thinking like Christ help us make a wise decision about (a) choosing a marriage mate? (b) choosing our friends?</p>

<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb">TODAY we are living near the end of the last days. We see more and more wicked people. They “sprout like weeds.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:92:7-19:92:7" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Psalm 92:7</a>) So we are not surprised that many people reject what God says is right. Paul told Christians: “Be young children as to badness,” but “become full-grown in your understanding.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:14:20-46:14:20" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 14:20</a>) How can we do this?</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>We find the answer in our theme text, which says: “Those who seek Jehovah can understand everything.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:28:5-20:28:5" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Proverbs 28:5</a>) This means they can understand everything that is necessary in order to please Jehovah. <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:2:7-20:2:7" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Proverbs 2:7,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:2:9-20:2:9" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 9</a> also teaches us that Jehovah gives wisdom to <span id="page10" class="pageNum" data-no="10" data-before-text="10"></span>those who do what is right. As a result, they can “understand what is righteous and just and fair, the entire course of what is good.”</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>Noah, Daniel, and Job had this godly wisdom.

To “understand everything” that you need in order to please Jehovah, you need to know him well.

<div class="stdPullQuote floatEast"><p id="p50" data-pid="50" class="sc">Noah could have learned about God’s qualities by paying attention to creation</p>
</div>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup>How did Noah come to know Jehovah? </strong>From the time that Adam and Eve started to have children, people have learned about Jehovah in three ways: through his creation, from other faithful servants of God, and from experiencing the benefits of obeying him. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:48:18-23:48:18" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Isaiah 48:18</a>) By paying attention to creation, Noah could have seen proof that God exists and could also have learned about God’s qualities. As a result, Noah would have understood that Jehovah is powerful and that he is the only true God. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:1:20-45:1:20" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Romans 1:20</a>) Thus, Noah did not just believe in God, but he also developed strong faith in him.</p>
<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu"> <strong>5. </strong>How did Noah learn about what God wanted for mankind?</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>The Bible says that “faith follows the thing heard,” which means that what we hear from others can help us to have faith. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:10:17-45:10:17" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Romans 10:17</a>) Noah probably heard about Jehovah from his relatives. His father, Lamech, had faith in God and was born before Adam died. (See opening picture.) His grandfather was Methuselah, and his great-great-grandfather was Jared, who died 366 years after Noah was born.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> (See footnote.) (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:3:36-42:3:37" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Luke 3:36, 37</a>) Perhaps those men and their wives taught Noah that Jehovah created humans and that He wanted them to have children, fill the earth, and serve Him. Noah would also have learned that Adam and Eve had disobeyed Jehovah, and he could see the bad results of their decision. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:28-1:1:28" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Genesis 1:28;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:3:16-1:3:19" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 3:16-19,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:3:24-1:3:24" data-bid="11-3" class="b"> 24</a>) Noah loved what he learned, and it motivated him to serve Jehovah.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:6:9-1:6:9" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Genesis 6:9</a>.</p>
<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu"><strong>6, 7. </strong>How did hope strengthen Noah’s faith?</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>Hope strengthens faith. Imagine how Noah’s faith was strengthened <span id="page11" class="pageNum" data-no="11" data-before-text="11"></span>when he learned that his name, which means “Rest” or “Consolation,” included the idea of hope. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:5:29-1:5:29" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Genesis 5:29</a>, footnote) Jehovah inspired Lamech to say about his son Noah: “This one will bring us comfort from our labor and from the painful toil of our hands because of the ground that Jehovah has cursed.” So Noah had hope that God would make things better. Like Abel and Enoch, he had faith that an “offspring” would bruise the serpent’s head.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:3:15-1:3:15" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Genesis 3:15</a>.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>Noah did not fully understand God’s promise recorded at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:3:15-1:3:15" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Genesis 3:15</a>. But he understood that this prophecy gave hope for the future. Enoch had preached a similar message, saying that Jehovah would destroy the wicked. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/65:1:14-65:1:15" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Jude 14, 15</a>) Certainly, Enoch’s message, which will fully come true at Armageddon, must have strengthened Noah’s faith and hope!</p>

<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu"> <strong>8. </strong>How did knowing God well protect Noah?</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><strong><sup>8 </sup>How did accurate knowledge of God help Noah? </strong>Because Noah learned about Jehovah, he developed faith and godly wisdom. This protected him, especially from doing anything that would make Jehovah sad. How so? Noah wanted to be God’s friend, so he was not friends with those who did not have faith in Jehovah and who rejected him. Unlike them, Noah was not fooled by the demons who had come to the earth. People were impressed by the powerful demons and might have even tried to worship them. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:6:1-1:6:4" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Genesis 6:1-4,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:6:9-1:6:9" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> 9</a>) Also, Noah knew that Jehovah wanted <strong>humans </strong>to have children and fill the earth. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:27-1:1:28" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Genesis 1:27, 28</a>) So when the demons took wives and had children with them, Noah knew that this was wrong. It became even clearer when those children grew bigger and stronger than all other children. Eventually, Jehovah told Noah that he would bring a flood to destroy all the wicked people. Because Noah had faith in Jehovah’s warning, he built the ark, and he and his family were saved.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:11:7-58:11:7" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Hebrews 11:7</a>.</p>
<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu"><strong>9, 10. </strong>How can we develop faith like Noah’s?</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><strong><sup>9 </sup>How can we develop faith like Noah’s? </strong>It is important to study God’s Word carefully, to love what we learn, and to use it to make changes and good choices in our life. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:1:13-60:1:15" data-bid="20-1" class="b">1 Peter 1:13-15</a>) Then faith and godly wisdom will protect us from Satan’s tricks and from this world’s influence. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:2:11-47:2:11" data-bid="21-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 2:11</a>) Many people in the world love violence and immorality and <span id="page12" class="pageNum" data-no="12" data-before-text="12"></span>follow their wrong desires. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:2:15-62:2:16" data-bid="22-1" class="b">1 John 2:15, 16</a>) They ignore the fact that we are close to the end of this wicked world. If we do not have strong faith, we could start to think this way too. Do not forget that when Jesus compared our time with Noah’s, he did not talk about violence or immorality but about the danger of getting distracted from serving God.​—<strong>Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:36-40:24:39" data-bid="23-1" class="b"><strong>Matthew 24:36-39</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>

<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><strong><sup>11 </sup>How did Daniel come to know Jehovah? </strong>Daniel’s parents must have taught him to love Jehovah and his Word.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:9:1-27:9:2" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Daniel 9:1, 2</a>) Daniel knew Jehovah very well. He also knew all that Jehovah had done for the Israelites.

<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><strong><sup>12 </sup>How did knowing God well help Daniel? </strong>It was not easy for a faithful Jew to serve God in pagan Babylon. For example, Jehovah told the Jews: “Seek the peace of the city to which I have exiled you.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:29:7-24:29:7" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Jeremiah 29:7</a>) Yet, he had also commanded them to worship only him with their whole heart. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:34:14-2:34:14" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Exodus 34:14</a>) How could Daniel obey both commands? Godly wisdom helped Daniel to know that he had to obey Jehovah first, then human rulers. Hundreds of years later, Jesus taught the same principle.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:20:25-42:20:25" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Luke 20:25</a>.</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>Think about what Daniel did when a law said that nobody could pray to any god or person except the king for 30 days. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:6:7-27:6:10" data-bid="29-1" class="b"><strong>Daniel 6:7-10</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>He could have made excuses and said, ‘It is only for 30 days.’ Instead, Daniel refused to let a human law become more important than his worship to God. Daniel could have prayed to Jehovah in a private place. But he knew that many people saw him pray every day. So even though it was dangerous, Daniel continued to pray where people could see him, because he did not want people to think that he had stopped serving Jehovah.</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>Jehovah blessed Daniel’s courageous and loyal decision.

<p id="p28" data-pid="28" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><strong><sup>18 </sup>How did knowing God well help Job? </strong>Job understood godly principles very well. He truly knew Jehovah, and this motivated him to act in the right way. For example, Job knew that he could not say that he loved God if he was unkind to others. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:6:14-18:6:14" data-bid="39-1" class="b">Job 6:14</a>) He did not think that he was better than others, but rather, he treated them as if they were his family, whether they were rich or poor. Job said: “Did not the One who made me in the womb also make them?” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:31:13-18:31:22" data-bid="40-1" class="b">Job 31:13-22</a>) Even when Job was rich and powerful, he did not become proud and did not view others as less important than he was. That is very different from the way many people who are rich and powerful act today.</p>
<p id="p29" data-pid="29" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><strong><sup>19 </sup></strong>Job did not want anything, including material things, to become more important to him than Jehovah.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:31:1-18:31:1" data-bid="42-1" class="b">Job 31:1</a>) That is very impressive, because Job lived during a time when Jehovah allowed men to have more than one wife.
